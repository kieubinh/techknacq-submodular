1. A Novel Personalized Citation Recommendation Approach Based on GAN

	Input: global citation recommendation using rich information including title, author, title, abstract, ect.
	Output: a comprehensive view of relevant references.
	We formally define personalized citation recommendation task in this paper as follows: Given a bibliography dataset P and Q of the set of queries that contain titles and authors information. For every query, which consists of keywords, title or other information, we aim to recommend a high-quality list of references that have better correlation with the query. We first construct a bibliographic citation network, which is represented as G 1⁄4 ð V; E; M; C Þ and G is a directed graph, where V is the paper nodes set, E is a set of edges representing the citation relation between the nodes. M is the adjacency matrix of graph G representing the network structure, C represents the node features information matrix, which C i 2 C indicates the content features of the node v i such as titles or authors information.  Given a network G, our network embedding model aims to learn a low-dimensional vector X i 2 R d with the format as follows: f: ð M; C Þ ! X, where X i T is the i-th row of the matrix X 2 R NXd . N is the number of nodes and d is the dimension of embedding. X is the representation matrix that encodes the structure and features information of the citation network. We construct the generative adversarial network embedding model to obtain the graph embedding matrix that it is our hard core. Then, we recommend a small subset of target p 2 P for a query manuscript q 2 Q by ranking the papers via the similarity score list s ð q; p Þ.
