Dear prof. Massimo,

  I will explain more about my question. I divide a part of the research process (from reading literature review to writing publication) into 3 steps:
  - Step 1: What are the related documents from an idea? from keywords -> searching related documents. We have a 'raw' list of related documents. 
  - Step 2: What should we read the necessary documents for our research? -> recommending reading list. Actually, this step advances the previous step with a better reading list for researchers. The candidate lists are here. They could be varied, a structured reading list (Gorgon 2017).
  - Step 3: What should we cite the necessary documents for publishing a paper? -> recommending reference list. I'm focusing on this part. I assume that a recommended reference list is a part of the recommended reading list from step 2. We use a submodular function for this step, the input is a recommended reading list and the output which is also our recommended reading list is a subset of this input. Therefore, with each input, we have a corresponding output. For example, if a candidate list is top 500 related documents with a query (title of paper), the list covers about 55% ground truth reference list (recall=55%). If a candidate list is top 5000 related documents, the list covers about 90% ground truth reference list. The result with budget = 100 for 500-candidates is
