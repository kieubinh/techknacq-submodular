        "One of the key tasks for analyzing conversational data is segmenting it into coherent topic segments.",
        "However, most models of topic segmentation ignore the social aspect of conversations, focusing only on the words used.",
        "We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian nonpara-metric model, Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), that discovers (1) the topics used in a conversation, (2) how these topics are shared across conversations, (3) when these topics shift, and (4) a person-specific tendency to introduce new topics.",
        "We evaluate against current unsupervised segmentation models to show that including person-specific information improves segmentation performance on meeting corpora and on political debates.",
        "Moreover, we provide evidence that SITS captures an individual's tendency to introduce new topics in political contexts, via analysis of the 2008 US presidential debates and the television program Crossfire.",
        "1 Topic Segmentation as a Social Process Conversation, interactive discussion between two or more people, is one of the most essential and common forms of communication.",
        "Whether in an informal situation or in more formal settings such as a political debate or business meeting, a conversation is often not about just one thing: topics evolve and are replaced as the conversation unfolds.",
        "Discovering this hidden structure in conversations is a key problem for conversational assistants (Tur et al., 2010) and tools that summarize (Murray et al., 2005) and display (Ehlen et al., 2007) conversational data.",
        "Topic segmentation also can illuminate individuals?",
        "agendas (Boydstun et al., 2011), patterns of agreement and disagreement (Hawes et al., 2009; Abbott et al., 2011), and relationships among conversational participants (Ireland et al., 2011).",
        "One of the most natural ways to capture conversational structure is topic segmentation (Reynar, 1998; Purver, 2011).",
        "Topic segmentation approaches range from simple heuristic methods based on lexical similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Hearst, 1997) to more intricate generative models and supervised methods (Georgescul et al., 2006; Purver et al., 2006; Gruber et al., 2007; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), which have been shown to outperform the established heuristics.",
        "However, previous computational work on conversational structure, particularly in topic discovery and topic segmentation, focuses primarily on content, ignoring the speakers.",
        "We argue that, because conversation is a social process, we can understand conversational phenomena better by explicitly model-ing behaviors of conversational participants.",
        "In Section 2, we incorporate participant identity in a new model we call Speaker Identity for Topic Segmentation (SITS), which discovers topical structure in conversation while jointly incorporating a participant-level social component.",
        "Specifically, we explicitly model an individual's tendency to introduce a topic.",
        "After outlining inference in Section 3 and introducing data in Section 4, we use SITS to improve state-of-the-art-topic segmentation and topic identification models in Section 5.",
        "In addition, in Section 6, we also show that the per-speaker model is able to discover individuals who shape and influence the course of a conversation.",
        "Finally, we discuss related work and conclude the paper in Section 7."

        "This insight has been used to tune supervised methods (Hsueh et al., 2006) and inspire unsupervised models of lexical cohesion using bags of words (Purver et al., 2006) and language models (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008).",
        "We too take the unsupervised statistical approach.",

        "Topic models typically do not model the temporal dynamics of individual documents, and those that do (Wang et al., 2008; Gerrish and Blei, 2010) are designed for larger documents and are not applicable here because they assume that most topics appear in every time slice.",
        "Instead, we endow each turn with a binary latent variable lc,t, called the topic shift.",
