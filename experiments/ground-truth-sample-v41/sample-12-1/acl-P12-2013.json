        "We describe an unsupervised approach to the problem of automatically detecting subgroups of people holding similar opinions in a discussion thread.",
        "An intuitive way of identifying this is to detect the attitudes of discussants towards each other or named entities or topics mentioned in the discussion.",
        "Sentiment tags play an important role in this detection, but we also note another dimension to the detection of people's attitudes in a discussion: if two persons share the same opinion, they tend to use similar language content.",
        "We consider the latter to be an implicit attitude.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the impact of implicit and explicit attitude in two genres of social media discussion data, more formal wikipedia discussions and a debate discussion forum that is much more informal.",
        "Experimental results strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an important complement for explicit attitudes (expressed via sentiment) and it can improve the subgroup detection performance independent of genre."

        "There has been a significant increase in discussion forum data in online media recently.",
        "Most of such discussion threads have a clear debate component in them with varying levels of formality.",
        "Automatically identifying the groups of discussants with similar attitudes, or subgroup detection, is an interesting problem which allows for a better understanding of the data in this genre in a manner that could directly benefit Opinion Mining research as well as Community Mining from Social Networks.",
        "A straightforward approach to this problem is to apply Opinion Mining techniques, and extract each discussant's attitudes towards other discussants and entities being discussed.",
        "But the challenge is that Opinion Mining is not mature enough to extract all the correct opinions of discussants.",
        "In addition, without domain knowledge, using unsupervised techniques to do this is quite challenging.",
        "On observing interactions from these threads, we believe that there is another dimension of attitude which is expressed implicitly.",
        "We find that people sharing the same opinion tend to speak about the same topics even though they do not explicitly express their sentiment.",
        "We refer to this as Implicit Attitude.",
        "One such example may be seen in the two posts in Table 1.",
        "It can be seen that even though discussants A and B do not express explicit sentiments, they hold similar views.",
        "Hence it can be said that there is an agreement in their implicit attitudes.",
        "Attempting to find a surface level word similarity between posts of two discussants is not sufficient as there are typically few overlapping words shared among the posts.",
        "This is quite significant a problem especially given the relative short context of posts.",
        "Accordingly, in this work, we attempt to model the implicit latent similarity between posts as a means of identifying the implicit attitudes among discussants.",
        "We apply variants on Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) based topic models to the problem (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Our goal is identify subgroups with respect to discussants?",
        "attitudes towards each other, the entities and topics in a discussion forum.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using text similarity as an indication of user attitudes.",
        "We investigate the influence of the explicit and implicit attitudes on two genres of data, one more formal than the other.",
        "We find an interesting trend.",
        "Explicit attitude alone",
        "as a feature is more useful than implicit attitude in identifying subgroups in informal data.",
        "But in the case of formal data, implicit attitude yields better results.",
        "This may be due to the fact that in informal data, strong subjective opinions about entities/events or towards other discussants are expressed more explicitly.",
        "This is generally not the case in the formal genre where ideas do not have as much sentiment associated with them, and hence the opinions are more ?implicit?.",
        "Finally, we observe that combining both kinds of features improves performance of our systems for both genres."
