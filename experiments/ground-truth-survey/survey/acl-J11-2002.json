        "For our purposes, we assume that we have a way of identifying the text words of a language, ignoring the fact that the term word has eluded exhaustive cross-linguistic definition.",
        "Similarly, we assume a number of commonly made distinctions in linguistic morphology, whose basic import is indisputable, but where there is an ongoing discussion on exactly where to draw the boundaries with respect to particular phenomena in individual languages.",
        "Generally, a distinction is made between inflectional morphology and word formation.",
        "Inflectional morphology deals with the various realizations of the \"same\" lexical word, depending on the particular syntactic context in which the word appears.",
        "Typical examples of inflection are verbs agreeing with one or more of their arguments in the clause, or nouns inflected in particular case forms in order to show their syntactic relation to other words in the phrase or clause, for example, showing which verb argument they express.",

        "If the same kinds of mechanisms are used as in inflectional morphology (i.e., the resulting word is derived out of only one existing word), linguists talk about derivational morphology.",
        "If two or more existing lexical words are combined in order to make up a new word, the terms compounding or incorporation are used, depending on the categories of the words involved.",
        "There is a fairly wide array of formal means available cross-linguistically for expressing inflectional and derivational categories in languages.",
        "Most commonly, however, some form of affixation is involved – that is, some phonological material is added to the end of the word (suffixation), to the beginning of the word (prefixation), or (much more rarely) inside the stem of the word (infixation).",
        "Suffixes and prefixes (but rarely infixes) can form long chains, where the different positions, or \"slots,\" express different kinds of inflectional or derivational categories.",
        "If a language has suffixing and/or prefixing – sometimes called concatenative morphology – it obviously follows that text words in that language can be segmented into a sequence of morphological elements: a stem and a number of suffixes after the stem and/or prefixes before the stem.",
        "Morphology is one of the oldest linguistic subdisciplines, and this brief presentation by necessity omits many intricacies and greatly simplifies a vast scholarship.",
        "(For standard, in-depth, introductions to this fascinating field, see, e.g., Nida [1949], Jensen [1990], Spencer and Zwicky [1998], or Haspelmath [2002].)",
        "In language technology applications, a morphological component forms a bridge between texts and structured information about the vocabulary of a language.",
        "Some kind of morphological analysis and/or generation thus forms a basic component in many natural language processing applications.",
        "Many languages have quite complex morphological systems, with the number of potential inflected forms of a single lexical word running into the thousands, requiring a substantial amount of work if the linguistic knowledge of the morphological component is to be defined manually.",
        "For this reason, researchers often turn to machine learning approaches.",
        "This survey article is concerned with unsupervised approaches to morphology learning.",
        "For the purposes of the present survey, we use the following definition of Unsupervised Learning of Morphology (ULM).",
        "Input: Raw (unannotated, non-selective) natural language text data Output: A description of the morphological structure (there are various levels to be",
        "distinguished; see subsequent discussion) of the language of the input text With: As little supervision (parameters, thresholds, human intervention, model selection during development, etc.)",
        "as possible",
        "Some approaches have explicit or implicit biases towards certain kinds of languages; they are nevertheless considered to be ULM for this survey.",
        "Morphology may be narrowly taken as to include only derivational and inflectional affixation, where the number of affixes a root may take is finite and the order of the affixes may not be",
        "1 The picture is less simple in reality, because affixation is often accompanied by so-called morphophonological changes – changes in the shape of the stem or affix involved, or both – which often have the effect of blurring the boundaries between the elements.",
        "2 With the term non-selective we intend to exclude text data that requires manual selection (e.g., curated singular-plural pairs).",
        "3 The number of inflectional affixes is finite by definition.",
        "The derivational affixes – especially in heavily agglutinating languages – may be recursive, but are in practice finite.",
        "permuted.",
        "This survey also subsumes attempts that take a broader view including clitics and compounding (and there seems to be no reason in principle to exclude incorporation and lexical affixes: see Mithun [1999], pages 37-67, for some examples).",
        "Many, but not all, approaches focus on concatenative morphology/compounding only.",
        "All works considered in this survey are designed to function on orthographic words, that is, raw text data in an orthography that provides a ready-made segmentation of text into words.",
        "Crucially, this excludes the rather large body of work that only targets word segmentation, that is, segmenting a sentence or a full utterance into words (cf. Goldsmith [2010] who also overviews word segmentation).",
        "However, works that explicitly aim to treat both word segmentation and morpheme segmentation in one algorithm are included.",
        "Hence, subsequent uses of the term segmentation in the present survey are to be understood as morpheme segmentation rather than word segmentation.",
        "We prefer the term segmentation to analysis because, in general in ULM, the algorithm does not attempt to label the segments.",
        "There have been other approaches to machine learning of morphology than pure ULM as defined here, the most popular ones being:",
        "• approaches where some (small) amount of annotated data, some (small) amount of existing rule sets, or resources such as a machine-readable dictionary or a parallel corpus, are mandatory (Yarowsky and Wicentowski 2000; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002; Neuvel and Fulop 2002; Johnson and Martin 2003; Rogati, McCarley, and Yang 2003, for example)",
        "Such approaches are excluded from the present survey, unless the required data (e.g., paradigm members) are extracted from raw text in an unsupervised manner as well.",
        "We also exclude the special case of the second approach where morphology learning means not \"learning the morphological system of a language,\" but rather \"learning the inflectional classes of out-of-vocabulary words,\" namely, approaches where an existing morphological analysis component is used as the basis for guessing in which existing paradigm an unknown text word should belong (e.g., Antworth 1990; Mikheev 1997; Bharati et al.",
        "2001; Forsberg, Hammarström, and Ranta 2006; Lindén 2008; Lindén 2009).",

        "It is useful to set up the implicational hierarchy shown in Table 1 (which",
        "4 There are, however, rare cases of languages which allow the permutation of specific pairs of prefixes, such as Kagulu (Petzell 2007), Yimas and Karawari (Foley 1991, pages 31-32) as well as Chintang, Bantawa, and possibly other Kiranti languages where prefix ordering in general is very free (Rai 1984;",
        "Bickel et al.",
        "2007).",
        "5 Clitics are affix-like elements that attach to words in particular syntactic positions, rather than to words of particular categories as proper affixes do.",
        "The English genitive -'s is sometimes classified as a clitic, because you can say things like The girl I met yesterday's purse (the -'s attaches to the end of the noun phrase, regardless of the part of speech of the last word, an adverb in this case).",

        "The division is implicational in the sense that if one can do the morphological analysis of a lower level in the table, one can also easily produce the analysis of any of the levels above it.",
        "Reflecting a fundamental assumption underlying most ULM work, form and meaning (semantics) are kept separate in the table (see Section 2).",
        "For example, if one can perform segmentation into stem and affixes, one can decide if two words are of the same stem (if meaning is disregarded) or the same lexeme (if meaning is taken into account).",

      "text": [
        "Usually and justifiedly, the work of Harris (1955, 1967) is given as the starting point of ULM.",
        "From another perspective, however, the same work by Harris can be said to equally represent the culmination of an endeavor in the linguistic school of thought known as American structuralism, to formalize the process of linguistic description into so-called linguistic discovery procedures.",
        "The variety of American structuralism which concerned itself most with the formalization of linguistic discovery procedures is often connected with the name of Leonard Bloomfield, and its core tenet may be succinctly summed up in Bloomfield's oft-quoted dictum: \"The only useful generalizations about language are inductive generalizations\" (Bloomfield 1933, page 20).",
        "The so-called \"extremist Post-Bloomfieldians\" took this program a step further: \"From Bloomfield's justified insistence on formal, rather than semantic, features as the starting-point for linguistic analysis, this group (especially Harris) set up as a theoretical aim the description of linguistic structure exclusively in terms of distribution\" (Hall 1987, page 156).",
        "The earliest reason for interest in ULM was thus – at least in part – methodological and arguably even ideological, but not (unlike at least some of the later ULM work) motivated by, for example, a desire to simulate language acquisition in humans.",
        "More or less simultaneously with but independently of Harris, the Russian linguist Andreev launched a program much like that of Harris.",
        "Andreev's work is much less known than that of Harris's, and for this reason we will describe it in some detail here.",
        "In a series of publications (Andreev 1959,1963,1965b, 1967), he develops an \"algorithm for statistical-combinatory modeling of languages.\"",
        "This is part of a research program which, just like that of Harris, aims at eliminating semantics and considerations of meaning completely from the process of \"discovery\" of language structure.",
        "Thus, Andreev claims to be able to go from unsegmented transcribed speech all the way up to syntax, using basically one and the same approach grounded in text (corpus) statistics.",
        "Given our focus on ULM, here we will be concerned only with his approach as applied to morphological segmentation.",
        "Andreev's approach is much more explicitly based in text statistics – and to some extent in language typology – than Harris's work.",
        "The algorithm for morphological segmentation is described in some detail in the works of Andreev and his colleagues.",
        "It relies on statistics of letter frequencies in a text corpus, and of average word length in characters and average sentence length in words.",
        "From these statistics he calculates a number of heuristic thresholds which are used to iteratively grow affix candidates from characters at given positions in text words, and paradigm candidates from the resulting segmentations.",
        "Instead of looking at successor/predecessor counts or transition probabilities, Andreev looks at character positions in relation to word edges, from the first and",
        "6 Web site http://www.cis.hut.fi/morphochallenge2009/ accessed 10 September 2009.",
        "7 To our knowledge, Andreev never refers to Harris's work.",
        "the last character inwards no further than the average word length.",
        "At each position, the amount of overrepresentation is calculated for each character found in this position in some word.",
        "The overrepresentation (\"correlative function\" in Andreev's terminology) is defined as the relative frequency of the character in this word position divided by its relative frequency in the corpus.",
        "The character-position combinations are used in order of decreasing overrepresentation in an iterative see-saw procedure, where affix and stem candidates are collected in alternating iterations of the algorithm.",
        "Andreev's approach reflects the same intuition as that of Harris; we would expect word-edge sequences of highly overrepresented characters to be flanked by marked differences in predecessor or successor counts calculated according to Harris's method.",
        "A concrete example of how Andreev's method works (with the finer details omitted) is the following, originally presented by Andreeva (1963), but the presentation here is partly based on that in Andreev (1967).",
        "In a 900,000-word corpus of electronics texts in Russian, the most overrepresented letter was <j> (Russian <h>) in the last position of the word, where it is eight times as frequent as in the corpus as a whole (Andreeva 1963, page 49).",
        "For the words ending in <j>, its most overrepresented predecessor was <o>, and using some thresholds derived from corpus statistics, the first affix candidate found was -oj (Russian -<oii>).Removing this ending from all words in which it appears and matching the remainders of the words (i.e., putative stems) against the other words of the corpus, yields a set of words from which additional suffix candidates emerge (including the null suffix).",
        "This set of words is then iteratively reduced, using the admissible suffix candidates (those below a certain length exceeding a heuristic threshold of overrepresentation) in each step, as long as at least two stem candidates remain.",
        "In other words: There must be at least two stems in the corpus appearing with all the suffix candidates.",
        "In the Russian experiment reported by Andreeva (1963), a complete adjective paradigm was induced, with 12 different suffixes.",
        "The initial suffix candidate, -oj, has a high functional load and consequently a high text frequency: It is the most ambiguous of the Russian adjective suffixes, appearing in four different slots in the adjective paradigm, and is also homonymous with a noun suffix.",
        "In Andreev (1965b) the method is tested extensively on Russian, which is the subject of several papers in the volume, and a number of other languages: Albanian (Persikov 1965), Armenian (Melkumjan 1965), Bulgarian (Fedulova 1965), Czech (Ozigova 1965), English (Malahovskij 1965), Estonian (Hol'm 1965), French (Kordi 1965), German (Fitialova 1965), Hausa (Fihman 1965a), Hungarian (Andreev 1965a), Latvian (Jakubajtis 1965), Serbo-Croatian (Panina 1965), Swahili (Fihman 1965b), Ukrainian (Eliseeva 1965), and Vietnamese (Jakuseva 1965).",
        "As an aside, we may note that only after the turn of the millennium are we again seeing this variety of languages in ULM work.",
        "Most of these studies are small-scale proof-of-concept experiments on corpora of varying sizes (from a few thousand words in many of the studies up to close to one million words for Russian).",
        "The outcomes are more often than not quite small \"paradigmoid fragments,\" that is, incomplete and not always in correspondence with traditional segmentations.",
        "It is noteworthy, however, that the method could not produce a single instance of morphological segmentation for Vietnamese (Jakuseva 1965, page 228), which is as it should be, because Vietnamese is often held forth as a language without morphology.",
        "The papers describing these experiments are short, and it is not always clear exactly what has been done.",
        "In fact, computers are not mentioned at all in most of the papers; on the contrary, it is quite clear that at least some of the experiments have been carried out manually.",
        "In principle, because Andreev and the other authors in Andreev (1965b) describe the procedure in great detail, it should be possible to replicate some of the findings (cf. Altmann and Lehfeldt 1980, pages 195-198).",
        "To our knowledge, there has been one attempt to do this, by Cromm (1997), who reimplemented the method and tested it on the German Bible, experimenting with various parameter settings and also making some changes to the method itself.",
        "He notes that several parameters that Andreev provides mostly without motivation or comment in fact can be changed in a more accepting direction, leading to much increased recall without much loss in precision.",
        "Unfortunately, however, in his short paper, Cromm does not provide enough information about the algorithm or the changes that he made to it, so that the Russian original is still the only publicly available source for the details of Andreev's approach.",
        "A very different, more practically oriented, motivation for ULM came in the 1980s, beginning with the supervised morphology learning ideas by Wothke (1985, 1986) and Klenk (1985a, 1985b) which later led to partly unsupervised methods (see the following).",
        "Because full natural language lexica, at the time, were too big to fit in working memory, these authors were looking for a way to analyze or stem running words in a \"nichtlexikalisches\" manner, that is, without the storage and use of a large lexicon.",
        "This motivation is now obsolete.",
        "The interest in purebred ULM was fairly low until about 1990, however, with only a few works appearing between the mid 1960s and 1990.",
        "Especially in the 1980s, the focus in computational morphology was on the development of finite-state approaches with handwritten rules, but in the course of the following decade, interest in ULM rose greatly, in the wake of a general increased attention during the 1990s to statistical and information-theoretically informed approaches in natural language processing.",
        "In speech processing, the problem of word segmentation is ever-present, and as the computational tools for taking on this problem became increasingly sophisticated and increasingly available not least as the result of a general development of computing hardware and software, researchers in linguistics and computational linguistics started taking a fresh look at the problems of word segmentation and ULM.",
        "The work of Goldsmith (2000, 2001, 2006) represents a kind of focal point here.",
        "He pulls together a number of strands from earlier work, sets them against a theoretical background informed both by information theory (MDL) and linguistics, and uses them specifically to address the problem of ULM – in particular, unsupervised learning of inflectional morphology – and not, for instance, that of word segmentation or of stemming for information retrieval, and so forth.",
        "Further, there has been the idea that ULM could contribute to various open questions in the field of first-language acquisition (see, e.g., Brent, Murthy, and Lundberg 1995; Batchelder 1997; Brent 1999; Clark 2001; Goldwater 2007).",
        "However, the connection is still rather vague and even if ULM has matured, it is not clear what implications, if any, this has for child language acquisition.",
        "Children have access to semantics and pragmatics, not just text strings, and it would be very surprising if such cues were not used at all in first language acquisition.",
        "Further, if some ULM technique was shown to be successful on some reasonably sized corpora, it does not automatically follow that children can (and do, if they can) use the same technique.",
        "Most current ULM techniques crucially involve long series of number crunching that seem implausible for the child-learning setting.",
        "After the turn of the century, ULM has become something of a growth industry in language technology.",
        "There are several reasons for this.",
        "One obvious reason is a generally increased interest in machine learning, both theoretically (as a research area interesting in itself and as a possible tool for modeling human language acquisition and language learning) and for pragmatic reasons, as a way to reduce the manual work involved in the construction of the lexical and grammatical knowledge bases needed for the realization of sophisticated language technology applications.",
        "Another reason has to do with the acceptance of the world as multilingual and the understanding that language communities are very unequally endowed with language technology resources.",
        "There are on the order of 7,000 languages spoken in the world today (Lewis 2009).",
        "Their size in number of first-language speakers is very unevenly distributed.",
        "The top 30 languages in the world account for more than 60% of its population.",
        "At the other end of the scale, we find that most languages are spoken by quite small communities:",
        "There are close to 7,000 languages in the world, and half of them have fewer than 7,000 speakers each, less than a village.",
        "What is more, 80% of the world's languages have fewer than 100,000 speakers, the size of a small town.",
        "(Ostler 2008, page 2)",
        "On the whole, small language communities will tend to have correspondingly small financial and other resources that could be spent on the development of language technology, but the cost of, for example, constructing a lexicon or a parser for a language is more or less constant, and not proportional to the number of speakers of the language.",
        "At the same time, it has been observed over and over again that the use or non-use of a language in a particular situation – where the language could in principle be used, but where there is a choice available between two or more languages – is intimately connected with the attitudes towards the language among the participants.",
        "This is perhaps the most reliable determiner of language use, and not factors such as effort, lack of vocabulary, and so on, which in many cases seem to be post hoc rationalizations motivating a choice made on attitudinal grounds.",
        "Another way of expressing this is that languages are more or less prestigious in the eyes of their speakers, and that linguistic inferiority complexes seem to be common in the world.",
        "However, rather than taking status as an inherent and immutable characteristic of a language, we should see it for what it is, namely, a perceived characteristic, something that lies in the eye of the beholder.",
        "As such, it can be influenced by human action.",
        "Important for our purposes here is that it has been suggested that making available modern information and communication technologies for a language, including the creation of linguistic resources and language technology for it, may serve to raise its status (see, e.g., the papers in Saxena and Borin 2006).",
        "This, then, is another reason for pursuing ULM: to be able to provide language technology to language communities lacking the requisite resources.",
        "However, ULM, at least as understood for the purposes of this survey, requires a written language, which would still exclude a substantial majority of the world's languages (Borin 2009).",
        "Note that the remainder – languages with a tradition of writing – are not on the whole small language communities; in the first instance, we are talking about the few hundred most spoken languages in the world, for example, the 313 languages with at least one million native speakers (accounting for about 80% of the world's population) surveyed by the Linguistic Data Consortium some years back in their Low-density language survey (Strassel, Maxwell, and Cieri 2003; Borin 2009).",
        "8 Another pragmatic, less savory reason is a general downplaying of linguistic knowledge in the language technology research community (Reiter 2007).",
        "The hope is often expressed in the literature that ULM and other unsupervised methods could be employed in order to rapidly and cheaply (in terms of human effort) bootstrap basic language technology resources for new languages.",
        "It should be noted that, even for larger languages, because of the human effort needed to build computational morphological resources, many such implementations are not released to the public domain.",
        "Also, open domain texts will always contain a fair share of (inflected) previously unknown words that are not in the lexicon.",
        "There has to be strategy for such out-of-dictionary words – a ULM-solving algorithm is one possibility.",
        "The ULM problem as specified, therefore, still has a role to play for larger languages.",
        "Finally, and closely related to the preceding reason, ULM and other kinds of machine learning of linguistic information are increasingly seen as providing potential tools in language documentation.",
        "It has been realized for some time that languages are disappearing at a rapid rate in the modern world (Krauss 1992, 2007).",
        "Many linguists see this loss of linguistic diversity as a disaster in the cultural and intellectual sphere on a par with the loss of the world's biodiversity in the ecological sphere, only on a grander scale; languages are going extinct more rapidly than species.",
        "Enter language documentation (Gippert, Himmelmann, and Mosel 2006), which is construed as going well beyond traditional descriptive linguistic fieldwork, aspiring as it does to capture all aspects – linguistic, cultural, and social – of a language community's day-to-day life, in video and audio recordings of a wide range of sociocultural activities, in still images, and in representative artifacts.",
        "Basic linguistic descriptions of lexicon and grammar made on the basis of transcribed recordings still form an important component of language documentation, however, and with the realization that languages are disappearing at a far faster rate than linguists can document them, it is natural to look for ways of making this process less labor-intensive.",
        "In summary, we have seen the following motivations for ULM (in chronological order):",
        "• Linguistic theory",
        "• Elimination of the lexicon",
        "• Child language acquisition",
        "• Morphological engine bootstrapping",
        "• Language description and documentation bootstrapping",
        "As noted, the motivation of eliminating the lexicon is now obsolete, whereas the others are active to various degrees.",
        "By far the most popular motivation has been, and still is, that of inducing a morphological analyzer/segmentation from raw text data (with little human intervention) in a well-described language.",
        "However, as we have argued herein, the timing is right for the momentum to carry over also to under-described languages.",
        "9 To our knowledge, Eguchi (1987, page 168) is the first author to suggest ULM as one of several",
        "computational aids to the language documentation fieldworker.",
        "10 For example, in the instructions for the recent large-scale language documentation effort BOLD:PNG – Basic Oral Language Documentation: Papua New Guinea – we read: \"Try not to spend more than an hour transcribing a minute of text.\"",
        "and \"As before, try not to spend more than an hour translating a minute of text.\"",

        "A chronological listing of earlier work (with very short characterizations) is given in Table 2.",
        "Several papers are co-indexed if they represent essentially the same line of work by essentially the same author(s).",
        "Given the number of algorithms proposed, it is impossible to go through the techniques and ideas individually.",
        "However, we will attempt to cover the main trends and look at some key questions in more detail.",
        "The problem has been approached in four fundamentally different ways, which we may summarize in the following way.",
        "(a) Border and Frequency: In this family of methods, if a substring occurs with a variety of substrings immediately adjacent to it, this is interpreted as evidence for a segmentation border.",
        "In addition, frequent or somehow overrepresented substrings are given a direct interpretation as candidates for segmentation.",
        "A typical implementation is to subject the data to a compression formula of some kind, where frequent long substrings with clear borders offer the optimal compression gain.",
        "The outcome of such a compression scheme gives the segmentation.",
        "In addition, for those approaches which also target paradigms, stem-suffix co-occurrence statistics are gathered given the segmentation produced, rather than all possible segmentations.",
        "(b) Group and Abstract: In this family of methods, morphologically related words are first grouped (clustered into sets, paired, shortlisted, etc.)",
        "according to some metric, which is typically string edit distance, but may include semantic features (Schone 2001), distributional similarity (Freitag 2005), or frequency signatures (Wicentowski 2002).",
        "The next step is to abstract some morphological pattern that recurs among the groups.",
        "Such emergent patterns provide enough clues for segmentation and can sometimes be formulated as rules or morphological paradigms.",
        "(c) Features and Classes: In this family of methods, a word is seen as made up of a set of features – n-grams in Mayfield and McNamee (2003) and McNamee and Mayfield (2007), and initial/terminal/mid-substring in De Pauw and Wagacha (2007).",
        "Features which occur on many words have little selective power across the words, whereas features which occur seldom pinpoint a specific word or stem.",
        "To formalize this intuition, Mayfield and McNamee and McNamee and Mayfield use TF-IDF, and De Pauw and Wagacha use entropy.",
        "Classifying an unseen word reduces to using its features to select which word(s) it may be morphologically related to.",
        "This decides whether the unseen word is a morphological variant of some other word, and allows extracting the \"variation\" by which they are related, such as an affix.",
        "(d) Phonological Categories and Separation: In this family of methods, the phonemes (approximated by graphemes) are first classed into categories, foremostly, vowel versus consonant.",
        "Thereafter, each word is separated into its vowel skeleton and its consonant skeleton, after which various",

        "If the purpose is to say something about human language acquisition or language learning, or if the aim is to devise a method that should work with any language, such a bias naturally becomes problematic.",
        "The two human learning analogues which have most frequently been proposed in the literature on ULM and other machine learning of morphology are those of language acquisition and of linguistic analysis (e.g., as carried out as part of linguistic fieldwork).",

        "An analyst approaches a language which either he already knows in some practical way or with which he sets about to familiarize himself – preferably in a language learning situation.",

        "With this knowledge of the language to be analyzed and with this background knowledge, he makes certain guesses about the grammatical structure of the language.",
        "He then submits these guesses to a series of systematic checks in which he confirms, disproves, or modifies his original guesses – and makes a few better guesses en route.",

        "One component of a research program on ULM would then be to formulate this kind of general knowledge in a way which makes sense given that the object of study is language, to test it, and to share it with the community of linguistic scholars.",
        "A concrete illustration could be the way that the old notion of proportional analogy (Anttila 1977) is refined and formalized in various ways and used to test segmentation hypotheses in works on ULM from the earliest times onwards (e.g., the \"squares\" mentioned in Section 3.3)."

        "This bears emphasizing, because ULM work generally has been concerned only with the formal expression side of morphology; that is, instead of the traditional tables 'table NPL' tables table V 3SG' it will give us simply tables tables although it may tell us that the stem table appears in two paradigms.",
        "As far as we know, there have been no attempts to induce functional labels using ULM, although it is conceivable that the same kind of techniques used, for example, in order to cluster words semantically (e.g., Latent Semantic Indexing/Analysis or Random Indexing), could be used also to classify the resulting morphs from a ULM segmentation (cf. Schone and Jurafsky [2001b] for a study of inducing part-of-speech class labels in a setting similar to that of ULM).",
        "The labelling problem can easily be considered independent of ULM by using a hand-segmented (or segmented by a hand-built morphological parser) input corpus.",
        "As we said in Section 2, there is an explicit expectation frequently encountered in the more recent literature that ULM and other unsupervised methods could be employed in order to rapidly and cheaply (in terms of human effort) bootstrap basic language technology resources for new languages.",
        "However, looking at the literature, it seems that – at least in the area of inflectional morphology – the only approaches that have so far produced substantial results are the old-fashioned, hand-coded grammar-based ones, such as the work described by Trosterud (2004), where finite-state morphological processors and constraint grammar-based disambiguation components are developed for a number of related languages.",

        "The following observation is perhaps trivial, but bears stressing, because it is in fact often not heeded in practice: For this kind of approach to work, it is necessary that tools for providing systems with linguistic knowledge use a conceptual apparatus and notation familiar to the linguists who are supposed to be working with them.",
        "Relevant to our purposes here, the same holds for any attempt to kickstart the development of a morphological analyzer by using ULM: If the expectation is that the output of ULM should be manually \"post-edited,\" this output must of course be intelligible to the linguist doing the post-editing.",
        "17 As pointed out by one anonymous reviewer, this suggests that with the right organization of information flow among machine-learning components, ULM, too, could benefit from working with several closely related languages simultaneously.",

        "However, many (most?)",
        "of the strong-looking systems reported in the literature have not, for one reason or another, taken part in the MorphoChallenge.",

        "In the terms of Table 1 in Section 1, the state of the art of ULM is somewhere in the region of \"Segmentation\" and \"Inflection tables,\" if we are talking about linguistic form, but there has been next to no progress at all when it comes to linguistic meaning (e.g., functional labeling of affixes).",
        "In the early days of ULM, the expectation was that it should constitute – when eventually achieved sometime in the future – a formalized version of a linguistic discovery procedure, that is, a knowledge-heavy enterprise.",
        "Instead, recent successes in the area have been largely contingent upon the rapid development in computational linguistics of statistical and information-theoretic knowledge-light (but robust) methodologies.",
        "We believe (like Wintner 2009 for computational linguistics in general), however, that if ULM is to become a serious alternative to – or, equally likely, a natural component of – manually built computational morphology systems for a wide and diverse range of languages, and especially if we are to make headway in the area of semantics, we need to see more interaction between the present approaches to ULM with the computational techniques and mathematical modeling tools they can bring to bear on the problem on the one hand, and typologically informed linguistic research on morphology founded on a vast store of knowledge and methodology refined over two millennia on the other."
