        "The phrase translation model, also known as the phrase table, is one of the core components of a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system.",

        "First, the bilingual phrase pairs are extracted heuristically from an automatically word-aligned training data.",
        "The second phase is parameter estimation, where each phrase pair is assigned with some scores that are estimated based on counting of words or phrases on the same word-aligned training data.",
        "There has been a lot of research on improving the quality of the phrase table using more principled methods for phrase extraction (e.g., Lamber and Banchs 2005), parameter estimation (e.g., Wuebker et al. 2010; He and Deng 2012), or both (e.g., Marcu and Wong 2002; Denero et al. 2006).",
        "The focus of this paper is on the parameter estimation phase.",
        "We revisit the problem of scoring a phrase translation pair by developing a new phrase translation model based on Markov random fields (MRFs) and large-scale discriminative training.",
        "We strive to address the following three primary concerns.",
        "First of all, instead of parameterizing a phrase translation pair using a set of scoring functions that are learned independently (e.g., phrase translation probabilities and lexical weights) we use a general, statistical framework in which arbitrary features extracted from a phrase pair can be incorporated to model the translation in a unified way.",
        "To this end, we propose the use of a MRF model.",
        "Second, because the phrase model has to work with other component models in an SMT system in order to produce good translations and the quality of translation is measured via BLEU score, it is desirable to optimize the parameters of the phrase model jointly with other component models with respect to an objective function that is closely related to the evaluation metric under consideration, i.e., BLEU in this paper.",
        "To this end, we resort to a large-scale discriminative training approach, following the pioneering work of Liang et al. (2006).",
        "Although there are established methods of tuning a handful of features on small training sets, such as the MERT method (Och 2003), the development of discriminative training methods for millions of features on millions of sentence pairs is still an ongoing area of research.",
        "A recent survey is due to Koehn (2010).",
        "In this paper we show that by using stochastic gradient ascent and an N-best list based",
        "expected BLEU as the objective function, large-scale discriminative training can lead to significant improvements.",
        "The third primary concern is the ease of adoption of the proposed method.",
        "To this end, we use a simple and well-established learning method, ensuring that the results can be easily reproduced.",
        "We also develop the features for the MRF model in such a way that the resulting model is of the same format as that of a traditional phrase table.",
        "Thus, the model can be easily incorporated into a standard phrase-based SMT system, requiring no code change in the runtime engine.",

        "In future work we strive to fully realize the potential of the MRF model by developing features that can capture more sophisticated translation dependencies that those used in this study.",
        "We will also explore the use of MRF-based translation models for translation systems that go beyond simple phrases, such as hierarchical phrase based systems (Chiang 2005) and syntax-based systems (Galley et al. 2004)."
