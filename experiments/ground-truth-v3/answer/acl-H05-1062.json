        "Traditional approaches to Information Extraction (IE) from speech input simply consist in applying text based methods to the output of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.",
        "If it gives satisfaction with low Word Error Rate (WER) transcripts, we believe that a tighter integration of the IE and ASR modules can increase the IE performance in more difficult conditions.",
        "More specifically this paper focuses on the robust extraction of Named Entities from speech input where a temporal mismatch between training and test corpora occurs.",
        "We describe a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system, developed within the French Rich Broadcast News Transcription program ESTER, which is specifically optimized to process ASR transcripts and can be integrated into the search process of the ASR modules.",
        "Finally we show how some meta-data information can be collected in order to adapt NER and ASR models to new conditions and how they can be used in a task of Named Entity indexation of spoken archives."

        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial step in many Information Extraction (IE) tasks.",
        "It has been a specific task in several evaluation programs such as the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), the Conferences on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), the DARPA HUB-5 program or more recently the French ESTER Rich Transcription program on Broadcast News data.",
        "Most of these conferences have studied the impact of using transcripts generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system rather than written texts.",
        "It appears from these studies that unlike other IE tasks, NER performance is greatly affected by the Word Error Rate (WER) of the transcripts processed.",
        "To tackle this problem, different ideas have been proposed: modeling explicitly the ASR errors (Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001) or using the ASR system alternate hypotheses found in word lattices (Sar-aclar and Sproat, 2004).",
        "However performance in NER decreases dramatically when processing high WER transcripts like the ones that are obtained with unmatched conditions between the ASR training model and the data to process.",
        "This paper investigates this phenomenon in the framework of the NER task of the French Rich Transcription program of Broadcast News ESTER (Gravier et al., 2004).",
        "Several issues are addressed:",
        "• how to jointly optimize the ASR and the NER models ?",
        "• what is the impact in term of ASR and NER performance of a temporal mismatch between the corpora used to train and test the models and how can it be recovered by means of meta-data information ?",
        "• Can metadata information be used for indexing large spoken archives ?",
        "After a quick overview of related works in IE from speech input, we present the ESTER evaluation program ; then we introduce a NER system tightly integrated to the ASR process and show how it can successfully index high WER spoken databases thanks to metadata."

        "The NIST Topic Detection and Tracking (Fiscus and Doddington, 2002) and TREC document retrieval evaluation programs has studied the impact of recognition errors in the overall performance of Information Extraction systems for tasks like story segmentation or topic detection and retrieval.",
        "This impact has been shown to be very limited compared to clean text corpora.",
        "The main explanation for this phenomenon is the redundancy effect: themes, topics are very likely to be represented in texts by many occurrences of salient words characterizing them.",
        "Therefore, even if some of these words are missing, numerical Information Extraction methods can use the remaining salient words and discard the noise generated by ASR errors.",
        "However, this phenomenon is not true for tasks related to the extraction of fine grained entities, like Named Entities.",
        "Indeed, several studies have shown that F-measure and WER are strongly correlated : 0.7 points of F-measure lost for each additional 1% of WER according to (Miller et al., 2000) on the experiments of 1998 NIST Hub-4 evaluations (Przybocki et al., 1999).",
        "Despite the continuous improvement of ASR techniques, high WER transcriptions are inevitable in difficult conditions like those found in large spoken archives like in the MALACH project (Ramabhadran et al., 2003).",
        "Moreover, Named Entities extraction performance is greatly affected by a mismatch between training and testing data.",
        "This is due mainly because proper names, which represent most of the Named Entity items, are a very dynamic category of words, strongly related to the period of time representing the documents to process.",
        "Therefore this mismatch is inevitable when dealing with archives spreading over a long period of time and containing multiple domain information.",
        "One way of tackling this problem is to gather metadata information related to the documents to process.",
        "This information can be newspaper corpora related to the same period of time, abstract describing the document content, or simply lists of terms or entities likely to occur.",
        "Although such collected data can be used to update the ASR and NER models, the potential gain is rather small unless the metadata corpus gathered fits perfectly the document to process and is of a reasonable size.",
        "But another way of exploiting this metadata information is to use it as set of index terms that are going to be explicitly looked for in the processed documents.",
        "We present in section 7 an implementation of this idea that uses word lattices as input."

        "There are also 2 new radio channels in the test corpus which were not in the training data.",
