        "Intelligent language technologies capable of full semantic interpretation of domain-general text remain an elusive goal.",
        "However, statistical advances have made it possible to address core pieces of the problem.",
        "Recent years have seen a wealth of research on one important component of semantic interpretation – automatic role labelling (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Ha-cioglu et al., 2004, and additional papers from Car-reras and Marquez, 2004).",
        "Such work aims to annotate each constituent in a clause with a semantic tag indicating the role that the constituent plays with respect to the target predicate, as in (1):",
        "(1) [Yuka]Ayc.t [whispered]Pred to [Dar]RCCZPzc.t",
        "Semantic role labelling systems address a crucial first step in the automatic extraction of semantic relations from domain-general text, taking us closer to the goal of comprehensive semantic mark-up.",
        "Most work thus far on domain-general role labelling depends on supervised learning over statistical features extracted from a hand-labelled corpus.",
        "The reliance on such a resource – one in which the arguments of each predicate are manually identified and assigned a semantic role – limits the portability of such methods to other languages or even to other genres of corpora.",
        "In this study, we explore the possibility of using a verb lexicon, rather than a hand-labelled corpus, as the primary resource in the semantic role labelling task.",
        "Perhaps because of the focus on what can be gleaned from labelled data, existing supervised approaches have made little use of the additional knowledge available in the predicate lexicon associated with the labelled corpus.",
        "By contrast, we exploit the explicit knowledge of the role assignment possibilities for each verb within an existing lexicon.",
        "Moreover, we utilize a very simple probability model within a highly efficient algorithm.",
        "We use VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000), a computational lexicon which lists the possible semantic role assignments for each of its verbs.",
        "Our algorithm extracts automatically parsed arguments from a corpus, and assigns to each a list of the compatible roles according to VerbNet.",
        "Arguments which are given only a single role possibility are considered to have been assigned an unambiguous role label.",
        "This set of arguments constitutes our primary-labelled data, which serves as the noisy training data for a simple probability model which is then used to label the remaining (role ambiguous) arguments.",
        "This method has several advantages, the foremost of which is that it eliminates the dependence on a role labelled corpus, a very expensive resource to produce.",
        "Of course, a verb lexicon is also an expensive resource, but one that is highly reusable across a range of NLP tasks.",
        "Moreover, the approach points at some potentially useful information that current",
        "supervised methods have failed to exploit.",
        "Even if one has access to an annotated corpus for training, our work shows that directly calling on additional information from the lexicon itself may prove useful in restricting the possible labels for an argument.",
        "The method has disadvantages as well.",
        "The information available in a predicate lexicon is less directly applicable to building a learning model.",
        "Inevitably, our results are noisier than in a supervised approach which has access to a labelled sample of what it must produce.",
        "Still, the method shows promise: on unseen test data, the system yields an F-measure of .83 on labelling of correctly extracted arguments, compared to an informed baseline of .74, and an F-measure of .65 (compared to .52) on the overall identification and labelling task.",
        "The latter is well below the best supervised performance of about .80 on similar tasks, but it must be emphasized that it is achieved with a simple probability model and without the use of hand-labelled data.",
        "We view this as a starting point by which to demonstrate the utility of deriving more explicit knowledge from a predicate lexicon, which can be later extended through the use of additional probabilistic features.",
        "We face a methodological challenge arising from the particular choice of VerbNet for the prototyping of our method: the lexicon has no associated semantic role labelled corpus.",
        "While this underscores the need for approaches which do not rely on such a resource, it also means that we lack a labelled sample of data against which to evaluate our results.",
        "To address this, we use the existing labelled corpus of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), and develop a mapping for converting the FrameNet roles to corresponding VerbNet roles.",
        "Our mapping method demonstrates the possibility of leveraging existing resources to support the development of role labelling systems based on verb lexicons that do not have an associated hand-labelled corpus."

        "We perform the mapping in three steps.",
        "First we use an existing mapping between the semantically-specific roles in FrameNet and a much smaller intermediate set of 39 semantic roles which subsume all FrameNet roles.",
        "The associations in this mapping are straightforward – e.g., the Place role for Abusing verbs and the Area role for Operate-vehicle verbs are both mapped to Location.",
        "Second, from this intermediate set we create a simple mapping to the set of 22 VerbNet roles.",
        "Some roles are unaffected by the mapping (e.g., Cause alone in the intermediate set maps to Cause in the VerbNet set).",
        "Other roles are merged (e.g., Degree and Measure both map to Amount).",
        "Moreover, some roles in FrameNet (and the intermediate set) must be mapped to more than one VerbNet role.",
        "For example, an Experiencer role in FrameNet is considered Experiencer by some VerbNet classes, but Agent by others.",
        "In such cases, our mappings in this step must be specific to the VerbNet class.",
        "In this second step, some roles have no subsuming VerbNet role, because FrameNet provides roles for a wider variety of relations.",
        "For example, both FrameNet and the intermediate role set contain a Manner role, which VerbNet does not have.",

        "An extracted subject would be aligned with the subject position in a VerbNet frame, for instance, and the subject role from the frame would be listed as a possible label for the extracted subject.",
        "The alignment of PP-objects is similar to that of the other slot types, except that we add an additional constraint that the associated prepositions must match.",
        "For PP-object slots, VerbNet frames often provide an explicit list of allowable prepositions.",
        "Alternatively, the frame may specify a required semantic feature such as +path or +loc.",
        "In order for an extracted PP-object to align with one of these frame slots, its associated preposition must be included in the list provided by the frame, or have the specified feature.",
        "To determine the latter, we manually create lists of prepositions that we judge to have each of the possible semantic features.",
        "In general, this matching procedure assumes that frames describing a syntactic argument structure similar to that of the parsed sentence are more likely to correctly describe the semantic roles of the extracted arguments.",
        "Thus, the frame matcher only chooses roles from frames that are the best syntactic matches with the extracted argument set.",
        "This is achieved by adopting the scoring method of Swier and Stevenson (2004), in which we compute the portion %Frame of frame slots that can be mapped to an extracted argument, and the portion %Sent of extracted arguments from the sentence that can be mapped to the frame.",

        "(2001) and the bootstrapping labeller of Swier and Stevenson (2004), but both are evaluated on only a small number of verbs and arguments.",
        "In related unsupervised tasks, Riloff and colleagues have learned “case frames” for verbs (e.g., Riloff and Schmelzen-bach, 1998), while Gildea (2002) has learned role-slot mappings (but does not apply the knowledge for the labelling task).",
        "Other role labelling systems have also relied on the extraction of much more complex features or probability models than we adopt here.",
        "As a point of comparison, we apply the iterative backoff model from Swier and Stevenson (2004), trained on 20% of the BNC, with our frame matcher and test data.",
        "The backoff model achieves an F-measure of .63, slightly below the performance of .65 for our simplest probability model, which uses less training data and takes far less time to run (minutes rather than hours).",
        "In general, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between our work and most other role labellers because of differences in corpora and role sets, and, perhaps more significantly, differences in the selection of target arguments.",
        "However, the best supervised systems, using automatic parses to identify full argument phrases in PropBank, achieve about .82 on the task of identifying and labelling arguments (Pradhan et al., 2004).",
        "Though this is higher than our performance of .61 on full phrase arguments, our system does not require manually annotated data."

        "In this work, we employ an expensive but highly reusable resource – a verb lexicon – to perform role labelling with a simple probability model and a small amount of unsupervised training data.",
        "We outperform similar work that uses much more data and a more complex model, showing the benefit of exploiting lexical information directly.",
        "To achieve performance comparable to that of supervised methods may require human filtering or augmentation of the initial labelling.",
        "However, given the expense of producing a large semantically annotated corpus, even such “human in the loop” approaches may lead to a decrease in overall resource demands.",
        "We use such a corpus for evaluation purposes only, modifying it with a role mapping to correspond to our lexicon.",
        "We thus demonstrate that such existing resources can be bootstrapped for lexicons lacking an associated annotated corpus."
