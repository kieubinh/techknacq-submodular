        "A useful tool in natural language processing tasks such as translation, speech recognition, parsing, etc., is the ranked list of results.",
        "Modern systems typically produce competing partial results internally and return only the top-scoring complete result to the user.",
        "They are, however, also capable of producing lists of runners-up, and such lists have many practical uses: The lists may be inspected to determine the quality of runners-up and motivate model changes.",
        "The lists may be re-ranked with extra knowledge sources that are difficult to apply during the main search.",
        "The lists may be used with annotation and a tuning process, such as in (Collins and",
        "Roark, 2004), to iteratively alter feature weights and improve results.",

        "al., 2004).",
        "Notice that the same tree occurs multiple times in this list.",
        "This repetition is quite characteristic of the output of ranked lists.",
        "It occurs because many systems, such as the ones proposed by (Bod,1992), (Galley, et.",
        "al., 2004), and (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) represent their result space in terms of weighted partial results of various sizes that may be assembled in multiple ways.",
        "There is in general more than one way to assemble the partial results to derive the same complete result.",
        "Thus, the best list of results is really an best list of derivations.",
        "When list-based tasks, such as the ones mentioned above, take as input the top results for some constant , the effect of repetition on these tasks is deleterious.",
        "A list with many repetitions suffers from a lack of useful information, hampering diagnostics.",
        "Repeated results prevent alternatives that would be highly ranked in a secondary reranking system from even being considered.",
        "And a list of fewer unique trees than expected can cause overfitting when this list is used to tune.",
        "Furthermore, the actual weight of obtaining any particular tree is split among its repetitions, distorting the actual relative weights between trees.",
        "(Mohri,1997) encountered this problem in speech recognition, and presented a solution to the problem of repetition in best lists of strings that are derived from finite-state automata.",
        "That work described a way to use a powerset construction along",
        "with an innovative bookkeeping system to deter-minize the automaton, resulting in an automaton that preserves the language but provides a single, properly weighted derivation for each string in it.",
        "Put another way, if the input automaton has the ability to generate the same string with different weights, the output automaton generates that string with weight equal to the sum of all of the generations of that string in the input automaton.",
        "In (Mohri and Riley, 2002) this technique was combined with a procedure for efficiently obtaining best ranked lists, yielding a list of string results with no repetition.",

        "The application to parsing is natural, and in machine translation tree grammars can be used to model syntactic transfer, control of function words, reordering, and target-language well-formedness.",
        "In the world of automata these grammars have as a natural dual the finite tree recognizer (Doner, 1970).",
        "Like tree grammars and packed forests, they are compact ways of representing very large sets of trees.",
        "We will present an algorithm for determiniz-ing weighted finite tree recognizers, and use a variant of the procedure found in (Huang and Chiang, 2005) to obtain best lists of trees that are weighted correctly and contain no repetition.",
