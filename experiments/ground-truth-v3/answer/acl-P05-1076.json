        "Research into automatic acquisition of lexical information from large repositories of unannotated text (such as the web, corpora of published text, etc.)",
        "is starting to produce large scale lexical resources which include frequency and usage information tuned to genres and sublanguages.",
        "Such resources are critical for natural language processing (NLP), both for enhancing the performance of",
        "state-of-art statistical systems and for improving the portability of these systems between domains.",
        "One type of lexical information with particular importance for NLP is subcategorization.",
        "Access to an accurate and comprehensive subcategorization lexicon is vital for the development of successful parsing technology (e.g. (Carroll et al., 1998b), important for many NLP tasks (e.g. automatic verb classification (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002)) and useful for any application which can benefit from information about predicate-argument structure (e.g. Information Extraction (IE) (Surdeanu et al., 2003)).",
        "The first systems capable of automatically learning a small number of verbal subcategorization frames (SCFs) from English corpora emerged over a decade ago (Brent, 1991; Manning, 1993).",
        "Subsequent research has yielded systems for English (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen, 2002) capable of detecting comprehensive sets of SCFs with promising accuracy and demonstrated success in application tasks (e.g. (Carroll et al., 1998b; Korhonen et al., 2003)), besides systems for a number of other languages (e.g. (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002; Ferrer, 2004)).",
        "While there has been considerable research into acquisition of verb subcategorization, we are not aware of any systems built for adjectives.",
        "Although adjectives are syntactically less multivalent than verbs, and although verb subcategorization distribution data appears to offer the greatest potential boost in parser performance, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of the many adjective SCFs can improve the accuracy of parsing at several levels",
        "(from tagging to syntactic and semantic analysis).",
        "Automatic SCF acquisition techniques are particularly important for adjectives because extant syntax dictionaries provide very limited coverage of adjective subcategorization.",
        "In this paper we propose a method for automatic acquisition of adjectival SCFs from English corpus data.",
        "Our method has been implemented using a decision-tree classifier which tests for the presence of grammatical relations (GRs) in the output of the RASP (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing) system (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).",
        "It uses a powerful task-specific pattern-matching language which enables the frames to be classified hierarchically in a way that mirrors inheritance-based lexica.",
        "As reported later, the system is capable of detecting 30 SCFs with an accuracy comparable to that of best state-of-art verbal SCF acquisition systems (e.g. (Korhonen, 2002)).",
        "Additionally, we present a novel tool for linguistic annotation of SCFs in corpus data aimed at alleviating the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition.",
        "The tool incorporates an intuitive interface with the ability to significantly reduce the number of frames presented to the user for each sentence.",
        "We discuss adjectival subcategorization in section 2 and introduce the system for SCF acquisition in section 3.",
        "Details of the annotation tool and the experimental evaluation are supplied in section 4.",

        "Although the number of SCF types for adjectives is smaller than the number reported for verbs (e.g. (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997)), adjectives nevertheless exhibit rich syntactic behaviour.",
        "Besides the common attributive and predicative positions there are at least six further positions in which adjectives commonly occur (see figure 1).",
        "Adjectives in predicative position can be further classified according to the nature of the arguments with which they combine – finite and non-finite clauses and noun phrases, phrases with and without complementisers, etc.",
        " – and whether they occur as subject or object.",
        "Additional distinctions can be made concern",
        "ing such features as the mood of the complement (mandative, interrogative, etc.",
        "), preferences for particular prepositions and whether the subject is extra-posed.",
        "Even ignoring preposition preference, there are more than 30 distinguishable adjectival SCFs.",
        "Some fairly extensive frame sets can be found in large syntax dictionaries, such as COMLEX (31 SCFs) (Wolff et al., 1998) and ANLT (24 SCFs) (Boguraev et al., 1987).",
        "While such resources are generally accurate, they are disappointingly incomplete: none of the proposed frame sets in the well-known resources subsumes the others, the coverage of SCF types for individual adjectives is low, and (accurate) information on the relative frequency of SCFs for each adjective is absent.",
        "The inadequacy of manually-created dictionaries and the difficulty of adequately enhancing and maintaining the information by hand was a central motivation for early research into automatic subcategorization acquisition.",
        "The focus heretofore has remained firmly on verb subcategorization, but this is not sufficient, as countless examples show.",
        "Knowledge of adjectival subcategorization can yield further improvements in tagging (e.g. distinguishing between “to” as an infinitive marker and as a true preposition), parsing (e.g. distinguishing between PP-arguments and adjuncts), and semantic analysis.",
        "For example, if John is both easy and eager to please then we know that he is the recipient of pleasure in the first instance and desirous of providing it in the second, but a computational system cannot determine this without knowledge of the subcategorization of the two adjectives.",
        "Likewise, a natural language generation system can legitimately apply the extraposition transformation to the first case, but not to the second: It is “easy to please John”, but not",
        "“eager”to do so, at least if “it” be expletive.",
        "Similar examples abound.",
        "Many of the difficulties described in the literature on acquiring verb subcategorization also arise in the adjectival case.",
        "The most apparent is data sparsity: among the 100M-word British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995), the RASP tools find 124,120 distinct adjectives, of which 70,246 occur only once, 106,464 fewer than ten times and 119,337 fewer than a hundred times.",
        "There are fewer than 1,000 adjectives in the corpus which have more than 1,000 occurrences.",
        "Both adjective and SCF frequencies have Zipfian distributions; consequently, even the largest corpora may contain only single instances of a particular adjective-SCF combination, which is generally insufficient for classification."

        "Besides focusing on adjectives, our approach to SCF acquisition differs from earlier work in a number of ways.",
        "A common strategy in existing systems (e.g. (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997)) is to extract SCFs from parse trees, introducing an unnecessary dependence on the details of a particular parser.",
        "In our approach the patterns are extracted from GRs – representations of head-complement relations which are designed to be largely parser-independent – making the techniques more widely applicable and allowing classification to operate at a higher level.",
        "Further, most existing systems work by classifying corpus occurrences into individual, mutually independent SCFs.",
        "We adopt instead a hierarchical approach, viewing frames that share features as descendants of a common parent frame.",
        "The benefits are severalfold: specifying each feature only once makes the system both more efficient and easier to understand and maintain, and the multiple inheritance hierarchy reflects the hierarchy of lexical types found in modern grammars where relationships between similar frames are represented explicitly1 .",
        "Our acquisition process consists of two main steps: 1) extracting GRs from corpus data, and 2) feeding the GRs as input to the classifier which incrementally matches parts of the GR sets to decide which branches of a decision-tree to follow.",

        "The parser has several modes of operation; we invoked it in a mode in which GRs with associated probabilities are emitted even when a complete analysis of the sentence could not be found.",
        "In this mode there is wide coverage (over 98% of the BNC receives at least a partial analysis (Carroll and Briscoe, 2002)) which is useful in view of the infrequent occurrence of some of the SCFs, although combining the results of competing parses may in some cases result in an inconsistent or misleading combination of GRs.",

        "tives using more data (possibly from several corpora and the web) to determine how severe this problem is for adjectives.",
        "One possible way to address the problem is to smooth the acquired SCF distributions using SCF “back-off” (probability) estimates based on lexical classes of adjectives in the manner proposed by (Korhonen, 2002).",
        "This helps to correct the acquired distributions and to detect low frequency and unseen SCFs.",
        "However, our experiment also revealed other problems which require attention in the future.",
        "One such is that GRs output by RASP (the version we used in our experiments) do not retain certain distinctions which are essential for distinguishing particular SCFs.",
        "For example, a sentential complement of an adjective with a that-complementiser should be annotated with ccomp (that, adjective, verbal-head), but this relation (with that as the type argument) does not occur in the parsed BNC.",
        "As a consequence the classifier is unable to distinguish the frame.",
        "Another problem arises from the fact that our current classifier operates on a predefined set of SCFs.",
        "The COMLEX SCFs, from which ours were derived, are extremely incomplete.",
        "Almost a quarter (477 of 1931) of sentences were annotated as “undefined”.",
        "For example, while there are SCFs for sentential and infinitival complement in subject position with what6, there is no SCF for the case with a what-prefixed complement in object position, where the subject is an NP.",
        "The lack is especially perplexing, because COMLEX does include the corresponding SCFs for verbs.",
        "There is a frame for “He wondered",
        "what to do” (what-to-inf), but none for “He was unsure what to do”.",
        "While we can easily extend the current frameset by looking for further SCF types from dictionaries and from among the corpus occurrences labelled by our annotators as unclassified, we also plan to extend the classifier to automatically induce previously unseen frames from data.",
        "A possible approach is to use restricted generalization on sets of GRs to group similar sentences together.",
        "Generalization (anti-unification) is an intersection operation on two structures which retains the features common to both; generalization over the sets of GRs associated with the sentences which instantiate a particular frame can produce a pattern such as we used for classification in the experiments described above.",
        "This approach also offers the possibility of associating confidence levels with each pattern, corresponding to the degree to which the generalized pattern captures the features common to the members of the associated class.",
        "It is possible that frames could be induced by grouping sentences according to the “best” (e.g. most information-preserving) generalizations for various combinations, but it is not clear how this can be implemented with acceptable efficiency.",
        "The hierarchical approach described in this paper may also helpful in the discovery of new frames: missing combinations of parent classes can be explored readily, and it may be possible to combine the various features in an SCF feature structure to generate example sentences which a human could then inspect to judge grammaticality."
