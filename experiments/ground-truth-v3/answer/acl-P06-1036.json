        "A dictionary user typically pursues one of two goals (Humble, 2001): as a decoder (reading, listening), he may look for the definition or the translation of a specific target word, while as an encoder (speaker, writer) he may want to find a word that expresses well not only a given concept, but is also appropriate in a given context.",
        "Obviously, readers and writers come to the dictionary with different mindsets, information and expectations concerning input and output.",
        "While the decoder can provide the word he wants additional information for, the encoder (language producer) provides the meaning of a word for which he lacks the corresponding form.",
        "In sum, users with different goals need access to different indexes, one that is based on form (decoding),",
        "the other being based on meaning or meaning relations (encoding).",
        "Our concern here is more with the encoder, i.e. lexical access in language production, a feature largely neglected in lexicographical work.",
        "Yet, a good dictionary contains not only many entries and a lot of information concerning each one of them, but also efficient means to reveal the stored information.",
        "Because, what is a huge dictionary good for, if one cannot access the information it contains?",
        "2 Lexical access on the basis of what: concepts (i.e. meanings) or words?",
        "Broadly speaking, there are two views concerning lexicalization: the process is conceptually-driven (meaning, or parts of it are the starting point) or lexically-driven2: the target word is accessed via a source word.",
        "This is typically the case when we are looking for a synonym, antonym, hypernym (paradigmatic associations), or any of its syntagmatic associates (red-rose, coffee-black), the kind of association we will be concerned with here.",
        "Yet, besides conceptual knowledge, people seem also to know a lot of things concerning the lexical form (Brown and Mc Neill, 1966): number of syllables, beginning/ending of the target word, part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.",
        "), origin (Greek or Latin), gender (Vigliocco et al., 2 Of course, the input can also be hybrid, that is, it can be composed of a conceptual and a linguistic component.",
        "For example, in order to express the notion of intensity, MAGN in Mel’cuk’s theory (Mel’cuk et al., 1995), a speaker or writer has to use different words (very, seriously, high) depending on the form of the argument (ill, wounded, price), as he says very ill, seriously wounded, high price.",
        "In each case he expresses the very same notion, but by using a different word.",
        "While he could use the adverb very for qualifying the state of somebody’s health (he is ill), he cannot do so when qualifying the words injury or price.",
        "Likewise, he cannot use this specific adverb to qualify the noun illness.",
        "1997).",
        "While in principle, all this information could be used to constrain the search space, we will deal here only with one aspect, the words’ relations to other concepts or words (associative knowledge).",
        "Suppose, you were looking for a word expressing the following ideas: domesticated animal, producing milk suitable for making cheese.",
        "Suppose further that you knew that the target word was neither cow, buffalo nor sheep.",
        "While none of this information is sufficient to guarantee the access of the intended word goat, the information at hand (part of the definition) could certainly be used 3.",
        "Besides this type of information, people often have other kinds of knowledge concerning the target word.",
        "In particular, they know how the latter relates to other words.",
        "For example, they know that goats and sheep are somehow connected, sharing a great number of features, that both are animals (hypernym), that sheep are appreciated for their wool and meat, that they tend to follow each other blindly, etc., while goats manage to survive, while hardly eating anything, etc.",
        "In sum, people have in their mind a huge lexico-conceptual network, with words 4 , concepts or ideas being highly interconnected.",
        "Hence, any one of them can evoke the other.",
        "The likelihood for this to happen depends on such factors as frequency (associative strength), saliency and distance (direct vs. indirect access).",
        "As one can see, associations are a very general and powerful mechanism.",
        "No matter what we hear, read or say, anything is likely to remind us of something else.",
        "This being so, we should make use of it.",
        "4 Of course, one can question the very fact that people store words in their mind.",
        "Rather than considering the human mind as a wordstore one might consider it as a wordfactory.",
        "Indeed, by looking at some of the work done by psychologists who try to emulate the mental lexicon (Levelt et al., 1999) one gets the impression that words are synthesized rather than located and call up.",
        "In this case one might conclude that rather than having words in our mind we have a set of highly distributed, more or less abstract information.",
        "By propagating energy rather than data – (as there is no message passing, transformation or cumulation of information, there is only activation spreading, that is, changes of energy levels, call it weights, electronic impulses, or whatever), – that we propagate signals, activating ultimately certain peripherical organs (larynx, tongue, mouth, lips, hands) in such a way as to produce movements or sounds, that, not knowing better, we call words.",
        "3 Accessing the target word by navigating in a huge associative network If one agrees with what we have just said, one could view the mental lexicon as a huge semantic network composed of nodes (words and concepts) and links (associations), with either being able to activate the other5.",
        "Finding a word involves entering the network and following the links leading from the source node (the first word that comes to your mind) to the target word (the one you are looking for).",
        "Suppose you wanted to find the word nurse (target word), yet the only token coming to your mind is hospital.",
        "In this case the system would generate internally a graph with the source word at the center and all the associated words at the periphery.",
        "Put differently, the system would build internally a semantic network with hospital in the center and all its associated words as satellites (see Figure 1, next page).",
        "Obviously, the greater the number of associations, the more complex the graph.",
        "Given the diversity of situations in which a given object may occur we are likely to build many associations.",
        "In other words, lexical graphs tend to become complex, too complex to be a good representation to support navigation.",
        "Readability is hampered by at least two factors: high connectivity (the great number of links or associations emanating from each word), and distribution: conceptually related nodes, that is, nodes activated by the same kind of association are scattered around, that is, they do not necessarily occur next to each other, which is quite confusing for the user.",
        "In order to solve this problem, we suggest to display by category (chunks) all the words linked by the same kind of association to the source word (see Figure 2).",
        "Hence, rather than displaying all the connected words as a flat list, we suggest to present them in chunks to allow for categorial search.",
        "Having chosen a category, the user will be presented a list of words or categories from which he must choose.",
        "If the target word is in the category chosen by the user (suppose he looked for a hypernym, hence he checked the ISA-bag), search stops, otherwise it continues.",
        "The user could choose either another category (e.g. AKO or TIORA), or a word in the current list, which would then become the new starting point.",
        "As one can see, the fact that the links are labeled has some very important consequences: (a) While maintaining the power of a highly connected graph (possible cyclic navigation), it has at the interface level the simplicity of a tree: each node points only to data of the same type, i.e. to the same kind of association.",
        "(b) With words being presented in clusters, navigation can be accomplished by clicking on the appropriate category.",
        "The assumption being that the user generally knows to which category the target word belongs (or at least, he can recognize within which of the listed categories it falls), and that categorical search is in principle faster than search in a huge list of unordered (or, alphabetically ordered) words6.",
        "Obviously, in order to allow for this kind of access, the resource has to be built accordingly.",
        "This requires at least two things: (a) indexing words by the associations they evoke, (b) identi6 Even though very important, at this stage we shall not worry too much for the names given to the links.",
        "Indeed, one might question nearly all of them.",
        "What is important is the underlying rational: help users to navigate on the basis of symbolically qualified links.",
        "In reality a whole set of words (synonyms, of course, but not only) could amount to a link, i. e. be its conceptual equivalent.",

        "We have argued in the previous sections that dictionaries must contain many kinds of relations on the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axis to allow for natural and flexible access of words.",

        "However, as various researchers have pointed out (Harabagiu et al., 1999), these networks lack information, in particular with regard to syntagmatic associations, which are generally unsystematic.",
        "These latter, called TIORA (Zock and Bilac, 2004) or topical relations (Ferret, 2002) account for the fact that two words refer to the same topic, or take part in the same situation or scenario.",
        "Word-pairs like doctor–hospital, burglar–policeman or plane–airport, are examples in case.",
        "The lack of such topical relations in resources like WordNet has been dubbed as the tennis problem (Roger Chaffin, cited in Fell-baum, 1998).",
        "Some of these links have been introduced more recently in WordNet via the domain relation.",
        "Yet their number remains still very small.",
        "For instance, WordNet 2.1 does not contain any of the three associations mentioned here above, despite their high frequency.",
        "The lack of systematicity of these topical relations makes their extraction and typing very difficult on a large scale.",
        "This is why some researchers have proposed to use automatic learning techniques to extend lexical networks like WordNet.",
        "In (Harabagiu & Moldovan, 1998), this was done by extracting topical relations from the glosses associated to the synsets.",
        "Other researchers used external sources: Mandala et al.",

        "This last idea has been taken up and extended by (Avancini et al., 2003) who expanded the domains built from this annotation.",
        "Despite the improvements, all these approaches are limited by the fact that they rely too heavily on WordNet and some of its more sophisticated features (such as the definitions associated with the synsets).",
        "While often being exploited by acquisition methods, these features are generally lacking in similar lexico-semantic networks.",
        "Moreover, these methods attempt to learn topical knowledge from a lexical network rather than topical relations.",

        "In consequence, we took an incremental approach (Ferret, 2006): starting from a network of lexical co-occurrences7 collected from a large corpus, we used these latter to select potential topical relations by using a topical analyzer."

        "Like (Church and Hanks, 1990), we used mutual information to measure the cohesion between two words.",
        "The finite size of the corpus allows us to normalize this measure in line with the maximal mutual information relative to the corpus.",

        "• it proposes a restricted set of words from the co-occurrence network to expand the selected words of the segment.",
        "These three tasks rely on a common mechanism: a window is moved over the text to be analyzed in order to limit the focus space of the analysis.",

        "The number of links between the selected words of the network, called expansion words, and those of the window is a good indicator of the topical coherence of the window’s content.",
