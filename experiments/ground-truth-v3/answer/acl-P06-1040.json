        "Randomly guessing answers should yield an F of 20% (1 out of 5 choices), but ranking patterns randomly (row 13) results in an F of 26.4%.",

        "There are five general classes of labels with thirty subclasses.",

        "The input set W consists of the 600 noun-modifier pairs.",

        "The distance between two noun-modifier pairs is measured by the average rank of their best shared pattern.",
        "Table 5 shows the resulting precision, recall, and F, when ranking patterns by pertinence.",

        "The main contribution of this paper is the idea of pertinence, which allows us to take an opaque measure of relational similarity and use it to find patterns that express the implicit semantic relations between two words.",
        "The experiments in Sections 5 and 6 show that ranking patterns by pertinence is superior to ranking them by a variety of tf-idf methods.",
        "On the word analogy and noun-modifier tasks, pertinence performs as well as the state-of-the-art, LRA, but pertinence goes beyond LRA by making relations explicit."
