        "Recently, textual entailment recognition has been receiving a lot of attention.",
        "The main reason is that the understanding of the basic entailment processes will allow us to model more accurate semantic theories of natural languages (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet, 2001) and design important applications (Dagan and Glickman, 2004), e.g., Question Answering and Information Extraction.",
        "However, previous work (e.g., (Zaenen et al., 2005)) suggests that determining whether or not a text T entails a hypothesis H is quite complex even when all the needed information is explicitly asserted.",
        "For example, the sentence T1: “At the end of the year, all solid companies pay dividends.” entails the hypothesis H1: “At the end of the year, all solid insurance companies pay dividends.” but it does not entail the hypothesis H2: “At the end of the year, all solid companies pay cash dividends.” Although these implications are uncontroversial, their automatic recognition is complex if we rely on models based on lexical distance (or similarity) between hypothesis and text, e.g., (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "Indeed, according to such approaches, the hypotheses H1 and H2 are very similar and seem to be similarly related to T1.",
        "This suggests that we should study the properties and differences of such two examples (negative and positive) to derive more accurate entailment models.",
        "For example, if we consider the following entailment:",
        "we note that T3 is structurally (and somehow lexically similar) to T1 and H3 is more similar to H1 than to H2.",
        "Thus, from T1 ==>.",
        "H1 we may extract rules to derive that T3 ==>.",
        "H3.",
        "The above example suggests that we should rely not only on a intra pair similarity between T and H but also on a cross-pair similarity between two pairs (T', H') and (T\", H\").",
        "The latter similarity measure along with a set of annotated examples allows a learning algorithm to automatically derive syntactic and lexical rules that can solve complex entailment cases.",
        "In this paper, we define a new cross-pair similarity measure based on text and hypothesis syntactic trees and we use such similarity with traditional intra pair similarities to define a novel semantic kernel function.",
        "We experimented with such kernel using Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1995) on the test tests of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar Haim et al., 2006).",
        "The comparative results show that (a) we have designed an effective way to automatically learn entailment rules from examples and (b) our approach is highly accurate and exceeds the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art",
        "models (Glickman et al., 2005; Bayer et al., 2005) by about 4.4% (i.e. 63% vs. 58.6%) on the RTE 1 test set (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "In the remainder of this paper, Sec. 2 illustrates the related work, Sec. 3 introduces the complexity of learning entailments from examples, Sec. 4 describes our models, Sec. 6 shows the experimental results and finally Sec. 7 derives the conclusions."

        "Although the textual entailment recognition problem is not new, most of the automatic approaches have been proposed only recently.",
        "This has been mainly due to the RTE challenge events (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar Haim et al., 2006).",
        "In the following we report some of such researches.",
        "A first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between T and H either assuming the independence between words (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Glickman et al., 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005).",
        "A pair (T, H) is then in entailment when sim(T, H) > α.",
        "These approaches can hardly determine whether the entailment holds in the examples of the previous section.",
        "From the point of view of bag-of-word methods, the pairs (T1, H1) and (T1, H2) have both the same intra-pair similarity since the sentences of T1 and H1 as well as those of T1 and H2 differ by a noun, insurance and cash, respectively.",
        "At syntactic level, also, we cannot capture the required information as such nouns are both noun modifiers: insurance modifies companies and cash modifies dividends.",
        "A second class of methods can give a solution to the previous problem.",
        "These methods generally combine a similarity measure with a set of possible transformations T applied over syntactic and semantic interpretations.",
        "The entailment between T and H is detected when there is a transformation r ∈ T so that sim(r(T), H) > α.",
        "These transformations are logical rules in (Bos and Markert, 2005) or sequences of allowed rewrite rules in (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005).",
        "The disadvantage is that such rules have to be manually designed.",
        "Moreover, they generally model better positive implications than negative ones and they do not consider errors in syntactic parsing and semantic analysis."

      "text": [
        "In the introductory section, we have shown that, to carry out automatic learning from examples, we need to define a cross-pair similarity measure.",
        "Its definition is not straightforward as it should detect whether two pairs (T', H') and (T\", H\") realize the same rewrite rules.",
        "This measure should consider pairs similar when: (1) T' and H' are structurally similar to T\" and H\", respectively and (2) the lexical relations within the pair (T', H') are compatible with those in (T\", H\").",
        "Typically, T and H show a certain degree of overlapping, thus, lexical relations (e.g., between the same words) determine word movements from T to H (or vice versa).",
        "This is important to model the syntactic/lexical similarity between example pairs.",
        "Indeed, if we encode such movements in the syntactic parse trees of texts and hypotheses, we can use interesting similarity measures defined for syntactic parsing, e.g., the tree kernel devised in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).",
        "To consider structural and lexical relation similarity, we augment syntactic trees with placeholders which identify linked words.",
        "More in detail: - We detect links between words wt in T that are equal, similar, or semantically dependent on words wh in H. We call anchors the pairs (wt, wh) and we associate them with placeholders.",
        "For example, in Fig. 1, the placeholder 12”1 indicates the (companies, companies) anchor between T1 and H1.",
        "This allows us to derive the word movements between text and hypothesis.",
        "- We align the trees of the two texts T' and T\" as well as the tree of the two hypotheses H' and H\" by considering the word movements.",
        "We find a correct mapping between placeholders of the two hypothesis H' and H\" and apply it to the tree of H\" to substitute its placeholders.",
        "The same mapping is used to substitute the placeholders in TV.",
        "This mapping should maximize the structural similarity between the four trees by considering that placeholders augment the node labels.",
        "Hence, the cross-pair similarity computation is reduced to the tree similarity computation.",
        "The above steps define an effective cross-pair similarity that can be applied to the example in Fig. 1: T1 and T3 share the subtree in bold starting with S → NP VP.",
        "The lexicals in T3 and H3 are quite different from those T1 and H1, but we can rely on the structural properties expressed by their bold subtrees.",
        "These are more similar to the subtrees of T1 and H1 than those of T1 and H2, respectively.",
        "Indeed, H1 and H3 share the production NP → DT JJ NN NNS while H2 and H3 do",
        "not.",
        "Consequently, to decide if (T3,H3) is a valid entailment, we should rely on the decision made for (T1, H1).",
        "Note also that the dashed lines con-ng placeholders of two texts (hypotheses) indicate structurally equivalent nodes.",
        "For instance, the dashed line between 3 d b linkshe n verbs both in the texts T1 and T3 and in the hypotheses H1 and H3.",
        "After substituting 3 with and 2 with a, we can detect if T1 and T3 share the bold subtree S → NP2 VP3.",
        "As such subtree is shared also by H1 and H3, the words n the pair (T1, H1) are correlated similarly to the words |XML |xmlLoc_0 xmlBold_no xmlItalic_no xmlFontSize_common xmlPic_no xmlTable_no xmlBullet_no bi_xmlSFBIA_continue bi_xmlPara_new ks mai element c ∈ C is a substitution function.",

        "The accuracy reported for the best systems, i.e. 58.6% (Glickman et al., 2005; Bayer et al., 2005), is not significantly different from the result obtained with K1 that uses the idf.",
        "- Third, the dramatic improvement observed in (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) on the dataset “Train: D 1-Test: T 1” is given by the idf rather than the use of the J&C similarity (second vs. third columns).",
        "The use of J&C with the idf decreases the accuracy of the idf alone.",
        "- Next, our approach (last column) is significantly better than all the other methods as it provides the best result for each combination of training and test sets.",
        "On the “Train:D1-Test:T1” test set, it exceeds the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art models (Glickman et al., 2005; Bayer et al., 2005) by about 4.4 absolute percent points (63% vs. 58.6%) and 4% over our best lexical similarity measure.",
        "By comparing the average on all datasets, our system improves on all the methods by at least 3 absolute percent points.",
        "- Finally, the accuracy produced by Synt Trees with placeholders is higher than the one obtained with Only Synt Trees.",
        "Thus, the use of placeholders is fundamental to automatically learn entailments from examples."
