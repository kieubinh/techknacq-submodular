        "We refer to distinctions made between lexical types in one language that do not result in different distributions over types in the other language as lexically redundant for the language pair.",
        "Since the role of the translation model is to determine a distribution over target types given a source type, when the corresponding target distributions do not vary significantly over a set of source types, the model gains nothing by maintaining a distinct set of parameters for each member of this set.",
        "Lexical redundancy may arise when languages differ in the specificity with which they refer to the same concepts.",
        "For instance, colours of the spectrum may be partitioned differently (e.g. blue in English v.s.",

        "Previous work on automatic bilingual word clustering has been motivated somewhat differently and not made use of cluster-based models to assign translation probabilities directly (Wang et al., 1996), (Och, 1998).",
        "There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004).",
        "These approaches have used morphological annotation (e.g. lemmas and part of speech tags) to provide explicit supervision.",
        "They have also involved manually specifying which morphological distinc",
        "tions are redundant (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).",
        "In contrast, we attempt to learn both equivalence classes and redundant relations automatically.",
        "Our experiments with orthographic features suggest that some morphological redundancies can be acquired in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "The marginal likelihood hard-clustering algorithm that we propose here for translation model selection can be viewed as a Bayesian k-means algorithm and is an application of Bayesian model selection techniques, e.g., (Wolpert, 1995).",
        "The Markov random field prior over model structure extends the fixed uniform prior over clusters implicit in k-means clustering and is common in computer vision (Geman and Geman, 1984).",
        "Recently Basu et al.",
        "(2004) used an MRF to embody hard constraints within semi-supervised clustering.",
        "In contrast, we use an iterative EM algorithm to learn soft constraints within the ‘prior’ monolingual space based on the results of clustering with bilingual statistics."

        "We proposed a framework for modelling lexical redundancy in machine translation and tackled optimisation of the lexicon via Bayesian model selection over a set of cluster-based translation models.",
        "We showed improvements in translation quality incorporating these models within a phrase-based SMT sytem.",
        "Additional gains resulted from the inclusion of an MRF prior over model structure.",
        "We demonstrated that this prior could be used to learn weights for monolingual features that characterise bilingual redundancy.",
        "Preliminary experiments defining MRF features over morphological annotation suggest this model can also identify redundant distinctions categorised linguistically (for instance, that morphological case is redundant on Czech nouns and adjectives with respect to English, while number is redundant only on adjectives).",
        "In future work we will investigate the use of linguistic resources to define feature sets for the MRF prior.",
        "Lexical redundancy would ideally be addressed in the context of phrases, however, computation and statistical estimation may then be significantly more challenging."
