        "Our findings show that information from both these sources can lead to strong improvements in overall system accuracy: dependency knowledge improved performance over all classes of word, and knowledge of the position of a word in an ontological hierarchy increased accuracy for words not seen in the training data.",

        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging has been one of the fundamental areas of research in natural language processing for many years.",
        "Most of the prior research has focussed on the task of labeling text with tags that reflect the words’ syntactic role in the sentence.",
        "In parallel to this, the task of word sense disambiguation (WSD), the process of deciding in which semantic sense the word is being used, has been actively researched.",
        "This paper addresses a combination of these two fields, that is: labeling running words with tags that comprise, in addition to their syntactic function, a broad semantic class that signifies the semantics of the word in the context of the sentence, but does not necessarily provide information that is sufficiently fine-grained as to disambiguate its sense.",
        "This differs",
        "from what is commonly meant by WSD in that although each word may have many “senses” (by senses here, we mean the set of semantic labels the word may take), these senses are not specific to the word itself but are drawn from a vocabulary applicable to the subset of all types in the corpus that may have the same semantics.",
        "In order to perform this task, we draw on research from several related fields, and exploit publicly available linguistic resources, namely the WordNet database (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Our aim is to simultaneously disambiguate the semantics of the words being tagged while tagging their POS syntax.",
        "We treat the task as fundamentally a POS tagging task, with a larger, more ambiguous tag set.",
        "However, as we will show later, the ‘n-gram’ feature set traditionally employed to perform POS tagging, while basically competent, is not up to this challenge, and needs to be augmented by features specifically targeted at semantic disambiguation."

        "The ME approach is well-suited to this kind of labeling because it allows the use of a wide variety of features without the necessity to explicitly model the interactions between them.",

        "An ME-system for WSD that operates on similar principles to our system (Suarez, 2002) was based on an array of local features that included the words/POS tags/lemmas occurring in a window of +/-3 words of the word being disambiguated.",
        "(Lamjiri et al., 2004) also developed an ME-based system that used a very simple set of features: the article before; the POS before and after; the preposition before and after, and the syntactic category before and after the word being labeled.",
        "The features used in both of these approaches resemble those present in the feature set of a standard n-gram tagger, such as the one used as the baseline for the experiments in this paper.",
        "The semantic tags we use can be seen as a form of semantic categorization acting in a similar manner to the semantic class of a word in the system of (Lamjiri et al., 2004).",
        "The major difference is that with a left-to-right beam-search tagger, labeled context to the right of the word being labeled is not available for use in the feature set.",
        "Although POS tag information has been utilized in WSD techniques (e.g. (Suarez, 2002)), there has been relatively little work addressing the problem of assigning a part-of-speech tag to a word together with its semantics, despite the fact that the tasks involve a similar process of label disambiguation for a word in running text."

The predicate will be true for the word pomegranate which will thereby benefit from the model’s knowledge of how to tag the other words in its class.",

        "However the clustering process is computationally expensive.",
        "Another problem is that a word may only be a member of a single cluster; thus typically the cluster set assigned to a word will only be appropriate for that word when used in its most common sense.",

        "To put the magnitude of this gain into perspective, dropping the features for the identity of the previous word from the baseline model, only degraded performance by 0.2%.",
        "The features from the link grammar parser were handicapped due to the fact that only 31% of the sentences were able to be parsed.",
        "When the model (Model 3 in Table 1) was evaluated on only the parsable portion on the test set, the accuracy obtained was roughly comparable to that using the dependencies from Collins’ parses.",

        "Its accuracy was within 0.2% of the accuracy on the whole test set in all cases.",
        "Neither of the lexical dependency-based approaches had a particularly strong effect on the performance on OOV’s.",
        "This is in line with our intuition, since these features rely on the identity of the word being tagged, and the performance gain we see is due to the improvement in labeling accuracy of the context around the OOV.",
        "In contrast to this, for the word-ontology-based feature sets, one would hope to see a marked improvement on OOV’s, since these features were designed specifically to address this issue.",

        "The overall accuracy when using the automatically acquired ontology is only 0.1% higher than the accuracy using dependencies from Collins’ parser.",
        "However the accuracy on OOV’s jumps 3.5% to 35.08% compared to just 0.7% for Model 4.",
        "Performance for both clustering techniques was quite similar, with the WordNet taxonomical features being slightly more useful, especially for OOV’s.",
        "One possible explanation for this is that overall, the coverage of both techniques is similar, but for rarer words, the MI clustering can be inconsistent due to lack of data (for an example, see Figure 5.2: the word newsstand is a member of a cluster of words that appear to be commodities), whereas the WordNet clustering remains consistent even for rare words.",
        "It seems reasonable to expect, however, that the automatic method would do better if trained on more data.",

        "The dependent words boosted overall performance, especially when tagging verbs.",
        "The hierarchical ontology-based approaches also increased overall performance, but with particular emphasis on OOV’s, the intended target for this feature set.",
        "Moreover, when features from both knowledge sources were applied in combination, the gains were cumulative, indicating little overlap.",
        "Visual inspection the output of the tagger on held-out data suggests there are many remaining errors arising from special cases that might be better handled by models separate from the main tagging model.",
        "In particular, numerical expressions and named entities cause OOV errors that the techniques presented in this paper are unable to handle.",
