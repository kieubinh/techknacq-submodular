        "Information Extraction (IE) is one of the fundamental problems of natural language processing.",
        "Progress in IE is important to enhance results in such tasks as Question Answering, Information Retrieval and Text Summarization.",
        "Multiple efforts in MUC series allowed IE systems to achieve near-human performance in such domains as biological (Humphreys et al., 2000), terrorism (Kaufmann, 1992; Kaufmann, 1993) and management succession (Kaufmann, 1995).",
        "The IE task is formulated for MUC series as filling of several predefined slots in a template.",
        "The terrorism template consists of slots Perpetrator, Victim and Target; the slots in the management succession template are Org, PersonIn, PersonOut and Post.",
        "We decided to choose both terrorism and management succession domains, from MUC4 and MUC6 respectively, in order to demonstrate that our idea is applicable to multiple domains.",
        "Paraphrasing of instances is one of the crucial problems in IE.",
        "This problem leads to data sparseness in situations when information is expressed in different ways.",
        "As an example, consider the excerpts “Terrorists attacked victims” and “Victims were attacked by unidentified terrorists”.",
        "These instances have very similar semantic meaning.",
        "However, context-based approaches such as Autoslog-TS by Riloff (1996) and Yangarber et al.",
        "(2002) may face difficulties in handling these instances effectively because the context of entity ‘victims’ is located on the left context in the first instance and on the right context in the second.",
        "For these cases, we found that we are able to verify the context by performing dependency relation parsing (Lin, 1997), which outputs the word ‘victims’ as an object in both instances, with ‘attacked’ as a verb and ‘terrorists’ as a subject.",
        "After grouping of same syntactic roles in the above examples, we are able to unify these instances.",
        "Another problem in IE systems is word alignment.",
        "Insertion or deletion of tokens prevents instances from being generalized effectively during learning.",
        "Therefore, the instances “Victims were attacked by terrorists” and “Victims were recently attacked by terrorists” are difficult to unify.",
        "The common approach adopted in GRID by Xiao et al.",
        "(2003) is to apply more stable chunks such as noun phrases and verb phrases.",
        "Another recent approach by Cui et al.",
        "(2005) utilizes soft patterns for probabilistic matching of tokens.",
        "However, a longer insertion leads to a more complicated structure, as in the instance “Victims, living near the shop, went out for a walk and were attacked by terrorists”.",
        "Since there may be many inserted words, both approaches may also be inefficient for this case.",
        "Similar to the paraphrasing problem, the word alignment problem may be handled with dependency relations in many cases.",
        "We found that the relation subject-verb-object for words ‘victims’, ‘attacked’ and ‘terrorists’ remains invariant for the above two instances.",
        "Before IE can be performed, we need to identify sentences containing possible slots.",
        "This is",
        "done through the identification of cue phrases which we call anchors or anchor cues.",
        "However, natural texts tend to have diverse terminologies, which require semantic features for generalization.",
        "These features include semantic classes, Named Entities (NE) and support from ontology (for example, synsets in Wordnet).",
        "If such features are predefined, then changes in terminology (for instance, addition of new terrorism organization) will lead to a loss in recall.",
        "To avoid this, we exploit automatic mining techniques for anchor cues.",
        "Examples of anchors are the words “terrorists” or “guerrilla” that signify a possible candidate for the Perpetrator slot.",
        "From the reviewed works, we observe that the inefficient use of relations causes problems of paraphrasing and alignment and the related data sparseness problem in current IE systems.",
        "As a result, training and testing instances in the systems often lack generality.",
        "This paper aims to tackle these problems with the help of dependency relation-based model for IE.",
        "Although dependency relations provide invariant structures for many instances as illustrated above, they tend to be efficient only for short sentences and make errors on long distance relations.",
        "To tackle this problem, we classify relations into ‘simple’, ‘average’ and ‘hard’ categories, depending on the complexity of the dependency relation paths.",
        "We then employ different strategies to perform IE in each category.",
        "The main contributions of our work are as follows.",
        "First, we propose a dependency relation based model for IE.",
        "Second, we perform classification of instances into several categories based on the complexity of dependency relation structures, and employ the action promotion strategy to tackle the problem of long distance relations.",
        "The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work and Section 3 introduces our approach for constructing ARE.",
        "Section 4 introduces our method for splitting instances into categories.",
        "Section 5 describes our experimental setups and results and, finally, Section 6 concludes the paper."

        "Case frame based IE systems incorporate domain-dependent knowledge in the processing and learning of semantic constraints.",
        "However, concept hierarchy used in case frames is typically encoded manually and requires additional human labor for porting across domains.",
        "Moreover, the systems tend to rely on heuristics in order to match case frames.",
        "PALKA by Kim and Moldovan (1995) performs keyword-based matching of concepts, while CRYSTAL by Soderland et al.",
        "(1995) relied on additional domain-specific annotation and associated lexicon for matching.",
        "Rule-based IE models allow differentiation of rules according to their performance.",

        "(2004) stated that hard matching techniques tend to have low recall due to data sparseness problem.",
        "To overcome this problem, (LP)2 by Ciravegna (2002) utilizes rules with high precision in order to improve the precision of rules with average recall.",
        "However, (LP)2 is developed for semi-structured textual domain, where we can find consistent lexical patterns at surface text level.",
        "This is not the same for free-text, in which different order of words or an extra clause in a sentence may cause paraphrasing and alignment problems respectively, such as the example excerpts “terrorists attacked peasants” and “peasants were attacked 2 months ago by terrorists”.",
        "The classification-based approaches such as by Chieu and Ng (2002) tend to outperform rule-based approaches.",
        "However, Ciravegna (2001) argued that it is difficult to examine the result obtained by classifiers.",
        "Thus, interpretability of the learned knowledge is a serious bottleneck of the classification approach.",
        "Additionally, Zhou and Su (2002) trained classifiers for Named Entity extraction and reported that performance degrades rapidly if the training corpus size is below 100KB.",
        "It implies that human experts have to spend long hours to annotate a sufficiently large amount of training corpus.",

        "In order to evaluate the efficiency of our method, we conduct our experiments in 2 domains: MUC4 (Kaufmann, 1992) and MUC6 (Kaufmann, 1995).",
        "The official corpus of MUC4 is released with MUC3; it covers terrorism in the Latin America region and consists of 1,700 texts.",
        "Among them, 1,300 documents belong to the training corpus.",
        "Testing was done on 25 relevant and 25 irrelevant texts from TST3, plus 25 relevant and 25 irrelevant texts from TST4, as is done in Xiao et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "MUC6 covers news articles in Management Succession domain.",
        "Its training corpus consists of 1201 instances, whereas the testing corpus consists of 76 person-ins, 82 person-outs, 123 positions, and 79 organizations.",
        "These slots we extracted in order to fill templates on a sentence-by-sentence basis, as is done by Chieu et al.",
        "(2002) and Soderland (1999).",
        "Our experiments were designed to test the effectiveness of both case splitting and action verb promotion.",
        "The performance of ARE is compared to both the state-of-art systems and our baseline approach.",
        "We use 2 state-of-art systems for MUC4 and 1 system for MUC6.",
        "Our baseline system, Anc+rel, utilizes only anchors and relations without category splitting as described in Section 3.",
        "For our ARE system with case splitting, we present the results on Overall corpus, as well as separate results on Simple, Average and Hard categories.",
        "The Overall performance of ARE represents the result for all the categories combined together.",
        "Additionally, we test the impact of the action promotion (in the right column) for the average and hard categories.",
        "The comparative results are presented in Table 4 and Table 5 for MUC4 and MUC6, respectively.",
        "First, we review our experimental results on MUC4 corpus without promotion (left column) before proceeding to the right column.",
        "a) From the results on Table 4 we observe that our baseline approach Anc+rel outperforms all the state-of-art systems.",
        "It demonstrates that both anchors and relations are useful.",
        "Anchors allow us to group entities according to their semantic meanings and thus to select of the most prominent candidates.",
        "Relations allow us to capture more invariant representation of instances.",
        "However, a sentence may contain very few high-quality relations.",
        "It implies that the relations ranking step is fuzzy in nature.",
        "In addition, we noticed that some anchor cues may be missing, whereas the other anchor types may be represented by several anchor cues.",
        "All these factors lead only to moderate improvement in performance, especially in comparison with GRID system.",
        "b) Overall, the splitting of instances into categories turned out to be useful.",
        "Due to the application of specific strategies the performance increased by 1% over the baseline.",
        "However, the large dominance of the hard cases (65%) made this improvement modest.",
        "c) We notice that the amount of variations for connecting anchor cues in the Simple category is relatively small.",
        "Therefore, the overall performance for this case reaches F1=82%.",
        "The main errors here come from missing anchors resulting partly from mistakes in such component as NE detection.",
        "d) The performance in the Average category is F1=67%.",
        "It is lower than that for the simple category because of higher variability in relations and negative influence of support verbs.",
        "For example, for excerpt such as “X investigated murder of Y”, the processing tends to make mistake without the analysis of semantic value of support verb ‘investigated’.",
        "e) Hard category achieves the lowest performance of F1=51% among all the categories.",
        "Since for this category we have to rely mostly on anchors, the problem arises if these anchors provide the wrong clues.",
        "It happens if some of them are missing or are wrongly extracted.",
        "The other cause of mistakes is when ARE finds several anchor cues which belong to the same type.",
        "Additional usage of promotion strategies allowed us to improve the performance further.",
        "f) Overall, the addition of promotion strategy enables the system to further boost the performance to F1=60%.",
        "It means that the promotion strategy is useful, especially for the average case.",
        "The improvement in comparison to the state-of-art system GRID is about 3%.",
        "g) It achieved an F1=69%, which is an improvement of 2%, for the Average category.",
        "It implies that the analysis of support verbs helps in revealing the differences between the instances such as “X was involved in kidnapping of Y” and “X reported kidnapping of Y”.",
        "h) The results in the Hard category improved moderately to F1=52%.",
        "The reason for the improvement is that more anchor cues are captured after the promotion.",
        "Still, there are 2 types of common mis",
        "takes: 1) multiple or missing anchor cues of the same type and 2) anchors can be spread across several sentences or several clauses in the same sentence.",
        "For the MUC6 results given in Table 5, we observe that the overall improvement in performance of ARE system over Chieu et al.’02 is 6%.",
        "The trends of results for MUC6 are similar to that in MUC4.",
        "However, there are few important differences.",
        "First, 45% of instances in MUC6 fall into the Simple category, therefore this category dominates.",
        "The reason for this is that the terminologies used in Management Succession domain are more stable in comparison to the Terrorism domain.",
        "Second, there are more anchor types for this case and therefore the promotion strategy is applicable also to the simple case.",
        "Third, there is no improvement in performance for the Hard category.",
        "We believe the primary reason for it is that more stable language patterns are used in MUC6.",
        "Therefore, dependency relations are also more stable in MUC6 and the promotion strategy is not very important.",
        "Similar to MUC4, there are problems of missing anchors and mistakes in dependency parsing."

        "The current state-of-art IE methods tend to use co-occurrence relations for extraction of entities.",

        "In our work, we proposed to utilize dependency relations to tackle these problems.",

        "For each category, we applied specific strategy.",
        "This approach allowed us to outperform the existing state-of-art approaches by 3% on Terrorism domain and 6% on Management Succession domain.",
        "In our future work we plan to investigate the role of semantic relations and integrate ontology in the rule generation process.",
        "Another direction is to explore the use of bootstrapping and transduction approaches that may require less training instances."
