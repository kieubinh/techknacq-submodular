        "In the few last years there has been an increasing interest in shallow semantic parsing of natural language, which is becoming an important component in all kind of NLP applications.",
        "As a particular case, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is currently a well-defined task with a substantial body of work and comparative evaluation.",
        "Given a sentence, the task consists of analyzing the propositions expressed by some target verbs of the sentence.",
        "In particular, for each target verb all the constituents in the sentence which fill a semantic role of the verb have to be recognized.",
        "Typical semantic arguments include Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.",
        "and also adjuncts such as Locative, Temporal, Manner, Cause, etc.",
        "Last year, the CoNLL-2004 shared task aimed at evaluating machine learning SRL systems based only on partial syntactic information.",
        "In (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004) one may find a detailed review of the task and also a brief state-of-the-art on SRL previous to 2004.",
        "Ten systems contributed to the task, which was evaluated using the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "The best results were around 70 in F1 measure.",
        "Though not directly comparable, these figures are substantially lower than the best results published up to date using full parsing as input information (F1 slightly over 79).",
        "In addition to the CoNLL-2004 shared task, another evaluation exercise was conducted in the Senseval-3 workshop (Litkowski, 2004).",
        "Eight systems relying on full parsing information were evaluated in that event using the FrameNet corpus (Fillmore et al., 2001).",
        "From the point of view of learning architectures and study of feature relevance, it is also worth mentioning the following recent works (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Moschitti, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Prad-han et al., 2005a).",
        "Following last year’s initiative, the CoNLL-2005 shared task' will concern again the recognition of semantic roles for the English language.",
        "Compared to the shared task of CoNLL-2004, the novelties introduced in the 2005 edition are:",
        "• Aiming at evaluating the contribution of full parsing in SRL, the complete syntactic trees given by two alternative parsers have been provided as input information for the task.",
        "The rest of input information does not vary and corresponds to the levels of processing treated in the previous editions of the CoNLL shared task, i.e., words, PoS tags, base chunks, clauses, and named entities.",
        "• The training corpus has been substantially enlarged.",
        "This allows to test the scalability of",
        "learning-based SRL systems to big datasets and to compute learning curves to see how much data is necessary to train.",
        "Again, we concentrate on the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005), which is the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn TreeBank corpus enriched with predicate–argument structures.",
        "• In order to test the robustness of the presented systems, a cross-corpora evaluation is performed using a fresh test set from the Brown corpus.",
        "Regarding evaluation, two different settings were devised depending if the systems use the information strictly contained in the training data (closed challenge) or they make use of external sources of information and/or tools (open challenge).",
        "The closed setting allows to compare systems under strict conditions, while the open setting aimed at exploring the contributions of other sources of information and the limits of the current learning-based systems on the SRL task.",
        "At the end, all 19 systems took part in the closed challenge and none of them in the open challenge.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the general setting of the task.",
        "Section 3 provides a detailed description of training, development and test data.",
        "Participant systems are described and compared in section 4.",
        "In particular, information about learning techniques, SRL strategies, and feature development is provided, together with performance results on the development and test sets.",

        "As in the 2004 edition, the goal of the task was to develop a machine learning system to recognize arguments of verbs in a sentence, and label them with their semantic role.",
        "A verb and its set of arguments form a proposition in the sentence, and typically, a sentence contains a number of propositions.",
        "There are two properties that characterize the structure of the arguments in a proposition.",
        "First, arguments do not overlap, and are organized sequentially.",
        "Second, an argument may appear split into a number of non-contiguous phrases.",
        "For instance, in the sentence “[A1 The apple], said John, [C-A1 is on the table]”, the utterance argument (labeled with type A1) appears split into two phrases.",
        "Thus, there is a set of non-overlapping arguments labeled with semantic roles associated with each proposition.",
        "The set of arguments of a proposition can be seen as a chunking of the sentence, in which chunks are parts of the semantic roles of the proposition predicate.",
        "In practice, number of target verbs are marked in a sentence, each governing one proposition.",
        "A system has to recognize and label the arguments of each target verb.",
        "To support the role labeling task, sentences contain input annotations, that consist of syntactic information and named entities.",
        "Section 3 describes in more detail the annotations of the data."

      "heading": "2.1 Evaluation",
      "text": [
        "Evaluation is performed on a collection of unseen test sentences, that are marked with target verbs and contain only predicted input annotations.",
        "A system is evaluated with respect to precision, recall and the F1 measure of the predicted arguments.",
        "Precision (p) is the proportion of arguments predicted by a system which are correct.",
        "Recall (r) is the proportion of correct arguments which are predicted by a system.",
        "Finally, the F1 measure computes the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is the final measure to compare the performance of systems.",
        "It is formulated as: F,3=1 = 2pr/(p + r).",
        "For an argument to be correctly recognized, the words spanning the argument as well as its semantic role have to be correct.",
        "2 As an exceptional case, the verb argument of each proposition is excluded from the evaluation.",
        "This argument is the lexicalization of the predicate of the proposition.",
        "Most of the time, the verb corresponds to the target verb of the proposition, which is provided as input, and only in few cases the verb participant spans more words than the target verb.",
        "Except for non-trivial cases, this situation makes the verb fairly easy to identify and, since there is one verb with each proposition, evaluating its recognition overestimates the overall performance of a system.",
        "For this reason, the verb argument is excluded from evaluation."

        "In the closed challenge, systems have to be built strictly with information contained in the training sections of the TreeBank and PropBank.",
        "Since this collection contains the gold reference annotations of both syntactic and predicate-argument structures, the closed challenge allows: (1) to make use of any preprocessing system strictly developed within this setting, and (2) to learn from scratch any annotation that is contained in the data.",
        "To support the former, the organization provided the output of state-of-the-art syntactic preprocessors, described in Section 3.",
        "The development set is used to tune the parameters of a system.",
        "The gold reference annotations are also available in this set, but only to evaluate the performance of different parametrizations of a system, and select the optimal one.",
        "Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the performance of a system.",
        "It is only allowed to use predicted annotations in this set.",

        "Table 5 summarizes the type of features exploited by systems.",

        "Almost all teams used the heuristics of Collins (1999) to extract the head word of the argument, and used features that capture the form, lemma and PoS tag of the head.",
        "In the same line, some systems also use features of the content words of the argument, using the heuristics of Surdeanu et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Very generally also, many systems extract features from the first and last words of the argument.",
        "Regarding the syntactic elements surrounding the argument, many systems working on full trees have considered the parent and siblings of the argument, capturing their syntactic type and head word.",
        "Differently, other systems have captured features from the left/right tokens surrounding the argument, which are typically words, but can be chunks or general phrases in systems that sequentialize the task (M`arquez et al., 2005; Pradhan et al., 2005b; Mitsumori et al., 2005).",
        "Many systems use a variety of indicator features that capture properties of the argument structure and its local syntactic annotations.",
        "For example, indicators of the immediate syntactic types that form the argument, flags raised by punctuation tokens in or nearby the argument, or the governing category feature of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).",

        "To represent the predicate, all systems have used features codifying the form, lemma, PoS tag and voice of the verb.",
        "It is also of general use the subcategorization feature, capturing the syntactic rule that expands the parent of the predicate.",
        "Some systems captured statistics related to the frequency of a verb in training data (not in Table 5).",
        "Regarding features related to an argument-verb pair, almost all systems use the simple feature describing the relative position between them.",
        "To a lesser degree, systems have computed distances from one to the other, based on the number of words or chunks between them, or based on the syntactic tree.",
        "Not surprisingly, all systems have extracted the path from the argument to the verb.",
        "While almost all systems use the standard path of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), many have explored variations of it.",
        "A common one consists of the path from the argument to the lowest common ancestor of the verb and the argument.",
        "Another variation is the partial path, that is built of chunks and clauses only.",
        "Indicator features that capture scalar values of the path are also common, and concentrate mainly on looking at the common ancestor, capturing the difference of clausal levels, or looking for punctuation and other linguistic elements in the path.",
        "In this category, it is also noticeable the use of the syntacticframe feature, proposed by Xue and Palmer (2004).",
        "Finally, in this edition two systems apply learning at a global context (Haghighi et al., 2005; Sutton and McCallum, 2005) and, consequently, they are able to extract features from a complete labeling of a predicate.",
        "Basically, the central feature in this context extracts the sequential pattern of predicate arguments.",
        "Then, this pattern can be enriched with syntactic categories, broken down into role-specific indicator variables, or conjoined with the predicate lemma.",
        "Apart from basic feature extraction, combination of features has also been explored in this edition.",

        "Their results on the WSJ test equal the best results published so far on this task and datasets (Pradhan et al., 2005a), though they are not directly comparable due to a different setting in defining arguments not perfectly matching the predicted parse constituents.",

        "In order to have a more clear idea of the impact of enriching the syntactic information, we refer to (M`arquez et al., 2005), who developed an individual system based only on partial parsing (“upc” input information).",

        "Comparing the results across development and WSJ test corpora, we find that, with two exceptions, all systems experienced a significant increase in performance (normally between 1 and 2 F1 points).",
