        "Named Entities (NEs) translation is crucial for effective cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and for Machine Translation.",
        "There are many types of NE phrases, such as: person names, organization names, location names, temporal expressions, and names of events.",
        "In this paper we only focus on three categories of NEs: person names, location names and organization names, though the approach is, in principle, general enough to accommodate any entity type.",
        "NE identification has been an area of significant research interest for the last few years.",
        "NE translation, however, remains a largely unstudied problem.",
        "NEs might be phonetically transliterated (e.g. persons names) and might also be mixed between phonetic transliteration and semantic translation as the case with locations and organizations names.",
        "There are three distinct approaches that can be applied for NE translation, namely: a transliteration approach, a word based translation approach and a phrase based translation approach.",
        "The transliteration approach depends on phonetic transliteration and is only appropriate for out of vocabulary and completely unknown words.",
        "For more frequently used words, transliteration does not provide sophisticated results.",
        "A word based approach depends upon traditional statistical machine translation techniques such as IBM Model1 (Brown et al., 1993) and may not always yield satisfactory results due to its inability to handle difficult many-to-many phrase translations.",
        "A phrase based approach could provide a good translation for frequently used NE phrases though it is inefficient for less frequent words.",
        "Each of the approaches has its advantages and disadvantages.",
        "In this paper we introduce an integrated approach for combining phrase based NE translation, word based NE translation, and NE transliteration in a single framework.",
        "Our approach attempts to harness the advantages of the three approaches while avoiding their pitfalls.",
        "We also introduce and evaluate a new approach for aligning NEs across parallel corpora, a process for automatically extracting new NEs translation phrases, and a new transliteration approach.",
        "As is typical for statistical MT, the system requires the availability of general parallel corpus and Named Entity identifiers for the NEs of interest.",
        "Our primary focus in this paper is on translating NEs out of context (i.e. NEs are extracted and translated without any contextual clues).",
        "Although",
        "this is a more difficult problem than translating NEs in context, we adopt this approach because it is more generally useful for CLIR applications.",
        "The paper is organized as follows, section 2 presents related work, section 3 describes our integrated NE translation approach, section 4 presents the word based translation module, the phrase based module, the transliteration module, and system integration and decoding, section 5 provides the experimental setup and results and finally section 6 concludes the paper."

        "We use IBM Model1, as introduced in (Brown et.",
        "al, 1993), with a modified alignment cost.",
        "The cost function has some similarity with the multi-cost aligning approach introduced by Huang (Huang et al.",
        "2003) but it is significantly different.",
        "The cost for aligning any source and target NE word is defined as: C1p(we |wf) 2Ed(we, wf) 3Tag(we,wf) Where: we and wf are the target and source words respectively and1 ,2 and3 are the cost weighting parameters.",
        "The first term p(we |wf) represents the translation log probability of target word (we) given the source word (wf ).",
        "The second term Ed (we, wf) is length-normalized phonetic based edit distance between the two words.",
        "This phonetic-based edit distance employs an Editex style (Zobel and Dart, 1996) distance measure, which groups letters that can result in similar pronunciations, but doesn’t require that the groups be disjoint, and can thus reflect the correspondences between letters with similar pronunciation more accurately.",
        "The Editex distance (d) between two letters a and b is:",
        "= 1 if they are in the same group = 2 otherwise The Editex distance between two words is the summation of Editex distance between their letters and length-normalized edit distance is: where d (we, wf) is the “Editex” style edit distance and max( |we |, |wf |) is the maximum of the two lengths for the source and target, normalizing the edit distance.",
        "The Editex edit distance is deployed between English words and “romanized” Arabic words with a grouping of similar consonants and a grouping of similar vowels.",
        "This helps in identifying the correspondence between rare NEs during the alignment.",
        "For example, consider two rare NE phrases that occur once in the training: “wqd AstdEY wzyr AlxArjyp AlyAbAny nwbwtAkA mA$ymwrA Alsfyr AlSyny wAnj yy ” “Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machi-mura has summoned the Chinese ambassador Wang Yee” Thus the task of the alignment technique is to align :nwbwkAtA Nobutaka : mA$ymwrA Machimura :wAng Wang :yy Yee If a pure Model-1 alignment was used, then the model would have concluded that all words could be aligned to all others with equal probability.",
        "However, the multi-cost alignment technique could align two named entities using a single training sample.",
        "This approach has significant effect in correctly aligning rare NEs.",

        "This two-phase approach filters out the words that might be incorrectly aligned using the single phase alignment techniques.",
        "Thus the alignment accuracy is enhanced; especially for organization names since organization names used to contain many content words.",
