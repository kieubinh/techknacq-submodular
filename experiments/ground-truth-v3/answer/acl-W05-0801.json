        "(2003)), possible phrase translations must first be extracted from word-aligned bilingual text segments.",
        "The standard approach to word alignment makes use of five translation models defined by Brown et al.",
        "(1993), sometimes augmented by an HMM-based model or Och and Ney’s “Model 6” (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The best of these models can produce high accuracy alignments, at least when trained on a large parallel corpus of fairly direct translations in closely related languages.",
        "There are a number of ways in which these standard models are less than ideal, however.",
        "The higher-accuracy models are mathematically complex, and also difficult to train, as they do not factor in a way that permits a dynamic programming solution.",
        "It can thus take many hours of processing time on current standard computers to train the models and produce an alignment of a large parallel corpus.",
        "In this paper, we take a different approach to word alignment, based on the use of bilingual word-association statistics rather than the generative probabilistic framework that the IBM and HMM models use.",
        "In the end we obtain alignment algorithms that are much faster, and in some ways simpler, whose accuracy comes surprisingly close to the established probabilistic generative approach."

        "The trial and test data have been manually aligned at the word level, noting particular pairs of words either as “sure” or “possible” alignments.",

        "We needed annotated development data to optimize certain parameters of our algorithms, and we were concerned that the small number of sentence pairs designated as trial data would not be enough for this purpose.",
        "We therefore randomly split each of the English-French and English-Romanian test data sets into two virtually equal subsets, by randomly ordering the test data pairs, and assigning alternate pairs from the random order to the two subsets.",

        "The conventional wisdom in the statistical MT community has been that “heuristic” alignment methods based on word association statistics could not be competitive with methods that have a “well-founded mathematical theory that underlies their parameter estimation” (Och and Ney, 2003, p. 37).",
        "Our results seem to suggest that this is not the case.",
        "While we would not claim to have demonstated that association-based methods are superior to the established approach, they certainly now appear to be worth investigating further.",
        "Moreover, our alignment method is faster than standard models to train; potentially much faster if it were reimplemented in a language like C++.",
        "Efficiency issues, especially in training, are often dismissed as unimportant, but one should consider simply the number of experiments that it is possible to do in the course of system development.",
        "In our case, for example, it was impractical to try to try to optimize all the options and parameters of the Giza++ models in a reasonable amount of time, given the computational resources at our disposal.",
        "While the wealth of details regarding various passes through the data in our best methods might seem to undercut our claim of simplicity, it is important to realize that each of our methods makes a fixed number of passes, and each of those passes involves a simple procedure of computing LLR scores, collecting co-occurrence counts to estimate link probabilities, or performing competitive linking; plus one best first search for minimally nonmonotonic alignments.",
        "All these procedures are simple to understand and straightforward to implement, in contrast to some of the difficult mathematical and computational issues with the standard models."
