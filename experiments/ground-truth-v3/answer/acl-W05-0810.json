        "When efficient techniques have been proposed (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003), they have been mostly evaluated on ”safe” pairs of languages where the notion of word is rather clear.",
        "We devoted two weeks to the intriguing task of aligning at the word level pairs of sentences of English and Inuktitut.",
        "We experimented with two different approaches.",
        "For the first one, we relied on an in-house sentence alignment program (JAPA) where English and Inuktitut tokens were considered as sentences.",
        "The second approach we propose takes advantage of associations computed between any English word and roughly any subsequence of Inuktitut characters seen in the training corpus.",

      "text": [
        "To adjust our systems, the organizers made available to the participants a set of 25 pairs of sentences where words had been manually aligned.",
        "A fast inspection of this material reveals that in most of the cases, the alignment produced are monotonic and involve cepts of n adjacent English words aligned to a single Inuktitut word.",
        "Many sentence alignment techniques strongly rely on the monotonic nature of the inherent alignment.",
        "Therefore, we conducted a first experiment using an in-house sentence alignment program called JAPA that we developed within the framework of the Arcade evaluation campaign (Langlais et al., 1998).",
        "The implementation details of this aligner can be found in (Langlais, 1997), but in a few words, JAPA aligns pairs of sentences by first grossly aligning their words (making use of either cognate-like tokens, or a specified bilingual dictionary).",
        "A second pass aligns the sentences in a way similar1 to the algorithm described by Gale and Church (1993), but where the search space is constrained to be close to the one delimited by the word alignment.",
        "This technique happened to be among the most accurate of the ones tested during the Arcade exercise.",
        "To adapt JAPA to our needs, we only did two things.",
        "First, we considered single sentences as documents, and tokens as sentences (we define a token as a sequence of characters delimited by",
        "patterns observed on the development set.",
        "A total of 24 different patterns have been observed.",
        "white space).",
        "Second, since in its default setting, JAPA only considers nm sentence-alignment patterns with n, m E [0, 2], we provided it with a new pattern distribution we computed from the development corpus (see Table 1).",
        "It is interesting to note that although English and Inuktitut have very different word systems, the length ratio (in characters) of the two sides of the TRAIN corpus is 1.05.",
        "Each pair of documents (sentences) were then aligned separately with JAPA.",
        "1-n and n-1 alignments identified by JAPA where output without further processing.",
        "Since the word alignment format of the shared task do not account directly for nm alignments (n, m > 1) we generated the cartesian product of the two sets of words for all these nm alignments produced by JAPA.",
        "The performance of this approach is reported in Table 2.",
        "Clearly, the precision is poor.",
        "This is partly explained by the cartesian product we resorted to when nm alignments were produced by JAPA.",
        "We provide in section 4 a way of improving upon this scenario.",
