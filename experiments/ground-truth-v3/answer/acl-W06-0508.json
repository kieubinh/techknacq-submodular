        "Semantic relations extracted from texts are useful for several applications, including question answering, information retrieval, semantic web annotation, and construction and extension of lexical resources and ontologies.",
        "In this paper we present an approach for relation extraction developed to semantically annotate relational knowledge coming from raw text, within a framework aiming to automatically acquire high quality semantic metadata for the Semantic Web.",
        "In that framework, applications such as semantic web portals (Lei et al., 2006) analyze data from texts, databases, domain ontologies, and knowledge bases in order to extract the semantic knowledge in an integrated way.",
        "Known entities occurring in the text, i.e., entities that are included in the knowledge base, are semantically annotated with their properties, also provided by the knowledge base and by databases.",
        "New entities, as given by a named entity recognition system according to the possible types of entities in the ontology, are annotated without any additional information.",
        "In this context, the goal of the relation extraction approach presented here is to extract relational knowledge about entities, i.e., to identify the semantic relations between pairs of entities in the input texts.",
        "Entities can be both known and new, since named entity recognition is also carried out.",
        "Relations include those already existent in the knowledge base, new relations predicted as possible by the domain ontology, or completely new (unpredicted) relations.",
        "The approach makes use of a domain ontology, a knowledge base, and lexical databases, along with knowledge-based and empirical resources and strategies for linguistic processing.",
        "These include a lemmatizer, syntactic parser, part-of-speech tagger, named entity recognition system, and pattern matching and word sense disambiguation models.",
        "The input data used in the experiments with our approach consists of English texts from the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi)1 newsletters.",
        "We believe that by integrating corpus and knowledge-based techniques and using rich linguistic processing strategies in a completely automated fashion, the approach can achieve effective results, in terms of both accuracy and coverage.",
        "With relational knowledge, a richer representation of the input data can be produced.",
        "Moreover, by identifying new entities, the relation extraction approach can also be applied to ontology population.",
        "Finally, since it extracts new relations, it can also be used as a first step for ontology learning.",
        "In the remaining of this paper we first describe some cognate work on relation extraction, particularly those exploring empirical methods, for various applications (Section 2).",
        "We then present",
        "our approach, showing its architecture and describing each of its main components (Section 3).",

        "Recently, they have focused on the use of supervised or unsupervised corpus-based techniques in order to automate the task.",
        "A very common approach is based on pattern matching, with patterns composed by subject-verb-object (SVO) tuples.",
        "Interesting work has been done on the unsupervised automatic detection of relations from a small number of seed patterns.",
        "These are used as a starting point to bootstrap the pattern learning process, by means of semantic similarity measures (Yangarber, 2000; Stevenson, 2004).",
        "Most of the approaches for relation extraction rely on the mapping of syntactic dependencies, such as SVO, onto semantic relations, using either pattern matching or other strategies, such as probabilistic parsing for trees augmented with annotations for entities and relations (Miller et al., 2000), or clustering of semantically similar syntactic dependencies, according to their selectional restrictions (Gamallo et al., 2002).",
        "In corpus-based approaches, many variations are found concerning the machine learning techniques used to produce classifiers to judge relation as relevant or non-relevant.",
        "(Roth and Yih, 2002), e.g., use probabilistic classifiers with constraints induced between relations and entities, such as selectional restrictions.",
        "Based on instances represented by a pair of entities and their position in a shallow parse tree, (Zelenko et al., 2003) use support vector machines and voted perceptron algorithms with a specialized kernel model.",
        "Also using kernel methods and support vector machines, (Zhao and Grishman, 2005) combine clues from different levels of syntactic information and applies composite kernels to integrate the individual kernels.",
        "Similarly to our proposal, the framework presented by (Iria and Ciravegna, 2005) aims at the automation of semantic annotations according to ontologies.",
        "Several supervised algorithms can be used on the training data represented through a canonical graph-based data model.",
        "The framework includes a shallow linguistic processing step, in which corpora are analyzed and a representation is produced according to the data model, and a classification step, where classifiers run on the datasets produced by the linguistic processing step.",
        "Several relation extraction approaches have been proposed focusing on the task of ontology learning (Reinberger and Spyns, 2004; Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005; Ciaramita et al., 2005).",
        "More comprehensive reviews can be found in (Maedche, 2002) and (Gomez-Perez and Man-zano-Macho, 2003).",
        "These approaches aim to learn non-taxonomic relations between concepts, instead of lexical items.",
        "However, in essence, they can employ similar techniques to extract the relations.",
        "Additional strategies can be applied to determine whether the relations can be lifted from lexical items to concepts, as well as to determine the most appropriate level of abstraction to describe a relation (e.g. Maedche, 2002).",
        "In the next section we describe our relation extraction approach, which merges features that have shown to be effective in several of the previous works, in order to achieve more comprehensive and accurate results."
