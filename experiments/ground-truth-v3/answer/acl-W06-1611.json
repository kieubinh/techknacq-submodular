        "Predictive models of spoken dialogue system (SDS) performance are an important tool for researchers and practitioners in the SDS domain.",
        "These models offer insights on what factors are important for the success of a SDS and allow researchers to assess the performance of future system improvements without running additional costly user experiments.",
        "One of the most popular models of performance is the PARADISE framework proposed by (Walker et al., 2000).",
        "In PARADISE, a set of interaction parameters are measured in a SDS corpus, and then used in a multivariate linear regression to predict the target performance metric.",
        "A critical ingredient in this approach is the relevance of the interaction parameters for the SDS success.",
        "A number of parameters that measure the dialogue efficiency (e.g. number of system/user turns, task duration) and the dialogue quality (e.g. recognition accuracy, rejections, helps) have been shown to be successful in (Walker et al., 2000).",
        "An extensive set of parameters can be found in (Möller, 2005a).",
        "In this paper we study the utility of discourse structure as an information source for SDS performance analysis.",
        "The discourse structure hierarchy has been shown to be useful for other tasks: understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Levow, 2004), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al., 2001), and essay scoring (Higgins et al., 2004).",
        "We perform our analysis on a corpus of speech-based tutoring dialogues.",
        "A tutoring SDS (Litman and Silliman, 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2004) has to discuss concepts, laws and relationships and to engage in complex subdialogues to correct student misconceptions.",
        "As a result, dialogues with such systems have a rich discourse structure.",
        "We perform three experiments to measure three ways of exploiting the discourse structure.",
        "In our first experiment, we test the predictive utility of the discourse structure in itself.",
        "For example, we look at whether the number of pop-up transitions in the discourse structure hierarchy predicts performance in our system.",
        "The second experiment measures the utility of the discourse structure as contextual information for two types of student states: correctness and certainty.",
        "The intuition behind this experiment is that interaction events should be treated differently based on their position in the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "For example, we test if the number of incorrect answers after a pop-up transition has a higher predictive utility than the total number of incorrect student answers.",
        "In contrast, the majority of the previous work either ignores this contextual information (Möller, 2005a; Walker et al., 2000) or makes limited use of the",
        "discourse structure hierarchy by flattening it (Walker et al., 2001) (Section 5).",
        "As another way to exploit the discourse structure, in our third experiment we look at whether specific trajectories in the discourse structure are indicative of performance.",
        "For example, we test if two consecutive pushes in the discourse structure are correlated with higher learning.",
        "To measure the predictive utility of our interaction parameters, we focus primarily on correlations with our performance metric (Section 4).",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "First, a significant correlation between an interaction parameter and the performance metric is a good indicator of the parameter’s relevance for PARADISE modeling.",
        "Second, correlations between factors and the performance metric are commonly used in tutoring research to analyze the tutoring/learning process (Chi et al., 2001).",
        "Our correlation and PARADISE results show that, while the discourse structure is not useful in isolation, using the discourse structure as context information for other factors or via trajectories produces highly predictive parameters for performance analysis."

        "Our annotation for discourse structure and student state has been performed on a corpus of 95 experimentally obtained spoken tutoring dialogues between 20 students and our system ITSPOKE (Litman and Silliman, 2004).",
        "ITSPOKE is a speech-enabled version of the text-based Why2-Atlas conceptual physics tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2002).",
        "When interacting with ITSPOKE, students first type an essay answering a qualitative physics problem using a graphical user interface.",
        "ITSPOKE then engages the student in spoken dialogue (using head-mounted microphone input and speech output) to correct misconceptions and elicit more complete explanations, after which the student revises the essay, thereby ending the tutoring or causing another round of tutoring/essay revision.",
        "Each student went through the same procedure: 1) read a short introductory material, 2) took a pretest to measure the initial physics knowledge, 3) work through a set of 5 problems with ITSPOKE, and 4) took a posttest similar to the pretest.",

        "We base our annotation of discourse structure on the Grosz & Sidner theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "A critical ingredient of this theory is the intentional structure.",
        "According to the theory, each discourse has a discourse purpose/intention.",
        "Satisfying the main discourse purpose is achieved by satisfying several smaller purposes/intentions organized in a hierarchical structure.",
        "As a result, the discourse is segmented in discourse segments each with an associated discourse segment purpose/intention.",
        "This theory has inspired several generic dialogue managers for spoken dialogue systems (Bohus and Rud-nicky, 2003).",
        "We automate our annotation of the discourse structure by taking advantage of the structure of the tutored information.",
        "A dialogue with ITSPOKE follows a question-answer format (i.e. system initiative): ITSPOKE asks a question, the student provides the answer and then the process is repeated.",
        "Deciding what question to ask, in what order and when to stop is hand-authored beforehand in a hierarchical structure that resembles the discourse segment structure (see Figure 1).",
        "Tutor questions are grouped in segments which correspond roughly to the discourse segments.",
        "Similarly to the discourse segment purpose, each question segment has an associated tutoring goal or purpose.",
        "For example, in",
        "ITSPOKE there are question segments discussing about forces acting on the objects, others discussing about objects’ acceleration, etc.",
        "In Figure 1 we illustrate ITSPOKE’s behavior and our discourse structure annotation.",
        "First, based on the analysis of the student essay, ITSPOKE selects a question segment to correct misconceptions or to elicit more complete explanations.",
        "This question segment will correspond to the top level discourse segment (e.g. DS1).",
        "Next, ITSPOKE asks the student each question in DS 1.",
        "If the student answer is correct, the system moves on to the next question (e.g. Tutor1 – >Tutor2).",
        "If the student answer is incorrect, there are two alternatives.",
        "For simple questions, the system will simply give out the correct answer and move on to the next question (e.g. Tutor3 – >Tutor4).",
        "For complex questions (e.g. applying physics laws), ITSPOKE will engage into a remediation subdialogue that attempts to reme-diate the student’s lack of knowledge or skills.",
        "The remediation subdialogue is specified in another question segment and corresponds to a new discourse segment (e.g DS2).",
        "The new discourse segment is dominated by the current discourse segment (e.g. DS2 dominated by DS1).",
        "Tutor2 system turn is a typical example; if the student answers it incorrectly, ITSPOKE will enter discourse segment DS2 and go through its questions (Tutor3 and Tutor4).",
        "Once all the questions in DS2 have been answered, a heuristic determines whether ITSPOKE should ask the original question again (Tutor2) or simply move on to the next question (Tutor5).",
        "To compute interaction parameters from the discourse structure, we focus on the transitions in the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "For each system turn we define a transition feature.",
        "This feature captures the position in the discourse structure of the current system turn relative to the previous system turn.",
        "We define six labels (see Table 1).",
        "NewTopLevel label is used for the first question after an essay submission (e.g. Tutor1).",
        "If the previous question is at the same level with the current question we label the current question as Advance (e.g. Tutor2,4).",
        "The first question in a remediation subdialogue is labeled as Push (e.g. Tutor3).",
        "After a remediation subdialogue is completed, ITSPOKE will pop up and it will either ask the original question again or move on to the next question.",
        "In the first case, we label the system turn as PopUp.",
        "Please note that Tutor2 will not be labeled with PopUp because, in such cases, an extra system turn will be created between Tutor4 and Tutor5 with the same content as Tutor2.",
        "In addition, variations of “Ok, back to the original question” are also included in the new system turn to mark the discourse segment boundary transition.",
        "If the system moves on to the next question after finishing the remediation subdialogue, we label the system turn as PopUpAdv (e.g. Tutor5).",
        "Note that while the sum of PopUp and PopUpAdv should be equal with Push, it is smaller in our corpus because in some cases ITSPOKE popped up more than one level in the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "In case of rejections, the system question is repeated using variations of “Could you please repeat that?”.",
        "We label such cases as SameGoal (e.g. Tutor6).",
        "Please note that each student dialogue has a specific discourse structure based on the dialogue that dynamically emerges based on the correctness of her answers.",
        "For this reason, the same system question in terms of content may get a different transition label for different students.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, if the student would have answered Tutor2 correctly, the next tutor turn would have had the same content as Tutor5 but the Advance label.",
        "Also, while a human annotation of the discourse structure will be more complex but more time consuming (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Levow, 2004), its advantages are outweighed by the automatic nature of our discourse structure annotation.",
        "We would like to highlight that our transition annotation is domain independent and automatic.",
        "Our transition labels capture behavior like starting a new dialogue (NewTopLevel), crossing discourse segment boundaries (Push, PopUp, PopUpAdv) and local phenomena inside a discourse segment (Advance, SameGoal).",

        "transition information can be automatically computed using the procedure described above."

        "Since our training data is relatively small (20 data points) and overfitting might be involved here, in the future we plan to do a more in-depth evaluation by testing if our model generalizes on a larger ITSPOKE corpus we are currently annotating."

        "Previous work has proposed a large number of interaction parameters for SDS performance modeling (Möller, 2005a; Walker et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2001).",
        "Several information sources are being tapped to devise parameters classified by (Möller, 2005a) in several categories: dialogue and communication parameters (e.g. dialogue duration, number of system/user turns), speech input parameters (e.g. word error rate, recognition/concept accuracy) and meta-communication parameters (e.g. number of help request, cancel requests, corrections).",
        "But most of these parameters do not take into account the discourse structure information.",
        "A notable exception is the DATE dialogue act annotation from (Walker et al., 2001).",
        "The DATE annotation captures information on three dimensions: speech acts (e.g. acknowledge, confirm), conversation domain (e.g. conversation versus task-related) and the task model (e.g. subtasks like getting the date, time, origin, and destination).",
        "All these parameters can be linked to the discourse structure but flatten the discourse structure.",
        "Moreover, the most informative of these parameters (the task model parameters) are domain dependent.",
        "Similar approximations of the discourse structure are also common for other SDS tasks like predictive models of speech recognition problems (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004).",
        "We extend over previous work in several areas.",
        "First, we exploit in more detail the hierarchical information in the discourse structure.",
        "We quantify this information by recording the discourse structure transitions.",
        "Second, in contrast to previous work, our usage of discourse structure is domain independent (the transitions).",
        "Third, we exploit the discourse structure as a contextual information source.",
        "To our knowledge, previous work has not employed parameters similar with our transition–student state bi",
        "gram parameters.",
        "Forth, via the transition– transition bigram parameters, we exploit trajectories in the discourse structure as another domain independent source of information for performance modeling.",
        "Finally, similar to (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006), we are tackling a more problematic performance metric: the student learning gain.",
        "While the requirements for a successful information access SDS are easier to spell out, the same can not be said about tutoring SDS due to the current limited understanding of the human learning process."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this paper we highlight the role of discourse structure for SDS performance modeling.",
        "We experiment with various ways of using the discourse structure: in isolation, as context information for other factors (correctness and certainty) and through trajectories in the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "Our correlation and PARADISE results show that, while the discourse structure is not useful in isolation, using the discourse structure as context information for other factors or via trajectories produces highly predictive parameters for performance analysis.",
        "Moreover, the PARADISE framework selects in the final model only discourse-based parameters ignoring parameters that do not use the discourse structure (certainty and correctness unigrams are ignored).",
        "Our significant correlations also suggest ways we should modify our system.",
        "For example, the PopUp–Incorrect negative correlations suggest that after a failed learning opportunity the system should not give out the correct answer but engage in a secondary remediation subdialogue specially tailored for these situations.",
        "In the future, we plan to test the generality of our PARADISE model on other corpora and to compare models built using our interaction parameters against models based on parameters commonly used in previous work (Möller, 2005a).",
        "Testing if our results generalize to a human annotation of the discourse structure and automated models of certainty and correctness is also of importance.",
        "We also want to see if our results hold for performance metrics based on user satisfaction questionnaires; in the new ITSPOKE corpus we are currently annotating, each student also completed a user satisfaction survey (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006) similar to the one used in the DARPA Communicator multi-site evaluation (Walker et al., 2002).",
        "Our work contributes to both the computational linguistics domain and the tutoring domain.",
        "For the computational linguistics research community, we show that discourse structure is an important information source for SDS performance modeling.",
        "Our analysis can be extended easily to other SDS.",
        "First, a similar automatic annotation of the discourse structure can be performed in SDS that rely on dialogue managers inspired by the Grosz & Sidner theory of discourse (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003).",
        "Second, the transition–transition bigram parameters are domain independent.",
        "Finally, for the other successful usage of discourse structure (transition– student state bigrams) researchers have only to identify relevant factors and then combine them with the discourse structure information.",
        "In our case, we show that instead of looking at the user state in isolation (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006), combining it with the discourse structure transition can generate informative interaction parameters.",
        "For the tutoring research community, we show that discourse structure, an important concept in computational linguistics theory, can provide useful insights regarding the learning process.",
        "The correlations we observe in our corpus have intuitive interpretations (successful/failed learning opportunities, discovery of deep student knowledge gaps, providing relevant tutoring)."
