        "In psycholinguistics, priming refers to the fact that speakers prefer to reuse recently encountered linguistic material.",
        "Priming effects typically manifest themselves in shorter processing times or higher usage frequencies for reused material compared to non-reused material.",
        "These effects are attested both in language comprehension and in language production.",
        "Structural priming occurs when a speaker repeats a syntactic decision, and has been demonstrated in numerous experiments over the past two decades (e.g., Bock, 1986; Branigan et al., 2000).",
        "These experimental findings show that subjects are more likely to choose, e.g., a passive voice construction if they have previously comprehended or produced such a construction.",
        "Recent studies have used syntactically annotated corpora to investigate structural priming.",
        "The results have demonstrated the existence of priming effects in corpus data: they occur for specific syntactic constructions (Gries, 2005; Szmrecsanyi, 2005), consistent with the experimental literature, but also generalize to syntactic rules across the board, which repeated more often than expected by chance (Reitter et al., 2006b; Dubey et al., 2006).",
        "In the present paper, we build on this corpus-based approach to priming, but focus on the role of the underlying syntactic representations.",
        "In particular, we use priming to evaluate claims resulting from a particular syntactic theory, which is a way of testing the representational assumptions it makes.",
        "Using priming effects to inform syntactic theory is a novel idea; previous corpus-based priming studies have simply worked with uncontroversial classes of constructions (e.g., passive/active).",
        "The contribution of this paper is to overcome this limitation by defining a computational model of priming with a clear interface to a particular syntactic framework.",
        "The general assumption we make is that priming is a phenomenon relating to grammatical constituents â€“ these constituents determine the syntactic choices whose repetition can lead to priming.",
        "Crucially, grammatical frameworks differ in the grammatical constituents they assume, and therefore predict different sets of priming effects.",
        "We require the following ingredients to pursue this approach: a syntactic theory that identifies a set of constituents, a corpus of linguistic data annotated according to that syntactic theory, and a statistical model that estimates the strength of priming based on a set of external factors.",
        "We can then derive predictions for the influence of these factors from the syntactic theory, and test them using the statistical model.",
        "In this paper, we use regression models to quantify structural priming effects and to verify predictions made by Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, Steedman (2000)), a syntactic framework that has the theoretical potential to elegantly explain some of the phenomena discovered in priming experiments.",
        "CCG is distinguished from most other grammatical theories by the fact that its rules are type-dependent, rather than structure-dependent like classical transformations.",
        "Such rules adhere strictly to the constituent condition on rules, i.e., they apply to and yield constituents.",
        "Moreover, the syntactic types that determine the applicability of rules in derivations are transparent to (i.e., are determined, though not necessarily uniquely, by) the semantic types that they are associated with.",
        "As a consequence, syntactic types are more expressive and more numerous than standard parts of speech: there are around 500 highly frequent CCG types, against the standard 50 or so Penn Treebank POS tags.",
        "As we will see below, these properties allow CCG to discard a number of traditional assumptions concerning surface constituency.",
        "They also allow us to make a number of testable predictions concerning priming effects, most importantly (a) that priming effects are type-driven and independent of derivation, and, as a corollary; (b) that lexical and derived constituents of the same type can prime each other.",
        "These effects are not expected under more traditional views of priming as structure-dependent.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the relationship between structural priming and CCG, which leads to a set of specific predictions, detailed in Section 3.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present the methodology employed to test these predictions, describing the corpus data and the statistical analysis used.",
        "Section 6 then presents the results of three experiments that deal with priming of lexical vs. phrasal categories, priming in incremental vs. normal form derivations, and frequency effects in priming.",
        "Section 7 provides a discussion of the implications of these findings."

        "Previous studies of structural priming (Bock, 1986; Branigan et al., 2000) have made few theoretical assumptions about syntax, regardless of whether the studies were based on planned experiments or corpora.",
        "They leverage the fact that alternations such as He gave Raquel the car keys vs.",
        "He gave the car keys to Raquel are nearly equivalent in semantics, but differ in their syntactic structure (double object vs. prepositional object).",
        "In such experiments, subjects are first exposed to a prime, i.e., they have to comprehend or produce either the double object or the prepositional object structure.",
        "In the subsequent trial, the target, they are the free to produce or comprehend either of the two structures, but they tend to prefer the one that has been primed.",

        "The size of the priming effect is then estimated as the difference between the repetition probability close to the prime and far away from the prime.",
        "This is a way of factoring out chance repetition (which is required if we do not deal with syntactic alternations).",

        "Lexical repetition makes repetition on the syntactic level more likely.",
        "For instance, suppose we have two verbal phrases (prime, target) produced only a few seconds apart.",
        "Priming means that the target is more likely to assume the same syntactic form (e.g., a passive) as the prime.",
        "Furthermore, if the head verbs in prime and target are identical, experiments have demonstrated a stronger priming effect.",
        "This effect seems to indicate that lexical and syntactic representations in the grammar share the same information (e.g., subcategorization information), and therefore these representations can prime each other.",
        "Consequently, we treat subcategorization as coterminous with syntactic type, rather than as a feature exclusively associated with lexemes.",
        "Such types determine the context of a lexeme or phrase, and are determined by derivation.",
        "Such an analysis is exactly what categorial grammars suggest.",
        "The rich set of syntactic types that categories afford may be just sufficient to describe all and only",
        "the units that can show priming effects during syntactic processing.",
        "That is to say that syntactic priming is categorial type -priming, rather than structural priming.",
        "Consistent with this view, Pickering and Branigan (1998) assume that morphosyntactic features such as tense, aspect or number are represented independently from combinatorial properties which specify the contextual requirements of a lexical item.",
        "Property groups are represented centrally and shared between lexicon entries, so that they may â€“ separately â€“ prime each other.",
        "For example, the pre-nominal adjective red in the red book primes other pre-nominal adjectives, but not a post-nominal relative clause (the book thatâ€™s red) (Cleland and Pickering, 2003; Scheepers, 2003).",
        "However, if a lexical item can prime a phrasal constituent of the same type, and vice versa, then a type-driven grammar formalism like CCG can provide a simple account of the effect, because lexical and derived syntactic types have the same combinatory potential, which is completely specified by the type, whereas in structure-driven theories, this information is only implicitly given in the derivational process."

        "5, t â€“ d + 0.5] in which a priming instance of the same category could occur.",
        "If it occurred at least once, the data point was counted as a possible example of priming (response variable: true), otherwise it was included as a counterexample (response variable: false).",
        "For the target category, its type (lexical or phrasal) was clear.",
        "For the category of the prime, we included two data points, one for each type, with a response indicating whether a prime of the category of such a type occurred in the time window.",
        "We built separate models for incremental and normal form derivations.",
        "Models were fitted to a balanced subset, including all repetitions and a randomly sampled subset of non-repetitions.",

        "STRUCTURALLEVEL has a significant influence on priming strength (LN DIST) for the cases where a lexical item serves as prime (e.g., normal-form PP: Î²lnDist:lex â€“ lex = 0.261, p < 0.0001; Î²lnDist:lex â€“ phr = 0.166, p < 0.0001; Î²lnDist:phr â€“ lex = 0.056,p < 0.05; as compared to the baseline phr â€“ phr.",

        "Figure 3 presents the resulting effect sizes.",
        "Albeit significant, we assume the effect ofprime type is attributable to processing differences rather than the strong difference that would indicate that there is no priming of, e.g., lexical subcategorization frames.",
        "As the analysis of effect sizes shows, we can see priming from and in between both lexical and phrasal categories.",
        "Additionally, there is no evidence suggesting that, once frequency is taken into account, syntactic processes happening high up in derivation trees show more priming (see Scheepers 2003)."

        "We can confirm the syntactic priming effect for CCG categories.",
        "Priming occurs in incremental as well as in normal-form CCG derivations, and at different syntactic levels in those derivations: we demonstrated that priming effects persists across syntactic stages, from the lowest one (lexical categories) up to higher ones (phrasal categories).",
        "This is what CCG predicts if priming of categories is assumed.",
        "Linguistic data is inherently noisy.",
        "Annotations contain errors, and conversions such as the one to CCG may add further error.",
        "However, since noise is distributed across the corpus, it is unlikely to affect priming effect strength or its interaction with the factors we used: priming, in this study, is defined as decay of repetition probability.",
        "We see the lack of control in the collection of a corpus like Switchboard not only as a challenge, but also as an advantage: it means that realistic data is present in the corpus, allowing us to conduct a controlled experiments to validate a claim about a specific theory of competence grammar.",
        "The fact that CCG categories prime could be explained in a model that includes a basic form of subcategorization.",
        "All categories, if lexical or phrasal, contain a subcategorization frame, with only those categories present that have yet to be satisfied.",
        "Our CCG based models make predictions for experimental studies, e.g., that specific heads with open subcategorization slots (such as transitive verbs) will be primed by phrases that require the same kinds of arguments (such as verbal phrases with a ditransitive verb and an argument).",
        "The models presented take the frequency of the syntactic category into account, reducing noise, especially in the conditions with lower numbers of (positive) reptition examples (e.g., CP and incremental derivations in Experiment 1).",
        "Whether there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences of PP and CP priming with respect to choice of derivation type â€“ which would point out processing differences in comprehension vs. production priming â€“ will be a matter of future work.",
        "At this point, we do not explicitly discriminate different syntactic frameworks.",
        "Comparing priming effects in a corpus annotated in parallel according to different theories will be a matter of future work."
