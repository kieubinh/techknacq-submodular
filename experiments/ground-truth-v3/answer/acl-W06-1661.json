        "This paper describes the application of several different statistical models for the task of realization ranking in tactical generation, i.e. the problem of choosing among multiple paraphrases that are generated for a given meaning representation.",
        "The specific realization component we use is the open-source chart generator of the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB; Carroll, Copestake, Flickinger, & Poznanski, 1999; Carroll & Oepen, 2005).",
        "Given a meaning representation in the form of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Malouf, Riehemann, & Sag, 1995), the generator outputs English realizations in accordance with the HPSG LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger, 2002).",
        "As an example of generator output, a subset of alternate realizations that are produced for a single input MRS is shown in Figure 1.",
        "For the two data sets considered in this paper, the average number of realizations produced by the generator is 85.7 and 102.2 (the maximum numbers are 4176 and 3408, respectively).",
        "Thus, there is immediate demand for a principled way of choosing a single output among the generated candidates.",
        "For this task we train and test three different statistical models: an n-gram language model,",
        "a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and a (linear) support vector machine (SVM).",
        "These are all models that have proved popular within the NLP community, but it is usually only the first of these three that has been applied to the task of ranking in sentence generation.",
        "The latter two models that we present here go beyond the surface information used by then-gram model, and are trained on a symmetric treebank with features defined over the full HPSG analyses of competing realizations.",
        "Furthermore, such discriminative models are suitable for ‘on-line’ use within our generator – adopting the technique of selective unpacking from a packed forest (Carroll & Oepen, 2005) – which means our hybrid realizer obviates the need for exhaustive enumeration of candidate outputs.",
        "The present results extend our earlier work (Velldal, Oepen, & Flickinger, 2004) – and the related work of Nakanishi, Miyao, & Tsu-jii (2005) – to an enlarged data set, more feature types, and additional learners.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 first gives a general summary of the various statistical models we will be considering, as well as the measures used for evaluating them.",
        "We then go on to define the task we are aiming to solve in terms of treebank data and feature types in Section 3.",
        "By looking at different variants of the MaxEnt model we review some results for the relative contribution of individual features and the impact of frequency cutoffs for feature selection.",
        "Keeping these parameters constant then, Section 4 provides an array of empirical results on the relative performance of the various approaches."

        "Finally, Table 7 breaks down per-item exact match errors for three distinct ranking configurations, viz. the BNC LM only, the structural MaxEnt model only, and the combined MaxEnt model, which includes the LM probability as an additional feature; all numbers are for application to the held-out ‘Rondane’ test set.",
        "Further contrasting the first two of these, the BNC LM yields 129 unique errors, in the sense that the structural MaxEnt makes the correct predictions on these items, contrasted to 98 unique errors in the structural MaxEnt model.",
        "When compared to the only 124 errors made equally by both rankers, we conclude that the different approaches have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses.",
        "This observation is confirmed in the relatively substantial improvement in ranking performance of the combined model on the ‘Rondane’ test: The exact match accuracies of then-gram model, the basic MaxEnt model and the combined model are 54.19%, 59.43% and 64.28%, respectively."

        "Applying three alternate statistical models to the realization ranking task, we found that discriminative models with access to structural information substantially outperform the traditional language model approach.",
        "Using comparatively small amounts of annotated training data, we were able to boost ranking performance from around 54% to more than 72%, albeit for a limited, reasonably coherent domain and genre.",
        "The incremental addition of feature templates into the MaxEnt model suggests a trend of diminishing return, most likely due to increasing overlap in the portion of the problem space captured across templates, and possibly reflecting limitations in the amount of training data.",
        "The comparison of the MaxEnt and SVM rankers suggest comparable performance on our task, not showing statistically significant differences.",
        "Nevertheless, in terms of scalability when using large data sets, it seems clear that the MaxEnt framework is a more practical and manageable alternative, both in terms of training time and memory requirements.",
        "As further work we would like to try to train an SVM that takes full advantage of the ranking potential of the set-up described in (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Instead of just making binary (right/wrong) distinctions, we could grade the realizations in the training data according to their WA scores toward the references and try to learn a similar ranking.",
        "So far we have only been able to do preliminary experiments with this set-up on a small subset of the data.",
        "When evaluated with the accuracy measures used in this paper the results were not as good as those obtained when training with only two ranks, however this might very well look different if we evaluate the full rankings (e.g. number of swapped pairs) instead of just focusing on the top ranked candidates.",
        "Note that it is also possible to use such graded training data with the MaxEnt models, by letting the probabilities of the empirical distribution be based on similarity scores such as WA instead of frequencies."
