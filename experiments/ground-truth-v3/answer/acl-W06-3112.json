        "Since their appearance, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) have been the standard tools used for evaluating the quality of machine translation.",
        "They both score candidate translations on the basis of the number of n-grams it shares with one or more reference translations provided.",
        "Such automatic measures are indispensable in the development of machine translation systems, because they allow the developers to conduct frequent, cost-effective, and fast evaluations of their evolving models.",
        "These advantages come at a price, though: an automatic comparison of n-grams measures only the string similarity of the candidate translation to one or more reference strings, and will penalize any divergence from them.",
        "In effect, a candidate translation expressing the source meaning accurately and fluently will be given a low score if the lexical choices and syntactic structure it contains, even though perfectly legitimate, are not present in at least one of the references.",
        "Necessarily, this score would not reflect a much more favourable human judgment that such a translation would receive.",
        "The limitations of string comparison are the reason why it is advisable to provide multiple references for a candidate translation in the BLEU- or NIST-based evaluation in the first place.",
        "While (Zhang and Vogel, 2004) argue that increasing the size of the test set gives even more reliable system scores than multiple references, this still does not solve the inadequacy of BLEU and NIST for sentence-level or small set evaluation.",
        "On the other hand, in practice even a number of references do not capture the whole potential variability of the translation.",
        "Moreover, often it is the case that multiple references are not available or are too difficult and expensive to produce: when designing a statistical machine translation system, the need for large amounts of training data limits the researcher to collections of parallel corpora like Europarl (Koehn, 2005), which provides only one reference, namely the target text; and the cost of creating additional reference translations of the test set, usually a few thousand sentences long, often exceeds the resources available.",
        "Therefore, it would be desirable to find a way to automatically generate legitimate translation alternatives not present in the reference(s) already available.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel method that automatically derives paraphrases using only the source and reference texts involved in for the evaluation of French-to-English Europarl translations produced by two MT systems: statistical phrase-based Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) and rule-based Logomedia.1 In using what is in fact a miniature bilingual corpus our approach differs from the mainstream paraphrase generation based on monolingual resources.",
        "We show that paraphrases produced in this way are more relevant to the task of evaluating machine translation than the use of external lexical knowledge resources like thesauri or WordNet2, in that our paraphrases contain both lexical equivalents and low-level syntactic variants, and in that, as a side-effect, evaluation bitextderived paraphrasing naturally yields domain-specific paraphrases.",
        "The paraphrases generated from the evaluation bitext are added to the existing reference sentences, in effect creating multiple references and resulting in a higher score for the candidate translation.",
        "Our hypothesis, confirmed by the experiments in this paper, is that the scores raised by additional references produced in this way will correlate better with human judgment than the original scores.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work; Section 3 describes our method and presents examples of derived paraphrases; Section 4 presents the results of the comparison between the BLUE and NIST scores for a single-reference translation and the same translation using the paraphrases automatically generated from the bitext, as well as the correlations between the scores and human judgment; Section 5 discusses ongoing work; Section 6 concludes."

        "The insensitivity of BLEU and NIST to perfectly legitimate variation has been raised, among others, in (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), but the criticism is widespread.",
        "Even the creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level (Papineni et al., 2002), a problem also noted by (Och et al., 2003) and (Russo-Lassner et al., 2005).",
        "A side effect of this phenomenon is that BLEU is less reliable for smaller data sets, so the advantage it provides in the speed of evaluation is to some extent counterbalanced by the time spent by developers on producing a sufficiently large test data set in order to obtain a reliable score for their system.",
        "Recently a number of attempts to remedy these shortcomings have led to the development of other automatic machine translation metrics.",
        "Some of them concentrate mainly on the word reordering aspect, like Maximum Matching String (Turian et al., 2003) or Translation Error Rate (Snover et al., 2005).",
        "Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference, like CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering; METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy; and a linear regression model developed by (Russo-Lassner et al., 2005), which makes use of stemming, WordNet synonymy, verb class synonymy, matching noun phrase heads, and proper name matching.",
        "A closer examination of these metrics suggests that the accommodation of lexical equivalence is as difficult as the appropriate treatment of syntactic variation, in that it requires considerable external knowledge resources like WordNet, verb class databases, and extensive text preparation: stemming, tagging, etc.",
        "The advantage of our method is that it produces relevant paraphrases with nothing more than the evaluation bitext and a widely available word and phrase alignment software, and therefore can be used with any existing evaluation metric."

        "According to (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), who derived their paraphrases automatically from a corpus of over a million German-English Europarl sentences, the baseline syntactic and semantic accuracy of the best paraphrases (those with the highest probability) reaches 48.9% and 64.5%, respectively.",
        "That is, by replacing a phrase with its one most likely paraphrase the sentence remained syntactically well-formed in 48.9% of the cases and retained its meaning in 65% of the cases.",

        "We then compared the accuracy across four samples of data.",
        "Each sample contained 50 randomly drawn words/phrases and their paraphrases.",
        "For the first two samples, the paraphrases were derived from the initial 2000- sentence corpus; for the second two, the paraphrases were derived from the 700,000-sentence corpus.",
        "For each corpus, one of the two samples contained only one best paraphrase for each entry, while the other listed all possible paraphrases.",
        "We then evaluated the quality of each paraphrase with respect to its syntactic and semantic accuracy.",
        "In terms of syntax, we considered the paraphrase accurate either if it had the same category as the original word/phrase; in terms of semantics, we relied on human judgment of similarity.",
        "Tables 5 and 6 summarize the syntactic and semantic accuracy levels in the samples.",
        "Although it has to be kept in mind that these percentages were taken from relatively small samples, an interesting pattern emerges from comparing the results.",
        "It seems that the average syntactic accuracy of all paraphrases decreases with increased corpus size, but the syntactic accuracy of the one best paraphrase improves.",
        "This reflects the idea behind word alignment: the bigger the corpus, the more potential alignments there are for a given word, but at the same time the better their order in terms of probability and the likelihood to obtain the correct translation.",
        "Interestingly, the same pattern is not repeated for semantic accuracy, but again, these samples are quite small.",
        "In order to address this issue, we plan to repeat the experiment with more data.",
        "Additionally, it should be noted that certain expressions, although not completely correct syntactically, could be retained in the paraphrase lists for the purposes of machine translation evaluation.",
        "Consider the case where our equivalence set looks like this: (4) abandon – abandoning – abandoned The words in (4) are all inflected forms of the verb abandon, and although they would produce rather ungrammatical paraphrases, those ungrammatical paraphrases still allow us to score our translation higher in terms of BLEU or NIST if it contains one of the forms of abandon than when it contains some unrelated word like piano instead.",
