        "Since the gathering of such lexical information is a delicate and time-consuming endeavour, some effort has been devoted to the automatic building of sets of synonyms words or expressions.",
        "Synonym extraction suffers from a variety of methodological problems, however.",
        "Synonymy itself is not an easily definable notion.",
        "Totally equivalent words (in meaning and use) arguably do not exist, and some people prefer to talk about near-synonyms (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002).",
        "A near-synonym is a word that can be used instead of another one, in some contexts, without too much change in meaning.",
        "This leaves of lot of freedom in the degree of synonymy one is ready to accept.",
        "Other authors include “related” terms in the building of thesaurus, such as hyponyms and hypernyms, (Blondel et al., 2004) in a somewhat arbitrary way.",
        "More generally, paraphrase is a preferred term referring to alternative formulations of words or expressions, in the context of information retrieval or machine translation.",
        "Then there is the question of evaluating the results.",
        "Comparing to already existing thesaurus is a debatable means when automatic construction is supposed to complement an existing one, or when a specific domain is targeted, or when simply the automatic procedure is supposed to fill a void.",
        "Manual verification of a sample of synonyms extracted is a common practice, either by the authors of a study or by independent lexicographers.",
        "This of course does not solve problems related to the definition of synonymy in the “manual” design of a thesaurus, but can help evaluate the relevance of synonyms extracted automatically, and which could have been forgotten.",
        "One can hope at best for a semi-automatic procedure were lexicographers have to weed out bad candidates in a set of proposals that is hopefully not too noisy.",
        "A few studies have tried to use the lexical information available in a general dictionary and find patterns that would indicate synonymy relations (Blon",
        "del et al., 2004; Ho and Cédrick, 2004).",
        "The general idea is that words are related by the definition they appear in, in a complex network that must be semantic in nature (this has been also applied to word sense disambiguation, albeit with limited success (Veronis and Ide, 1990; H.Kozima and Furugori, 1993)).",

        "We describe here our method (dubbed Prox) to compute a distance between nodes in a graph.",
        "Basically, nodes are derived from entries in the dictionary or words appearing in definitions, and there are edges between an entry and the word in its definition (more in section 3).",
        "Such graphs are \"small world\" networks with distinguishing features and we hypo-thetize these features reflect a linguistic and semantic organisation that can be exploited (Gaume et al., 2005).",
        "The idea is to see a graph as a Markov chain whose states are the graph nodes and whose transitions are its edges, valuated with probabilities.",
        "Then we send random particles walking through this graph, and their trajectories and the dynamics of their trajectories reveal their structural properties.",
        "In short, we assume the average distance a particle has made between two nodes after a given time is an indication of the semantic distance between these nodes.",
        "Obviously, nodes located in highly clustered areas will tend to be separated by smaller distance.",
        "Formally, if G = (V, E) is a reflexive graph (each node is connected to itself) with IV I = n, we note [G] the n x n adjacency matrix of G that is such that [G]Z,; (the ith row and jth column) is non null if there is an edge between node i and node j and 0 otherwise.",

        "Obviously a lot of synonyms appear in the definition of a word, and words in a definition tend to be consider close to the entry they appear in.",
        "So we tried two different baselines to estimate this bias, and how our method improves or not from this.",
        "The first baseline considers as synonyms of a word all the words of the same category (verbs or nouns in each case) that appear in a definition of the word, and all the entry the word appear in.",
        "Then we selected ten words at random among this base.",
        "The second baseline was similar, but restricted to the first word appearing in a definition of another word.",
        "Again we took ten words at random in this set if it was larger than ten, and all of them otherwise.",
        "We show the results of precision for the first candidate ranked by prox, the first 5, and the first 10 (always excluding the word itself).",
        "In the case of the two baselines, results for the first ten are a bit",
        "misleading, since the average numbers of candidates proposed by these methods were respectively 8 and 6 for verbs and 9 and 5.6 for nouns (Table 2).",
        "Also, nouns had an average of 5.8 synonyms in the existing thesauri (when what was considered was the min between 10 and the number of synonyms), and verbs had an average of 8.9.",
        "We can see that both baselines outperforms weighted prox on the existing thesaurus for verbs, and that the simpler prox is similar to baseline 2 (first word only).",
        "For nouns, results are close between B2 and the two proxs.",
        "It is to be noted that a lot of uncommon words appear as candidates, as they are related with very few words, and a lot of these do not appear in the existing thesauri.",
        "By looking precisely at each candidate (see judges’ scores), we can see that both baselines are slightly improved (and still close to one another), but are now beaten by both prox for the first and the first 5 words.",
        "There is a big difference between the two judges, so Judge 2 has better scores than Judge 1 for the baselines, but in each case, prox was better.",
        "It could be troubling to see how good the second baseline is for the first 10 candidates, but one must remember this baseline actually proposes 6 candidates on average (when prox was always at 10), making it actually nothing more than a variation on the 5",
        "baseline-1 baseline-2 simple prox weighted prox candidate baseline, to which it should be compared in all fairness (and we see that prox is much better there).",
        "The difference between the two versions of prox shows that a basic version is better for verbs and the more elaborate one is better for nouns, with overall better results for verbs than for nouns.",
        "One could wonder why there was some many more candidates marked as synonyms by both judges, compared to the original compilation of thesaurus.",
        "Mainly, it seemed to us that it can be accounted for by a lot of infrequent words, or old senses of words absent for more restricted dictionaries.",
        "We are currently investigating this matter.",
        "It could also be that our sample picked out a lot of not so frequent words since they outnumber frequent words in such a large dictionary as the TLF.",

        "The 50 words picked out in our sample have an average frequency of 2000 occurrences, while when we consider all our about 430 candidates for synonymy, the average frequency is 5300.",

        "The approach of (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) uses a related kind of resource: multiple translations of the same text, with additional constraints on availability, and problems of text alignment, for only a third of the results being synonyms (when compared to Wordnet).",

        "In the case of distributional approaches, similarity if determined from the appearance in similar contexts (Lin, 1998); in the case of dictionary-based methods, lexical relations are deduced from the links between words expressed in definitions of entries.",
        "Approaches that rely on distributional data have two major drawbacks: they need a lot of data, generally syntactically parsed sentences, that is not always available for a given language (English is an exception), and they do not discriminate well among lexical relations (mainly hyponyms, antonyms, hy-pernyms) (Weeds et al., 2004) .",

        "A lot of work has been done to extract lexical relations from the definitions taken in isolation (mostly for ontology building), see recently (Nichols et al., 2005), with a syntactic/semantic parse, with usually results around 60% of precision (that can be compared with the same baseline we used, all words in the definition with the same category), on dictionaries with very small definitions (and thus a higher proportions of synonyms and hypernyms).",

        "Both (Ho and Cédrick, 2004) and (Blondel et al., 2004) build a graph of lexical items from a dictionary in a manner similar to ours.",
        "In the first case, the method used to compute similarity between two concepts (or words) is restricted to neighbors, in the graph, of the two concepts; in the second case, only directly related words are considered as potential candidates for synonymy: for two words to be considered synonyms, one has to appear in the definition of another.",
        "In both cases, only 6 or 7 words have been used as a test of synonymy, with a validation provided by the authors with \"related terms\" (an unclear notion) considered correct.",
        "The similarity measure itself was evaluated on a set of related terms from (Miller and Charles, 1991), as in (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001; Banerjee and Ped-ersen, 2003), with seemingly good results, but semantically related terms is a very different notion (\"car\" and \"tire\" for instance are semantically related terms, and thus considered similar).",
        "We do not know of any dictionary-based graph approach which have been given a larger evaluation of its results.",
        "Parsing definitions in isolation prevents a complete coverage (we estimated that only 30% of synonyms pairs in the TLF can be found from definitions).",
        "As for distributional approaches, (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) gets a very high precision (around 90%) on valid paraphrases as judged by humans, among which 35% are synonymy relations in Word-net, 32% are hypernyms, 18% are coordinate terms.",
        "Discriminating among the paraphrases types is not addressed.",
        "Other approaches usually consider either given sets of synonyms among which one is to be chosen (for a translation for instance) (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002) or must choose a synonym word against unrelated terms in the context of a synonymy test (Freitag et al., 2005), a seemingly easier task than actually proposing synonyms.",
        "(Lin, 1998) proposes a different methodology for evaluation of candidate synonyms, by comparing similarity measures of the terms he provides with the similarity measures between them in Wordnet, using various semantic distances.",
