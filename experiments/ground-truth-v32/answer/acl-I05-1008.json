        "Corpus-based supervised learning is now a standard approach to build a system which shows high performance for a given task in NLP.",
        "However, the weakness of such approach is to need an annotated corpus.",
        "Corpus annotation is labor intensive and very expensive.",
        "To reduce or avoid the cost of annotation, various approaches are proposed, which include unsupervised learning, minimally supervised learning (e.g., [1]), and active learning (e.g., [2,3]).",
        "To discuss clearly the cost of corpus annotation, we here consider a simple model of the cost:",
        "annotation cost o ^ c(t)n(t) t where t is a type of annotation such as POS tagging, chunk tagging, etc., c(t) is a cost per type t annotation, and n(t) is the number of type t annotation.",
        "Previous work to tackle the problem of annotation cost has mainly focused on reducing n(t).",
        "For example, in active learning, useful examples to be annotated are selected based on some criteria, and then the number of examples to be annotated is considerably reduced.",
        "In contrast, we here focus on reducing c(t) instead of n(t).",
        "Obviously, if some portion of annotations are not given, the performance of a NLP system will deteriorate.",
        "The question here is how much the performance deteriorates.",
        "Is there a good trade-off between saving the cost and losing the performance?",
        "Minimizing portions of annotations is also very important from the point of view of engineering.",
        "Suppose that we want to build an annotated corpus to make a parser for some real-world application.",
        "The design and strategy of corpus annotation is crucial in order to get a good parser while saving the cost.",
        "Furthermore, we have to keep in mind the maintenance cost of both the corpus and the parser.",
        "For example, we may find some errors in the annotations and the design of linguistic categories.",
        "In this situation fewer annotations lead to saving the cost because the corpus is more stable and less prone to errors.",
        "The main purpose of this study is to explore the use of a partially annotated corpus to build a dependency parser for Japanese.",
        "In this paper, we describe experiments to investigate the feasibility of a partially annotated corpus.",
        "In addition, we propose features for parsing which are based on character n-grams.",
        "Even if grammatical tags are not given, a parser with these features demonstrates better performance than does the maximum entropy parser [4] with full grammatical features.",
        "Similarly, we have conducted experiments on bunsetsu (described in Sect.",
        "2.1) chunking trained with a corpus which does not have grammatical tags.",
        "After that, we have tested a parser trained with a corpus which is partially annotated for dependency structures."

        "The Japanese language is basically an SOV language.",
        "Word order is relatively free.",
        "In English the syntactic function of each word is represented with word order, while in Japanese postpositions represent the syntactic function of each word.",
        "For example, one or more postpositions following a noun play a similar role to declension of nouns in German, which indicates a grammatical case.",
        "Based on such properties, the concept of bunsetsus1 was devised and has been used to describe the structure of a sentence in Japanese.",
        "A bunsetsu consists of one or more content words followed by zero or more function words.",
        "By defining a bunsetsu like that, we can analyze a sentence in a similar way that is used when analyzing the grammatical role of words in inflecting languages like German.",
        "Thus, strictly speaking, bunsetsu order rather than word order is free except the bunsetsu that contains the main verb of a sentence.",
        "Such bunsetsu must be placed at the end of the sentence.",

        "We have explored the use of a partially annotated corpus for building a dependency parser for Japanese.",
        "We have examined two types of partially annotated corpora.",
        "It is found that a parser trained with a corpus that does not have any grammatical tags for words can demonstrate an accuracy of 87.38%, which is comparable to the current state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "In contrast, a parser trained with a corpus that has only dependency annotations for each two adjacent bunsetsus shows moderate performance.",
        "Nonetheless, it is notable that features based on character n-grams are found very useful for a dependency parser for Japanese.",
        "Use of Character N-grams.",
        "Character n-grams are often used for POS tagging of unknown words, unsupervised POS tagging, and measures of string similarity.",
        "The number of common n-grams between two sentences is used for a similarity measure in [14].",
        "This usage is essentially the same as in the spectrum kernel [21], which is one of string kernels [22].",
