        "Two broad approaches have dominated the literature on constructing paraphrase corpora.",
        "One",
        "approach utilizes multiple translations of a single source language text, where the source language text guarantees semantic equivalence in the target language texts (e.g., Barzilay & McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003).",
        "Such corpora are of limited availability, however, since multiple translations of the same document are uncommon in non-literary domains.",
        "The second strain of corpora construction involves mining paraphrase strings or sentences from news articles, with document clustering typically providing the topical coherence necessary to boost the likelihood that any two arbitrary sentences in the cluster are paraphrases.",
        "In this vein, Shinyama et al.",
        "(2002) use named entity anchors to extract paraphrases within a narrow domain.",
        "Barzilay & Lee (2003) employ Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA, e.g., Durbin et al., 1998) to align strings extracted from closely related news articles.",
        "Although the MSA approach can produce dramatic results, it is chiefly effective in extracting highly templatic data, and appears to be of limited extensibility to broad domain application (Quirk et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Recent work by Dolan, et al.",
        "(2004) describes the construction of broad-domain corpora of aligned paraphrase pairs extracted from news-cluster data on the World Wide Web using two heuristic strategies: 1) pairing sentences based on a word-based edit distance heuristic; and 2) a naive text-feature-based heuristic in which the first two sentences of each article in a cluster are cross-matched with each other, their assumption being that the early sentences of a news article will tend to summarize the whole article and are thus likely to contain the same information as other early sentences of other articles in the cluster.",
        "The word-based edit distance heuristic yields pairs that are relatively clean but offer relatively minor rewrites in generation, especially when compared to the MSA model of (Barzilay & Lee, 2003).",
        "The text-based heuristic, on the other hand, results in a noisy “comparable” corpus: only 29.7% of sentence pairs are paraphrases, resulting in degraded performance on alignment metrics.",
        "This latter technique, however, does afford large numbers of pairings that are widely divergent at the string level; capturing these is of primary interest to paraphrase research.",
        "In this paper, we use an annotated corpus and an SVM classifier to refine the output of this second heuristic in an attempt to better identify sentence pairs containing richer paraphrase material, and minimize the noise generated by unwanted and irrelevant data."
