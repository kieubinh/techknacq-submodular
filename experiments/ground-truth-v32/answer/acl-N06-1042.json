        "Furthermore, it is possible for a word to take an unlimited number of suffixes, therefore the number of possible morphological tags is unlimited.",
        "We attempted to cope with these problems by training a separate model for each of the 126 morphological features recognized by the morphological analyzer.",
        "The resulting decision lists independently vote on each of the potential parses of a word and the final parse is selected based on our confidence on these votes.",
        "The accuracy of our model (96%) is slightly above the best previously reported results which use statistical models.",
        "For comparison, when we train a single decision list on full tags instead of using separate models on each feature we get 91% accuracy."

        "Morphological disambiguation is the task of selecting the correct morphological parse for a given word in a given context.",
        "The possible parses of a word are generated by a morphological analyzer.",
        "In Turkish, close to half the words in running text are morphologically ambiguous.",
        "Below is a typical word “masalı” with three possible parses.",
        "The first two parses start with the same root, masal (= story, fable), but the interpretation of the following +ı suffix is the Accusative marker in one case, and third person possessive agreement in the other.",
        "The third parse starts with a different root, masa (= table) followed by a derivational suffix +lı (= with) which turns the noun into an adjective.",
        "The symbol \" DB represents a derivational boundary and splits the parse into chunks called inflectional groups (IGs).1 We will use the term feature to refer to individual morphological features like +Acc and +With; the term IG to refer to groups of features split by derivational boundaries (\"DB), and the term tag to refer to the sequence of IGs following the root.",
        "Morphological disambiguation is a useful first step for higher level analysis of any language but it is especially critical for agglutinative languages like Turkish, Czech, Hungarian, and Finnish.",
        "These languages have a relatively free constituent order, and",
        "syntactic relations are partly determined by morphological features.",
        "Many applications including syntactic parsing, word sense disambiguation, text to speech synthesis and spelling correction depend on accurate analyses of words.",
        "An important qualitative difference between part of speech tagging in English and morphological disambiguation in an agglutinative language like Turkish is the number of possible tags that can be assigned to a word.",
        "Typical English tag sets include less than a hundred tag types representing syntactic and morphological information.",
        "The number of potential morphological tags in Turkish is theoretically unlimited.",
        "We have observed more than ten thousand tag types in our training corpus of a million words.",
        "The high number of possible tags poses a data sparseness challenge for the typical machine learning approach, somewhat akin to what we observe in word sense disambiguation.",
        "One way out of this dilemma could be to ignore the detailed morphological structure of the word and focus on determining only the major and minor parts of speech.",
        "However (Oflazer et al., 1999) observes that the modifier words in Turkish can have dependencies to any one of the inflectional groups of a derived word.",
        "For example, in “mavi masalı oda” (_ the room with a blue table) the adjective “mavi” (_ blue) modifies the noun root “masa” (_ table) even though the final part of speech of “masalı” is an adjective.",
        "Therefore, the final part of speech and inflection of a word do not carry sufficient information for the identification of the syntactic dependencies it is involved in.",
        "One needs the full morphological analysis.",
        "Our approach to the data sparseness problem is to consider each morphological feature separately.",
        "Even though the number of potential tags is unlimited, the number of morphological features is small: The Turkish morphological analyzer we use (Oflazer, 1994) produces tags that consist of 126 unique features.",
        "For each unique feature f, we take the subset of the training data in which one of the parses for each instance contain f. We then split this subset into positive and negative examples depending on whether the correct parse contains the feature f. These examples are used to learn rules using the Greedy Prepend Algorithm (GPA), a novel decision list learner.",
        "To predict the tag of an unknown word, first the morphological analyzer is used to generate all its possible parses.",
        "The decision lists are then used to predict the presence or absence of each of the features contained in the candidate parses.",
        "The results are probabilistically combined taking into account the accuracy of each decision list to select the best parse.",
        "The resulting tagging accuracy is 96% on a hand tagged test set.",
        "A more direct approach would be to train a single decision list using the full tags as the target classification.",
        "Given a word in context, such a decision list assigns a complete morphological tag instead of predicting individual morphological features.",
        "As such, it does not need the output of a morphological analyzer and should be considered a tagger rather than a disambiguator.",
        "For comparison, such a decision list was built, and its accuracy was determined to be 91% on the same test set.",
        "The main reason we chose to work with decision lists and the GPA algorithm is their robustness to irrelevant or redundant features.",
        "The input to the decision lists include the suffixes of all possible lengths and character type information within a five word window.",
        "Each instance ends up with 40 attributes on average which are highly redundant and mostly irrelevant.",
        "GPA is able to sort out the relevant features automatically and build a fairly accurate model.",
        "Our experiments with Naive Bayes resulted in a significantly worse performance.",
        "Typical statistical approaches include the tags of the previous words as inputs in the model.",
        "GPA was able to deliver good performance without using the previous tags as inputs, because it was able to extract equivalent information implicit in the surface attributes.",
        "Finally, unlike most statistical approaches, the resulting models of GPA are human readable and open to interpretation as Section 3.1 illustrates.",
        "The next section will review related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces decision lists and the GPA training algorithm.",
        "Section 4 presents the experiments and the results."

        "In the statistical approach a hand tagged corpus is used to train a probabilistic model which is then used to select the best tags in unseen text (Church, 1988; Hakkani-T¨ur et al., 2002).",
        "Examples of statistical and machine learning approaches that have been used for tagging include transformation based learning (Brill, 1995), memory based learning (Daelemans et al., 1996), and maximum entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",
        "It is also possible to train statistical models using unlabeled data with the expectation maximization algorithm (Cutting et al., 1992).",

        "Previous work on morphological disambiguation of inflectional or agglutinative languages include unsupervised learning for of Hebrew (Levinger et al., 1995), maximum entropy modeling for Czech (Hajiˇc and Hladk´a, 1998), combination of statistical and rule-based disambiguation methods for Basque (Ezeiza et al., 1998), transformation based tagging for Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999).",
        "Early work on Turkish used a constraint-based approach with hand crafted rules (Oflazer and Kuru¨oz, 1994).",
        "A purely statistical morphological disambiguation model was recently introduced (Hakkani-T¨ur et al., 2002).",
        "To counter the data sparseness problem the morphological parses are split across their derivational boundaries and certain independence assumptions are made in the prediction of each inflectional group.",
        "A combination of three ideas makes our approach unique in the field: (1) the use of decision lists and a novel learning algorithm that combine the statistical and rule based techniques, (2) the treatment of each individual feature separately to address the data sparseness problem, and (3) the lack of dependence on previous tags and relying on surface attributes alone."
