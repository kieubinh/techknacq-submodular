        "Example 1 is written from a Israeli perspective; Example 2 is written from a Palestinian perspective .",
        "We aim to address a research question: can computers learn to identify the perspective of a document given a training corpus of documents that are written from different perspectives?",
        "When an issue is discussed from different perspectives, not every sentence in a document strongly reflects the perspective the author possesses.",
        "For example, the following sentences are written by one Palestinian and one Israeli:",
        "(3) The Rhodes agreements of 1949 set them as the ceasefire lines between Israel and the Arab states.",
        "(4) The green line was drawn up at the Rhodes Armistice talks in 1948-49.",
        "Example 3 and 4 both factually introduce the background of the issue of the “green line” without expressing explicit perspectives.",
        "Can computers automatically discriminate between sentences that strongly express a perspective and sentences that only reflect shared background information?",
        "A system that can automatically identify the perspective from which a document written will be a highly desirable tool for people analyzing huge collections of documents from different perspectives.",
        "An intelligence analyst regularly monitors the positions that foreign countries take on political and diplomatic issues.",
        "A media analyst frequently surveys broadcast news, newspapers, and web blogs for different viewpoints.",
        "What these analysts need in common is that they would like to find evidence of strong statements of differing perspectives, while ignoring statements without strong perspectives as less interesting.",
        "In this paper we approach the problem of learning perspectives in a statistical learning framework.",
        "We develop statistical models to learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage, and evaluate the models by measuring how accurately they can predict the perspectives of unseen documents.",
        "Lacking annotation on how strongly individual sentences convey a particular perspective in our corpus poses a challenge on learning sentence-level perspectives.",

        "Identifying the perspective from which a document is written is a subtask in the growing area of automatic opinion recognition and extraction.",

        "So far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (Wiebe et al., 2004; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Morinaga et al., 2002).",
        "Although by its very nature we expect much of the language of presenting a perspective or point-of-view to be subjective, labeling a document or a sentence as subjective is not enough to identify the perspective from which it is written.",
        "Moreover, the ideology and beliefs authors possess are often expressed in ways more than conspicuous positive or negative language toward specific targets."

        "If LSPM does not achieve similar identification accuracy after modeling sentence-level information, we will doubt the quality of predictions on how strongly a sentence convey perspective made by LSPM.",

        "Therefore identifying perspective at the sentence level is much harder than at that the document level, and the high accuracy of identifying document-level perspectives suggests that LPSM closely captures the perspectives expressed at the document and sentence levels, given individual sentences are very short and much less informative about overall perspective."
