        "They also assist in the interpretation of anaphora, verb phrase ellipsis and lexical ambiguities (Hobbs, 1985; Kehler, 2002; Asher and Las-carides, 2003).",
        "Coherence relations can be implicit, or they can be signalled explicitly through the use of discourse connectives, e.g. because, even though.",
        "For a machine to interpret a text, it is important that it recognises coherence relations, and so as explicit markers discourse connectives are of great assistance (Marcu, 2000).",
        "When discourse connectives are not present, the task is more difficult.",
        "For such cases, unsupervised approaches have been developed for predicting relations, by using sentences containing discourse connectives as training data (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Lapata and Las-carides, 2004).",
        "However the nature of the relationship between the coherence relations signalled by discourse connectives and their empirical distributions has to date been poorly understood.",
        "In particular, one might wonder whether connectives with similar meanings also have similar distributions.",
        "Concerning natural language generation, texts are easier for humans to understand if they are coherently structured.",
        "Addressing this, a body of research has considered the problems of generating appropriate discourse connectives (for example (Moser and Moore, 1995; Grote and Stede, 1998)).",
        "One such problem involves choosing which connective to generate, as the mapping between connectives and relations is not one-to-one, but rather many-to-many.",
        "Siddharthan (2003) considers the task of paraphrasing a text while preserving its rhetorical relations.",
        "Clauses conjoined by but, or and when are separated to form distinct orthographic sentences, and these conjunctions are replaced by the discourse adverbials however, otherwise and then, respectively.",
        "The idea underlying Siddharthan’s work is that one connective can be substituted for another while preserving the meaning of a text.",
        "Knott (1996) studies the substitutability of discourse connectives, and proposes that substitutability can motivate theories of discourse coherence.",
        "Knott uses an empirical methodology to determine the substitutability of pairs of connectives.",
        "However this methodology is manually intensive, and Knott derives relationships for only about 18% of pairs of connectives.",
        "It would thus be useful if substitutability could be predicted automatically.",
        "This paper proposes that substitutability can be predicted through statistical analysis of the contexts in which connectives appear.",
        "Similar methods have been developed for predicting the similarity of nouns and verbs on the basis of their distributional similarity, and many distributional similarity functions have been proposed for these tasks (Lee, 1999).",
        "However substitutability is a more complex notion than similarity, and we propose a novel variance-based function for assisting in this task.",
        "This paper constitutes a first step towards predicting substitutability of cnonectives automatically.",
