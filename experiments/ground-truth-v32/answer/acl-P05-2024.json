        "In this study, we report the corpus-oriented development of a Japanese HPSG parser using the EDR Japanese corpus (2002).",
        "Although several researchers have attempted to utilize linguistic grammar theories, such as LFG (Bresnan and Kaplan, 1982), CCG (Steedman, 2001) and HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), for parsing real-world texts, such attempts could hardly be successful, because manual development of wide-coverage linguistically motivated grammars involves years of labor-intensive effort.",
        "Corpus-oriented grammar development is a grammar development method that has been proposed as a promising substitute for conventional manual development.",
        "In corpus-oriented methods, a treebank of a target grammar is constructed first, and various grammatical constraints are extracted from the treebank.",
        "Previous studies reported that wide-coverage grammars can be obtained at low cost by using this method.",
        "(Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Miyao et al., 2004) The treebank can also be used for training statistical disambiguation models, and hence we can construct a statistical parser for the extracted grammar.",
        "The corpus-oriented method enabled us to develop a Japanese HPSG parser with semantic information, whose coverage on real-world sentences is 95.3%.",
        "This high coverage allowed us to evaluate the parser in terms of the accuracy of dependency analysis on real-world texts, the evaluation measure that is previously used for more statistically-oriented parsers."

        "Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is classified into lexicalized grammars (Schabes et al., 1988).",
        "It attempts to model linguistic phenomena by interactions between a small number of grammar rules and a large number of lexical entries.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of an HPSG derivation of a Japanese sentence ‘kare ga shinda,’ which means, ‘He died.’ In HPSG, linguistic entities such as words and phrases are represented by typed feature structures called signs, and the grammaticality of a sentence is verified by applying grammar rules to a sequence of signs.",
        "The sign of a lexical entry encodes the type and valence (i.e. restriction on the types of phrases that can appear around the word) of a corresponding word.",
        "Grammar rules of HPSG consist of",
        "schemata and principles, the former enumerate possible patterns of phrase structures, and the latter are basically for controlling the inheritance of daughters’ features to the parent.",
        "In the current example, the lexical entry for “shinda” is of the type verb, as indicated in its HEAD, and its COMPS feature restricts its preceding phrase to be of the type PP “ ga ”.",
        "The HEAD feature of the root node of the derivation is inherited from the lexical entry for “shinda”, because complement-head structures are head-final, and the head feature principle states that the HEAD feature of a phrase must be inherited from its head daughter.",
        "There are several implementations of Japanese HPSG grammars.",
        "JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002) is a hand-crafted Japanese HPSG grammar that provides semantic information as well as linguistically motivated analysis of complex constructions.",

        "Although Bond et al.",
        "(2004) attempted to improve the coverage of the JACY grammar through the development of an HPSG treebank, they limited the target of their treebank annotation to short sentences from dictionary definitions.",
        "SLUNG (Mitsuishi et al., 1998) is an HPSG grammar whose coverage on real-world sentences is about 99%, but the grammar is underspecified, which means that the constraints of the grammar are not sufficient for conducting semantic analysis.",

        "Case alternation is caused by special auxiliaries “(sa)se” and “(ra)re,” which are causative and passive auxiliaries, respectively, and the verbs change their subcategorization behavior when they are combined with these auxiliaries.",

        "The following descriptions are also summarized in Table 1. specifier-head schema Words are first concatenated by this schema to construct basic word chunks.",
        "Postpositional phrases (PPs), which consist of postpositions and preceding phrases, are the most typical example of specifier-head structures.",
        "For postpositions, we specify a head feature PFORM, with the postposition’s surface string as its value, in addition to the features in Figure 2, because differences of postpositions play a crucial role in disambiguating semantic-structures of Japanese.",
        "For example, the postposition ‘wo’ has a PFORM feature whose value is “wo,” and it accepts an NP as its specifier.",
        "As a result, a PP such as “kare wo” inherits the value of PFORM feature “wo” from ’wo.’ The schema is also used when VPs are constructed from verbs and their endings (or, sometimes auxiliaries.",
        "See also Section 3.2).",
        "complement-head schema This schema is used for combining VPs with their subcategorized arguments (see Section 3.2 for details).",

        "promotion schema This unary schema changes the value of the BAR feature from chunk to phrase.",
        "The distinction between these two types of constituents is for prohibiting some kind of spurious ambiguities.",
        "For example, ‘kinou/yesterday koroshi/kill ta/DECL’ can be analyzed in two different ways, i.e. ‘(kinou (koroshi ta))’ and ‘((kinou koroshi) ta).’ The latter analysis is prevented by restricting “kinou”’s modifiee to be a phrase, and “ta”’s specifier to be a chunk, and by assuming “koroshi” to be a chunk."

        "Scrambling causes problems in designing a Japanese HPSG grammar, because original HPSG, designed for English, specifies the subcategorization frame of a verb as an ordered list, and the semantic roles of arguments are determined by their order in the complement list.",
        "Our implementation treats the complement feature as a list of semantic roles.",
        "Semantic roles for which verbs subcategorize are agent, object, and goal.3 Correspondingly, we assume three subtypes of the complement-head schema: the agent-head, object-head, and goal-head schemata.",
        "When verbs take their arguments, arguments receive semantic roles which are permitted by the subcategorization of verbal signs.",
        "We do not restrict the order of application of the three types of complement-head schemata, so that a single verbal lexical entry can accept arguments that are scrambled in arbitrary order.",
        "In Figure 3, “kare ga” is a ga-marked PP, so it is analyzed as an agent of “koro(su).” 4 Case alternation is caused by special auxiliaries “(sa)se” and “(ra)re.” For instance, in ‘boku/I",
        "ga/NOM kare/he ni/DAT korosa/kill re/PASSIVE ta/DECL’ (I was killed by him), “korosa” takes a “ga”-marked PP as an object and a “ni”-marked PP as an agent, though without “(sa)re,” it takes a “ga”-marked PP as an agent and a “wo”-marked PP as an object.",
        "We consider auxiliaries as a special type of verbs which do not have their own subcategorization frames.",
        "They inherit the subcategorization frames of verbs.5 To capture the case alternation phenomenon, each verb has distinct lexical entries for its passive and causative uses.",
        "This distinction is made by binary valued HEAD features, PASSIVE and CAUSATIVE.",
        "The passive (causative) auxiliary restricts the value of its specifier’s PASSIVE (CAUSATIVE) feature to be plus, so that it can only be combined with properly case-alternated verbal lexical entries.",
        "Figure 4 presents the lexical sign of the passive auxiliary “(ra)re.” Our analysis of an example sentence is presented in Figure 5.",
        "Note that the passive auxiliary “re(ta)” requires the value of the PASSIVE feature of its specifier be plus, and hence “koro(sa)” cannot take the same lexical entry as in Figure 3."
