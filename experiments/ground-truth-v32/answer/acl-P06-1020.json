        "This paper presents highlights of a large scale lexical functional grammar for Turkish that is being developed in the context of the ParGram project1 In order to incorporate in a manageable way, the complex morphology and the syntactic relations mediated by morphological units, and to handle lexical representations of very productive derivations, we have opted to develop the grammar using sublexical units called inflectional groups.",
        "Inflectional groups (IGs hereafter) represent the inflectional properties of segments of a complex",
        "word structure separated by derivational boundaries.",
        "An IG is typically larger than a morpheme but smaller than a word (except when the word has no derivational morphology in which case the IG corresponds to the word).",
        "It turns out that it is the IGs that actually define syntactic relations between words.",
        "A grammar for Turkish that is based on words as units would have to refer to information encoded at arbitrary positions in words, making the task of the grammar writer much harder.",
        "On the other hand, treating morphemes as units in the grammar level implies that the grammar will have to know about morphotactics making either the morphological analyzer redundant, or repeating the information in the morphological analyzer at the grammar level which is not very desirable.",
        "IGs bring a certain form of normalization to the lexical representation of a language like Turkish, so that units in which the grammar rules refer to are simple enough to allow easy access to the information encoded in complex word structures.",
        "That IGs delineate productive derivational processes in words necessitates a mechanism that reflects the effect of the derivations to semantic representations and valency changes.",
        "For instance, English LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) represents derivations as a part of the lexicon; both happy and happiness are separately lexicalized.",
        "Lexicalized representations of adjectives such as easy and easier are related, so that both lexicalized and phrasal comparatives would have the same feature structure; easier would have the feature structure Encoding derivations in the lexicon could be applicable for languages with relatively unproductive derivational phenomena, but it certainly is not",
        "possible to represent in the grammar lexicon,2 all derived forms as lexemes for an agglutinative language like Turkish.",
        "Thus one needs to incorporate such derivational processes in a principled way along with the computation of the effects on derivations on the representation of the semantic information.",
        "Lexical functional grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) is a theory representing the syntax in two parallel levels: Constituent structures (c-structures) have the form of context-free phrase structure trees.",
        "Functional structures (f-structures) are sets of pairs of attributes and values; attributes may be features, such as tense and gender, or functions, such as subject and object.",
        "C-structures define the syntactic representation and f-structures define more semantic representation.",
        "Therefore c-structures are more language specific whereas f-structures of the same phrase for different languages are expected to be similar to each other.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work both on Turkish, and on issues similar to those addressed in this paper.",
        "Section 3 motivates and presents IGs while Section 4 explains how they are employed in a LFG setting.",
        "Section 5 summarizes the architecture and the current status of the our system.",

        "Although this grammar had a good coverage and handled phenomena such as free-constituent order, the underlying implementation was based on pseudo-unification.",
        "But most crucially, it employed a rather standard approach to represent the lexical units: words with multiple nested derivations were represented with complex nested feature structures where linguistically relevant information could be embedded at unpredictable depths which made access to them in rules extremely complex and unwieldy.",
        "Bozs¸ahin (2002) employed morphemes overtly as lexical units in a CCG framework to account for a variety of linguistic phenomena in a prototype implementation.",
        "The drawback was that morphotactics was explicitly raised to the level of the sentence grammar, hence the categorial lexicon accounted for both constituent order and the morpheme order with no distinction.",
        "Oflazer’s dependency parser (2003) used IGs as units between which dependency relations were established.",

        "Turkish is an agglutinative language where a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root (Oflazer, 1994).",
        "At the syntax level, the unmarked constituent order is SOV, but constituent order may vary freely as demanded by the discourse context.",
        "Essentially all constituent orders are possible, especially at the main sentence level, with very minimal formal constraints.",
        "In written text however, the unmarked order is dominant at both the main sentence and embedded clause level.",

        "Turkish words found in typical text average about 3-4 morphemes including the stem, with an average of about 1.23 derivations per word, but given that certain noninflecting function words such as conjuctions, determiners, etc.",
        "are rather frequent, this number is rather close to 2 for inflecting word classes.",
        "Statistics from the Turkish Treebank indicate that for sentences ranging between 2 words to 40 words (with an average of about 8 words), the number of IGs range from 2 to 55 IGs (with an average of 10 IGs per sentence) (Eryi˘git and Oflazer, 2006).",

        "A given word may have multiple such representations depending on any morphological ambiguity brought about by alternative segmentations of the",
        "word, and by ambiguous interpretations of morphemes.",
        "For instance, the morphological analysis of the derived modifier cezalandırılacak (literally, “(the one) that will be given punishment”) would be :3",
        "The first IG indicates that the root is a singular noun with nominative case marker and no possessive marker.",
        "The second IG indicates a derivation into a verb whose semantics is “to acquire” the preceding noun.",
        "The third IG indicates that a causative verb (equivalent to “to punish” in English), is derived from the previous verb.",
        "The fourth IG indicates the derivation of a passive verb with positive polarity from the previous verb.",
        "Finally the last IG represents a derivation into future participle which will function as a modifier in the sentence.",
        "The simple phrase eski kitaplarımdaki hikayeler (the stories in my old books) in Figure 1 will help clarify how IGs are involved in syntactic relations: Here, eski (old) modifies kitap (book) and not hikayeler (stories),4 and the locative phrase eski",

        "Morpheme boundaries are represented by ’+’ sign and morphemes in solid boxes actually define one IG.",

        "The semantic representation of derivational suffixes plays an important role in f-structure construction.",
        "In almost all cases, each derivation that is induced by an overt or a covert affix gets a OBJ feature which is then unified with the f-structure of the preceding stem already constructed, to obtain the feature structure of the derived form, with the PRED of the derived form being constructed on the fly.",
        "A PRED feature thus constructed however is not meant to necessarily have a precise lexical semantics.",
        "Most derivational suffixes have a consistent (lexical) semantics6, but some don’t, that is, the precise additional lexical semantics that the derivational suffix brings in, depends on the stem it is affixed to.",
        "Nevertheless, we represent both cases in the same manner, leaving the determination of the precise lexical semantics aside.",
        "If we consider Figure 2 in terms of dependency relations, the adjective mavi (blue) modifies the noun renk (color) and then the derivational suffix -li (with) kicks in although the -li is attached to renk only.",
        "Therefore, the semantics of the phrase should be with (blue color), not blue with (color) .",
        "With the approach we take, this difference can easily be represented in both the f-structure as in the leftmost branch in Example (5)",
        "We have already seen how the IGs are used to construct on the fly PRED features that reflect the lexical semantics of the derivation.",
        "In this section we describe how we handle phenomena where the derivational suffix in question does not explicitly affect the semantic representation in PRED feature but determines the semantic role so as to unify the derived form or its components with the appropriate external f-structure."
