        "Conditional random fields (CRFs) are a recently introduced formalism (Lafferty et al., 2001) for representing a conditional model p(ylx), where both a set of inputs, x, and a set of outputs, y, display non-trivial interdependency.",
        "CRFs are basically defined as a discriminative model of Markov random fields conditioned on inputs (observations) x.",
        "Unlike generative models, CRFs model only the output y’s distribution over x.",
        "This allows CRFs to use flexible features such as complicated functions of multiple observations.",
        "The modeling power of CRFs has been of great benefit in several applications, such as shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and information extraction (McCallum and Li, 2003).",
        "Since the introduction of CRFs, intensive research has been undertaken to boost their effectiveness.",
        "The first approach to estimating CRF parameters is the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion over conditional probability p(ylx) itself (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "The ML criterion, however, is prone to over-fitting the training data, especially since CRFs are often trained with a very large number of correlated features.",
        "The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion over parameters, A, given x and y is the natural choice for reducing over-fitting (Sha and Pereira, 2003).",
        "Moreover, the Bayes approach, which optimizes both MAP and the prior distribution of the parameters, has also been proposed (Qi et al., 2005).",
        "Furthermore, large margin criteria have been employed to optimize the model parameters (Taskar et al., 2004; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005).",
        "These training criteria have yielded excellent results for various tasks.",
        "However, real world tasks are evaluated by task-specific evaluation measures, including non-linear measures such as F-score, while all of the above criteria achieve optimization based on the linear combination of average accuracies, or error rates, rather than a given task-specific evaluation measure.",
        "For example, sequential segmentation tasks (SSTs), such as text chunking and named entity recognition, are generally evaluated with the segmentation F-score.",
        "This inconsistency between the objective function during training and the task evaluation measure might produce a suboptimal result.",
        "In fact, to overcome this inconsistency, an SVM-based multivariate optimization method has recently been proposed (Joachims, 2005).",
        "Moreover, an F-score optimization method for logistic regression has also been proposed (Jansche, 2005).",
        "In the same spirit as the above studies, we first propose a generalization framework for CRF training that allows us to optimize directly not only the error rate, but also any evaluation measure.",
        "In other words, our framework can incorporate any evaluation measure of interest into the loss function and then optimize this loss function as the training objective function.",
        "Our proposed framework is fundamentally derived from an approach to (smoothed) error rate minimization well",
        "known in the speech and pattern recognition community, namely the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) framework (Juang and Katagiri, 1992).",
        "The framework of MCE criterion training supports the theoretical background of our method.",
        "The approach proposed here subsumes the conventional ML/MAP criteria training of CRFs, as described in the following.",
