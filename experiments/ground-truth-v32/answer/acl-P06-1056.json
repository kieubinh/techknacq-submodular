        "When learning a second language, a student can benefit from knowledge in his / her first language (Gass, 1987), (Ringbom, 1987), (LeBlanc et al.",
        "1989).",
        "Cognates – words that have similar spelling and meaning – can accelerate vocabulary acquisition and facilitate the reading comprehension task.",
        "On the other hand, a student has to pay attention to the pairs of words that look and sound similar but have different meanings – false friends pairs, and especially to pairs of words that share meaning in some but not all contexts – the partial cognates.",
        "Carroll (1992) claims that false friends can be a hindrance in second language learning.",
        "She suggests that a cognate pairing process between two words that look alike happens faster in the learner’s mind than a false-friend pairing.",
        "Experiments with second language learners of different stages conducted by Van et al.",
        "(1998) suggest that missing false-friend recognition can be corrected when cross-language activation is used – sounds, pictures, additional explanation, feedback.",
        "Machine Translation (MT) systems can benefit from extra information when translating a certain word in context.",
        "Knowing if a word in the source language is a cognate or a false friend with a word in the target language can improve the translation results.",
        "Cross-Language Information Retrieval systems can use the knowledge of the sense of certain words in a query in order to retrieve desired documents in the target language.",
        "Our task, disambiguating partial cognates, is in a way equivalent to coarse grain cross-language Word-Sense Discrimination.",
        "Our focus is disambiguating French partial cognates in context: deciding if they are used as cognates with an English word, or if they are used as false friends.",
        "There is a lot of work done on monolingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems that use supervised and unsupervised methods and report good results on Senseval data, but there is less work done to disambiguate cross-language words.",
        "The results of this process can be useful in many NLP tasks.",
        "Although French and English belong to different branches of the Indo-European family of languages, their vocabulary share a great number of similarities.",
        "Some are words of Latin and Greek origin: e.g., education and theory.",
        "A small number of very old, “genetic\" cognates go back all the way to Proto-Indo-European, e.g., mére - mother and pied - foot.",
        "The majority of these pairs of words penetrated the French and English language due to the geographical, historical, and cultural contact between the two countries over",
        "many centuries (borrowings).",
        "Most of the borrowings have changed their orthography, following different orthographic rules (LeBlanc and Seguin, 1996) and most likely their meaning as well.",
        "Some of the adopted words replaced the original word in the language, while others were used together but with slightly or completely different meanings.",
        "In this paper we describe a supervised and also a semi-supervised method to discriminate the senses of partial cognates between French and English.",

        "The spelling can be identical or not, e.g., nature - nature, reconnaissance - recognition.",
        "False Friends (Faux Amis) are pairs of words in two languages that are perceived as similar but have different meanings, e.g., main (= hand) - main (= principal or essential), blesser (= to injure) - bless (= bénir).",
        "Partial Cognates are pairs of words that have the same meaning in both languages in some but not all contexts.",
        "They behave as cognates or as false friends, depending on the sense that is used in each context.",
        "For example, in French, facteur means not only factor, but also mailman, while étiquette can also mean label or sticker, in addition to the cognate sense.",
        "Genetic Cognates are word pairs in related languages that derive directly from the same word in the ancestor (proto-)language.",
        "Because of gradual phonetic and semantic changes over long periods of time, genetic cognates often differ in form and/or meaning, e.g., père - father, chef - head.",

        "They report an accuracy of 74%.",
        "One of the most active researchers in identifying cognates between pairs of languages is Kondrak (2001; 2004).",
        "His work is more related to the phonetic aspect of cognate identification.",
        "He used in his work algorithms that combine different orthographic and phonetic measures, recurrent sound correspondences, and some semantic similarity based on glosses overlap.",
        "Guy (1994) identified letter correspondence between words and estimates the likelihood of relatedness.",
        "No semantic component is present in the system, the words are assumed to be already matched by their meanings.",

        "WSD is a task that has attracted researchers since 1950 and it is still a topic of high interest.",
        "Determining the sense of an ambiguous word, using bootstrapping and texts from a different language was done by Yarowsky (1995), Hearst (1991), Diab (2002), and Li and Li (2004).",
        "Yarowsky (1995) has used a few seeds and untagged sentences in a bootstrapping algorithm based on decision lists.",
        "He added two constrains – words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation.",
        "He reported high accuracy scores for a set of 10 words.",
        "The monolingual bootstrapping approach was also used by Hearst (1991), who used a small set of hand-labeled data to bootstrap from a larger corpus for training a noun disambiguation system for English.",
        "Unlike Yarowsky (1995), we use automatic collection of seeds.",
        "Besides our monolingual bootstrapping technique, we also use bilingual bootstrapping.",
        "Diab (2002) has shown that unsupervised WSD systems that use parallel corpora can achieve results that are close to the results of a supervised approach.",
        "She used parallel corpora in French, English, and Spanish, automatically-produced with MT tools to determine cross-language lexicalization sets of target words.",
        "The major goal of her work was to perform monolingual English WSD.",
        "Evaluation was performed on the nouns from the English all words data in Senseval2.",
        "Additional knowledge was added to the system",
        "from WordNet in order to improve the results.",
        "In our experiments we use the parallel data in a different way: we use words from parallel sentences as features for Machine Learning (ML).",
        "Li and Li (2004) have shown that word translation and bilingual bootstrapping is a good combination for disambiguation.",
        "They were using a set of 7 pairs of Chinese and English words.",
        "The two senses of the words were highly distinctive: e.g. bass as fish or music; palm as tree or hand.",
        "Our work described in this paper shows that monolingual and bilingual bootstrapping can be successfully used to disambiguate partial cognates between two languages.",
        "Our approach differs from the ones we mentioned before not only from the point of human effort needed to annotate data – we require almost none, and from the way we use the parallel data to automatically collect training examples for machine learning, but also by the fact that we use only off-the-shelf tools and resources: free MT and ML tools, and parallel corpora.",
