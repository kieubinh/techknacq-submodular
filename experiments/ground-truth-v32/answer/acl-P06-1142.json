        "In applications such as cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT), there is an increasing need to translate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for example from an alphabetical language to Chinese.",
        "Foreign proper names constitute a good portion of OOV words, which are translated into Chinese through transliteration.",
        "Transliteration is a process of translating a foreign word into a native language by preserving its pronunciation in the original language, otherwise known as translation-by-sound.",
        "MT and CLIR systems rely heavily on bilingual lexicons, which are typically compiled manually.",
        "However, in view of the current information explosion, it is labor intensive, if not impossible, to compile a complete proper nouns lexicon.",
        "The Web is growing at a fast pace and is providing a live information source that is rich in transliterations.",
        "This paper presents a novel solution for automatically constructing an English-Chinese transliteration lexicon from the Web.",
        "Research on automatic transliteration has reported promising results for regular transliteration (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Li et al., 2004), where transliterations follow rigid guidelines.",
        "However, in Web publishing, translators in different countries and regions may not observe common guidelines.",
        "They often skew the transliterations in different ways to create special meanings to the sound equivalents, resulting in casual transliterations.",
        "In this case, the common generative models (Li et al., 2004) fail to predict the transliteration most of the time.",
        "For example, “Coca Cola” is transliterated into “ Vii' [ I Vii' V /Ke-Kou-Ke-Le/” as a sound equivalent in Chinese, which literately means “happiness in the mouth”.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in constructing lexicons that cover both regular and casual transliterations.",
        "When a new English word is first introduced, many transliterations are invented.",
        "Most of them are casual transliterations because a regular transliteration typically does not have many variations.",
        "After a while, the transliterations converge into one or two popular ones.",
        "For example, “Taxi” becomes “ P'J :1 /Di-Shi/” in China and “ 1 :1 /De-Shi/” in Singapore.",
        "Therefore, the adequacy of a transliteration entry could be judged by its popularity and its conformity with the translation-by-sound principle.",
        "In any case, the phonetic similarity should serve as the primary basis of judgment.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly introduce prior works pertaining to machine transliteration.",
        "In Section 3, we propose a phonetic similarity model (PSM) for confidence scoring of transliteration.",
        "In Section 4, we propose an adaptive learning process for PSM modeling and lexicon construction.",
        "In Section 5, we conduct experiments to evaluate different adaptive learning strategies.",
        "Finally, we conclude in Section 6."

        "In general, studies of transliteration fall into two categories: transliteration modeling (TM) and extraction of transliteration pairs (EX) from corpora.",
        "The TM approach models phoneme-based or grapheme-based mapping rules using a generative model that is trained from a large bilingual lexicon, with the objective of translating unknown words on the fly.",
        "The efforts are centered on establishing the phonetic relationship between transliteration pairs.",
        "Most of these works are devoted to phoneme1-based transliteration modeling (Wan and Verspoor 1998, Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "Suppose that EW is an English word and CW is its prospective Chinese transliteration.",
        "The phoneme-based approach first converts EW into an intermediate phonemic representation P, and then converts the phonemic representation into its Chinese counterpart CW.",
        "In this way, EW and CW form an EC transliteration pair.",
        "In this approach, we model the transliteration using two conditional probabilities, P(CWMP) and P(PMEW), in a generative model P(CWMEW) = P(CWMP)P(PMEW).",
        "Meng (2001) proposed a rule-based mapping approach.",
        "Virga and Khudanpur (2003) and Kuo et al. (2005) adopted the noisy-channel modeling framework.",
        "Li et al. (2004) took a different approach by introducing a joint source-channel model for direct orthography mapping (DOM), which treats transliteration as a statistical machine translation problem under monotonic constraints.",
        "The DOM approach, which is a grapheme-based approach, significantly outperforms the phoneme-based approaches in regular transliterations.",
        "It is noted that the state-of-the-art accuracy reported by Li et al. (2004) for regular transliterations of the Xinhua database is about 70.1%, which leaves much room for improvement if one expects to use a generative model to construct a lexicon for casual transliterations.",
        "EX research is motivated by information retrieval techniques, where people attempt to extract transliteration pairs from corpora.",
        "The EX approach aims to construct a large and up-to-date transliteration lexicon from live corpora.",
        "Towards this objective, some have proposed extracting translation pairs from parallel or comparable bitext using co-occurrence analysis",
        "or a context-vector approach (Fung and Yee, 1998; Nie et al., 1999).",
        "These methods compare the semantic similarities between words without taking their phonetic similarities into accounts.",
        "Lee and Chang (2003) proposed using a probabilistic model to identify EC pairs from aligned sentences using phonetic clues.",
        "Lam et al. (2004) proposed using semantic and phonetic clues to extract EC pairs from comparable corpora.",
        "However, these approaches are subject to the availability of parallel or comparable bitext.",
        "A method that explores non-aligned text was proposed by harvesting katakana-English pairs from query logs (Brill et al., 2001).",
        "It was discovered that the unsupervised learning of such a transliteration model could be overwhelmed by noisy data, resulting in a decrease in model accuracy.",
        "Many efforts have been made in using Web-based resources for harvesting transliteration/ translation pairs.",
        "These include exploring query logs (Brill et al., 2001), unrelated corpus (Rapp, 1999), and parallel or comparable corpus (Fung and Yee, 1998; Nie et al., 1999; Huang et al. 2005).",
        "To establish correspondence, these algorithms usually rely on one or more statistical clues, such as the correlation between word frequencies, cognates of similar spelling or pronunciations.",
        "They include two aspects.",
        "First, a robust mechanism that establishes statistical relationships between bilingual words, such as a phonetic similarity model which is motivated by the TM research; and second, an effective learning framework that is able to adaptively discover new events from the Web.",
        "In the prior work, most of the phonetic similarity models were trained on a static lexicon.",
        "In this paper, we address the EX problem by exploiting a novel Web-based resource.",
        "We also propose a phonetic similarity model that generates confidence scores for the validation of EC pairs.",
        "In Chinese webpages, translated or transliterated terms are frequently accompanied by their original Latin words.",
        "The latter serve as the appositives of the former.",

        "example above, “Content to Community” is not a transliteration of C2C, but rather an acronym expansion, while “庫洛 /Ku-Luo/”, as underlined, presents a transliteration for “Kuro”.",
        "What is important is that the EC pairs are always closely collocated.",
        "Inspired by this observation, we propose an algorithm that searches over the close context of an English word in a bilingual snippet for the word’s transliteration candidates.",

        "Although active unsupervised learning was reported having promising results (Riccardi and Hakkani-Tur, 2003) in some NLP tasks, it has not been as effective as active learning alone in this experiment probably due to the fact the unlabeled high confidence candidates are still too noisy to be informative."
