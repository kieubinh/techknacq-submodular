        "Temporal expressions (timexes) are natural language phrases that refer directly to time points or intervals.",
        "They not only convey temporal information on their own but also serve as anchors for locating events referred to in a text.",
        "Timex recognition is a named entity recognition (NER) task to which a variety of natural language processing and machine learning techniques have been applied.",
        "As with other NER",
        "tasks, timex recognition is naturally viewed as a sequence labeling task, easily lending itself to machine learning techniques such as conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "A preliminary experiment showed that, using CRFs, a respectable recognition performance can easily be achieved with a straightforward baseline system that is based on a simple tagging scheme and requires very little tuning, yielding F-scores around 0.78 (exact match) or even 0.90 (partial match).",
        "Interestingly, these high scores are mainly due to high or even very high precision scores, while recall leaves much to be improved.",
        "The main focus of this paper is on boosting recall while maintaining precision at an acceptable (i.e., high) level.",
        "We report on two types of experiments aimed at achieving this goal.",
        "One type concerns feature engineering and the other concerns post-processing the output of a machine learner.",
        "While we do exploit the special nature of timexes, for portability reasons we avoid using task-specific and richer linguistic features (POS, chunks, etc.).",
        "Instead, we focus on features and techniques that can readily be applied to other NER tasks.",
        "Specifically, our feature engineering experiments have two facets.",
        "The first concerns identification of a set of simple features that results in high generalization ability (accuracy).",
        "Here, particular emphasis will be placed on the use of a list of core timexes as a feature.",
        "The assumption is that the performance of data-driven approaches for timex recognition can be improved by taking into account the peculiar properties of timexes.",
        "Timexes exhibit various patterns, ranging from regular patterns that can easily be captured using simple regular expressions to complex linguistic forms (phrases).",
        "While timexes are real",
        "ized in different phrase types, the core lexical items of timexes are restricted.",
        "This suggests that a list of core timexes can easily be compiled and used in machine learning-based timex recognition.",
        "One approach of integrating such a list is using them to generate features, but the availability of such a list also opens up other possibilities in feature design that we present in later sections.",
        "The second aspect concerns the tagging scheme.",
        "As in most NER experiments, the task of recognizing timexes is reduced to tagging.",
        "Commonly used tagging schemes are Inside-Outside (IO) and Begin-Continue-End-Unique-Negative (BCEUN) (Borthwick et al., 1998).",
        "The IO tagging scheme, which we use as a baseline, assigns the tag I to a token if it is part of a timex and O otherwise.",
        "The richer BCEUN scheme assigns the five tags B, C, E, U, and N to tokens depending on whether the token is single-token timex (U), a non-timex (N), appears at the beginning (B), at the end (E) or inside a timex boundary (C).",
        "In this paper, we compare the IO, BCEUN and an extended form of the BCEUN tagging scheme.",
        "The extended scheme adds two tags, PRE and POST, to the BCEUN scheme, which correspond to tokens appearing to the left and to the right of a timex.",
        "In contrast, our post-processing experiments investigate the application of the list of core timexes for filtering the output of a machine learner.",
        "The incorporation into the recognition process of explicit knowledge in the form of a list for post-processing requires a carefully designed strategy to ensure that the important properties of the trained model are kept intact as much as possible while at the same-time improving overall results.",
        "We present an approach for using a list for post-processing that exploits the knowledge embodied in the trained model.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we provide background material, both on the timex extraction task (§2.1) and on the machine learning techniques on which we build in this paper, conditional random fields (§2.2).",
        "Our ideas on engineering feature sets and tagging schemes are presented in Section 3, while we describe our method for exploiting the explicit knowledge contained in a list in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we describe the experimental setup and present the results of our experiments.",

        "One important problem that we have identified is that timexes headed by core lexical items on the list may be missed.",
        "This is either due to the fact that some of these lexical items are semantically ambiguous and appear in a non-temporal sense, or the training material does not cover the particular context.",
        "In such cases, a reliable list of core timexes can be used to identify the missing timexes.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we have created a list containing mainly headwords of timexes.",
        "These words are called trigger words since they are good indicators of the presence of temporal expressions.",
        "How can we use trigger words?",
        "Before describing our method in some detail, we briefly describe a more naive (and problematic) approach.",
        "Observe that trigger words usually appear in a text along with their complements or adjuncts.",
        "As a result, picking only these words will usually contribute to token recall but span precision is likely to drop.",

        "But if one limits the search to a window of size n (n < 6), sequential search will be feasible.",
        "The method, then, works on the output of the system.",

        "(3) The chairman arrived in the city yesterday-U , and will leave next week.",
        "The press conference will be held tomorrow-B afternoon-E .",
        "According to (3), the system recognizes only ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow afternoon’ but misses ‘next week’.",
        "Assuming our list of timexes contains the word ‘week’, it tells us that there is a missing temporal expression, headed by ‘week.’ The naive method is to go through the above output sequence and change the token-tag pair ‘week-N’ to ‘week-U’.",
        "This procedure recognizes the token ‘week’ as a valid temporal expression, but this is not correct: the valid temporal expression is ‘next week’.",
        "We now describe a second approach to incorporating the knowledge contained in a list of core lexical timexes as a post-processing device.",
        "To illustrate our ideas, take the complete sequence in (3) and extract the following segment, which is a window of 7 tokens centered at ‘week’.",

        "Of course, the best sequence will still assign both ‘next’ and ‘week’ the N tag since the underlying parameters (feature sets and the associated weights) are the same as the ones in the system.",
        "However, since the word sequence in (4) is now short (contains only 7 words) we can maintain a list of all possible tag sequences for it and perform a sequential search for the next best sequence, which assigns the ‘week’ token a non-negative tag.",
        "Assume the new tag sequence looks as follows: (5) ... [will leave next-B week-E.",
        "The press] ...",
        "This tag sequence will then be placed back into the original sequence resulting in (6):",
        "(6) The chairman arrived in the city yesterday-U , and will leave next-B week-E .",
        "The press conference will be held tomorrow-B afternoon-E .",
        "In this case, all the temporal expressions will be extracted since the token sequence ‘next week’ is properly tagged.",

        ".",
        "will leave next week-C .-E The press ...",
        "The final extraction step will not return any timex since none of the candidate sequences in (7) contains a valid tag sequence.",
        "The assumption here is that of all the tag sequences, which assign the token ‘week’ a non-negative tag, those tag sequences which contain the segment ‘next-B week-E’ are likely to receive a higher weight since the underlying system is trained to recognize temporal expressions and the phrase ‘next week’ is a likely temporal expression.",
        "This way, we hypothesize, it is possible to exploit the knowledge embodied in the trained model.",
        "As pointed out previously, simply going through the list and picking only head words like ‘week’ will not guarantee that the extracted tokens form a valid temporal expression.",
        "On the other hand, the above heuristics, which relies on the trained model, is likely to pick the adjunct ‘next’.",
        "The post-processing method we have just outlined boils down to reclassifying a small segment of a complete sequence using the same parameters (feature sets and associated weights) as the original model, and keeping all possible candidate sequences and searching through them to find a valid sequence."

        "This in turn allows one to incorporate segment based-features, e.g., segment length, and also facilitates integration of external dictionaries since segments are more likely to match the entries of an external dictionary than tokens.",
        "In this paper, we stuck to conventional CRFs, which are computationally less expensive, and introduced post-processing techniques, which takes into account knowledge embodied in the trained model.",
        "Kristjannson et al.",
        "(2004) introduced constrained CRFs (CCRFs), a model which returns an optimal label sequence that fulfills a set of constraints imposed by the user.",
        "The model is meant to be used in an interactive information extraction environment, in which the system extracts structured information (fields) from a text and presents it to the user, and the user makes the necessary correction and submits it back to the system.",
        "These corrections constitute an additional set of constraints for CCRFs.",
        "CCRFs recomputes the optimal sequence by taking these constraints into account.",
        "The method is shown to reduce the number of user interactions required in validating the extracted information.",
        "In a very limited sense our approach is similar to this work.",
        "The list of core lexical timexes that we use represents the set of constraints on the output of the underlying system.",
        "However, our method differs in the way in which the constraints are implemented.",
        "In our case, we take a segment of the whole sequence that contains a missing timex, and reclassify the words in this segment while keeping all possible tag sequences sorted based on their weights.",
        "We then",
        "search for the next optimal sequence that assigns the missing timex a non-negative tag sequentially.",
        "On the other hand, Kristjannson et al.",
        "(2004) take the whole sequence and recompute an optimal sequence that satisfies the given constraints.",
        "The constraints are a set of states which the resulting optimal sequence should include."

        "The use of a list of timexes both during training and for post-processing resulted in improved recall whereas the use of a more complex tagging scheme results in better precision.",
        "Their individual overall contribution to the recognition performances is limited or even negative whereas their combination resulted in substantial improvements over the baseline.",
        "While we exploited the special nature of timexes, we did avoid using linguistic features (POS, chunks, etc.",
        "), and we did so for portability reasons.",
        "We focused exclusively on features and techniques that can readily be applied to other named entity recognition tasks.",
        "For instance, the basic and list features can also be used in NER tasks such as PERSON, LOCATION, etc.",
        "Moreover, the way that we have used a list of core expressions for post-processing is also task-independent, and it can easily be applied for other NER tasks."
