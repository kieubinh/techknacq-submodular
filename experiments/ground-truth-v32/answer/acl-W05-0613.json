        "Achieving a model of discourse interpretation that is both robust and deep is a major challenge.",
        "Consider the dialogue in Figure 1 (the sentence numbers are from the Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2002)).",
        "A robust and deep interpretation of it should resolve the anaphoric temporal description in utterance 154 to the twenty sixth of July in the afternoon.",
        "It should identify that time and before 3pm on the twenty-seventh as potential times to meet, while ruling out July thirtieth to August third.",
        "It should gracefully handle incomplete or ungrammatical utterances like 152 and recognise that utterances 151 and 152 have no overall effect on the time and place to meet.",
        "According to Hobbs et al.",
        "(1993) and Asher and Lascarides (2003), a discourse structure consisting of hierarchical rhetorical connections between utterances is vital for providing a unified model of a wide",
        "range of anaphoric and intentional discourse phenomena, contributing to the interpretations of pronouns, temporal expressions, presuppositions and ellipses (among others), as well as influencing communicative goals.",
        "This suggests that a robust model of discourse structure could complement current robust interpretation systems, which tend to focus on only one aspect of the semantically ambiguous material, such as pronouns (e.g., Str¨ube and M¨uller (2003)), definite descriptions (e.g., Vieira and Poe-sio (2000)), or temporal expressions (e.g., Wiebe et al.",
        "(1998)).",
        "This specialization makes it hard to assess how they would perform in the context of a more comprehensive set of interpretation tasks.",
        "To date, most methods for constructing discourse structures are not robust.",
        "They typically rely on grammatical input and use symbolic methods which inevitably lack coverage.",
        "One exception is Marcu’s work (Marcu, 1997, 1999) (see also Soricut and Marcu (2003) for constructing discourse structures for individual sentences).",
        "Marcu (1999) uses a decision-tree learner and shallow syntactic features",
        "to create classifiers for discourse segmentation and for identifying rhetorical relations.",
        "Together, these amount to a model of discourse parsing.",
        "However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992).",
        "Furthermore, RST does not offer an account of how compositional semantics gets augmented, nor does it model anaphora.",
        "It is also designed for monologue rather than dialogue, so it does not offer a precise semantics of questions or non-sentential utterances which convey propositional content (e.g., 154 and 155 in Figure 1).",
        "Another main approach to robust dialogue processing has been statistical models for identifying dialogue acts (e.g., Stolcke et al.",
        "(2000)).",
        "However, dialogue acts are properties of utterances rather than hierarchically arranged relations between them, so they do not provide a basis for resolving semantic underspecification generated by the grammar (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "Here, we present the first probabilistic approach to parsing the discourse structure of dialogue.",
        "We use dialogues from Redwoods’ appointment scheduling domain and adapt head-driven generative parsing strategies from sentential parsing (e.g., Collins (2003)) for discourse parsing.",
        "The discourse structures we build conform to Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "SDRT provides a precise dynamic semantic interpretation for its discourse structures which augments the conventional semantic representations that are built by most grammars.",
        "We thus view the task of learning a model of SDRT-style discourse structures as one step towards achieving the goal of robust and precise semantic interpretations.",
        "We describe SDRT in the context of our domain in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 discusses how we encode and annotate discourse structures as headed trees for our domain.",
        "Section 4 provides background on probabilistic head-driven parsing models, and Section 5 describes how we adapt the approach for discourse and gives four models for discourse parsing.",
        "We report results in Section 6, which show the importance of dialogue-based features on performance.",
        "Our best model performs far better than a baseline that uses the most frequent rhetorical relations and right-branching segmentation."

      "text": [
        "SDRT extends prior work in dynamic semantics (e.g., van Eijk and Kamp (1997)) via logical forms that feature rhetorical relations.",
        "The logical forms consist of speech act discourse referents which label content (either of a clause or of text segments).",
        "Rhetorical relations such as Explanation relate these referents.",
        "The resulting structures are called segmented discourse representation structures or SDRSs.",
        "An SDRS for the dialogue in Figure 1 is given in Figure 2; we have used the numbers of the elementary utterances from Redwoods as the speech act discourse referents but have omitted their labelled logical forms.",
        "Note that utterances 151 and 152, which do not contribute to the truth conditions of the dialogue, are absent – we return to this shortly.",
        "There are several things to note about this SDRS.",
        "First, SDRT’s dynamic semantics of rhetorical relations imposes constraints on the contents of its arguments.",
        "For example, Plan-Elab(150, h1) (standing for Plan-Elaboration) means that h1 provides information from which the speaker of 150 can elaborate a plan to achieve their communicative goal (to meet for two hours in the next couple of weeks).",
        "The relation Plan-Elab contrasts with Plan-Correction, which would relate the utterances in dialogue (1):",
        "(1) a.",
        "A: Can we meet at the weekend?",
        "b.",
        "B: I’m afraid I’m busy then.",
        "Plan-Correction holds when the content of the second utterance in the relation indicates that its communicative goals conflict with those of the first one.",
        "In this case, A indicates he wants to meet next weekend, and B indicates that he does not (note that then resolves to the weekend).",
        "Utterances (1ab) would also be related with IQAP (Indirect Question Answer",
        "Pair): this means that (1b) provides sufficient information for the questioner A to infer a direct answer to his question (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "The relation Elaboration(153, h2) in Figure 2 means that the segment 154 to 155 resolves to a proposition which elaborates part of the content of the proposition 153.",
        "Therefore the twenty sixth in 154 resolves to the twenty sixth of July – any other interpretation contradicts the truth conditional consequences of Elaboration.",
        "Alternation (154, 155) has truth conditions similar to (dynamic) disjunction.",
        "Continuation (156, 157) means that 156 and 157 have a common topic (here, this amounts to a proposition about when CAE is unavailable to meet).",
        "The second thing to note about Figure 2 is how one rhetorical relation can outscope another: this creates a hierarchical segmentation of the discourse.",
        "For example, the second argument to the Elaboration relation is the label h2 of the Alternation-segment relating 154 to 155.",
        "Due to the semantics of Elaboration and Alternation, this ensures that the dialogue entails that one of 154 or 155 is true, but it does not entail 154, nor 155.",
        "Finally, observe that SDRT allows for a situation where an utterance connects to more than one subsequent utterance, as shown here with Elaboration (153, h2) n Continuation(153,156).",
        "In fact, SDRT also allows two utterances to be related by multiple relations (see (1)) and it allows an utterance to rhetorically connect to multiple utterances in the context.",
        "These three features of SDRT capture the fact that an utterance can make more than one illo-cutionary contribution to the discourse.",
        "An example of the latter kind of structure is given in (2):",
        "(2) a.",
        "A: Shall we meet on Wednesday?",
        "b.",
        "A: How about one pm?",
        "c. B: Would one thirty be OK with you?",
        "The SDRS for this dialogue would feature the relations Plan Correction (2b, 2c), IQAP(2b, 2c) and Q-Elab(2a, 2c).",
        "Q-Elab, or Question-Elaboration, always takes a question as its second argument; any answers to the question must elaborate a plan to achieve the communicative goal underlying the first argument to the relation.",
        "From a logical perspective, recognising Plan Correction (2b, 2c) and Q-Elab(2a, 2c) are codependent."

      "text": [
        "Our starting point is to create training material for probabilistic discourse parsers.",
        "For this, we have augmented dialogues from the Redwoods Treebank (Oepen et al., 2002) with their analyses within a fragment of SDRT (Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005).",
        "This is a very different effort from that being pursued for the Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004), which uses discourse connectives rather than abstract rhetorical relations like those in SDRT in order to provide theory neutral annotations.",
        "Our goal is instead to leverage the power of the semantics provided by SDRT’s relations, and in particular to do so for dialogue as opposed to monologue.",
        "Because the SDRS-representation scheme, as shown in Figure 2, uses graph structures that do not conform to tree constraints, it cannot be combined directly with statistical techniques from sentential parsing.",
        "We have therefore designed a headed tree encoding of SDRSs, which can be straightforwardly modeled with standard parsing techniques and from which SDRSs can be recovered.",
        "For instance, the tree for the dialogue in Figure 1 is given in Figure 3.",
        "The SDRS in Figure 2 is recovered automatically from it.",
        "In this tree, utterances are leaves which are immediately dominated by their tag, indicating either the sentence mood (indicative, interrogative or imperative) or that it is irrelevant, a pause or a pleasantry (e.g., hello), annotated as pls.",
        "Each non-terminal node has a unique head daughter: this is either a Segment node, Pass node, or a",
        "leaf utterance tagged with its sentence mood.",
        "Nonterminal nodes may in addition have any number of daughter irr, pause and pls nodes, and an additional daughter labelled with a rhetorical relation.",
        "The notion of headedness has no status in the semantics of SDRSs themselves.",
        "The heads of these discourse trees are not like verbal heads with sub-categorization requirements in syntax; here, they are nothing more than the left argument of a rhetorical relation, like 154 in Alternation (154, 155).",
        "Nonetheless, defining one of the arguments of rhetorical relations as a head serves two main purposes.",
        "First, it enables a fully deterministic algorithm for recovering SDRSs from these trees.",
        "Second, it is also crucial for creating probabilistic head-driven parsing models for discourse structure.",
        "Segment and Pass are non-rhetorical node types.",
        "The former explicitly groups multiple utterances.",
        "The latter allows its head daughter to enter into relations with segments higher in the tree.",
        "This allows us to represent situations where an utterance attaches to more than one subsequent utterance, such as 153 in dialogue (1).",
        "Annotators manually annotate the rhetorical relation, Segment and Pass nodes and determine their daughters.",
        "They also tag the individual utterances with one of the three sentence moods or irr, pause or pls.",
        "The labels for segments (e.g., h0 and h1 in Figure 3) are added automatically.",
        "Non-veridical relations such as Alternation also introduce segment labels on their parents; e.g., h2 in Figure 3.",
        "The SDRS is automatically recovered from this tree representation as follows.",
        "First, each relation node generates a rhetorical connection in the SDRS: its first argument is the discourse referent of its parent’s head daughter, and the second is the discourse referent of the node itself (which unless stated otherwise is its head daughter’s discourse referent).",
        "For example, the structure in Figure 3 yields Request-Elab(149,150), Alternation(154,155) and Elaboration (153, h2).",
        "The labels for the relations in the SDRS – which determine segmentation – must also be recovered.",
        "This is easily done: any node which has a segment label introduces an outscopes relation between that and the discourse referents of the node’s daughters.",
        "This produces, for example, outscopes(h0,149), outscopes(h1,153) and outscopes(h2,154).",
        "It is straightforward to determine the labels of all the rhetorical relations from these conditions.",
        "Utterances such as 151 and 152, which are attached with pause and irr to indicate that they have no overall truth conditional effect on the dialogue, are ignored when constructing the SDRS, so SDRT does not assign these terms any semantics.",
        "Overall, this algorithm generates the SDRS in Figure 2 from the tree in Figure 3.",
        "Thus far, 70 dialogues have been annotated and reviewed to create our gold-standard corpus.",
        "On average, these dialogues have 237.5 words, 31.5 utterances, and 8.9 speaker turns.",
        "In all, there are 30 different rhetorical relations in the inventory for this annotation task, and 6 types of tags for the utterances themselves: ind, int, imp, pause, irr and pls.",
        "Finally, we annotated all 6,000 utterances in the Verbmobil portion of Redwoods with the following: whether the time mentioned (if there is one) is a good time to meet (e.g., I’m free then or Shall we meet at 2pm?)",
        "or a bad time to meet (e.g., I’m busy then or Let’s avoid meeting at the weekend).",
        "These are used as features in our model of discourse structure (see Section 5).",
        "We use these so as to minimise using directly detailed features from the utterances themselves (e.g. the fact that the utterance contains the word free or busy, or that it contains a negation), which would lead to sparse data problems given the size of our training corpus.",
        "We ultimately aim to learn good-time and bad-time from sentence-level features extracted from the 6,000 Redwoods analyses, but we leave this to future work."

        "One of the most important developments in this work is that of Collins (2003).",
        "Collins created several lex-icalised head-driven generative parsing models that incorporate varying levels of structural information, such as distance features, the complement/adjunct distinction, subcategorization and gaps.",
        "These models are attractive for constructing our discourse trees, which contain heads that establish non-local dependencies in a manner similar to that in syntactic parsing.",
        "Also, the codependent tasks of determining segmentation and choosing the rhetorical connections are both heavily influenced by the content of",
        "the utterances/segments which are being considered, and lexicalisation allows the model to probabilistically relate such utterances/segments very directly.",
        "Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs) determine the conditional probability of a right-hand side of a rule given the left-hand side, P(RHS|LHS).",
        "Collins instead decomposes the calculation of such probabilities by first generating a head and then generating its left and right modifiers independently.",
        "In a supervised setting, doing this gathers a much larger set of rules from a set of labelled data than a standard PCFG, which learns only rules that are directly observed.",
        "The decomposition of a rule begins by noting that rules in a lexicalised PCFG have the form:",
        "where h is the head word, H(h) is the label of the head constituent, P(h) is its parent, and Li(li) and Ri(ri) are the n left and m right modifiers, respectively.",
        "It is also necessary to include STOP symbols Ln+1 and R.+1 on either side to allow the Markov process to properly model the sequences of modifiers.",
        "By assuming these modifiers are generated independently of each other but are dependent on the head and its parent, the probability of such expansions can be calculated as follows (where Ph, Pl and Pr are the probabilities for the head, left-modifiers and right-modifiers respectively):",
        "This provides the simplest of models.",
        "More conditioning information can of course be added from any structure which has already been generated.",

        "These models are well suited for our discourse parsing task.",
        "They are lexicalised, so there is a clear place in the discourse model for incorporating features from utterances: simply replace lexical heads with whole utterances, and exploit features from those utterances in discourse parsing in the same manner as lexical features are used in sentential parsing.",
        "Discourse trees contain a much wider variety of kinds of information than syntactic trees.",

        "It is the latter that ultimately matters for the discourse structures produced by the parser to be useful; nonetheless, the PARSEVAL scores do show that each model progressively improves on capturing the trees themselves, and that even Model 1 – as a syntactic model – is far superior to the baseline for capturing the overall form of the trees.",
        "We also compare our best model against two up-perbounds: (1) inter-annotator agreement on ten dialogues that were annotated independently and (2) the best annotator against the gold standard agreed upon after the independent annotation phase.",
        "For the first, the labelled/unlabelled relations f - scores are 50.3%/73.0% and for the latter, they are 75.3%/84.0% – this is similar to the performance on other discourse annotation projects, e.g., Carlson et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "On the same ten dialogues, Model 4 achieves 42.3%/64.9%.",
        "It is hard to compare these models with Marcu’s (1999) rhetorical parsing model.",
        "Unlike Marcu, we did not use a variety of corpora, have a smaller training corpus, are analysing dialogues as opposed to monologues, have a larger class of rhetorical relations, and obtain the elementary discourse units",
        "from the Redwoods annotations rather than estimating them.",
        "Even so, it is interesting that the scores reported in Marcu (1999) for labelled and unlabelled relations are similar to our scores for Model 4."

        "In this paper, we have shown how the complex task of creating structures for SDRT can be adapted to a standard probabilistic parsing task.",
        "This is achieved via a headed tree representation from which SDRSs can be recovered.",
        "This enables us to directly apply well-known probabilistic parsing algorithms and use features inspired by them.",
        "Our results show that using dialogue-based features are a major factor in improving the performance of the models, both in terms of determining segmentation appropriately and choosing the right relations to connect them.",
        "There is clearly a great deal of room for improvement, even with our best model.",
        "Even so, that model performed suf�ciently well for use in semiautomated annotation: when correcting the model’s output on ten dialogues, one annotator took 30 seconds per utterance, compared to 39 for another annotator working on the same dialogues with no aid.",
        "In future work, we intend to exploit an existing implementation of SDRT’s semantics (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002), which adopts theorem proving to infer resolutions of temporal anaphora and communicative goals from SDRSs for scheduling dialogues.",
        "This additional semantic content can in turn be added (semi-automatically) to a training corpus.",
        "This will provide further features for learning discourse structure and opportunities for learning anaphora and goal information directly."
