        "The ACL-2005 Workshop on Parallel Texts hosted a shared task on building statistical machine translation systems for four European language pairs: French–English, German–English, Spanish–English, and Finnish–English.",
        "Eleven groups participated in the event.",
        "This paper describes the goals, the task definition and resources, as well as results and some analysis.",
        "Statistical machine translation is currently the dominant paradigm in machine translation research.",
        "Annual competitions are held for Chinese–English and Arabic–English by NIST (sponsored by the US military funding agency DARPA), which creates a forum to present and compare novel ideas and leads to steady progress in the field.",
        "One of the advantages of statistical machine translation is that the currently applied methods are fairly language-independent.",
        "Building a new machine translation system for a new language pair is not much more than a matter of running a training process on a training corpus of parallel text (a text in one language paired with a translation in another).",
        "It is therefore possible to hold a competition where research groups have only a few weeks to build machine translation systems for language pairs that they have not previously worked on.",
        "We effectively demonstrated this with our shared task.",
        "For instance, seven teams built Finnish–English machine translation systems, a language pair that was certainly not of their immediate concern before.",
        "In contrast to the bigger NIST competition, we wanted to keep the barrier of entry as low as possible.",
        "We provided not only training data from the Eu-roparl corpus (Koehn, 2005), but also additional resources: sentence and word alignments, the decoder Pharaoh1 (Koehn, 2004b), and a language model, so that participation was feasible even as a graduate level class project.",
        "Using about 15 million words of translated text, participants were asked to build a phrase-based statistical machine translation system.",
        "The focus of the task was to build a probabilistic phrase translation table, since most of the other resources were provided – for more on phrase-based statistical machine translation, refer to Koehn et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The participants’ systems were compared by how well they translated 2000 previously unseen test sentences from the same domain.",
        "The shared task operated within an extremely short timeframe.",
        "The workshop and hence the shared task was accepted on February 22, 2005 and announced on March 3.",
        "The official test data was made available on April 3, results were due one week later.",
        "Despite this tight schedule, eleven research groups participated and built a total of 32 machine translation systems for the four language pairs."

      "heading": "1 Goals",
      "text": [
        "When setting up this competition, we were motivated by a number of goals.",
        "We set out to: Create a platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel ideas: The research community is easily balkanized, where different groups work on",
        "different data sets and under different conditions, so that it becomes often hard to assess, how effective a novel method is.",
        "By creating an environment with common test and training sets, language model, preprocessing, and even decoder, the effect of other model choices can be more easily demonstrated.",
        "Work on new language pairs, new problems: Different language pairs pose different challenges.",
        "We picked Finnish–English and German –English for the special problems of rich morphology, word order, which are a challenge to current phrase-based SMT methods.",
        "Enable more researchers to get engaged in SMT research: One of our main goals with providing as many resources as possible was to keep the barrier of entry low.",
        "Participants could use the word alignment and other resources and focus on phrase extraction.",
        "We hoped to attract researchers that are relatively new to the field.",
        "We were satisfied to learn that many entries are by graduate students working on their own.",
        "Promote and create free resources: Academic research thrives on freely available resources.",
        "The field of statistical machine translation has been blessed with a long tradition of freely available software tools – such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) – and parallel corpora – such as the Canadian Hansards 2.",
        "Following this lead, we made word alignments and a language model available for this competition in addition to our previously published resources (Europarl and Pharaoh).",
        "The competition created resources as well.",
        "Most teams agreed to share system output and their model files.",
        "You can download them from the competition web site3.",
        "Promote work on European language pairs: Finally, we wanted to promote work on European languages.",
        "The increasing economic and political ties within the European Union create a huge need for translation services.",
        "We would like to see researchers rise to the challenge of creating high quality machine translation systems to fill these needs.",
        "We are very grateful for the strong participation, especially by researchers who are relatively new to the field."

      "heading": "2 Rules of Engagement",
      "text": [
        "We set up a machine translation competition for four language pairs.",
        "We chose Spanish–English and French–English, because many researchers would be familiar with these languages.",
        "We chose German–English for its special problems with word order (such as nested constructions and split verb groups) and morphology.",
        "Finally, we picked Finnish–English for the rich agglutinative morphology of Finnish.",
        "Statistical machine translation systems are typically trained on sentence-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "We selected Europarl4, a freely available parallel corpus in eleven languages.",
        "In addition, we also made a word alignment available, which was derived using a variant of the current default method for word alignment – Och and Ney (2003)’s refined method.",
        "Figure 1 details some properties of the parallel corpora.",
        "The training corpus is most of the Europarl corpus, only the text of sessions from last quarter of the year 2000 was reserved for testing.",
        "The corpus has the size of roughly 15 million English words in 700,000 sentences – these numbers differ for each of the four parallel corpora due to the different number of discarded sentences during sentence alignment and after enforcing a 40 word length limit for sentences.",
        "The number of foreign words differs even more dramatically.",
        "The effect of Finnish morphology manifests itself in a low number of words (just over 11 million), but a high number of distinct words (more than 5 times as many as in the English half).",
        "The test corpus consists of 2000 sentences aligned across all five languages.",
        "Note that the output of each system is compared against the same English references for all source languages.",
        "The number of total words, distinct words, and words not seen in the training data reflects again the morphology effect.",
        "For researchers willing to create their own word alignment, we suggested the use of GIZA++5, an implementation of the IBM word-based machine translation models, which also assisted the creation of the provided word alignments.",
        "We trained a language model on the English part",
        "of the Europarl corpus using the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolke, 2002).",
        "Finally, we suggested the use of Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004b), a phrase-based machine translation decoder.",
        "How well does this setup match the state of the art?",
        "The MIT system using the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004a) proved to be very competitive in last year’s NIST evaluation.",
        "However, the field is moving fast, and a number of steps help to improve upon the provided baseline setup, e.g., larger language models trained on general text (up to a billion words have been used), better reodering models (e.g., suggested by Tillman (2004) and Och et al.",
        "(2004)), better language-specific preprocessing (Koehn and Knight, 2003) and restructuring (Collins et al., 2005), additional feature functions such as word class language models, and minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to optimize parameters.",
        "Some of these steps (e.g., improved reordering models) go beyond the current capabilities of Pharaoh.",
        "However, we are hopeful that freely available software continues to match or at least follow closely the state of the art.",
        "We announced the shared task on March 3, and provided all the resources mentioned above (also a development test corpus to track the quality of systems being developed).",
        "The test schedule called for the translation of 2000 sentence for each of the four language pairs in the week between April 3–10.",
        "We allowed late submissions up to April 17."

      "text": [
        "Eleven teams from eight institutions in Europe and North America participated, see Figure 2 for a complete list.",
        "The figure also indicates, if a team used the Pharaoh decoder (eight teams), the provided language model (seven teams) and the provided word alignment (four did, three of those with additional preprocessing or additional data).",
        "Translation performance was measured using the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures n-gram overlap with a reference translation.",
        "In our case, we only used a single reference translation, since the test set was taken from a held-out portion of the Europarl corpus.",
        "On the other hand we used a relatively large number of test sentences to guarantee that the BLEU results are stable despite the fact that we used only one reference translation for each sentence.",
        "Shared tasks like this one, of course, bring out the competitive spirit of participants and can draw criticisms about being a horse race.",
        "From an outside perspective, however, it is far more interesting to learn which methods and ideas proved to be successful, than who won the competition.",
        "Taking stock of the results – see Figure 3 – one observes a very packed field at the top.",
        "While the participants from the University of Washington produced the best translations for every single language pair, the distance to many other participant scores",
        "is within a BLEU percentage point or two.",
        "As one might have expected, the scores are best for Spanish and French, and worst for Finnish.",
        "Figure 4 shows some typical output of the submitted systems.",
        "The proceedings to the workshop include detailed system descriptions of all participants.",
        "Novel phrase extraction approaches were proposed, along with better preprocessing, language modeling, rescoring, and other ideas.",
        "We are certain that better performance can be achieved by combining some of the methods used by different participants.",
        "And hence, we would like to pose the challenge to the research community to build and test better systems using the provided resources.",
        "We will gladly list additional results on the competition web site."

        "We listed four potential changes: 70% of the re-spondends checked translation from English, 50% checked out of domain test data, 40% checked more language pairs, 0% checked fewer language pairs.",
        "Additional suggestions were: alternatives to the BLEU scoring method (maybe human judgment by participants themselves), transitive translation using pivot languages, translation of resource-poor languages, and more time to prepare for the task."

        "Given the short timeframe, one should view the system performances (albeit very competitive with the state of the art) as a baseline effort on the task of open domain text translation between European languages.",
        "We hope that future researchers will use the provided environment as a test bed for their machine translation systems.",
        "We will continue to publish any scores reported to us.",
