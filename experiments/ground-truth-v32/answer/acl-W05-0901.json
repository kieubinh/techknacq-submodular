        "People often prefer to read a summary of a text document, e.g., news headlines, scientific abstracts, movie previews and reviews, and meeting minutes.",
        "Correspondingly, the explosion of online textual material has prompted advanced research in document summarization.",
        "Although researchers have demonstrated that users can read summaries faster than full text (Mani et al., 2002) with some loss of accuracy, researchers have found it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the usefulness of summarization due to the low level of interannotator agreement in the gold standards that they have used.",
        "Definitive conclusions about the usefulness of summaries would provide justification for continued research and development of new summarization methods.",
        "To investigate the question of whether text summarization is useful in an extrinsic task, we examined human performance in a relevance assessment task using a human text surrogate (i.e. text intended to stand in the place of a document).",
        "We use single-document English summaries as these are sufficient for investigating task-based usefulness, although more elaborate surrogates are possible, e.g., those that span more than one document (Radev and McKeown, 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998).",
        "The next section motivates the need for developing a new framework for measuring task-based usefulness.",
        "Section 3 presents a novel extrinsic measure called Relevance-Prediction.",
        "Section 4 demonstrates that this is a more reliable measure than that of previous gold standard methods, e.g., the LDC-Agreement method used for SUMMAC-style evaluations, and that this reliability allows us to make stronger statistical statements about the benefits of summarization.",
        "We expect these findings to be important for future summarization evaluations.",
        "Section 5 presents the results of correlation between task usefulness and the Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metric (Lin and Hovy, 2003).1 While we show that ROUGE correlates with task usefulness (using our Relevance-Prediction measure), we detect a slight difference between informative, extractive headlines (containing words from the full document) and less informative, non-extractive “eye-catchers” (containing words that might not appear in the full document, and intended to entice a reader to read the entire document).",
        "Section 6 further highlights the importance of this point and discusses the implications for automatic evaluation of non-extractive summaries.",
        "To evaluate non-extractive summaries reliably, an automatic measure may require knowledge of sophisticated meaning units .2 It is our hope that the conclusions drawn herein will prompt investigation into more sophisticated automatic metrics as researchers shift their focus to non-extractive summaries."

        "In the past, assessments of usefulness involved a wide range of both intrinsic and extrinsic (task-based) measures (Sparck-Jones and Gallier, 1996).",
        "Intrinsic evaluations focus on coherence and informativeness (Jing et al., 1998) and often involve quality comparisons between automatic summaries and reference summaries that are predetermined to be of high quality.",
        "Human intrinsic measures determine quality by assessing document accuracy, fluency, and clarity.",
        "Automatic intrinsic measures such as ROUGE use n-gram scoring to produce rankings of summarization methods.",
        "Extrinsic evaluations concentrate on the use of summaries in a specific task, e.g., executing instructions, information retrieval, question answering, and relevance assessments (Mani, 2001).",
        "In relevance assessments, a user reads a topic or event description and judges relevance of a document to the topic/event based solely on its summary.",
        "These have been used in many large-scale extrinsic evaluations, e.g., SUMMAC (Mani et al., 2002) and the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) (Harman and Over, 2004).",
        "The task chosen for such evaluations must support a very high degree of interannotator agreement, i.e., consistent relevance decisions across subjects with respect to a predefined gold standard.",
        "Unfortunately, a consistent gold standard has not yet been reported.",
        "For example, in two previous studies (Mani, 2001; Tombros and Sanderson, 1998), users’ judgments were compared to “gold standard judgments” produced by members of the University of Pennsylva-nia’s Linguistic Data Consortium.",
        "Although these judgments were supposed to represent the correct relevance judgments for each of the documents associated with an event, both studies reported that annotators’ judgments varied greatly and that this was a significant issue for the evaluations.",
        "In the SUMMAC experiments, the Kappa score (Carletta, 1996; Eugenio and Glass, 2004) for in-terannotator agreement was reported to be 0.38 (Mani et al., 2002).",
        "In fact, large variations have been found in the initial summary scoring of an individual participant and a subsequent scoring that occurs a few weeks later (Mani, 2001; van Halteren and Teufel, 2003).",
        "This paper attempts to overcome the problem of in-terannotator inconsistency by measuring summary effectiveness in an extrinsic task using a much more consistent form of user judgment instead of a gold standard.",
        "Using Relevance-Prediction increases the confidence in our results and strengthens the statistical statements we can make about the benefits of summarization.",
        "The next section describes an alternative approach to measuring task-based usefulness, where the usage of external judgments as a gold standard is replaced by the",
        "user’s own decisions on the full text.",
        "Following the lead of earlier evaluations (Oka and Ueda, 2000; Mani et al., 2002; Sakai and Sparck-Jones, 2001), we focus on relevance assessment as our extrinsic task."

        "For each event, the subjects were given a description of the event (written by LDC) and then asked to judge relevance of a set of 20 documents associated with that event (using three different presentation types to be discussed below).",
        "The events used from the TDT data set were events from world news occurring in 1998.",

        "A second hypothesis is that the HEAD surrogates would yield a significantly lower agreement rate than that of the HUM surrogates.",
        "Our commissioned HUM surrogates were written to stand in place of the full document, whereas the HEAD surrogates were written to catch a reader’s interest.",

        "Our results suggest that ROUGE may be sensitive to the style of summarization that is used.",
        "As we observed above, many of the HEAD surrogates were not actually summaries of the full text, but were eye-catchers.",
        "Often, these surrogates did not allow the subject to judge relevance correctly, resulting in lower agreement.",
        "In addition, these same surrogates often did not use a high percentage of words that were actually from the story, resulting in low ROUGE scores.",
        "(We noticed that most words in the HUM surrogates appeared in the corresponding stories.)",
        "There were three consequences of this difference between HEAD and HUM: (1) The rate of agreement was lower for HEAD than for HUM; (2) The average ROUGE score was lower for HEAD than for HUM; and (3) The correlation of ROUGE scores with agreement was higher for HEAD than for HUM.",
        "A further analysis supports the (somewhat counterintuitive) third point above.",
        "Although the ROUGE scores of true positives (and true negatives) were significantly lower for HEAD surrogates (0.2127 and 0.2162) than for HUM surrogates (0.2696 and 0.2715), the number of false negatives was substantially higher for HEAD surrogates than for HUM surrogates.",
        "These cases corresponded to much lower ROUGE scores for HEAD surrogates (0.1996) than for HUM (0.2586) surrogates.",
        "A summary of this analysis is given in Table 6, where true positives and negatives are indicated by Rel/Rel and NonRel/NonRel, respectively, and false positives and negatives are indicated by Rel/NonRel and NonRel/Rel, respectively.10 The numbers in parentheses after each ROUGE score refer to the standard deviation for that Surrogate P =1 P=2 P=4 10We also included (average) elapsed times for summary judgments in each of the four categories.",
        "One might expect a “relevant” judgment to be much quicker than a “non-relevant” judgment (since the latter might require reading the full summary).",
        "However, it turned out non-relevant judgments did not always take longer.",
        "In fact, the NonRel/NonRel cases took considerably less time than the Rel/Rel and Rel/NonRel cases.",
        "On the other hand, the NonRel/Rel cases took considerably more time – almost as much time as reading the full text documents – an indication that the subjects may have reread the summary a number of times, perhaps vacillating back and forth.",

        "Although there were very few false positives (less than 6% for both HEAD and HUM), the number of false negatives (NonRel/Rel) was particularly high for HEAD (50% higher than for HUM).",
        "This difference was statistically The large number ated with the lowest average ROUGE score (0.1996), we speculate that, if a correlation exists between Relevance-Prediction and ROUGE, the false negatives may be a major contributing factor.",
        "Based on this experiment, we conjecture that ROUGE may not be a good method for measuring the usefulness of summaries when the summaries are not extractive.",
        "That is, if someone intentionally writes summaries that contain different words than the story, the summaries will also likely contain different words than a reference summary, resulting in low ROUGE scores.",
        "However, We have shown that two types of human summaries, HEAD and HUM, can be useful for relevance assessment in that they help a user achieve 70-85% agreement in rel-evancejudgments.",
        "We observed a 65% reduction in judgment time between full texts and summaries.",
        "These findings are important in that they establish the usefulness of summarization and they support research and development of additional summarization methods, including automatic methods.",
        "We introduced a new method for measuring agreement, Relevance-Prediction, which takes a subject’s full-text judgment as the standard against which the same subject’s summary judgment is measured.",
        "Because Relevance-Prediction was more reliable than LDC-Agreement judgments, we encourage others to use this measure in future summarization evaluations.",
        "Using this new method, we were able to find positive correlations between relevance assessments and ROUGE scores for HUM and HEAD surrogates, where only",
        "negative correlations were found using LDC-Agreement scores.",
        "We found that both the Relevance-Prediction and the ROUGE-1 scores were higher for human-generated summaries than for the original headlines.",
        "It appears that most of the difference is induced by surrogates that are eye-catchers (rather than true summaries), where both agreement and ROUGE scores are low.",
        "Our future work will include further experimentation with automatic summarization methods to determine the level of Relevance-Prediction.",
        "We aim to determine how well automatic summarizers help users complete tasks, and to investigate which automatic summarizers perform better than others.",
        "We also plan to test for correlations between ROUGE and human task performance with automatic summaries, to further investigate whether ROUGE is a good predictor of human task performance."
