        "Most existing NLG systems assume that generated texts are read by proficient readers with good literacy levels.",
        "However, many people in the UK and elsewhere are not proficient readers; indeed, according to a UK Government survey [Moser, 1999], twenty percent of the UK adult population have problems with reading (and an even greater number have problems with simple maths).",
        "Some of these individuals have physical or cognitive disabilities (such as dyslexia), but many have no such problems; their poor basic skills are because of factors such as social deprivation and attending low-quality schools.",
        "NLG systems that generate personalised health information, for example Cawsey et al.",
        "[2000] and Reiter et al.",
        "[2003a], would probably be more effective if they could generate appropriate texts for poor readers as well as good readers.",
        "Certainly real world NLG applications should at least consider such readers; otherwise there is a danger that many readers will not understand the texts we generate.",
        "Generating appropriate texts for poor readers is a multifaceted problem.",
        "At a content level, texts should be short, explicit, and clearly useful to the reader [Sripada et al., 2003], so that he or she is willing to make the effort required to read it.",
        "At a linguistic level, texts should use simple and easy-to-understand words and short sentences with simple syntactic structures [Harley, 2001].",
        "At a presentation level, texts should have an easy-to-understand layout [Bouayad-Agha et al., 2001] and be communicated in clear fonts particularly for dyslexic readers (e.g. K-type fonts, www.ktype.com) and for readers with visual impairment (e.g. tiresias font, www.tiresias.org).",
        "The focus of our research is on the linguistic level, and to date we have looked at choices related to the expression of discourse structure, such as the order in which phrases related by a discourse relation are expressed.",
        "Our hope was that rules for linguistic choices at least would be generic and easy to “plug in” to NLG systems intended for poor readers.",
        "Future work in the project will look at lexical choice and also at improved content selection and personalisation."

        "SkillSum is being developed in a user-centred manner involving rapid prototyping and frequent evaluations with users.",

        "Currently most people with poor skills do not in fact enrol in courses to improve their skills, and our hope is that making the assessment process as easy (and private) as possible will encourage more people who need help to seek it out.",
        "The SkillSum project originally used detailed diagnostic literacy and numeracy assessments developed by CTAD.",
        "However, in pilots with users, we found that these took too long to complete and it seemed unlikely that people would be able to use them in an unsupported environment.",
        "Our current solution uses modified versions of CTAD’s shorter literacy and numeracy screeners, i.e. tests that identify in a broader sense whether a user has problems with literacy or numeracy, but without a detailed analysis.",

        "Ideally, the difficulty of the questions that are administered should change according to a user’s ability to answer correctly, but at present if a user has difficulties with the questions, the test simply ends.",

        "We initially wanted to measure readability by asking comprehension questions and by timing silent reading, but this proved problematical.",
        "The problem with comprehension questions was that subjects responded to them based on their beliefs about their literacy, not on the content of the report.",
        "For example, if we showed a subject a text similar to Figure 2 and asked her “What does the report say you did well on”, she might respond “I didn’t do well on anything” instead of “It says I did well on grammar”.",

        "Again, this did not work well with poor readers because they tended to skim-read or even simply press the button without reading the text at all.",

        "We initially avoided lexical choice because of this issue (except for choice of cue phrases, where this problem in fact arose, as mentioned in Section 3.2).",
        "Recently, we carried out a small study on technical terms in English and maths (such as grammar) to find out what kinds of explanation basic skills students would understand.",
        "We elicited their own explanations of the terms as well as trying out uses of the terms themselves, paraphrases of the terms and illustrative examples of the terms.",
        "We asked basic skills students to think aloud while solving simple English and maths problems and then explained their errors to them using technical terms.",
        "In think-aloud, they varied a great deal:",
        "• Some people did not use technical terms at all.",
        "• Some people used technical terms inaccurately, (e.g. spelling or capital letters were described as grammar).",
        "• Some people used technical terms correctly.",
        "We concluded that it is dangerous to use technical terms when they are likely to be misunderstood.",
        "When explaining terms to people, however, they seemed to comprehend the illustrative examples best of all and we will try these in the next version of SkillSum."

        "Other future work will be to improve content selection and personalisation in SkillSum to help people understand their strengths and weaknesses.",
        "This poses a challenge because the topic of SkillSum’s reports is very sensitive indeed, e.g. telling vulnerable people that they have problems with their literacy and/or numeracy can be hurtful!",
        "To date, one of our biggest difficulties has been to generate feedback for people who did not answer any of the questions correctly.",
        "What should SkillSum say to them?",
        "This is particularly difficult because SkillSum does not know what might have gone wrong during the test: perhaps there was a problem with using the computer or the mouse; or perhaps the user had difficulties with reading the screen because of poor eyesight; or perhaps he/she has severe learning difficulties.",
        "Knowledge acquisition for SkillSum is difficult because the task of generating adult basic skills summary reports is novel, poorly-understood and complex.",
        "See Reiter et al.",
        "2003b] for a detailed review of KA problems specific to NLG.",
        "Like the smoking cessation letters generated by the STOP system [Reiter et al., 2003 a], adult basic skills reports did not previously occur naturally.",
        "That is, tutors do not tend to write down feedback and advice for basic learners.",
        "A related text type is school reports.",
        "However, Education literature on writing school reports is unhelpful because adult basic learners have often had bad experiences with school and school reports in the past [FENTO, 2004].",
        "We are currently involved in knowledge acquisition to derive improved content selection rules.",
        "We elicited tutor-authored reports for ten case studies in literacy and ten in numeracy.",
        "We gave tutors test results and a short user profile containing background material, e.g. age, gender, course enrolled in and ambitions (these were built using ano-nymised data from actual people who took part in earlier pilots and from [Swain et al., 2004]).",
        "An analysis of the tutor-authored reports demonstrated that they have similarities in high-level content structures but individual author differences in lower-level content.",
        "Some issues that we are currently considering include:",
        "• Should reports mention students’ mistakes as well as their correct answers?",
        "• Should reports congratulate students for doing well,",
        "when perhaps their performance was worse than normal, or, on the other hand, should they commiserate with students when perhaps their performance was better than normal?",
        "• Should reports refer to students’ ambitions (e.g. in terms of qualifications or career)?",
        "• How much advice should be given?",
        "• How much motivational content should be included?",
        "We need to reconcile what tutors tell us with what students tell us.",
        "Tutors tend to agree that reports should be encouraging, focus on positive aspects and not mention mistakes.",
        "On the other hand, when we talk to basic skills students, they often want to know what their mistakes were (it can be frustrating to score twenty-six out of twenty-seven and not know which one was wrong!).",
        "Not knowing an individual and how much effort he/she has put into the test is another problem.",
        "Evaluative comments in a report such as “this is very good” are meaningless without such knowledge and, indeed they are meaningless without reference to some scale (but tutors have advised against mentioning the core curriculum scale as students are not familiar with it).",
        "We propose to elicit self-assessments and some background information about users’ ambitions from an initial questionnaire in SkillSum.",
        "The former might help with choice of evaluative comments.",
        "But combining the latter with advice and motivational content e.g. “you may be able to get a plumbing qualification if you do a course to improve your English” could be dangerous because the system has no way of knowing what an individual’s potential might be and the resulting content could be highly inaccurate."

        "Nevertheless, we would like to think that the choice preferences we used (Section 3.2) could be practically useful to people building systems that produce texts for low-skilled readers, and indeed systems that produce texts for the general public (since good readers don’t seem to be affected by these choices, there is no harm in using low-skilled preferences for all readers).",
