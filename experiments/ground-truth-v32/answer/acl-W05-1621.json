        "Research in NLG focused on problems related to TS from very early on, [McKeown, 1985] being a classic example.",
        "Nowadays, TS continues to be an extremely fruitful field of diverse active research.",
        "In this paper, we assume the so-called search-based approach to TS [Karamanis et al., 2004] which employs a metric of coherence to select a text structure among various alternatives.",
        "The TS module is hypothesised to simply order a preselected set of information-bearing items such as sentences [Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004] or database facts [Dimitromanolaki and Androutsopoulos, 2003; Karamanis et al., 2004].",
        "Empirical work on the evaluation of TS has become increasingly automatic and corpus-based.",
        "As pointed out by [Karamanis, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004] inter alia, using corpora for automatic evaluation is motivated by the fact that employing human informants in extended psycholinguistic experiments is often simply unfeasible.",
        "By contrast, large-scale automatic corpus-based experimentation takes place much more easily.",
        "[Lapata, 2003] was the first to present an experimental setting which employs the distance between two orderings to estimate automatically how close a sentence ordering produced",
        "by her probabilistic TS model stands in comparison to orderings provided by several human judges.",
        "[Dimitromanolaki and Androutsopoulos, 2003] derived sets of facts from the database of MPIRO, an NLG system that generates short descriptions of museum artefacts [Isard et al., 2003].",
        "Each set consists of 6 facts each of which corresponds to a sentence as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The facts in each set were manually assigned an order to reflect what a domain expert, i.e. an archaeologist trained in museum labelling, considered to be the most natural ordering of the corresponding sentences.",
        "Patterns of ordering facts were automatically learned from the corpus created by the expert.",
        "Then, a classification-based TS approach was implemented and evaluated in comparison to the expert’s orderings.",
        "Database fact Sentence subclass(ex1, amph) – .",
        "This exhibit is an amphora.",
        "painted-by(ex1, p-Kleo) – .",
        "This exhibit was decorated by the Painter of Kleofrades.",

        "museum-country(wag-mus, ger) – .",
        "The Martin von Wagner Museum is in Germany.",
        "A subset of the corpus created by the expert in the previous study (to whom we will henceforth refer as E0) is employed by [Karamanis et al., 2004] who attempt to distinguish between many metrics of coherence with respect to their usefulness for TS in the same domain.",
        "Each human ordering of facts in the corpus is scored by each of these metrics which are then penalised proportionally to the amount of alternative orderings of the same material that are found to score equally to or better than the human ordering.",
        "The few metrics which manage to outperform two simple baselines in their overall performance across the corpus emerge as the most suitable candidates for TS in the investigated domain.",
        "This methodology is very similar to the way [Barzilay and Lee, 2004] evaluate their probabilistic TS model in comparison to the approach of [Lapata, 2003].",
        "Because the data used in the studies of [Dimitromanolaki and Androutsopoulos, 2003] and [Karamanis et al., 2004] are based on the insights of just one expert, an obvious unresolved question is whether they reflect general strategies for ordering facts in the domain of interest.",
        "This paper addresses this issue by enhancing the dataset used in the two studies with orderings provided by three additional experts.",
        "These orderings are then compared with the orders of E0 using the methodology of [Lapata, 2003].",
        "Since E0 is found to share a lot of common ground with two of her colleagues in the ordering task, her reliability is verified, while a fourth “stand-alone” expert who uses strategies not shared by any other expert is identified as well.",
        "As in [Lapata, 2003], the same dependent variable which allows us to estimate how different the orders of E0 are from the orders of her colleagues is used to evaluate some of the metrics which perform best in [Karamanis et al., 2004].",
        "As explained in the next section, in this way we investigate the previously unaddressed possibility that there may exist many optimal solutions for TS in our domain.",
        "The results of this additional evaluation experiment are presented and emphasis is laid on their relation with the previous findings.",
        "Overall, this paper addresses two general issues: a) how to verify the generality of a dataset defined by one expert using sentence orderings provided by other experts and b) how to employ these data for the automatic evaluation of a TS approach.",
        "Given that the methodology discussed in this paper does not rely on the employed metrics of coherence or the assumed TS approach, our work can be of interest to any NLG researcher facing these questions.",
        "The next section discusses how the methodology implemented in this study complements the methods of [Karamanis et al., 2004].",
        "After briefly introducing the employed metrics of coherence, we describe the data collected for our experiments.",
        "Then, we present the employed dependent variable and formulate our predictions.",

        "Collecting sentence orderings defined by many experts in our domain enables us to investigate the possibility that there might exist many good solutions for TS.",
        "Then, the measure of [Lapata, 2003], which estimates how close two orderings stand, can be employed not only to verify the reliability of E0 but also to compare the orderings preferred by the assumed TS approach with the orderings of the experts.",

        "A question not addressed by previous studies making use of a certain collection of orderings of facts is whether the strategies reflected there are specific to E0, the expert who created the dataset.",
        "In this paper, we address this question by enhancing E0’s dataset with orderings provided by three additional experts.",
        "Then, the distance between E0 and her colleagues is computed and compared to the distance between the other expert pairs.",
        "The results indicate that E0 shares a lot of common ground with two of her colleagues in the ordering task deviating from them as much as they deviate from each other, while the orderings of a fourth “stand-alone” expert are found to manifest rather individualistic strategies.",
        "The same variable used to investigate the distance between the experts is employed to automatically evaluate the best scoring orderings of some of the best performing metrics in [Karamanis et al., 20041.",
        "Despite its limitations due to the necessarily restricted size of the employed dataset, this eval",
        "uation task allows us to explore the previously unaddressed possibility that there exist many good solutions for TS in the employed domain.",
        "Out of a much larger set of possibilities, 10 metrics were evaluated in [Karamanis et al., 2004], only a handful of which were found to overtake two simple baselines.",
        "The additional test in this study carries on the elimination process by pointing out PF.BFP as the single most promising metric to be used for TS in the explored domain, since this is the metric that manages to clearly survive both tests.",
        "Equally crucially, our analysis shows that all employed metrics are superior to a random baseline.",
        "Additional evidence in favour of the PF constraint on coherence introduced in [Karamanis, 2003] is provided as well.",
        "The general evaluation methodology as well as the specific results of this study will be useful for any subsequent attempt to automatically evaluate a TS approach using a corpus of sentence orderings defined by many experts.",
        "As [Reiter and Sripada, 2002] suggest, the best way to treat the results of a corpus-based study is as hypotheses which eventually need to be integrated with other types of evaluation.",
        "Although we followed the ongoing argumentation that using perceptual experiments to choose between many possible metrics is unfeasible, our efforts have resulted into a single preferred candidate which is much easier to evaluate with the help of psycholinguistic techniques (instead of having to deal with a large number of metrics from very early on).",
        "This is indeed our main direction for future work in this domain."
