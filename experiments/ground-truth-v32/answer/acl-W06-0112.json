        "Chunking means extracting the non-overlapping segments from a stream of data.",
        "These segments are called chunks (Dirk and Satoshi, 2003).",
        "The definition of base noun phrase (base NP) is simple and non-recursive noun phrase which does not contain other noun phrase descendants.",
        "Base NP chunking could be used as a precursor for many elaborate natural language processing tasks, such as information retrieval, name entity extraction and text summarization and so on.",
        "Many other problems similar to text processing can also benefit from base NP chunking, for example, finding genes in DNA and phoneme information extraction.",
        "The initial work on base NP chunking is focused on the grammar-based method.",
        "Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) introduced a transformation-based learning method which considered chunking as a kind of tagging problem.",
        "Their work inspired many others to study the applications of learning methods to noun phrase chunking.",
        "(Cardie and Pierce, 1998, 1999) applied a scoring method to select new rules and a naive heuristic for matching rules to evaluate the results' accuracy.",
        "CoNLL-2000 proposed a shared task (Tjong and Buchholz, 2000), which aimed at dividing a text in syntactically correlated parts of words.",
        "The eleven systems for the CoNLL-2000 shared task used a wide variety of machine learning methods.",
        "The best system in this workshop is on the basis of Support Vector Machines used by (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).",
        "Recently, some new statistical techniques, such as CRF (Lafferty et al.",
        "2001) and structural learning methods (Ando and Zhang, 2005) have been applied on the base NP chunking.",
        "(Fei and Fernando, 2003) considered chunking as a sequence labeling task and achieved good performance by an improved training methods of CRF.",
        "(Ando and Zhang, 2005) presented a novel semi-supervised learning method on chunking and produced performances higher than the previous best results.",
        "The research on Chinese Base NP Chunking is, however, still at its developing stage.",
        "Researchers apply similar methods of English Base NP chunking to Chinese.",
        "Zhao and Huang (1998) made a strict definition of Chinese base NP and put forward a quasi-dependency model to analysis the structure of Chinese base NPs.",
        "There are some other methods to deal with Chinese phrase (no only base NP) chunking, such as HMM (Heng Li et al., 2003), Maximum Entropy (Zhou Yaqian et al., 2003), Memory-Based Learning (Zhang and Zhou, 2002) etc.",
        "Proceedings of the Fifth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 87–93, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics However, according to our experiments over 30,000 Chinese words, the best results of Chinese base NP chunking are about 5% less than that of English chunking (Although we should admit the chunking outcomes vary among different sizes of corpus and rely on the details of experiments).",
        "The differences between Chinese NPs and English NPs are summarized as following points: First, the flexible structure of Chinese noun phrase often results in the ambiguities during the recognition procedure.",
        "For example, many English base NPs begin with the determinative, while the margin of Chinese base NPs is more uncertain.",
        "Second, the base NPs begins with more than two noun-modifiers, such as “n",
        "noun-modifiers “n/JJ ” can not be completely recognized.",
        "Third, the usage of Chinese word is flexible, as a Chinese word may serve with multi POS (Part-of-Speech) tags.",
        "For example, a noun is used as a verbal or an adjective component in the sentence.",
        "In this way the chunker is puzzled by those multi-used words.",
        "Finally, there are no standard datasets and elevation systems for Chinese base NP chunking as the CoNLL-2000 shared task, which makes it difficult to compare and evaluate different Chinese base NP chunking systems.",
        "In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to extract the Chinese base NPs with the help of the conditional probabilities derived from the CRF algorithm and some appropriate grammar rules.",
        "According to our preliminary experiments on SVM and CRF, our approach outperforms both of them.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a brief introduction of the data representations and methods.",
        "We explain our motivations of the hybrid approach in section 3.",
        "The experimental results and conclusions are introduced in section 4 and section 5 respectively."

        "SVM is a machine learning algorithm for a linear binary classifier in order to maximize the margin of confidence of the classification on the training data set.",
        "According to the different requirements, distinctive kernel functions are employed to transfer non-linear problems into linear problems by mapping it to a higher dimension space.",
        "By transforming the training data into the form with IOB tags, we can view the base NP chunking problem as a multi-class classification problem.",
        "As SVMs are binary classifiers, we use the pairwise method to convert the multi-class problem into a set of binary class problem, thus the I/O/B classifier is reduced into 3 kinds of binary classifier – I/O classifier, O/B classifier, B/I classifier.",
        "In our experiments, we choose TinySVM 1 together with YamCha 2 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) as the one of the baseline systems for our chunker.",
        "In order to construct the feature sets for training SVMs, all information available in the surrounding contexts, including tokens, POS tags and IOB tags.",
        "The tool YamCha makes it possible to add new features on your own.",
        "Therefore, in the training stage, we also add two new features according to the words.",
        "First, we give special tags to the noun words, especially the proper noun, as we find in the experiment the proper nouns sometimes bring on errors, such as base",
        "NP “ N) I I (Sichuan)/NR kA(basin)/NN”, containing the proper noun “ N) I I /NR”, could be mistaken for a single base NP “kA/NN”; Second, some punctuations such as separating marks, contribute to the wrong chunking, because many Chinese compound noun phrases are connected by separating mark, and the ingredients in the sentence are a mixture of simple nouns and noun phrases, for example, “ Q *c (National)/NN ?J6 it ( Statistics Office)/NN, rP Q (Chinese)/NR &t om (Social Sciences)/NN f4 ?",
        "Iii (Academy)/NN Ip (and)/CC rP f4 Iii (Chinese Academy of Sciences)/NNSHORT” The part of base NP – “rP Q/B &tom/I f4?Iii /I” can be recognized as three independent base NPs -- “rP Q/B &tom/B f4?Iii/B”.",
        "The kind of errors comes from the conjunction “Ip(and)” and the successive sequences of nouns, which contribute little to the chunker.",

        "(Simon, 2003) pointed out that the SVM guarantees a high generalization using very rich features from the sentences, even with a large and high-dimension training data.",

        "For each word of the testing data, the CRF chunker works out a conditional probability for each IOB tag and chooses the most probable tag for the output.",
        "We bring out the differences between the SVM and CRF, such as “R) I J (Sichuan)” in a base noun phrase is recognized as “I” and “O” respectively, and the distance between P(I |“R) I J”) and P(O |“R ) I J”) is tiny.",
        "According to our experiment, about 80% of the differences between SVM and CRF share the same statistical characters, which indicate the correct answers are inundated by the noisy features in the classifier.",
        "Using the comparison between SVM and CRF we can check most of those errors.",
        "Then we could build some simple grammar rules to figure out the correct tags for the ambiguous words corresponding to the surrounding contexts.",
        "Then At the error pruning step, judging from the surrounding texts and the grammar rules, the base NP is corrected to the right form.",
        "We give 5 mainly representative grammar rules to explain how they work in the experiments.",
        "The first simple sample of grammar rules is just like “BNP --+ NR NN”, used to solve the proper noun problems.",
        "Take the “ R ) I J (Sichuan)/NR/B It A (basin)/NN/I” for example, the comparison finds out the base NP recognized as “ R) I J (Sichuan)/NR/I ItA (basin)/NN/B”.",
        "Second, with respect to the base NP connecting with separating mark and conjunction words, two rules “BNP --+ BNP CC (BNP |Noun), BNP --+BNP PU (BNP |Noun)” is used to figure out those errors; Third, with analyzing our experiment results, the CRF and SVM chunker recognize differently on the determinative, therefore the rule “BNP --+ JJ BNP”, our combination methods figure out new BNP tags from the preliminary results according to this rule.",
        "Finally, the most complex situation is the determination of the Base NPs composed of series of nouns, especially the proper nouns.",
        "With figuring out the maximum length of this kind of noun phrase, we highlight the proper nouns and then separate the complex noun phrase to base noun phrases, and according to the our experiments, this",
        "method could solve close to 75% of the ambiguity in the errors from complex noun phrases.",

        "The previous work mostly considered base NP chunking as the classification problem without special attention to the lexical information and syntactic dependence of words.",
        "On the other hand, we add some grammar rules to strength the syntactic dependence between the words.",
        "However, the syntactic structure derived from Chinese is much more flexible and complex than that from English.",

        "ally the Chinese word “其中/NN (among)” refers to the content in the previous sentence and “其中 (thereinto)” sometimes used as an adverb.",
        "Second, how to deal with the conjunctions is a major problem, especially the words “与 (and)” can appear in the preposition structure “与 相 � (relate to)”, which makes it difficult to judge those types of differences.",
        "Third, the chunkers can not handle with compact sequence data of chunks with name entities and new words (especially the transliterated words) satisfactorily, such as “rP Q ( China ) /NR ����( Red Cross ) /NR-A2;� ( Honorary ) /NN �Ec (Chairman ) /NN U4 K( Jiang Ze-min ) /NR” As it points above, the English name entities sequences are connected with the conjunction such as “of, and, in”.",
        "While in Chinese there are no such connection words for name entities sequences.",

        "What’s more, some other factors such as Idiomatic and specialized expressions also account for the errors.",
