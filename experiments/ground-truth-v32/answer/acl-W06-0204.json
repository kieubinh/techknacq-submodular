        "A recent approach to Information Extraction (IE) is to make use of machine learning algorithms which allow systems to be rapidly developed or adapted to new extraction problems.",
        "This reduces the need for manual development which is a major bottleneck in the development of IE technologies and can be extremely time consuming (e.g. Riloff (1996)).",
        "A number of machine learning approaches have recently been applied.",
        "One is the use of iterative learning algorithms to infer extraction patterns from a small number of seed examples (Yangar-ber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005).",
        "These approaches use dependency analysis as the basis of IE patterns.",
        "Training text is parsed and a set of candidate patterns extracted.",
        "These patterns are then compared against the seeds with the most similar being selected and added to the seed set.",
        "(Optionally, a user may verify the patterns at this point.)",
        "The process is then repeated with the remaining patterns being compared to the enlarged seed set.",
        "The process continues until a suitable set of patterns has been learned.",
        "These approaches require only a small number of example extraction patterns which greatly reduces the effort required to develop IE systems.",
        "While it has been found that these approaches are capable of learning useful IE patterns from a handful of examples (Yangarber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) they are limited by the use of basic extraction patterns: SVO tuples.",
        "The patterns used by these systems are defined as a verb and its direct subject and/or object.",
        "They could then only extract a limited set of relations; those expressed using a verb and its direct arguments.",
        "For example, these patterns could identify the relation between Jones and Smith in the sentence “Jones replaced Smith”.",
        "However, no pattern consisting of a verb and its arguments could be constructed which could identify the same relation in “Jones was named as Smith’s successor.” Others have suggested alternative approaches for generating extraction patterns from dependency trees, each of which allows a particular part of the dependency analysis to act as an extraction pattern.",
        "For example, Sudo et al.",
        "(2003) used patterns consisting of a path from a verb to any of its descendents (direct or indirect) while Bunescu and Mooney (2005) suggest the shortest path between the items being related.",
        "However, iterative learning algorithms, such as the ones used by Yangarber et al.",
        "(2000) and Stevenson and Greenwood (2005), have not made use of these more complex extraction patterns.",
        "Part of the reason for this is that these algorithms require a way of determining the similarity between patterns (in order to compare candidate patterns with the seeds).",

        "While these represent some of the core information in this sentence, they cannot be used to identify a number of relations including the connection between Mr. Smith and CEO or between Mr. Smith and Mr. Bloggs.",
        "A number of alternative approaches to constructing extraction patterns from dependency trees have been proposed (e.g. (Sudo et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005)).",
