        "Summarization of meetings faces many challenges not found in texts, i.e., high word error rates, absence of punctuation, and sometimes lack of grammaticality and coherent ordering.",
        "On the other hand, meetings present a rich source of structural and pragmatic information that makes summarization of multi-party speech quite unique.",
        "In particular, our analyses of patterns in the verbal exchange between participants found that adjacency pairs (AP), a concept drawn from the conversational analysis literature (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973), have particular relevance to summarization.",
        "APs are pairs of utterances such as QUESTION-ANSWER or OFFER-ACCEPT, in which the second utterance is said to be conditionally relevant on the first.",
        "We show that there is a strong correlation between the two elements of an AP in summarization, and that one is unlikely to be included if the other element is not present in the summary.",

        "Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989), are linear chains that only encode local dependencies between utterances to be labeled.",
        "In multi-party speech, the two elements of an AP are generally arbitrarily distant, and such models can only poorly account for dependencies underlying APs in summarization.",
        "We use instead skip-chain sequence models (Sutton and McCallum, 2004), which allow us to explicitly model dependencies between distant utterances, and turn out to be particularly effective in the summarization task.",
        "In this paper, we compare two types of network structures – linear-chain and skip-chain – and two types of network semantics – Bayesian Networks (BNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).",
        "We discuss the problem of estimating the class posterior probability of each utterance in a sequence in order to extract the N most probable ones, and show that the cost assigned by a CRF to each utterance needs to be locally normalized in order to outperform BNs.",
        "After analyzing the predictive power of a large set of durational, acoustical, lexical, structural, and information retrieval features, we perform feature selection to have a competitive set of predictors to test the different models.",
        "Empirical evaluations using two standard summarization metrics – the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004b) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) – show that the best performing system is a CRF incorporating both order-2 Markov dependencies and skip-chain dependencies, which achieves 91.3% of human performance in Pyramid score, and outperforms our best-performing non-sequential model by 3.9%."

        "For automatic recognition, we used the ICSI-SRI-UW speech recognition system (Mirghafori et al., 2004), a state-of-the-art conversational telephone speech (CTS) recognizer whose language and acoustic models were adapted to the meeting domain.",
        "It achieves 34.8% WER on the ICSI corpus, which is indicative of the difficulty involved in processing meetings automatically.",
        "We also used additional annotation that has been developed to support higher-level analyses of meeting structure, in particular the ICSI Meeting Recorder Dialog act (MRDA) corpus (Shriberg et al., 2004).",
        "Dialog act (DA) labels describe the pragmatic function of utterances, e.g. a STATEMENT or a BACKCHANNEL.",
        "This auxiliary corpus consists of over 180,000 human-annotated dialog act labels (n = .8), for which so-called adjacency pair (AP) relations (e.g., APOLOGY-DOWNPLAY) were also labeled.",
        "This latter annotation was used to train an AP classifier that is instrumental in automatically determining the structure of our sequence models.",
        "Note that, in the case of three or more speakers, adjacency pair is admittedly an unfortunate term, since labeled APs are generally not adjacent (e.g., see Table 1), but we will nevertheless use the same terminology to enforce consistency with previous work.",
        "To train and evaluate our summarizer, we used a corpus of extractive summaries produced at the University of Edinburgh (Murray et al., 2005).",
        "For each of the 75 meetings, humanjudges were asked to select transcription utterances segmented by DA to include in summaries, resulting in an average compression ratio of 6.26% (though no strict limit was imposed).",
        "Inter-labeler agreement was measured using six meetings that were summarized by multiple coders (average n = .323).",
        "While this level of agreement is quite low, this situation is not uncommon to summarization, since there may be many good summaries for a given document; a main challenge lies in using evaluation schemes that properly accounts for this diversity."

        "Since DAs seem to matter less than adjacency pairs, the aim will be to build techniques to automatically identify such relations and exploit them in utterance selection.",

Using these auxiliary labels only, we can then use the standard forward-backward algorithm for computing marginal distributions in linear-chain CRFs, and Viterbi decoding in linear-chain CRFs and BNs.",

        "First, our models are optimized to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of the training data, a measure that does not correlate well with utility measures generally used in retrieval oriented tasks such as summarization, especially when faced with a significant class imbalance (only 6.26% of reference instances are positive).",
        "Second, the MAP decision rule doesn’t give us the freedom to select an arbitrary number of sentences in order to satisfy any constraint on length.",

        "BNs assign probability distributions over entire sequences by estimating the probability of each individual instance yt in the sequence (Equation 1), and seem thus particularly suited for ranking utterances.",

        "Very short SCUs (e.g., base noun phrases) sometimes appeared in different locations of a meeting, but we think it is problematic to assume that connections between such short units are indicative of any similarity of sentential meaning: the contexts are different, and words may be uttered by different speakers, which may lead to unrelated or conflicting pragmatic forces.",

        "For all these reasons, we believe that summarization evaluation in our case should rely on the following restrictive matching: two summary units should be considered equivalent if and only if they are extracted from the same location in the original document (e.g., the “DC” appearing in models 1 and 2 is not the same as the “DC” in the peer summary, since they are extracted from different sentences).",
        "This constraint on the matching is reflected in our Pyramid evaluation, and we define an SCU as a word and its document position, which lets us distinguish (“DC”,11) from (“DC”,33).",

        "Once all SCUs have been identified, the Pyramid method is applied as in (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004b): we compute a score D by adding for each SCU present in the summary a score equal to the number of model summaries in which that SCU appears.",
        "The Pyramid score P is computed by dividing D by the maximum D* value that is obtainable given the constraint on length.",

        "While our evaluation scheme is similar to comparing the binary predictions of model and peer summaries – each prediction determining whether a given transcription word is included or not – and averaging precision scores over all peer-model pairs, the Pyramid evaluation differs on an important point, which makes us prefer the Pyramid evaluation method: the maximum possible Pyramid score is always guaranteed to be 1, but average precision scores can become arbitrarily low as the consensus between summary annotators decreases.",

        "We performed feature selection by incrementally growing a log-linear model with order0 features f (x, yt) using a forward feature selection procedure similar to (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "Probably due to the imbalance between positive and negative samples, we found it more effective to rank candidate features by gains in F-measure (through 5-fold cross validation on the entire training set).",
        "The increase in Fi by adding new features to the model is displayed in Table 4; this greedy search resulted in a set S of 217 features.",
        "We now analyze the performance of different sequence models on our test set.",
        "The target length of each summary was set to 12.7% of the number of words of the full document, which is the aver",
        "age on the entire training data (the average on the test data is 12.9%).",
        "In Table 5, we use an order-0 CRF to compare S against all features and various categorical groupings.",
        "Overall, we notice lexical predictors and statistics derived from them (e.g. LSA features) represent the most helpful feature group (.497), though all other features combined achieve a competitive performance (.476).",
        "Table 6 displays performance for sequence models incorporating linear-chain features of increasing order k. Its second column indicates what criterion was used to rank utterances.",
        "In the case of ‘pred’, we used actual model 1-1, 11 predictions, which in all cases generated summaries much shorted than the allowable length, and produced poor performance.",
        "‘Costs’ and ‘norm-CRF’ refer to the two ranking criteria presented in Section 5, and it is clear that the performance of CRFs degrades with increasing orders without local normalization.",
        "While the contingency counts in Table 2 only hinted a limited benefit of linear-chain features, empirical results show the contrary – especially for order k = 2.",
        "However, the further increase of k causes overfitting, and skip-chain features seem a better way to capture non-local dependencies while keeping the number of model parameters relatively small.",
        "Overall, the addition of skip-chain edges to linear-chain models provide noticeable improvement in Pyramid scores.",
        "Our system that performed best on cross-validation data is an order-2 CRF with skip-chain transitions, which achieves a Pyramid score of P = .554.",
        "We now assess the significance of our results by comparing our best system against: (1) a lead summarizer that always selects the first N utterances to match the predefined length; (2) human performance, which is obtained by leave-one-out comparisons among references (Table 7); (3) “optimal” summaries generated using the procedure explained in (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004b) by ranking document utterances by the number of model summaries in which they appear.",
        "It appears that our system is considerably better than the baseline, and achieves 91.3% of human performance in terms of Pyramid scores, and 83% if using ASR transcription.",
        "This last result is particularly positive if we consider our strong reliance on lexical features.",
        "For completeness, we also included standard ROUGE (1, 2, and L) scores in Table 7, which were obtained using parameters defined for the",
        "DUC-05 evaluation.",
        "Since system summaries have on average approximately the same length as references, we only report recall measures of ROUGE (precision and F averages are within f .002).3 It may come as a surprise that our best system (both with ASR and true words) performs almost as well as humans; it seems more reasonable to conclude that, in our case, ROUGE has trouble discriminating between systems with moderately close performance.",
        "This seems to confirm our impression that content evaluation in our task should be based on exact matches.",
        "We performed a last experiment to compare our best system against Murray et al.",
        "(2005), who used the same test data, but constrained summary sizes in terms of number of DA units instead of words.",
        "In their experiments, 10% of DAs had to be selected.",
        "Our system achieves .91 recall, .5 precision, and .64 F1 with the same length constraint.",
        "3Human performance with ROUGE was assessed by cross-validating reference summaries of each meeting (i.e., n references for a given meeting resulted in n evaluations against the other references).",
        "We used the same leave-one-out procedure with other summarizers, in order to get results comparable to humans.",
        "The discrepancy between recall and precision is largely due to the fact that generated summaries are on average much longer than model summaries (10% vs. 6.26% of DAs), which explains why our precision is relatively low in this last evaluation.",
        "The best ROUGE-1 measure reported in (Murray et al., 2005) is .69 recall, which is significantly lower than ours according to confidence intervals."
