        "Any computer system for natural language processing has to struggle with the problem of ambiguities.",
        "If the system is meant to extract precise information from a text, these ambiguities must be resolved.",
        "One of the most frequent ambiguities arises from the attachment of prepositional phrases (PPs).",
        "Simply stated, a PP that follows a noun (in English, German or Swedish) can be attached to the noun or to the verb.",
        "In the last decade various methods for the resolution of PP attachment ambiguities have been proposed.",
        "The seminal paper by (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) started a sequence of studies for English.",
        "We investigated similar methods for German (Volk, 2001; Volk, 2002).",
        "Recently other languages (such as Dutch (Vandeghinste, 2002) or Swedish (Aasa, 2004)) have followed.",
        "In the PP attachment research for other languages there is often a comparison of the disambiguation accuracy with the English results.",
        "But are the results really comparable across languages?",
        "Are we starting from the same baseline when working on PP attachment in structurally similar languages like English, German and Swedish?",
        "Is the problem of PP attachment equally bad (equally frequent and of equal balance) for these three languages?",
        "These are the questions we will discuss in this paper.",
        "In order to find answers to these questions we have taken a closer look at the training and test data used in various experiments.",

      "text": [
        "(Hindle and Rooth, 1993) did not have access to a large treebank.",
        "Therefore they proposed an unsupervised method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities.",
        "And they evaluated their method against 880 English triples verb-noun-preposition (V-N-P) which they had extracted from randomly selected, ambiguously located PPs in a corpus.",
        "For example, the sentence ”Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches” results in the V-N-P triple (request, treatment, for).",
        "These triples were manually annotated by both authors with either noun or verb attachment based on the complete sentence context.",
        "Interestingly, 586 of these triples (67%) were judged as noun attachments and only 33% as verb attachments.",
        "And (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) reported on 80% attachment accuracy, an improvement of 13% over the baseline (i.e. guessing noun attachment in all",
        "cases).",
        "A year later (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) published a supervised approach to the PP attachment problem.",
        "They had extracted quadruples V-N-P-N1 (plus the accompanying attachment decision) from both an IBM computer manuals treebank (about 9000 tuples) and from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn treebank (about 24,000 tuples).",
        "The latter tuple set has been reused by subsequent research, so let us focus on this one.2 (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) used 20,801 tuples for training and 3097 tuples for evaluation.",
        "They reported on 81.6% correct attachments.",
        "But have they solved the same problem as (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)?",
        "What was the initial bias towards noun attachment in their data?",
        "It turns out that their training set (the 20,801 tuples) contains only 52% noun attachments, while their test set (the 3097 tuples) contains 59% noun attachments.",
        "The difference in noun attachments between these two sets is striking, but (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) do not discuss this (and we also do not have an explanation for this).",
        "But it makes obvious that (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) were tackling a problem different from (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) given the fact that their baseline was at 59% guessing noun attachment (rather than 67% in the Hindle and Rooth experiments).3 Of course, the baseline is not a direct indicator of the difficulty of the disambiguation task.",
        "We may construct (artificial) cases with low baselines and a simple distribution of PP attachment tendencies.",
        "For example, we may construct the case that a language has 100 different prepositions, where 50 prepositions always introduce noun attachments, and the other 50 prepositions always require verb attachments.",
        "If we also assume that both groups occur with the same frequency, we have a 50% baseline but still a trivial disambiguation task.",
        "But in reality the baseline puts the disambiguation result into perspective.",
        "If, for instance, the baseline is 60% and the disambiguation result is 80% correct attachments, then we will claim that our disambiguation procedure is useful.",
        "Whereas",
        "if we have a baseline of 80% and the disambiguation result is 75%, then the procedure can be discarded.",
        "So what are the baselines reported for other languages?",
        "And is it possible to use the same extraction mechanisms for V-N-P-N tuples in order to come to comparable baselines?",
        "We did an in-depth study on German PP attachment (Volk, 2001).",
        "We compiled our own treebank by annotating 3000 sentences from the weekly computer journal ComputerZeitung.",
        "We had first annotated a larger number of subsequent sentences with Part-of-Speech tags, and based on these PoS tags, we selected 3000 sentences that contained at least one full verb plus the sequence of a noun followed by a preposition.",
        "After annotating the 3000 sentences with complete syntax trees we used a Prolog program to extract V-N-P-N tuples with the accompanying attachment decisions.",
        "This lead to 4562 tuples out of which 61% were marked as noun attachments.",
        "We used the same procedure to extract tuples from the first 10,000 sentences of the NEGRA treebank.",
        "This resulted in 6064 tuples with 56% noun attachment (for a detailed overview see (Volk, 2001) p. 86).",
        "Again we observe a substantial difference in the baseline.",
        "When our student J¨orgen Aasa worked on replicating our German experiments for Swedish, he used a Swedish treebank from the 1980s for the extraction of test data.",
        "He extracted V-N-P-N tuples from SynTag, a treebank with 5100 newspaper sentences built by (J¨arborg, 1986).",
        "And Aasa was able to extract 2893 tuples out of which 73.8% were marked as noun attachments (Aasa, 2004) (p. 25).",
        "This was a surprisingly high figure, and we wondered whether this indicated a tendency in Swedish to avoid the PP in the ambiguous position unless it was to be attached to the noun.",
        "But again the extraction process was done with a special purpose extraction program whose correctness was hard to verify."

        "We therefore decided to check the attachment tendencies of PPs in various treebanks for the three languages in question with the same tool and with queries that are as uniform as possible.",
        "For English we used the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, for German we used our own ComputerZeitung treebank (3000 sentences), the",
        "NEGRA treebank (10,000 sentences) and the recently released version of the TIGER treebank (50,000 sentences).",
        "For Swedish we used the SynTag treebank mentioned above and one section of the Talbanken treebank (6100 sentences).",
        "All these treebanks consist of constituent structure trees, and they are in representation formats which allow them to be loaded into TIGER-Search.",
        "This enables us to query them all in similar manners and to get a fairer comparison of the attachment tendencies.",
        "TIGER-Search is a powerful treebank query tool developed at the University of Stuttgart (K¨onig and Lezius, 2002).",
        "Its query language allows for feature-value descriptions of syntax graphs.",
        "It is similar in expressiveness to tgrep (Ro-hde, 2005) but it comes with graphical output and highlighting of the syntax trees plus some nice statistics functions.",
        "Our experiments for determining attachment tendencies proceed along the following lines.",
        "For each treebank we first query for all sequences of a noun immediately followed by a PP (henceforth noun+PP sequences).",
        "The dot being the precedence operator, we use the query: [pos=\"NN\"] .",
        "[cat=\"PP\"] This query will match twice in the tree in figure 1.",
        "It gives us the frequency of all ambiguously located PP.",
        "We disregard the fact that in certain clause positions a PP in such a sequence cannot be verb-attached and is thus not ambiguous.",
        "For example, an English noun+PP sequence in subject position is not ambiguous with respect to PP attachment since the PP cannot attach to the verb.",
        "Similar restrictions apply to German and Swedish.",
        "In order to determine how many of these sequences are annotated as noun attachments, we query for noun phrases that contain both a noun and an immediately following PP.",
        "This query will look like: #np_mum:[cat=\"NP\"] > #np_child:[cat=\"NP\"] & #np_mum > #pp:[cat=\"PP\"] & #np_child >* #noun:[pos=\"NN\"] & #noun .",
        "#pp All strings starting with # are variables and the > symbol is the dominance operator.",
        "So, this query says: Search for an NP (and call it np mum) that immediately dominates another NP (np child) AND that immediately dominates a PP, AND the np child dominates a noun which is immediately followed by the PP.",
        "This query presupposes that a PP which is attached to a noun is actually annotated with the structure (NP (NP (... N)) (PP)) which is true for the Penn treebank (compare to the tree in figure 1).",
        "But the German treebanks represent this type of attachment rather as (NP (... N) (PP)) which means that the query needs to be adapted accordingly.4 Such queries give us the frequency of all noun+PP sequences and the frequency of all such sequences with noun attachments.",
        "These frequencies allow us to calculate the noun attachment rate (NAR) in our treebanks.",
        "We assume that all PPs in noun+PP sequences which are not attached to a noun are attached to a verb.",
        "This means we ignore the very few cases of such PPs that might be attached to adjectives (as for instance the second PP in ”due for revision in 1990”).",
        "Different annotation schemes require modifications to these basic queries, and different noun classes (regular nouns, proper names, deverbal nouns etc.)",
        "allow for a more detailed investigation.",

        "Its conversion to TIGER-XML is documented in (Hagstr¨om, 2004).",

        "Let us compare these results to the second Swedish treebank, Talbanken (first described by (Telemann, 1974)).",
        "Talbanken was a remarkable achievement in the 80s as it comes with two written language parts (with a total of more than 10,000 sentences from student essays and from newspapers) and two spoken language parts (with another 10,000 trees from interviews and conversations).",
        "We concentrated on the 6100 trees from the written part taken from newspaper texts.",
        "The occurrence rate in Talbanken is 0.76 (4658 noun+PP sequences in 6100 sentences), which is similar to the rates observed for English and German.",
        "The occurrence rate in SynTag is higher 0.93 (4737 noun+PP sequences in 5114 sentences).",
        "Talbanken (in its converted form) is annotated with constituent structure labels (NP, PP, VP etc.)",
        "and also distinguishes coordinated phrases (CNP, CPP, CVP etc.).",
        "The queries for determining the noun attachment rate can thus be similar to the queries over the German treebanks.",
        "In addition, Talbanken comes with a rich set of grammatical features as edge labels (e.g. there are different labels for logical subject, dummy subject and other subject).",
        "We found that the NAR for regular nouns in Talbanken is 60.5%.",
        "Talbanken distinguishes between regular nouns, deverbal nouns (often with the derivation suffix -ing: j¨anstg¨oring, utbildning, ¨ovning) and deadjectival nouns (mostly with the derivation suffix -het: skyldighet, snabbhet, verk-samhet).",
        "Not surprisingly, these special nouns have higher NARs than the regular nouns.",
        "The",
        "deadjectival nouns have a NAR of 69.5%, and the deverbal nouns even have a NAR of 77%.",
        "Taken together (i.e. regarding all regular, deadjectival and deverbal nouns) this results in a NAR of 64%.",
        "Thus, the NARs which we obtain from the two Swedish treebanks (SynTag 73% and Talbanken 64%) differ drastically.",
        "It is unclear what this difference depends on.",
        "The text genre (newspapers) is the same in both cases.",
        "We have noticed that SynTag contains a number of annotation errors, but we don’t see that these errors favor noun attachment of PPs in a systematic way.",
        "One aspect might be the annotation decision in Talbanken to annotate PPs in light verb constructions.",
        "These are disturbing cases where the PP is a child node of the sentence node S (which means that it is interpreted as a verb attachment) with the edge label OA (objektadverbial).",
        "Nivre (2005, personal communication) pointed out that ”OA is what some theoreticians would call a ’prepositional object’ or a ’PP complement’, i.e. a complement of the verb that semantically is close to an object but which is realized as a prepositional phrase.” In our judgement many of those cases should be noun attachments (and thus be a child of an NP).",
        "For example, we looked at f¨oruts¨attning f¨or (= prerequisite for) which occurs 14 times, out of which 2 are annotated as OO (Other object) + OA, 11 are annotated as noun attachments, and 1 is erroneously annotated.",
        "If we compare that to be-tydelse f¨or (= significance for) which occurs 16 times out of which 13 are annotated as OO+OA and 3 are annotated as noun attachments, we wonder.",
        "First, it is obvious that there are inconsistencies in the treebank.",
        "We cannot see any reason why the 2 cases of f¨oruts¨attning f¨or are annotated differently than the other 11 cases.",
        "The verbs do not justify these discrepancies.",
        "For example, we have skapa (= to create) with the verb attachments and f¨orsvinna (= to disappear) with the noun attachment cases.",
        "And we find ge (= to give) on both sides.",
        "Second, we find it hard to follow the argument that the tendency for betydelse f¨or is stronger for the OO+OA than forf¨oruts¨attningf¨or.",
        "It might be based on the fact that betydelse f¨or is often used with the verb ha (= to have) and thus may count as a light verb construction with a verb group consisting of both ha plus betydelse and the f¨or-PP being interpreted as an object of this complex verb group.",
        "Third, unfortunately not all cases of PPs annotated as objektadverbial can be regarded as noun attachments.",
        "But after having looked at some 70 occurrences of such PPs immediately following a noun, we estimate that around 30% should be noun attachments.",

        "and the test set has a NAR of 42%.",
        "In other words, English has a clear tendency of attaching PPs to verbs if we ignore the dominating of-PPs.",
        "Neither German nor Swedish has such a dominating preposition.",
        "There are, of course, prepositions in both languages that exhibit a clear tendency towards noun attachment or verb attachment.",
        "But they are not as frequent as the preposition of in English.",
        "For example, clear temporal prepositions like German seit (= since) are much more likely as verb attachments.",
        "Closest to the English of is the Swedish preposition av which has a NAR of 88% in the Talbanken corpus.",
        "But its overall frequency does not dominate the Swedish ranking.",
        "The most frequent preposition in ambiguous positions is i (frequency: 651 and NAR: 53%) followed by av (frequency: 564; NAR: 88%) and f¨or (frequency: 460; NAR: 42%)."

      "text": [
        "The most important conclusion to be drawn from the above experiments and observations is the importance of profiling the data sets when working and reporting on PP attachment experiments.",
        "The profile should certainly answer the following questions: 1.",
        "What types of nouns where used when the tuples were extracted?",
        "(regular nouns, proper names, deverbal nouns, etc.)",
        "2.",
        "Are there prepositions which dominate in frequency and attachment rate (like the English preposition of)?",
        "If so, how does the data set look like without these dominating prepositions?",
        "3.",
        "What types of prepositions where regarded?",
        "(regular prepositions, contracted prepositions (e.g. in German am, im, zur), derived prepositions (e.g. English prepositions derived from gerund verb forms following, including, pending) etc.)",
        "4.",
        "Is the extraction procedure restricted to noun+PP sequences in the verb phrase, or does it consider all such sequences?",
        "5.",
        "What is the noun attachment rate in the data set?",
        "In order to find dominating prepositions we suggest a data profiling that includes the frequency and NARs of all prepositions in the data set.",
        "This will also give an overall picture of the number of prepositions involved.",
        "Our experiments have also shown the advantages of large treebanks for comparative linguistic studies.",
        "Such treebanks are even more valuable if they come in the same representation schema (e.g. TIGER-XML) so that they can be queried with the same tools.",
        "TIGER-Search has proven to be a suitable treebank query tool for our experiments although its statistics function broke down on some frequency counts we tried on large treebanks.",
        "For example, it was not possible to get a list of all prepositions with occurrence frequencies from a 50,000 sentence treebank.",
        "Another item on our TIGER-Search wish list is a batch mode so that we could run a set of queries and obtain a list of frequencies.",
        "Currently we have to trigger each query manually and copy the frequency results manually to an Excel file.",
        "Other than that, TIGER-Search is a wonderful tool which allows for quick sanity checks of the queries with the help of the highlighted tree structure displays in its GUI.",
        "We have compared noun attachment rates in English, German and Swedish over treebanks from various sources and with various annotation schemes.",
        "Of course, the results would be even better comparable if the treebanks were built on the same translated texts, i.e. on parallel corpora.",
        "Currently, there are no large parallel treebanks available.",
        "But our group works on such a parallel treebank for English, German and Swedish.",
        "Design decisions and first results were reported in (Volk and Samuelsson, 2004) and (Samuelsson and Volk, 2005).",
        "We believe that such parallel treebanks will allow a more focused and more detailed comparison of phenomena across languages."
