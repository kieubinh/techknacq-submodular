        "For some years, a particular set of examples has been used to provide support for nativist theories of first language acquisition (FLA).",
        "These examples, which hinge around auxiliary inversion in the formation of questions in English, have been considered to provide a strong argument in favour of the nativist claim: that FLA proceeds primarily through innately specified domain specific mechanisms or knowledge, rather than through the operation of general-purpose cognitive mechanisms.",
        "A key point of empirical debate is the frequency of occurrence of the forms in question.",
        "If these are vanishingly rare, or non-existent in the primary linguistic data, and yet children acquire the construction in question, then the hypothesis that they have innate knowledge would be supported.",
        "But this rests on the assumption that examples of that specific construction are necessary for learning to proceed.",
        "In this paper we show that this assumption is false: that this particular construction can be learned without the learner being exposed to any examples of that particular type.",
        "Our demonstration is primarily mathematical/computational: we present a simple experiment that demonstrates the applicability of this approach to this particular problem neatly, but the data we use is not intended to be a realistic representation of the primary linguistic data, nor is the particular algorithm we use suitable for large scale grammar induction.",
        "We present a general purpose context-free grammatical algorithm that is provably correct under a certain learning criterion.",
        "This algorithm incorporates no domain specific knowledge: it has no specific information about language; no knowledge of X-bar schemas, no hidden sources of information to reveal the structure.",
        "It operates purely on unannotated strings of raw text.",
        "Obviously, as all learning algorithms do, it has an implicit learning bias.",
        "This very simple algorithm has a particularly clear bias, with a simple mathematical description, that allows a remarkably simple characterisation of the set of languages that it can learn.",
        "This algorithm does not use a statistical learning paradigm that has to be tested on large quantities of data.",
        "Rather it uses a",
        "symbolic learning paradigm, that works efficiently with very small quantities of data, while being very sensitive to noise.",
        "We discuss this choice in some depth below.",
        "For reasons that were first pointed out by Chomsky (Chomsky, 1975, pages 129–137), algorithms of this type are not capable of learning all of natural language.",
        "It turns out, however, that algorithms based on this approach are sufficiently strong to learn some key properties of language, such as the correct rule for forming polar questions.",

        "We will present the dispute in traditional terms, though later we shall analyse some of the assumptions implicit in this description.",
        "In English, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions) are formed by fronting an auxiliary, and adding a dummy auxiliary “do” if the main verb is not an auxiliary.",
        "For example, Example 1a The man is hungry.",
        "Example 1b Is the man hungry?",
        "When the subject NP has a relative clause that also contains an auxiliary, the auxiliary that is moved is not the auxiliary in the relative clause, but the one in the main (matrix) clause.",
        "Example 2a The man who is eating is hungry.",
        "Example 2b Is the man who is eating hungry?",
        "An alternative rule would be to move the first occurring auxiliary, i.e. the one in the relative clause, which would produce the form Example 2c Is the man who eating is hungry?",
        "In some sense, there is no reason that children should favour the correct rule, rather than the incorrect one, since they are both of similar complexity and so on.",
        "Yet children do in fact, when provided with the appropriate context, produce sentences of the form of Example 2b, and rarely if ever produce errors of the form Example 2c (Crain and Nakayama, 1987).",
        "The problem is how to account for this phenomenon.",
        "Chomsky claimed first, that sentences of the type in Example 2b are vanishingly rare in the linguistic environment that children are exposed to, yet when tested they unfailingly produce the correct form rather than the incorrect Example 2c.",
        "This is put forward as strong evidence in favour of innately specified language specific knowledge: we shall refer to this view as linguistic nativism.",
        "In a special volume of the Linguistic Review, Pul-lum and Scholz (Pullum and Scholz, 2002), showed that in fact sentences of this type are not rare at all.",
        "Much discussion ensued on this empirical question and the consequences of this in the context of arguments for linguistic nativism.",
        "These debates revolved around both the methodology employed in the study, and also the consequences of such claims for nativist theories.",
        "It is fair to say that in spite of the strength of Pullum and Scholz’s arguments, nativists remained completely unconvinced by the overall argument.",
        "(Reali and Christiansen, 2004) present a possible solution to this problem.",
        "They claim that local statistics, effectively n-grams, can be sufficient to indicate to the learner which alternative should be preferred.",
        "However this argument has been carefully rebutted by (Kam et al., 2005), who show that this argument relies purely on a phonological coincidence in English.",
        "This is unsurprising since it is implausible that a flat, finite-state model should be powerful enough to model a phenomenon that is clearly structure dependent in this way.",
        "In this paper we argue that the discussion about the rarity of sentences that exhibit this particular structure is irrelevant: we show that simple grammatical inference algorithms can learn this property even in the complete absence of sentences of this particular type.",

        "We have demonstrated, if nothing else, that that view is false.",
        "The distinction can be learnt from a set of data that does not include any example of the exact piece of data required: as long as the various parts can be learned separately, the combination will function in the natural way.",
        "A more interesting question is the extent to which the biases implicit in the learning algorithm are domain specific.",
        "Clearly the algorithm has a strong bias.",
        "It overgeneralises massively.",
        "One of the advantages of the algorithm for the purposes of this paper is that its triviality allows a remarkably clear and explicit statement of its bias.",
        "But is this bias specific to the domain of language?",
        "It in no way refers to anything specific to the field of language, still less specific to human language – no references to parts of speech, or phrases, or even hierarchical phrase structure.",
        "It is now widely recognised that this sort of recursive structure is domain-general (Jackendoff and Pinker, 2005).",
        "We have selected for this demonstration an algorithm from grammatical inference.",
        "A number of statistical models have been proposed over the last few years by researchers such as (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004) and (Solan et al., 2005).",
        "These models impressively manage to extract significant structure from raw data.",
        "However, for our purposes, neither of these models is suitable.",
        "Klein and Manning’s model uses a variety of different cues, which combine with some specific initialisation and smoothing, and an explicit constraint to produce binary branching trees.",
        "Though very impressive, the model is replete with domain-specific biases and assumptions.",
        "Moreover, it does not learn a language in the strict sense (a subset of the set of all strings), though it would be a simple modification to make it perform such a task.",
        "The model by Solan et al.",
        "would be more suitable for this task, but again the complexity of the algorithm, which has numerous components and heuristics, and the lack of a theoretical justification for these heuristics again makes the task of identifying exactly what these biases are, and more importantly how domain specific they are,",
        "a very significant problem.",
        "In this model, the bias of the algorithm is completely encapsulated in the assumption u = v implies u - v. It is worth pointing out that this does not even need hierarchical structure – the model could be implemented purely as a reduction system or semi-Thue system.",
        "The disadvantage of using that approach is that it is possible to construct some bizarre examples where the number of reductions can be exponential.",
        "Using statistical properties of the set of strings, it is possible to extend these learnability results to a more substantial class of context free languages, though it is unlikely that these methods could be extended to a class that properly contains all natural languages."

        "We have presented an analysis of the argument that the acquisition of auxiliary fronting in polar interrogatives supports linguistic nativism.",
