        "We then explore the impact on performance of using ASR output as opposed to human transcription.",
        "Examination of the effect of features shows that predicting top-level and predicting subtopic boundaries are two distinct tasks: (1) for predicting subtopic boundaries, the lexical cohesion-based approach alone can achieve competitive results, (2) for predicting top-level boundaries, the machine learning approach that combines lexical-cohesion and conversational features performs best, and (3) conversational cues, such as cue phrases and overlapping speech, are better indicators for the top-level prediction task.",
        "We also find that the transcription errors inevitable in ASR output have a negative impact on models that combine lexical-cohesion and conversational features, but do not change the general preference of approach for the two tasks."

        "Text segmentation, i.e., determining the points at which the topic changes in a stream of text, plays an important role in applications such as topic detection and tracking, summarization, automatic genre detection and information retrieval and extraction (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002).",
        "In recent work, researchers have applied these techniques to corpora such as newswire feeds, transcripts of radio broadcasts, and spoken dialogues, in order to facilitate browsing, information retrieval, and topic detection (Allan et al., 1998; van Mulbregt et al., 1999; Shriberg et al., 2000; Dharanipragada et al., 2000; Blei and Moreno, 2001; Christensen et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we focus on segmentation of multiparty dialogues, in particular recordings of small group meetings.",
        "We compare models based solely on lexical information, which are common in approaches to automatic segmentation of text, with models that combine lexical and conversational features.",
        "Because tasks as diverse as browsing, on the one hand, and summarization, on the other, require different levels of granularity of segmentation, we explore the performance of our models for two tasks: hypothesizing where major topic changes occur and hypothesizing where more subtle nested topic shifts occur.",
        "In addition, because we do not wish to make the assumption that high quality transcripts of meeting records, such as those produced by human transcribers, will be commonly available, we require algorithms that operate directly on automatic speech recognition (ASR) output."

        "Therefore, we conclude that for predicting both top-level and subtopic boundaries from human transcriptions, the most important features are the lexical cohesion based features (LF), followed by cue phrases (CUE), with interactional features contributing to improved performance only when used in combination with LF and CUE.",
        "However, a closer look at the Pk scores in Table 2, adds further evidence to our hypothesis that predicting subtopics may be a different task from predicting top-level topics.",
        "Subtopic shifts occur more frequently, and often without clear conversational cues.",
