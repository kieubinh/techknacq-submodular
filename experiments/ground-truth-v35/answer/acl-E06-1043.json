        "The term idiom has been applied to a fuzzy category with prototypical examples such as by and large, kick the bucket, and let the cat out of the bag.",
        "Providing a definitive answer for what idioms are, and determining how they are learned and understood, are still subject to debate (Glucksberg, 1993; Nunberg et al., 1994).",
        "Nonetheless, they are often defined as phrases or sentences that involve some degree of lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic idiosyncrasy.",
        "Idiomatic expressions, as a part of the vast family of figurative language, are widely used both in colloquial speech and in written language.",
        "Moreover, a phrase develops its idiomaticity over time (Cacciari, 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie et al., 1983; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).",
        "Idioms thus pose a serious challenge, both for the creation of wide-coverage computational lexicons, and for the development of large-scale, linguistically plausible natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "One problem is due to the range of syntactic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic expressions.",
        "Some idioms, such as by and large, contain syntactic violations; these are often completely fixed and hence can be listed in a lexicon as “words with spaces” (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "However, among those idioms that are syntactically well-formed, some exhibit limited morphosyntactic flexibility, while others may be more syntactically flexible.",
        "For example, the idiom shoot the breeze undergoes verbal inflection (shot the breeze), but not internal modification or passivization (?shoot the fun breeze, ?the breeze was shot).",
        "In contrast, the idiom spill the beans undergoes verbal inflection, internal modification, and even passivization.",
        "Clearly, a words-with-spaces approach does not capture the full range of behaviour of such idiomatic expressions.",
        "Another barrier to the appropriate handling of idioms in a computational system is their semantic idiosyncrasy.",
        "This is a particular issue for those idioms that conform to the grammar rules of the language.",
        "Such idiomatic expressions are indistinguishable on the surface from compositional (non-idiomatic) phrases, but a computational system must be capable of distinguishing the two.",
        "For example, a machine translation system should translate the idiom shoot the breeze as a single unit of meaning (“to chat”), whereas this is not the case for the literal phrase shoot the bird.",
        "In this study, we focus on a particular class of English phrasal idioms, i.e., those that involve the combination of a verb plus a noun in its direct object position.",
        "Examples include shoot the breeze, pull strings, and push one’s luck.",
        "We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs).",
        "The class of VNICs accommodates a large number of idiomatic expressions (Cowie et al., 1983; Nunberg et al., 1994).",
        "Moreover, their peculiar be",
        "haviour signifies the need for a distinct treatment in a computational lexicon (Fellbaum, 2005).",
        "Despite this, VNICs have been granted relatively little attention within the computational linguistics community.",
        "We look into two closely related problems confronting the appropriate treatment of VNICs: (i) the problem of determining their degree of flexibility; and (ii) the problem of determining their level of idiomaticity.",
        "Section 2 elaborates on the lexicosyntactic flexibility of VNICs, and how this relates to their idiomaticity.",
        "In Section 3, we propose two linguistically-motivated statistical measures for quantifying the degree of lexical and syntactic inflexibility (or fixedness) of verb+noun combinations.",
        "Section 4 presents an evaluation of the proposed measures.",
        "In Section 5, we put forward a technique for determining the syntactic variations that a VNIC can undergo, and that should be included in its lexical representation.",

        "To discover the Cform(s) for a given idiomatic verb–noun pair, we thus examine its frequency of occurrence in each syntactic pattern in PS.",
        "Since it is possible for an idiom to have more than one Cform, we cannot simply take the most dominant pattern as the canonical one.",

        "We evaluate the appropriateness of this approach in determining the Cform(s) of idiomatic pairs by verifying its predicted forms against OD-CIE and CCID.",
        "Specifically, for each of the 100 idiomatic pairs in TESTall, we calculate the precision and recall of its predicted Cforms (those whose z-scores are above T,), compared to the Cforms listed in the two dictionaries.",
        "The average precision across the 100 test pairs is 81.7%, and the average recall is 88.0% (with 69 of the pairs having 100% precision and 100% recall).",

      "text": [
        "The significance of the role idioms play in language has long been recognized.",
        "However, due to their peculiar behaviour, idioms have been mostly overlooked by the NLP community.",
        "Recently, there has been growing awareness of the importance of identifying non-compositional multiword expressions (MWEs).",
        "Nonetheless, most research on the topic has focused on compound nouns and verb particle constructions.",
        "Earlier work on idioms have only touched the surface of the problem, failing to propose explicit mechanisms for appropriately handling them.",
        "Here, we provide effective mechanisms for the treatment of a broadly documented and crosslinguistically frequent class of idioms, i.e., VNICs.",
        "Earlier research on the lexical encoding of idioms mainly relied on the existence of human annotations, especially for detecting which syntactic variations (e.g., passivization) an idiom can undergo (Villavicencio et al., 2004).",
        "We propose techniques for the automatic acquisition and encoding of knowledge about the lexicosyntactic behaviour of idiomatic combinations.",
        "We put forward a means for automatically discovering the set of syntactic variations that are tolerated by a VNIC and that should be included in its lexical representation.",
        "Moreover, we incorporate such information into statistical measures that effectively predict the idiomaticity level of a given expression.",
        "In this regard, our work relates to previous studies on determining the compositionality (inverse of idiomaticity) of MWEs other than idioms.",
        "Most previous work on compositionality of MWEs either treat them as collocations (Smadja, 1993), or examine the distributional similarity between the expression and its constituents (McCarthy et al., 2003; Baldwin et al., 2003; Ban-nard et al., 2003).",
        "Lin (1999) and Wermter and Hahn (2005) go one step further and look into a linguistic property of non-compositional compounds – their lexical fixedness – to identify them.",
        "Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) combine aspects of the above-mentioned work, by incorporating lexical fixedness, collocation-based, and distributional similarity measures into a set of features which are used to rank verb+noun combinations according to their compositionality.",
        "Our work differs from such studies in that it carefully examines several linguistic properties of VNICs that distinguish them from literal (compositional) combinations.",
        "Moreover, we suggest novel techniques for translating such characteristics into measures that predict the idiomaticity level of verb+noun combinations.",
        "More specifically, we propose statistical measures that quantify the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of such combinations.",
        "We demonstrate (v n) = f (v, n Pty)– f z �",
        "that these measures can be successfully applied to the task of automatically distinguishing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.",
        "We also show that our syntactic and overall fixedness measures substantially outperform a widely used measure of collocation, PMI, even when the latter takes syntactic relations into account.",
        "Others have also drawn on the notion of syntactic fixedness for idiom detection, though specific to a highly constrained type of idiom (Widdows and Dorow, 2005).",
        "Our syntactic fixedness measure looks into a broader set of patterns associated with a large class of idiomatic expressions.",
        "Moreover, our approach is general and can be easily extended to other idiomatic combinations.",
        "Each measure we use to identify VNICs captures a different aspect of idiomaticity: PMI reflects the statistical idiosyncrasy of VNICs, while the fixedness measures draw on their lexicosyntactic peculiarities.",
        "Our ongoing work focuses on combining these measures to distinguish VNICs from other idiosyncratic verb+noun combinations that are neither purely idiomatic nor completely literal, so that we can identify linguistically plausible classes of verb+noun combinations on this continuum (Fazly and Stevenson, 2005)."
