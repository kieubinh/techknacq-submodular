        "MSA is also used in some scripted spoken communication (news casts, parliamentary debates).",
        "MSA is based on Classical Arabic and is not a native language of any Arabic speaking people, i.e., children do not learn it from their parents but in school.",
        "Most native speakers of Arabic are unable to produce sustained spontaneous MSA.",
        "Dialects vary not only along a geographical continuum but also with other sociolinguistic variables such as the urban/rural/Bedouin dimension.",
        "The multidialectal situation has important negative consequences for Arabic natural language processing (NLP): since the spoken dialects are not officially written and do not have standard orthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate corpora, even unannotated corpora, to use for training NLP tools such as parsers.",
        "Furthermore, there are almost no parallel corpora involving one dialect and MSA.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of parsing transcribed spoken Levantine Arabic (LA), which we use as a representative example of the Arabic dialects.2 Our work is based on the assumption that it is easier to manually create new resources that relate LA to MSA than it is to manually create syntactically annotated corpora in LA.",
        "Our approaches do not assume the existence of any annotated LA corpus (except for development and testing), nor of a parallel LA-MSA corpus.",
        "Instead, we assume we have at our disposal a lexicon that relates LA lexemes to MSA lexemes, and knowledge about the morphological and syntactic differences between LA and MSA.",
        "For a single dialect, it may be argued that it is easier to create corpora than to encode all this knowledge explicitly.",
        "In response, we claim that because the dialects show important similarities, it will be easier to reuse and modify explicit linguistic resources for a new dialect, than to create a new corpus for it.",
        "The goal of this paper is to show that leveraging LA/MSA",
        "resources is feasible; we do not provide a demonstration of cost-effectiveness.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After discussing related work and available corpora, we present linguistic issues in LA and MSA (Section 4).",
        "We then proceed to discuss three approaches: sentence transduction, in which the LA sentence to be parsed is turned into an MSA sentence and then parsed with an MSA parser (Section 5); treebank transduction, in which the MSA treebank is turned into an LA treebank (Section 6); and grammar transduction, in which an MSA grammar is turned into an LA grammar which is then used for parsing LA (Section 7).",

        "We have built three frameworks for leveraging MSA corpora and explicit knowledge about the lexical, morphological, and syntactic differences between MSA and LA for parsing LA.",

        "We see that some important improvements in parsing",
        "error reduction in F-measure over baseline (using MSA parser on LA test corpus); all numbers are for best obtained results using that method quality can be achieved.",
        "We also remind the reader that on the ATB, state-of-the-art performance is currently about 75% F-measure.",
        "There are several important ways in which we can expand our work.",
        "For the sentence-transduction approach, we plan to explore the use of a larger set of permutations; to use improved language models on MSA (such as language models built on genres closer to speech); to use lattice parsing (Sima’an, 2000) directly on the translation lattice and to integrate this approach with the treebank transduction approach.",
        "For the treebank and grammar transduction approaches, we would like to explore more systematic syntactic, morphological, and lexico-syntactic transformations.",
        "We would also like to explore the feasibility of inducing the syntactic and morphological transformations automatically.",
        "Specifically for the treebank transduction approach, it would be interesting to apply an LA language model for the lexical substitution phase as a means of pruning out implausible word sequences.",
        "For all three approaches, one major impediment to obtaining better results is the disparity in genre and domain which affects the overall performance.",
        "This may be bridged by finding MSA data that is more in the domain of the LA test corpus than the MSA treebank."
