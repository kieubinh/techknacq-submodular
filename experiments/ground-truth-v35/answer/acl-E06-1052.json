        "A crucial challenge for semantic NLP applications is recognizing the many different ways for expressing the same information.",
        "This semantic variability phenomenon was addressed within specific applications, such as question answering, information extraction and information retrieval.",
        "Recently, the problem was investigated within generic application-independent paradigms, such as paraphrasing and textual entailment.",
        "Eventually, it would be most appealing to apply generic models for semantic variability to concrete applications.",
        "This paper investigates the applicability of a generic “paraphrase-based” approach to the Relation Extraction (RE) task, using an available RE dataset of protein interactions.",
        "RE is highly suitable for such investigation since its goal is to exactly identify all the different variations in which a target semantic relation can be expressed.",
        "Taking this route sets up a dual goal: (a) from the generic paraphrasing perspective - an objective evaluation of paraphrase acquisition performance on a concrete application dataset, as well as identifying the additional mechanisms needed to match paraphrases in texts; (b) from the RE perspective - investigating the feasibility and performance of a generic paraphrase-based approach for RE.",
        "Our configuration assumes a set of entailing templates (non-symmetric “paraphrases”) for the target relation.",
        "For example, for the target relation “X interact with Y” we would assume a set of entailing templates as in Tables 3 and 7.",
        "In addition, we require a syntactic matching module that identifies template instances in text.",
        "First, we manually analyzed the protein-interaction dataset and identified all cases in which protein interaction is expressed by an entailing template.",
        "This set a very high idealized upper bound for the recall of the paraphrase-based approach for this dataset.",
        "Yet, obtaining high coverage in practice would require effective paraphrase acquisition and lexical-syntactic template matching.",
        "Next, we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web (Szpektor et al., 2004), the Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1998) and a syntactic matching module.",
        "As expected, the performance of the implemented system was much lower than the ideal upper bound, yet obtaining quite reasonable practical results given its unsupervised nature.",
        "The contributions of our investigation follow",
        "the dual goal set above.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive evaluation that measures directly the performance of unsupervised paraphrase acquisition relative to a standard application dataset.",
        "It is also the first evaluation of a generic paraphrase-based approach for the standard RE setting.",
        "Our findings are encouraging for both goals, particularly relative to their early maturity level, and reveal constructive evidence for the remaining room for improvement."

        "Our approach differs from previous unsupervised IE methods in that we identify instances of a specific relation while prior methods identified template relevance only at the general scenario level.",
        "We manually analyzed the potential of our approach on a dataset annotated with protein interactions.",
        "The analysis shows that 93% of the interacting protein pairs can be potentially identified with the template-based approach.",
        "Additionally,",
        "we manually assessed the coverage of the TEASE acquisition algorithm and found that 63% of the distinct pairs can be potentially recognized with the learned templates, assuming an ideal matcher, indicating a significant potential recall for completely unsupervised paraphrase acquisition.",
        "Finally, we evaluated our current system performance and found it weaker than supervised RE methods, being far from fulfilling the potential indicated in our manual analyses due to insufficient syntactic matching.",
        "But, even our current performance may be considered useful given the very small amount of domain-specific information used by the system.",
        "Most importantly, we believe that our analysis and evaluation methodologies for an RE dataset provide an excellent benchmark for unsupervised learning of paraphrases and entailment rules.",
        "In the long run, we plan to develop and improve our acquisition and matching algorithms, in order to realize the observed potential of the paraphrase-based approach.",
        "Notably, our findings point to the need to learn generic morphological and syntactic variations in template matching, an area which has rarely been addressed till now."
