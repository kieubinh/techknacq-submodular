        "Reference resolution has proven to be a major obstacle in building robust systems for information extraction, question answering, text summarization and a number of other natural language processing tasks.",
        "Most reference resolution systems use representations built out of the lexical and syntactic attributes of the noun phrases (or “mentions”) for which reference is to be established.",
        "These attributes may involve string matching, agreement, syntactic distance, and positional information, and they tend to rely primarily on the immediate context of the noun phrases (with the possible exception of sentence-spanning distance measures such as Hobbs distance).",
        "Though gains have been made with such methods (Tetreault 2001; Mitkov 2000; Soon et al.",
        "2001; Ng and Cardie 2002), there are clearly cases where this sort of local information will not be sufficient to resolve coreference correctly.",
        "Coreference is by definition a semantic relationship: two noun phrases corefer if they both refer to the same real-world entity.",
        "We should therefore expect a successful coreference system to exploit world knowledge, inference, and other forms of semantic information in order to resolve hard cases.",
        "If, for example, two nouns refer to people who work for two different organizations, we want our system to infer that these noun phrases cannot corefer.",
        "Further progress will likely be aided by flexible frameworks for representing and using the information provided by this kind of semantic relation between noun phrases.",
        "This paper tries to make a small step in that direction.",
        "It describes a robust reference resolver that incorporates a broad range of semantic information in a general news domain.",
        "Using an ontology that describes relations between entities (the Automated Content Extraction program1 relation ontology) along with a training corpus annotated for relations under this ontology, we first train a classifier for identifying relations.",
        "We then apply the output of this relation tagger to the task of reference resolution.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the efforts made by previous researchers to use semantic information in reference resolution.",
        "Section 3 describes our own method for incorporating document-level semantic context into coreference decisions.",
        "We propose a representation of semantic context that isolates a particularly informative structure of interaction between semantic relations and coreference.",
        "Section 4 explains in detail our strategies for using relation information to modify coreference decisions, and the linguistic intuitions behind these strategies.",
        "Section 5 then presents the system architectures and algorithms we use to incorporate relational information into reference resolution.",
        "Section 6 presents the results of experiments on both English and Chinese test data.",

        "Our central goal is to model semantic and coreference structures in such a way that we can take advantage of a semantic context larger than the individual noun phrase when making coreference decisions.",
        "Ideally, this model should make it possible to pick out important features in the context and to distinguish useful signals from background noise.",
        "It should, for example, be able to represent such basic relational facts as whether the (possibly identical) people referenced by two noun phrases work in the same organization, whether they own the same car, etc.",
        "And it should be able to use this information to resolve references even when surface features such as lexical or grammatical attributes are imperfect or fail altogether.",
        "In this paper we present a Relational Coreference Model (abbreviated as RCM) that makes progress toward these goals.",
        "To represent semantic relations, we use an ontology (the ACE 2004 relation ontology) that describes 7 main types of relations between entities and 23 subtypes (Table 1).2 These relations prove to be more reliable guides for coreference than simple lexical context or even tests for the semantic compatibility of heads and modifiers.",
        "The process of tagging relations implicitly selects relevant items of context and abstracts raw lists of modifiers into a representation that is deeper, but still relatively lightweight.",

        "The resulting knowledge sources fall into two categories: rules that improve precision by pruning incorrect coreference links between mentions, and rules that improve recall by recovering missed links.",
        "To formalize these relation patterns, based on Figure 1, we define the following clauses:",
        "A: RelationType1 = RelationType2 B: RelationSubType1 = RelationSubType2 C: Two Relations have the same direction Same_Relation: A ∧ B ∧ C",

        "For example, if Mention1a and Mention 2a both refer to the same nation, and Mentions 1b and 2b participate in citizenship relations (GPE-AFF) with Mentions 1a and 2a respectively, we should not necessarily conclude that 1b and 2b refer to the same person.",

        "Our system learns broad restrictions like these by evaluating the accuracy of Rules (1) and (3) when they are instantiated with each possible relation type and direction and used as weak classifiers.",
        "For each such instantiation we use cross-validation on our training data to calculate a reliability weight defined as: |Correct decisions by rule for given instance| |Total applicable cases for given instance| We count the number of correct decisions for a rule instance by taking the rule instance as the only source of information for coreference resolution and making only those decisions suggested by the rule’s implication (interpreting CorefBMoreLikely as an assertion that mention 1b and mention 2b do in fact corefer, and interpreting CorefBLessLikely as an assertion that they do not corefer).",
        "Every rule instance with a reliability weight of 70% or greater is retained for inclusion in the final system.",
        "Rule (2) cannot be instantiated with a single type because it requires that the two relation types be different, and so we do not perform this filtering for Rule (2) (Rule (2) has 97% accuracy across all relation types).",

        "Tests include equality of mention heads, substring matching, absence of temporal key words such as “current” and “former,” number agreement, and high confidence for original coreference decisions (Mention1b and Mention2b).",
        "For each rule below the reliability threshold, we search for combinations of 3 or fewer of these restrictions until we achieve reliability of 70% or we have exhausted the search space.",
