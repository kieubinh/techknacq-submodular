        "Evaluations on the task of Japanese text input show that MSR can handle a large number of features and training samples; it significantly outperforms a regular trigram model trained using maximum likelihood estimation, and it also outperforms the two widely applied discriminative methods, the boosting and the per-ceptron algorithms, by a small but statistically significant margin."

        "Language modeling (LM) is fundamental to a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition and Asian language text input (Jelinek 1997; Gao et al.",
        "2002).",
        "The traditional approach uses a parametric model with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), usually with smoothing methods to deal with data sparseness problems.",
        "This approach is optimal under the assumption that the true distribution of data on which the parametric model is based is known.",
        "Unfortunately, such an assumption rarely holds in realistic applications.",
        "An alternative approach to LM is based on the framework of discriminative training, which uses a much weaker assumption that training and test data are generated from the same distribution but the form of the distribution is unknown.",
        "Unlike the traditional approach that maximizes the function (i.e. likelihood of training data) that is loosely associated with error rate, discriminative training methods aim to directly minimize the error rate on training data even if they reduce the likelihood.",
        "So, they potentially lead to better solutions.",
        "However, the error rate of a finite set of training samples is usually a step function of model parameters, and cannot be easily minimized.",
        "To address this problem, previous research has concentrated on the development of a loss function that approximates the exact error rate and can be easily optimized.",
        "Though these methods (e.g. the boosting method) have theoretically appealing properties, such as convergence and bounded generalization error, we argue that the approximated loss function may prevent them from attaining the original objective of minimizing the error rate.",
        "In this paper we present a new estimation procedure for LM, called minimum sample risk (MSR).",
        "It differs from most existing discriminative training methods in that instead of searching on an approximated loss function, MSR employs a simple heuristic training algorithm that minimizes the error rate on training samples directly.",
        "MSR operates like a multidimensional function optimization algorithm: first, it selects a subset of features that are the most effective among all candidate features.",
        "The parameters of the model are then optimized iteratively: in each iteration, only the parameter of one feature is adjusted.",
        "Both feature selection and parameter optimization are based on the criterion of minimizing the error on training samples.",
        "Our evaluation on the task of Japanese text input shows that MSR achieves more than 20% error rate reduction over MLE on two newswire data sets, and it also outperforms the other two widely applied discriminative methods, the boosting method and the perceptron algorithm, by a small but statistically significant margin.",
        "Although it has not been proved in theory that MSR is always robust, our experiments of cross-domain LM adaptation show that it is.",
        "MSR can effectively adapt a model trained on one domain to",
        "different domains.",
        "It outperforms the traditional LM adaptation method significantly, and achieves at least comparable or slightly better results to the boosting method and the perceptron algorithm."

        "So the decision of Equation (1) depends solely upon P(W), making IME a more direct evaluation test bed for LM than speech recognition.",
        "Another advantage is that it is easy to convert W to A (for Chinese and Japanese), which enables us to obtain a large number of training data for discriminative learning, as described later.",
        "The values of P(W) in Equation (1) are traditionally calculated by MLE: the optimal model parameters λ* are chosen in such a way that P(W |λ*) is maximized on training data.",
        "The arguments in favor of MLE are based on the assumption that the form of the underlying distributions is known, and that only the values of the parameters characterizing those distributions are unknown.",
        "In using MLE for LM, one always assumes a multinomial distribution of language.",
        "For example, a trigram model makes the assumption that the next word is predicted depending only on two preceding words.",
        "However, there are many cases in natural language where words over an arbitrary distance can be related.",

Without loss of generality, f0(W) is called the base feature, and is defined in our case as the log probability that the word trigram model assigns to W. Other features (fd(W), for d = 1...D) are defined as the counts of word n-grams (n = 1 and 2 in our experiments) in W. • Finally, the parameters of the model form a vector of D+1 dimensions, each for one feature function, λ = [λ0, λ1, ..., λD].",

        "Though MSR achieves impressive performance in CER reduction over the comparison methods, as described in Section 4.2, the experiments are all performed using newspaper text for both training and testing, which is not a realistic scenario if we are to deploy the model in an application.",
        "This section reports the results of additional experiments in which we adapt a model trained on one domain to a different domain, i.e., in a so-called cross-domain LM adaptation paradigm.",
        "See (Suzuki and Gao 2005) for a detailed report.",
        "The data sets we used stem from five distinct sources of text.",
        "The Nikkei newspaper corpus described in Section 4.1 was used as the background domain, on which the word trigram model was trained.",
        "We used four adaptation domains: Yomiuri (newspaper corpus), TuneUp (balanced corpus containing newspapers and other sources of text), Encarta (encyclopedia) and Shincho (collection of novels).",
        "For each of the four domains, we used an 72,000-sentence subset as adaptation training data, a 5,000-sentence subset as held-out data and another 5,000-sentence subset as test data.",
        "Similarly, all corpora have been word-segmented, and we kept for each training sample, in the four adaptation domains, the best 20 hypotheses in its candidate conversion set for discriminative training.",
        "We compared MSR with three other LM adaptation methods: Baseline is the background word trigram model, as described in Section 4.1.",
        "MAP (maximum a posteriori) is a traditional LM adaptation method where the parameters of the background model are adjusted in such a way that maximizes the likelihood of the adaptation data.",
        "Our implementation takes the form of linear interpolation as P(wi |h) = λPb(wi |h) + (1-λ)Pa(wi |h), where Pb is the probability of the background model, Pa is the probability trained on adaptation data using MLE and the history h corresponds to two preceding words (i.e. Pb and Pa are trigram probabilities).",
        "λ is the interpolation weight optimized on held-out data.",
        "Perceptron, Boosting and MSR are the three discriminative methods described in the previous sections.",
        "For each of them, the base feature was",
        "derived from the word trigram model trained on the background data, and other n-gram features (i.e. fd, d = 1...D in Equation (2)) were trained on adaptation data.",
        "That is, the parameters of the background model are adjusted in such a way that minimizes the errors on adaptation data made by background model.",
        "Results are summarized in Table 2.",
        "First of all, in all four adaptation domains, discriminative methods outperform MAP significantly.",
        "Secondly, the improvement margins of discriminative methods over MAP correspond to the similarities between background domain and adaptation domains.",
        "When the two domains are very similar to the background domain (such as Yomiuri), discriminative methods outperform MAP by a large margin.",
        "However, the margin is smaller when the two domains are substantially different (such as Encarta and Shincho).",
        "The phenomenon is attributed to the underlying difference between the two adaptation methods: MAP aims to improve the likelihood of a distribution, so if the adaptation domain is very similar to the background domain, the difference between the two underlying distributions is so small that MAP cannot adjust the model effectively.",
        "However, discriminative methods do not have this limitation for they aim to reduce errors directly.",
        "Finally, we find that in most adaptation test sets, MSR achieves slightly better CER results than the two competing discriminative methods.",
        "Specifically, the improvements of MSR are statistically significant over the boosting method in three out of four domains, and over the perceptron algorithm in the Yomiuri domain.",
        "The results demonstrate again that MSR is robust."

        "Discriminative models have recently been proved to be more effective than generative models in some NLP tasks, e.g., parsing (Collins 2000), POS tagging (Collins 2002) and LM for speech recognition (Roark et al.",

        "One of the reasons, as pointed out by Ng and Jordan (2002), is that the parameters of a discriminative model can be fit either to maximize the conditional likelihood on training data, or to minimize the training errors.",
        "Since the latter optimizes the objective function that the system is graded on, it is viewed as being more truly in the spirit of discriminative learning.",
        "The MSR method shares the same motivation: to minimize the errors directly as much as possible.",
        "Because the error function on a finite data set is a step function, and cannot be optimized easily, previous research approximates the error function by loss functions that are suitable for optimization (e.g. Collins 2000; Freund et al.",
        "1998; Juang et al.",
        "1997; Duda et al.",
        "2001).",

        "It is a simple heuristic training procedure to minimize training errors directly without applying any approximated loss function.",
        "MSR shares many similarities with previous methods.",
        "The basic training algorithm described in Section 3.2 follows the general framework of multidimensional optimization (e.g., Press et al.",
        "1992).",
        "The line search is an extension of that described in (Och 2003; Quirk et al.",
        "2005.",
        "The extension lies in the way of handling large number of features and training samples.",
        "Previous algorithms were used to optimize linear models with less than 10 features.",
        "The feature selection method described in Section 3.4 is a particular implementation of the feature selection methods described in (e.g., Theodoridis and Koutroumbas 2003).",
        "The major difference between the MSR and other methods is that it estimates the effectiveness of each feature in terms of its expected training error reduction while previous methods used metrics that are loosely coupled with reducing training errors.",
        "The way of dealing with feature correlations in feature selection in Equation (7), was suggested by Finette et al.",

        "We show that MSR is a very successful discriminative training algorithm for LM.",

        "This forms one area of our future work.",
        "One of the most interesting properties of MSR is that it can optimize any objective function (whether its gradient is computable or not), such as error rate in IME or speech, BLEU score in MT, precision and recall in IR (Gao et al.",
        "2005).",
        "In particular, MSR can be performed on large-scale training set with millions of candidate features.",
