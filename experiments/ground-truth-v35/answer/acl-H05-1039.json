        "2) What kind of questions can be answered by pattern matching?",
        "3) How much annotation is required for a pattern-based system to achieve good performance?",
        "4) What linguistic features are most useful?",
        "Extensive experiments are conducted on biographical questions and other definitional questions.",
        "Major findings include: 1) linguistic analysis and pattern learning are complementary; both are required to make a good definitional QA system; 2) pattern matching is very effective in answering biographical questions while less effective for other definitional questions; 3) only a small amount of annotation is required for a pattern learning system to achieve good performance on biographical questions; 4) the most useful linguistic features are copulas and appositives; relations also play an important role; only some propositions convey vital facts."

        "Due to the ever increasing large amounts of online textual data, learning from textual data is becoming more and more important.",

        "Question answering, which combines traditional document retrieval and information extraction, solves this problem directly by returning users the specific answers.",
        "Research in textual question answering has made substantial advances in the past few years (Voorhees, 2004).",
        "Most question answering research has been focusing on factoid questions where the goal is to return a list of facts about a concept.",
        "Definitional questions, however, remain largely unexplored.",
        "Definitional questions differ from factoid questions in that the goal is to return the relevant “answer nuggets” of information about a query.",
        "Identifying such answer nuggets requires more advanced language processing techniques.",
        "Definitional QA systems are not only interesting as a research challenge.",
        "They also have the potential to be a valuable complement to static knowledge sources like encyclopedias.",
        "This is because they create definitions dynamically, and thus answer definitional questions about terms which are new or emerging (Blair-Goldensoha et al., 2004).",
        "One success in factoid question answering is pattern based systems, either manually constructed (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002) or machine learned (Cui et al., 2004).",
        "However, it is unknown whether such pure pattern based systems work well on definitional questions where answers are more diverse.",
        "Deep linguistic analysis has been found useful in factoid question answering (Moldovan et al., 2002) and has been used for definitional questions (Xu et al., 2004; Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
        "Linguistic analy",
        "sis is useful because full parsing captures long distance dependencies between the answers and the query terms, and provides more information for inference.",
        "However, merely linguistic analysis may not be enough.",
        "First, current state of the art linguistic analysis such as parsing, co-reference, and relation extraction is still far below human performance.",
        "Errors made in this stage will propagate and lower system accuracy.",
        "Second, answers to some types of definitional questions may have strong local dependencies that can be better captured by surface patterns.",
        "Thus we believe that combining linguistic analysis and pattern learning would be complementary and be beneficial to the whole system.",
