        "While communicating, humans use different expressions to convey the same meaning.",
        "Therefore, numerous NLP applications, such as, Question Answering, Information Extraction, or Summarization require computational models of language that recognize if two texts semantically overlap.",
        "Trying to capture the major inferences needed to understand equivalent semantic expressions, the PASCAL Network proposed the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenge (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "Given two text fragments, the task is to determine if the meaning of one text (the entailed hypothesis, H) can be inferred from the meaning of the other text (the entailing text, T).",
        "Given the wide applicability of this task, there is an increased interest in creating systems which detect the semantic entailment between two texts.",
        "The systems that participated in the Pascal RTE challenge competition exploit various inference elements which, later, they combine within statistical models, scoring methods, or machine learning frameworks.",
        "Several systems (Bos and Markert, 2005; Herrera et al., 2005; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005; Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005; Newman et al., 2005) measured the word overlap between the two text strings.",
        "Using either statistical or Word-Net’s relations, almost all systems considered lexical relationships that indicate entailment.",
        "The degree of similarity between the syntactic parse trees of the two texts was also used as a clue for entailment by several systems (Herrera et al., 2005; Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Raina et al., 2005).",
        "Several groups used logic provers to show the entailment between T and H (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005; Raina et al., 2005) and some of them made use of world knowledge axioms to increase the logic prover’s power of inference (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we describe a novel technique which employs a set of semantic axioms in its attempt to exhaustively extract semantic knowledge from texts.",
        "In order to show the contribution that our semantic information extraction method brings, we append it as an additional module to an already existing system that participated in the RTE challenge.",
        "Our system (Fowler et al., 2005), first, transforms the text T and the hypothesis H into semantically enhanced logic forms, and, then, the integrated logic prover tries to prove or disprove the entailment using a set of world-knowledge axioms (die of blood loss – * bleed to death), linguistic rewriting rules which break down complex syntactic structures, like coordinating conjunctions, and WordNet-based lexical chains axioms (buy/VB/1 – * pay/VB/1)."

        "We believe that a logic-based semantic approach is highly appropriate for the RTE task'.",
        "Text T semantically entails H if its meaning logically implies the meaning of H. Because the set of semantic relations encoded in a text represents its meaning, we need to identify all the semantic relations that hold between the constituents of T and, subsequently, between the constituents of H to understand the meaning of each text.",
        "It should be noted that state-of-the-art semantic parsers extract only some of the semantic relations encoded in a given text.",
        "To complete this information, we need semantic axioms that augment the extracted knowledge and, thus, provide a better coverage of the text’s semantics.",
        "Once we gather this information, we state that text T entails hypothesis H if and only if we find similar relations between a concept from T and a semantically analogous concept from H. By analogous concepts, we mean identical concepts, or words connected by a chain of SYNONYMY, HYPERNYMY or morphological derivation relations in WordNet.",
        "Because the set of semantic elements identified by a semantic parser does not necessarily convey the complete meaning of a sentence, we shall use a set of semantic axioms to infer the missing pieces of information.",
        "By combining two semantic relations or by using the FrameNet’s frame elements identified in a given text, we derive new semantic information.",
        "In order to show if T entails H, we analyze their meanings.",
        "Our approach to semantic entailment involves the following stages:",
        "1.",
        "We convert each text into logic form (Moldovan and Rus, 2001).",
        "This conversion includes part-of-speech tagging, parse tree generation, and name entity recognition.",
        "2.",
        "Using our semantic parser, we identify some of the semantic relations encoded in the analyzed texts.",
        "We note that state-of-the-art semantic parsers cannot discover all the semantic relations conveyed implicitly or explicitly by the text.",
        "This problem compromises our system’s performance.",
        "To obtain the complete set of semantic relations that represents the meaning of the given texts, we introduce a new step in our algorithm.",
        "'After all, the entailment, inference, and equivalence terms originated from logic.",
        "3.",
        "We add semantic axioms to the already created set of world knowledge, NLP, and WordNet-based lexical chain (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002) axioms that assist the logic prover in its search for proofs.",
        "We developed semantic axioms that show how two semantic relations can be combined.",
        "This will allow the logic prover to combine, whenever possible, semantic instances in order to infer new semantic relationships.",
        "The instances of relations that participate in semantic combinations can be either provided by the text or annotated between WordNet synsets.",
        "We also exploit other sources of semantic information from the text.",

        "We claim that the process of applying the semantic axioms, given the semantic relations detected by a semantic parser, will capture the complete semantic information expressed by a text fragment.",

        "To ensure that H will be the last clause to participate, we assign it the largest value.",
        "The logic prover searches for new inferences that can be made using the smallest weight clauses.",
        "It also assigns a value to each inference based on the axiom it used to derive it.",

        "If a refutation is found, the proof is complete.",
        "If a contradiction cannot be found, then the predicate arguments are relaxed and, if the argument relaxation fails, then predicates are dropped until a proof by refutation is found.",
        "Its score will be computed by deducting points for each argument relaxation and predicate removal.",
        "If this value falls below a threshold, then T does not entail H. Otherwise, the (T, H) pair is a true entailment.",
        "We present a textual entailment example to show the steps of our approach.",
        "This proof will not",
        "make use of any world knowledge axioms.",
        "Let the text T be John and his son, George, emigrated with Mike, John’s uncle, to US in 1969 and the entailed hypothesis H George and his relative, Mike, came to America.",
        "Our system transforms each text into its corresponding semantically enhanced logic form (G.FT and G.FH in Table 1).",
        "Then, the logic prover uses the newly added semantic axioms to derive extra semantic information from T and H (for example, George and Mike are relatives, but T does not explicitly specify this), after another preprocessing step which identifies the frame elements of each frame encoded in the two texts (TDeparting, TKinship, HArriving, HKinship).",
