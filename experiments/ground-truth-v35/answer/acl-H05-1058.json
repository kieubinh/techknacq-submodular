        "A common sequence-labeling task in natural language processing involves assigning a part-of-speech (POS) tag to each word in the input text.",
        "Previous authors have used numerous HMM-based models (Banko and Moore, 2004; Collins, 2002; Lee et al., 2000; Thede and Harper, 1999) and other types of networks including maximum entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), conditional Markov models (Klein and Manning, 2002; McCallum et al., 2000), conditional random fields (CRF) (Laf-ferty et al., 2001), and cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "All of these models make use of varying amounts of contextual information.",
        "In this paper, we present a new model which remains within the well understood framework of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), and we show that it produces state-of-the-art results when applied to the POS-tagging task.",
        "This new model is conditionally-structured and, through the use of virtual evidence (Pearl, 1988; Bilmes, 2004), resolves the explaining-away problems (often described as label or observation bias) inherent in the CMM.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we discuss the differences between a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the corresponding conditional Markov model (CMM).",
        "In section 3 we describe our observed-child model (OCM), introducing the notion of virtual evidence, and providing an information-theoretic foundation for the use of negative training data.",
        "In section 4 we discuss our experiments and results, including a comparison of three simple first-order models and state-of-the-art results from our feature-rich second-order OCM.",
        "For clarity, the comparisons and derivations in sections 2 and 3 are done for first-order models using a single binary feature.",
        "The same ideas are then generalized to a higher order model with more features (including adjacent words)."

        "In this section we discuss the tradeoffs between the generative hidden Markov model (HMM) and the conditional Markov model (CMM).",
        "For pedagogical reasons, the figures and equations are for first order models with a single word-feature.",
        "The HMM shown in Figure 1 includes a single",
        "feature (the binary flag isCap) in addition to the word itself.",
        "Each observation, of = (wZ7 fi), is a word-feature pair.",
        "Let o = {oi} be the observation sequence and s = {si} be the associated tag (state) sequence.",
        "The HMM' factorizes the joint probability distribution over these two sequences as:",
        "A similar model often used for sequence labeling tasks is the conditional Markov model (CMM) which reverses the arrows between the words and the tags (Figure 2), and factorizes as:",
        "Because the words and features are observed, this model does not require that we compute the probability of the evidence, P(o), when finding the optimal tag sequence.",
        "The tag-sequence s which maximizes the joint probability P(s, o) is the same one that maximizes the conditional probability P(s|o).",
        "The CMM, therefore, does not require that we model the language, allowing us to focus on modeling the conditional probability of the tags given the words.",
        "The HMM has its advantages as well, principally that it is easier to train than the CMM because it",
        "factorizes the joint probability into simpler components.",
        "The tables required for P(si|si-1) and P(oi |si) are significantly smaller than the one for P(si |si-1, oz) which maybe difficult to estimate due to either data sparsity or normalization issues.",
        "One potential disadvantage of the HMM is that when it is trained using a maximum likelihood procedure, it is not necessarily encouraged to optimally classify tags due to its generative nature.",
        "One solution is to train the HMM using a discriminative procedure.",
        "Another option is to use entirely different models.",
        "A key disadvantage of the CMM is that it makes critical statements about independence that the HMM does not: the converging arrows at each tag put the parent nodes (the previous tag and the current observation) into causal competition and as a result the model states that the previous tag is independent of the current observation.",
        "In other words, all states (tags) are independent of future observations (words).",
        "The CMM thus incorporates a strong directional bias which does not exist in the HMM.",
        "One way to eliminate this bias is to use a CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001; McCallum, 2003), where factors over neighboring tags may use features from anywhere in the observation sequence.",
        "The CRF is discriminative and avoids label/observation bias by using a model that is constrained only in that the conditional distribution factorizes over an undirected Markov chain.",
        "However, most popular training procedures for a CRF are time-consuming and complex processes."

        "We thus propose a new solution to the problem, which retains the discriminative conditional form of “tag given word” from the CMM, but avoids label bias by temporally linking adjacent tags in a new way.",
        "Specifically, we employ virtual evidence in the form of a binary observed child node, ci, between adjacent tags (Figure 3) or a windowed sequence of tags.",
        "During decoding, this node will always be observed to be equal to 1 (one).",
        "Intuitively, this binary variable acts as an indicator of",
        "tag-pair consistency.",
        "When the tag pairs are consistent (as they are in real text), we should have a high conditional probability that ci = 1; and when the tag pairs are not consistent, the conditional probability that ci = 1 should be low.",
        "With this conditional distribution, observing ci = 1 during decoding expresses a preference for consistent tag pairs.",
        "The presence of this observed-child node results in a term in the factorization of the joint probability distribution that couples its parents:",
        "where ci is the observed-child node of tags si-1 and si, and we omit the probability of the observations, P(wZ7 fi) which do not affect the final choice of s. By the rules of d-separation (Pearl, 1988), the existence of ci defined in this way means that the parents (the adjacent tags) are not conditionally independent given the child.",
        "This link between adjacent tags through an observed-child node allows for a probabilistic relationship to exist between the adjacent tags.",
        "Thus, future words can influence tags, which is not true for the CMM.",
        "Whether or not a relationship between tags will actually be learned, however, will critically depend on how the model is trained.",

        "In other words, this na¨ıvely-trained model would assume that P(ci = 11 si – 1, SO _ 1 b (si-1, si), and when used to tag the sentences in the test-set (also labeled with ci = 1), it would maximize this simplified joint probability in which the relationship between si-1 and si has been lost:",
        "In order to induce and thereby have the model learn the relationship between the adjacent tags si-1 and si, the training has to be modified to include samples that are labeled with ci = 0.",
        "The probability table P(ci = 11 si – 1, si) should favor common (consistent) tag-pairs with high probabilities, while discouraging rare tag-pairs with low probabilities.",

The ratio of the amount of positive to negative training data should be the same as the ratio of our prior beliefs about tag-pair consistency, namely the ratio of P(ci = 1) to P(ci = 0).",
        "With no evidence to support that one is more likely than the other, one option is to use the strategy of “assuming the least” and use a maximum entropy prior, setting MO = Mi.",

        "From the start, we have implicitly postulated a relationship between adjacent tags.",
        "We now formally state two hypotheses: H1 that there is a relationship between adjacent tags which can be described by some joint probability distribution P(si-1, sz), and the null hypothesis, Ho, that there is no such relationship, i.e. sz-1 and sz are independent:",

        "Beginning with (Church and Hanks, 1989), numerous authors have used the pointwise mutual information between pairs of words to analyze word co-locations and associations.",

        "As expected, the sequence DT-NN (e.g. the surplus) occurs very often and gets a high score, while DT-DT (e.g. this a) and NN-DT (e.g. surplus the) occur infrequently and get low scores.",
        "The sequence NN-NN (e.g. trade surplus) gets a neutral score (A Pz� 1) indicating that if the preceding word is a noun, the likelihood that the current word is a noun is nearly equal to the likelihood that any randomly chosen word is a noun.",
        "We present two methods for inducing the negative training counts that are required to train the conditional probability table for P(cZ I sz-1, sz).",
        "In the first method, we generate “nonsense” sentences by randomly scrambling each sentence in the training-set n times, using a uniform distribution over all possible permutations.",
        "This results in n negative training sentences for each positive training sentence and therefore Mo = n • M1.",

        "where A _",

        "The method of scrambling sentences n-times only approximates the theory described above because it is performed on a sentence-by-sentence basis rather than across the entire training set.",
        "Also, the resulting negative training data represents only n realizations of a random process, so the total number of samples may not be large enough to approximate the underlying distribution.",
        "In the second method, rather than generate the negative training data in the form of scrambled sentences, we compute the negative-training counts directly, based on the positive unigram counts and the hypotheses presented in section 3.1.",
        "For example, the negative bigram counts are a function of the marginal probability of each tag, P(si):",
        "Negative unigram and trigram counts are computed in a similar fashion, and then the conditional probability table is derived as a smoothed back-off model directly from the combined sets of counts.",
        "These two methods are conceptually similar but may exhibit subtle differences: one is randomizing at the sentence level while the other operates over the entire training set and does not have the same sensitivity to small values of n."

        "The model stays entirely within the mathematically formal language of Bayesian networks, and even though it is conditional in nature, the model does not suffer from label or observation (or directional) bias.",
        "Staying within this framework has other advantages as well, including that the training procedures remain within the relatively simple maximum likelihood framework, albeit with appropriate smoothing.",
        "We believe that this model holds great promise for other NLP tasks as well as in other applications of machine-learning such as computational biology.",
        "In particular the way it factorizes the joint probability into a “horizontal” component which connects various nodes to the virtual-evidence node, and a “vertical” component (used here to link a tag to a set of observations), provides great simplicity, flexibility, and power."
