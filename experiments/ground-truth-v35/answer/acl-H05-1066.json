        "The primary reasons for using dependency structures instead of more informative lexicalized phrase structures is that they are more efficient to learn and parse while still encoding much of the predicate-argument information needed in applications.",
        "Dependency representations, which link words to their arguments, have a long history (Hudson, 1984).",
        "Figure 1 shows a dependency tree for the sentence John hit the ball with the bat.",
        "We restrict ourselves to dependency tree analyses, in which each word depends on exactly one parent, either another word or a dummy root symbol as shown in the figure.",
        "The tree in Figure 1 is projective, meaning that if we put the words in their linear order, preceded by the root, the edges can be drawn above the words without crossings, or, equivalently, a word and its descendants form a contiguous substring of the sentence.",
        "In English, projective trees are sufficient to analyze most sentence types.",
        "In fact, the largest source of English dependency trees is automatically generated from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and is by convention exclusively projective.",
        "However, there are certain examples in which a non-projective tree is preferable.",

        "Here the relative clause which was a Yorkshire Terrier and the object it modifies (the dog) are separated by an adverb.",
        "There is no way to draw the dependency tree for this sentence in the plane with no crossing edges, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In languages with more flexible word order than English, such as German, Dutch and Czech, non-projective dependencies are more frequent.",

        "This formalization generalizes standard projective parsing models based on the Eisner algorithm (Eisner, 1996) to yield efficient 0(n 2) exact parsing methods for non-projective languages like Czech.",

        "The present work is related to that of Hirakawa (2001) who, like us, reduces the problem of dependency parsing to spanning tree search.",
        "However, his parsing method uses a branch and bound algorithm that is exponential in the worst case, even though it appears to perform reasonably in limited experiments.",
        "Furthermore, his work does not adequately address learning or measure parsing accuracy on held-out data.",

        "We presented a general framework for parsing dependency trees based on an equivalence to maximum spanning trees in directed graphs.",
        "This framework provides natural and efficient mechanisms for parsing both projective and non-projective languages through the use of the Eisner and Chu-LiuEdmonds algorithms.",
        "To learn these structures we used online large-margin learning (McDonald et al., 2005) that empirically provides state-of-the-art performance for Czech.",
        "A major advantage of our models is the ability to naturally model non-projective parses.",
        "Non-projective parsing is commonly considered more difficult than projective parsing.",
        "However, under our framework, we show that the opposite is actually true that non-projective parsing has a lower asymptotic complexity.",
        "Using this framework, we presented results showing that the non-projective model outperforms the projective model on the Prague Dependency Treebank, which contains a small number of non-projective edges.",
        "Our method requires a tree score that decomposes according to the edges of the dependency tree.",
        "One might hope that the method would generalize to",
        "include features of larger substructures.",
        "Unfortunately, that would make the search for the best tree intractable (H¨offgen, 1993)."
