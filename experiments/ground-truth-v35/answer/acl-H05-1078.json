        "One of the challenges ahead lies in moving from hand-crafted programs of limited scope to robust systems independent of a given domain.",
        "While this ambitious goal will remain in the future for some time to come, recent efforts to develop language processing systems producing richer semantic outputs will likely be the cornerstone of many successful developments in natural language understanding.",
        "In this paper, we present a parser that outputs labels indicating the syntactic or semantic function of a constituent in the tree, such as NP-SBJ or PP-TMP shown in bold face in the tree in Figure 1.",
        "These labels indicate that the NP is the subject of the sentence and that the PP conveys temporal information.",

        "It is therefore important to choose a statistical parser that can model our augmented labelling problem.",
        "We use a family of statistical parsers, the Simple Synchrony Network (SSN) parsers (Henderson, 2003), which crucially do not make any explicit independence assumptions, and learn to smooth across rare feature combinations.",

        "This architecture has shown state-of-the-art performance and is very adaptive to properties of the input.",

        "To bound the number of parameters, standard history-based models partition the set of prefixes of well-formed sequences of transitions into equivalence classes.",
        "While such a partition makes the problem of searching for the most probable parse polynomial, it introduces hard independence assumptions: a derivation move only depends on the equivalence class to which its history belongs.",
        "SSN parsers, on the other hand, do not state any explicit independence assumptions: they induce a finite history representation of an unbounded sequence of moves, so that the representation of a move i – 1 is included in the inputs to the represention of the next move i, as explained in more detail in (Henderson, 2003).",
        "SSN parsers only impose soft inductive biases to capture relevant properties of the derivation, thereby exhibiting adaptivity to the input.",
        "The art of designing SSN parsers consists in selecting and introducing such biases.",
        "To this end, it is sufficient to specify features that extract some information relevant to the next derivation move from previous ones, or some set of nodes that are structurally local to the node on top of the stack.",

        "We also think that the parser we use is particularly able to take advantage of these subclasses.",
