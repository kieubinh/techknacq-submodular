        "Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is a formalism motived by both linguistic and computational perspectives (for a relatively recent review, see (Joshi and Schabes, 1997)).",
        "Because of the introduction of the adjoining operation, the TAG formalism is provably stronger than Context Free Grammar (CFG) both in the weak and the strong generative power.",
        "The TAG formalism provides linguistically attractive analysis of natural language (Frank, 2002).",
        "Recent psycholinguistic experiments (Sturt and Lombardo, 2005) demonstrate that the adjoining operation of LTAG is required for eager incremental processing.",
        "Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) introduced the first TAG parser in a CYK-like algorithm.",
        "Because of the adjoining operation, the time complexity of LTAG parsing is as large as 0(n6), compared with 0(n3) of CFG parsing, where n is the length of the sentence to be parsed.",
        "Many LTAG parsers were proposed, such as the head-driven Earley style parser (Lavelli and Satta, 1991) and the head-corner parser (van Noord, 1994).",
        "The high time complexity prevents LTAG parsing from real-time applications.",
        "In this paper, we work on LTAG-spinal (Shen and Joshi, 2005), an interesting subset of LTAG, which preserves almost all of the strong generative power of LTAG, and it is both weakly and strongly more powerful than CFG 1.",
        "We will present a statistical incremental parsing for LTAG-spinal.",
        "As far as we know, this parser is the first comprehensive attempt of efficient statistical parsing with a formal grammar with provably stronger generative power than CFG, supporting the full adjoining operation, dynamic predicate coordination, as well as non-projective dependencies 2.",
        "2 LTAG-spinal and the Treebank We first briefly describe the LTAG-spinal formalism and the LTAG-spinal treebank to be used in this paper.",
        "More details are reported in (Shen and Joshi, 2005).",
        "In LTAG-spinal, we have two different kinds of elementary trees, initial trees and auxiliary trees, which are the same as in LTAG.",
        "However, as the name implies, an initial tree in LTAG-spinal only contains the spine from the root to the anchor, and an auxiliary tree only contains the spine and the foot node directly connected to a node on the spine.",
        "Three types of operations are used to connect the elementary trees into a derivation tree, which are attachment, adjunction and conjunction.",
        "We show LTAG-spinal elementary trees and operations with an example in Figure 1.",
        "In Figure 1, each arc is associated with a character which represents the type of operation.",
        "We use T for attach, A for adjoin, and C for conjoin.",
        "Attachment in LTAG-spinal is similar to sister adjunction (Chiang, 2000) in Tree Insertion Grammar (TIG) (Schabes and Waters, 1995).",
        "It represents a combination of substitution and sister adjunction.",
        "The attachment operation is designed to encode the ambiguity of an argument and an adjunct.",
        "Adjunction inserts part of the spine and the foot node of an auxiliary tree into to the spine of another tree.",
        "The adjunction operation can effectively do wrapping, which distinguishes itself from sister adjunction.",
        "It is not difficult to see that adjunction only happens on the spine of a tree.",
        "This property will be exploited in the incremental parser.",
        "Conjunction is similar to what was originally proposed in (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996).",
        "However, in LTAG-spinal, the conjunction operation is much easier to handle, since we only conjoin spinal elementary trees and we do not need to enumerate contraction sets for conjunction.",
        "In our formalization, conjunction can be treated as a special adjunction, however, this is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "We use the LTAG-spinal treebank described in (Shen and Joshi, 2005), which was extracted from the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994) with Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005) annotations."

        "A spinal elementary tree is smaller than a tradition LTAG elementary tree which contains all the substitution nodes of the arguments.",
        "In the LTAG-spinal formalism, both arguments and adjuncts are expected to be directly attached or adjoined onto a spine.",
        "In this sense, LTAG-spinal roughly satisfies the fundamental TAG hypothesis: Every syntactic dependency is expressed locally within a single elementary tree (Frank, 2002).",
        "The only difference is that, in LTAG-spinal, syntactic dependencies are represented via direct or local connections.",
        "To better understand the meaning of this difference, we relate it to Frank’s (2002) model for how the LTAG elementary trees are constructed.",
        "In Frank’s model, all the elementary trees are built via Marge and Move operations, starting with a local lexical array.",
        "The resulting LTAG elementary trees are then combined with adjunction and substitution to build a derivation tree.",
        "Thus, in a sense, the LTAG-spinal grammar opens a door to a parallel mechanism of building the elementary trees and the derivation tree.",
        "The spinal templates in LTAG-spinal only contain the path of projection from the anchor to the top node.",

        "In this paper, we present an efficient incremental parser for LTAG-spinal, a variant of LTAG which is both linguistically and psycholinguistically motivated.",
        "As far as we know, the statistical incremental parser proposed in this paper is the first comprehensive attempt of efficient statistical parsing with a formal grammar with provably stronger generative power than CFG, supporting the adjoining operation, dynamic predicate coordination, as well as non-projective dependencies.",
        "We have trained and tested our parser on the LTAG-spinal treebank, extracted from the Penn Treebank with Propbank annotation, Using gold standard POS tags as part of the input, the parser achieves an f-score of 89.3% for syntactic dependency on section 23 of PTB.",
        "Because of the treatment of adjunction and predicate coordination, These dependencies, which are defined on LTAG-spinal derivation trees, are deeper than the dependencies extracted from PTB alone with head rules."
