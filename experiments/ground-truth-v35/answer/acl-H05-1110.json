        "Modern statistical natural language processing techniques require large amounts of human-annotated data to work well.",
        "For practical reasons, the required amount of data exists only for a few languages of major interest, either commercial or governmental.",
        "As a result, many languages have very little computational research done in them, especially outside the borders of the countries in which these languages are spoken.",
        "Some of these languages are, however, major languages with hundreds of millions of speakers.",
        "Of the top 10 most spoken languages, Linguistic Data Consortium at University of Pennsylvania, the premier U.S. provider of corpora, offers text corpora only in 7 (The World Factbook (2004), 2000 estimate) Only a few of the other languages (French, Arabic, and Czech) have resources provided by LDC.",
        "Many Asian and Eastern European languages number tens of millions of speakers, yet very few of these seem to have any related computational linguistics work, at least as presented at the international conferences, such as the ACL.1 The situation is not surprising, nor is it likely to significantly change in the future.",
        "Luckily, most of these less-represented languages belong to language families with several prominent members.",
        "As a result, some of these languages have siblings with more resources and published research.",
        "2 Interestingly, the better-endowed siblings are not always the ones with more native speakers, since political considerations are often more important.3 If one is able to use the resources available in one language (henceforth referred to as source) to facilitate the creation of tools and resource in another, related language (target), this problem would be alleviated.",
        "This is the ultimate goal of this project, but in the first stage we focus on multi-language dictionary induction.",
        "Building a high-quality dictionary, or even better, a joint word distribution model over all the languages in a given family is very important, because using such a model one can use a variety of techniques to project information across languages, e.g. to parse or to translate.",
        "Building a unified model for more than a pair of languages improves the quality over building several unrelated pairwise models, because relating them to each other provides additional information.",
        "If we know that word a in language A has as its likely translation word b in language B, and b is translated as c in C, then we also know that a is likely to be translated as c, without looking at",
        "the A to C model."

        "Such work, however, primarily focuses on finding cognates, whereas we are interested in translations of all words.",
        "Moreover, while some techniques (e.g., Mann and Yarowsky (2001)) use multiple languages, the languages used have resources such as dictionaries between some language pairs.",
        "We do not require any dictionaries for any language pair.",
        "An important element of our work is focusing on more than a pair of languages.",
        "There is an active research area focusing on multi-source translation (e.g., Och and Ney (2001)).",
        "Our setting is the reverse: we do not use multiple dictionaries in order to translate, but translate (in a very crude way) in order to build multiple dictionaries.",
        "Many machine translation techniques require dictionary building as a step of the process, and therefore have also attacked this problem.",
        "They use a variety of approaches (a good overview is Koehn and Knight (2001)), many of which require advanced tools for both languages which we are not able to use.",
        "They also use bilingual (and to some extent monolingual) corpora, which we do have available.",
        "They do not, however, focus on related languages, and tend to ignore lexical similarity 4, nor are they able to work on more than a pair of languages at a time.",
        "It is also worth noting that there has been some MT work on related languages which explores language similarity in an opposite way: by using dictionaries and tools for both languages, and assuming that a near word-for-word approach is reasonable (Hajic et al., 2000)."

        "Several approaches are possible, all involving the use of the dictionary we built.",
        "While working on this project, we would no longer be treating all languages in the same way.",
        "We would use the tools available for that language to further improve the performance of pairwise models involving that language and, indirectly, even the pairs not involving this language.",
        "Using these tools, we may be able to improve the word translation model even further, simply as a side effect.",
        "Once we build a high-quality dictionary for a special domain such as the Bible, it might be possible to expand to a more general setting by mining the Web for potential parallel texts.",
        "Our technique is limited in the coverage of the resulting dictionary which can only contain words which occur in our corpus.",
        "Whatever the corpus may be, however, it will include the most common words in the target language.",
        "These are the words that tend to vary the most between related (and even unrelated) languages.",
        "The relatively rare words (e.g. domain-specific and technical terms) can often be translated simply by inferring morphological rules transforming words of one language into another.",
        "Thus, one may expand the dictionary coverage using non-parallel texts in both languages, or even in just one language if its morphology is sufficiently regular."
