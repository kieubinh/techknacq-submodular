        "For cross-language text retrieval systems that rely on bilingual dictionaries for bridging the language gap between the source query language and the target document language, good bilingual dictionary coverage is imperative [8,9].",

        "Various methods have been proposed for finding translations of names and terminology through transliteration [5,11,13,14,16,18,20] and corpus mining [6,7,12,15,22].",
        "In this paper, instead of attempting to find the candidate translations of terms without translations to expand existing translation dictionaries, we explore to what extent simply using text context can help mitigate the missing translation problem and for what kinds of queries.",
        "The context-oriented approaches include (1) identifying words that are closely associated with the unknown source language terms as context vectors and (2) using the translations of the associated words in the context vectors as the surrogate translations of the unknown words.",

        "We evaluate these methods in Japanese-to-English retrieval using the NTCIR-3 topics and data sets.",

        "In dictionary-based CLIR applications, approaches for dealing with terms with missing translations can be classified into three major categories.",
        "The first is a do-nothing approach by simply ignoring the terms with missing translations.",
        "The second category includes attempts to generate candidate translations for a subset of unknown terms, such as names and technical terminology, through phonetic translation between different languages (i.e., transliteration) [5,11,13,14,16,18,20].",
        "Such methods generally yield translation pairs with reasonably good accuracy reaching about 70% [18].",
        "Empirical results have shown that the expanded lexicons can significantly improve CLIR system performance [5,16,20].",
        "The third category includes approaches for expanding existing bilingual dictionaries by exploring multilingual or bilingual corpora.",
        "For example, the \"mix-lingual\" feature of the Web has been exploited for locating translation pairs by searching for the presence of both Chinese and English text in a text window [22].",
        "In work focused on constructing bilingual dictionaries for machine translation, automatic translation lexicons are compiled using either clean aligned parallel corpora [12,15] or non-parallel comparable corpora [6,7].",
        "In work with non-parallel corpora, contexts of source language terms and target language terms and a seed translation lexicon are combined to measure the association between the source language terms and potential translation candidates in the target language.",
        "The techniques with non-parallel corpora save the expense of constructing large-scale parallel corpora with the tradeoff of lower accuracy, e.g., about 30% accuracy for the top-one candidate [6,7].",
        "To our knowledge, the usefulness of such lexicons in CLIR systems has not been evaluated.",
        "While missing translations have been addressed in dictionary-based CLIR systems, most of the approaches mentioned above attempt to resolve the problem through dictionary expansion.",
        "In this paper, we explore non-lexical approaches and their effectiveness on mitigating the problem of missing translations.",
        "Without additional lexicon expansion, and keeping the unknown terms in the source language query, we extract context vectors for these unknown terms and obtain their translations as the surrogate translations for the original query terms.",
        "This is motivated by the pre-translation feedback techniques proposed by several previous studies [1,2].",
        "Pre-translation feedback has been shown to be effective for resolving translation ambiguity, but its effect on recovering the lost meaning due to missing translations has not been empirically evaluated.",
        "Our work provides the first empirical results for such an evaluation."

        "In the empirical evaluation, we have examined the interaction between the use of context vectors with other factors such as translation disambiguation, pseudo-relevance feedback, and query lengths.",
        "The empirical findings suggest that using query-dependent context vectors together with post-translation pseudo-relevance feedback and translation disambiguation can help to overcome the meaning loss due to missing translations for short queries.",
        "For longer queries, the longer context in the query seems to make the use of context vectors unnecessary.",
        "The paper presents only our first set on experiments of using context to recover meaning loss due to missing translations.",
        "In our future work, we will verify the observations with other topic sets and database sources; verify the observations with other language pairs, e.g., Chinese-to-English retrieval; and experiment with different parameter settings such as context window size, methods for context term selection, different ways of ranking context terms, and the use of the context term ranking in combination with disambiguation for translation selection."
