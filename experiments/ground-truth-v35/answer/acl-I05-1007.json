        "In the recent development of full parsing technology, semantic knowledge is seldom used, though it is known to be useful for resolving syntactic ambiguities.",
        "The reasons for this may be twofold.",
        "The first one is that it can be very difficult to add additional features which are not available in treebanks to generative models like Collins (see [1]), which are very popular for full parsing.",
        "For smaller tasks, like prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, semantic knowledge can be incorporated flexibly using different learning algorithms (see [2,3,4,5]).",
        "For full parsing with generative models, however, incorporating semantic knowledge may involve great changes of model structures.",
        "The second reason is that semantic knowledge from external dictionaries seems to be noisy, ambiguous and not available in explicit forms, compared with the information from treebanks.",
        "Given these two reasons, it seems to be difficult to combine the two different information sources-treebank and semantic knowledge-into one integrated statistical parsing model.",
        "One feasible way to solve this problem is to keep the original parsing model unchanged and build an additional sub-model to incorporate semantic knowledge from external dictionaries.",
        "The modularity afforded by this approach makes it easier to expand or update semantic knowledge sources with the treebank",
        "Parsing the Penn Chinese Treebank with Semantic Knowledge 71",
        "unchanged or vice versa.",
        "Further, the combination of the semantic sub-model and the original parsing model can be optimized automatically.",
        "In this paper, we build a class-based selection preference sub-model, which is embedded in our lexicalized parsing model, to incorporate external semantic knowledge.",
        "We use two Chinese electronic dictionaries and their combination as our semantic information sources.",
        "Several experiments are carried out on the Penn Chinese Treebank to test our hypotheses.",
        "The results indicate that a significant improvement in performance is achieved when semantic knowledge is incorporated into parsing model.",
        "Further improvement analysis is made.",
        "We confirm that semantic knowledge is indeed useful for nominal compounds and coordination ambiguity resolution.",
        "And surprisingly, semantic knowledge is also helpful to correct Chinese NoV mistagging errors mentioned by Levy and Manning (see [12]).",
        "Yet another great benefit to incorporating semantic knowledge is to alleviate the sparseness of information available in treebank."

        "PrH(H\\P, Hht, Hhw) .",
        "Then each left/right modifier of head constituent is generated in two steps: first its syntactic label Mi and corresponding head tag Miht are chosen given context features from the parent (P), head constituent (H, Hht, Hhw), previously generated modifier (Mi-1,Mi-1ht) and other context information like the direction (dir) and distance2 (dis) to the head constituent:",

        "For the distribution PrM, we build back-off structures with six levels, which are different from Collins' since we find our back-off structures work better than the three-level back-off structures of Collins.",
        "For the distribution PrMw, the parsing model backs off to the history context with head word Hhw removed, then to the modifier head tag Miht, just like Collins.",
        "Gildea (see [9]) and Bikel (see [10]) both observed that the effect of bilexical dependencies is greatly impaired due to the sparseness of bilexical statistics.",
        "Bikel even found that the parser only received an estimate that made use of bilexi-cal statistics a mere 1.49% of the time.",
        "However, according to the wisdom of the parsing community, lexical bigrams, the word pairs ( Mihw, Hhw) are very informative with semantic constraints.",
        "Along this line, in this paper, we build an additional class-based selectional preference sub-model, which is described in section 3, to make good use of this semantic information through selectional restrictions between head and modifier words.",

        "We find this basic NP re-annotation very helpful for the performance.",
