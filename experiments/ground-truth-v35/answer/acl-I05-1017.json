        "For natural language processing (NLP), resolving various ambiguities is a fundamental and important issue.",
        "Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment ambiguity is one of the structural ambiguities.",
        "Consider, for example, the following sentences [1]:",
        "(1) a. Mary ate the salad with a fork.",
        "b. Mary ate the salad with croutons.",
        "The prepositional phrase in (1a) \"with a fork\" modifies the verb \"ate\", because \"with a fork\" describes how the salad is eaten.",
        "The prepositional phrase in (1b) \"with croutons\" modifies the noun \"the salad\", because \"with croutons\" describes the salad.",
        "To disambiguate such PP-attachment ambiguity, some kind of world knowledge is required.",
        "However, it is currently difficult to give such world knowledge to computers, and this situation makes PP-attachment disambiguation difficult.",
        "Recent state-of-the-art parsers perform with the practical accuracy, but seem to suffer from the PP-attachment ambiguity [2, 3].",
        "For NLP tasks including PP-attachment disambiguation, corpus-based approaches have been the dominant paradigm in recent years.",
        "They can be divided into two classes: supervised and unsupervised.",
        "Supervised methods automatically learn rules from tagged data, and achieve good performance for many NLP tasks, especially when lexical information, such as words, is given.",
        "Such methods, however, cannot avoid the sparse data problem.",
        "This is because tagged data are not sufficient enough to discriminate a large variety of lexical information.",
        "To deal with this problem, many smoothing techniques have been proposed.",
        "PP-Attachment Disambiguation Boosted by Unambiguous Examples 189",
        "The other class for corpus-based approaches is unsupervised learning.",
        "Unsupervised methods take advantage of a large number of data that are extracted from large raw corpora, and thus can alleviate the sparse data problem.",
        "However, the problem is their low performance compared with supervised methods, because of the use of unreliable information.",
        "For PP-attachment disambiguation, both supervised and unsupervised methods have been proposed, and supervised methods have achieved better performance (e.g., 86.5% accuracy by [1]).",
        "Previous unsupervised methods tried to extract reliable information from large raw corpora, but the extraction heuristics seem to be inaccurate [4,5].",
        "For example, Ratnaparkhi extracted unambiguous word triples of (verb, preposition, noun) or (noun, preposition, noun), and reported that their accuracy was 69% [4].",
        "This means that the extracted triples are not truly unambiguous, and this inaccurate treatment may have led to low PP-attachment performance (81.9%).",
        "This paper proposes a PP-attachment disambiguation method based on an enormous amount of truly unambiguous examples.",
        "The unambiguous examples are extracted from raw corpus using some heuristics inspired by the following example sentences in [6]:",
        "(2) a.",
        "She sent him into the nursery to gather up his toys, b.",
        "The road to London is long and winding.",
        "In these sentences, the underlined PPs are unambiguously attached to the double-underlined verb or noun.",
        "The extracted unambiguous examples are utilized to acquire precise lexical preferences for PP-attachment disambiguation.",
        "Attachment decisions are made by a machine learning technique that optimizes the use of the lexical preferences.",
        "The point of our work is to use a \"gigantic\" volume of \"truly\" unambiguous examples.",
        "The use of only truly unambiguous examples leads to statistics of high-quality and good performance of disambiguation in spite of the learning from raw corpus.",
        "Furthermore, by using a gigantic volume of data, we can alleviate the influence of the sparse data problem.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the globally used training and test set of PP-attachment.",
        "Section 3 summarizes previous work for PP-attachment.",
        "Section 4 describes a method of calculating lexical preference statistics from a gigantic volume of unambiguous examples.",
        "Section 5 is devoted to our PP-attachment disambiguation algorithm.",
