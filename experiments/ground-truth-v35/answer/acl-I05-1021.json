        "There is a great number of synonyms, which denote a set of words sharing the same meaning, in any natural language.",
        "This variety among synonyms causes difficulty in natural language processing applications, such as information retrieval and automatic summarization, because it reduces the coverage of lexical knowledge.",
        "Although many manually constructed synonym resources, such as WordNet [4] and Roget's Thesaurus [12], are available, it is widely recognized that these knowledge resources provide only a small coverage of technical terms and cannot keep up with newly coined words.",
        "We propose a method to acquire synonyms from monolingual comparable text (MCT).",
        "MCT denotes sets of different texts1 that share similar contents.",
        "MCT are appropriate for synonym acquisition because they share not only many synonymous words but also the relations between the words in a each text.",
        "Automatic MCT construction can be performed in practice through state-of-the-art clustering techniques [2].",
        "News articles are especially favorable for text clustering since they have both titles and date of publication.",
        "Synonym acquisition is based on a distributional hypothesis that words with similar meanings tend to appear in similar contexts [5].",
        "In this work, we adopt loose contextual information that considers only the surrounding one word from each side of the target words.",
        "This narrow condition enables extraction from source texts2 that have different structures.",
        "In addition, we use another constraint, prevention of outside appearance, which reduces improper extraction by looking over outside places of other texts.",
        "This constraint eliminates many nonsynonyms having the same surrounding words by chance.",
        "Since our method does not cut off acquired synonyms by frequency, synonyms that appear only once can be captured.",
        "In this paper, we describe related work in Sect.",

        "The basic idea of the technique is that words sharing a similar characteristic with other entities form a single cluster [9,7].",
        "A characteristic can be determined from relations with other entities, such as document frequency, co-occurrence with other words, and adjectives depending on target nouns.",
        "However, this approach has shortcomings in obtaining synonyms.",
        "First, words clustered by this approach involve not only synonyms but also many near-synonyms, hypernyms, and antonyms.",
        "It is difficult to distinguish synonyms from other related words [8].",
        "Second, words to be clustered need to have high frequencies to determine similarity, therefore, words appearing only a few times are outside the scope of this approach.",

        "Lattices are formed by top-down merging based on structural information.",

        "[13] extracted lexical paraphrases based on the substitution operation of edit operations.",
        "Text pairs having more than three edit distances are excluded from extraction.",

        "4.1) proves that 95.2% of either nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs follow this assumption.",

        "C2 The word does not appear in the synonym part of the other text.",
        "The constraint C1 means that the word in the outside part of the other text is considered as a correspondent word, and a captured word is unlikely to be corresponding.",
        "In other words, appearance of the word itself is more reliable than local context coincidence.",
        "The constraint C2 means that if the word is included in the synonym part of the other text, this word pair is considered to capture a corresponding word independent of the outside part.",

        "Word pairs to be extracted should have the same POS.",
