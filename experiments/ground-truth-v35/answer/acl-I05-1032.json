        "As the natural language processing (NLP) systems became large and applied to wide variety of application domains, the need for a broad-coverage lexical knowledge-base has increased more than ever before.",
        "A thesaurus, as one of these lexical knowledgebases, mainly represents a taxonomic relationship between nouns.",
        "However, because building broad-coverage thesauri is a very costly and time-consuming job, they are not readily available and often too general to be applied to a specific domain.",
        "The work presented here is an attempt to alleviate this problem by devising a new method for extending a thesaurus automatically using taxonomic information extracted from a machine readable dictionary (MRD).",
        "Most of the previous approaches for extracting hypernyms of a noun from the definition in an MRD rely on the lexico-syntactic patterns compiled by human experts.",
        "Not only these methods require high cost for compiling lexico-syntactic patterns but also it is very difficult for human experts to compile a set of lexical-syntactic patterns with a broad-coverage because, in natural languages, there are various different expressions which represent the same concept.",
        "Accordingly the applicable scope of a set of lexico-syntactic patterns compiled by human is very limited.",
        "To overcome the drawbacks of human-compiled lexico-syntactic patterns, we use part-of-speech (POS) patterns only and try to induce these patterns automatically using a small bootstrapping thesaurus and machine learning methods.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We introduce the related works in section 2.",
        "Section 3 deals with the problem of features selection.",
        "In section 4, our problem is formally defined as a machine learning method and discuss implementation details.",
        "Section 5 is devoted to experimenal result.",
        "Finally, we come to the conclusion of this paper in section 6.",
        "[3] introduced a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text, and gave several examples of lexico-syntactic patterns for hyponymy that can be used to detect these relationships including those used here, along with an algorithm for identifying new patterns.",
        "Hearst's approach is complementary to statistically based approaches that find semantic relations between terms, in that hers requires a single specially expressed instance of a relation while the others require a statistically significant number of generally expressed relations.",
        "The hyponym-hypernym pairs found by Hearst's algorithm include some that she describes as \"context and point-of-view dependent\", such as \"Washington/nationalist\" and \"aircraft/target\".",
        "[4] was somewhat less sensitive to this kind of problem since only the most common hypernym of an entire cluster of nouns is reported, so much of the noise is filtered.",
        "[3] tried to discover new patterns for hyponymy by hand, nevertheless it is a costly and time-consuming job.",
        "In the case of [3] and [4], since the hierarchy was learned from text, it got to be domain-specific different from a generalpurpose resource such as WordNet.",
        "[2] proposed a method that combines a set of unsupervised algorithms in order to accurately build large taxonomies from any MRD, and a system that 1)performs fully automatic extraction of a taxonomic link from MRD entries and 2) ranks the extracted relations in a way that selective manual refinement is allowed.",
        "In this project, they introduced the idea of the hyponym-hypernym relationship appears between the entry word and the genus term.",
        "Thus, usually a dictionary definition is written to employ a genus term combined with differentia which distinguishes the word being defined from other words with the same genus term.",
        "They found the genus term by simple heuristic defined using several examples of lexico-syntactic patterns for hyponymy.",
        "[1] presented the method to extract semantic information from standard dictionary definitions.",
        "Their automated mechanism for finding the genus terms is based on the observation that the genus term from verb and noun definitions is typically the head of the defining phrase.",
        "The syntax of the verb phrase used in verb definitions makes it possible to locate its head with a simple heuristic: the head is the single verb following the word to.",
        "He asserted that heads are bounded on the left and right by specific lexical defined by human intuition, and the substring after eliminating boundary words from definitions is regarded as a head.",
        "By the similar idea to [2], [10] introduced six kinds of rule extracting a hypernym from Korean MRD according to a structure of a dictionary definition.",
        "In this work, Moon proposed that only a subset of the possible instances of the hypernym relation will appear in a particular form, and she divides a definition sentence into a head term combined with differentia and a functional term.",
        "For extracting a hypernym, Moon analyzed a definition of a noun by word list and the position of words, and then searched a pattern coinciding with the lexico-syntactic patterns made by human intuition in the definition of any noun, and then extracted a hypernym using an appropriate rule among 6 rules.",
        "For example, rule 2 states that if a word X occurs in front of a lexical pattern \"leul bu-leu-deon ileum ( the name to call )\",then X is extracted as a hypernym of the entry word.",
        "Several approaches[11][12][13] have been researched for building a semantic hierarchy of Korean nouns adopting the method of [2].",

        "Location of a word.",
        "In Korean, a head word usually appears after its modifying words.",
        "Therefore a head word has tendency to be located at the end of a sentence.",
        "In the definition sentences in a Korean MRD, this tendency becomes much stronger.",
        "In the training examples, we found that 11% of the hypernyms appeared at the start, 81% of them appeared at the end and 7% appeared at the middle of a definition sentence.",

        "In the definition sentences, the function words which attached to hypernyms are confined to a small number of POSs.",
        "For example, nominalization endings, objective case postpositions come frequently after hypernyms but dative postpositions or locative postpositions never appear after hypernyms.",

        "Context of a noun.",
        "The context in which a word appears is valuable information and a wide variety of applications such as word clustering or word sense disambiguation make use of it.",
        "Like in many other applications, context of a noun is important in deciding hyperhyms too because hypernyms mainly appear in some limited context.",
        "Although lexico-syntactic patterns can represent more specific contexts, building set of lexco-syntactic patterns requires enormous training data.",
        "So we confined ourselves only to syntactic patterns in which hypernyms appear.",
        "We limited the context of a noun to be 4 word-phrases appearing around the noun.",
        "Because the relations between word-phrases are represented by the function words of these word-phrases, the context of a noun includes only POSs of the function words of the neighboring word-phrases.",
        "When a word-phrase has more than a functional morpheme, a representative functional morpheme is selected by an algorithm proposed by [8].",
        "When a noun appears at the start or at the end of a sentence, it does not have right or left context respectively.",
        "In this case, two treatments are possible.",
        "The simplest approach is to treat the missing context as don't care terms.",
        "On the other hand, we could extend the range of available context to compensate the missing context.",
        "For example, the context of a noun at the start of a sentence includes 4 POSs of function words in its right-side neighboring word-phrases."
