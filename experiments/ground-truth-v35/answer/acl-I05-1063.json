        "In recent years supervised learning approaches have been widely used in coreference resolution task and achieved considerable success [1,2,3,4,5].",
        "Most of these approaches adopt the single-candidate learning model, in which coreference relation is determined between a possible anaphor and one individual candidate at a time [1,3,4].",
        "However, it has been claimed that the reference between an anaphor and its candidate is often subject to the other competing candidates [5].",
        "Such information is nevertheless difficult to be captured in the single-candidate model.",
        "As an alternative, several researchers proposed a twin-candidate model [2,5,6].",
        "Instead of directly determining coreference relations, this model would judge the preference between candidates and then select the most preferred one as the antecedent.",
        "The previous work has reported that such a model can effectively help antecedent determination for anaphors [5,6].",
        "However, one problem exits with the twin-candidate model.",
        "For every encountered NP during resolution, the model would always pick out a \"best\" candidate as the antecedent, even if the current NP is not an anaphor.",
        "The twin-candidate model itself could not identify and block such invalid resolution of non-anaphors.",
        "Therefore, to apply such a model to coreference resolution, some additional efforts have to be required, e.g., using an anaphoricity determination module to eliminate non-anaphors in advance [5], or using threshold to prevent the selection of a candidate if the confidence it wins other competitors is low [6].",
        "In this paper, we explore how to effectively apply the twin-candidate model to the coreference resolution task.",
        "We propose a modified learning framework with the capability of processing non-anaphors.",
        "In the framework, we make use of non-anaphors to create training instances.",
        "This special class of instances would enable the learned classifier to identify the test instances formed by non-anaphors during resolution.",
        "Thus, the resulting model could avoid resolving a non-anaphor to a non-existent antecedent by itself, without specifying a threshold or using an additional anaphoricity determination module.",
        "Our experiments on MUC data set systematically evaluated effectiveness of our modified learning framework.",
        "We found that with this new framework, the twin-candidate based system could not only outperform the single-candidate based one, but also achieve better and more reliable results than those twin-candidate based systems using the two mentioned solutions.",

        "The basic idea of the twin-candidate model is to learn a binary classifier which could judge the preference between candidates of an anaphor.",
        "In this section we will describe a general framework of such a model.",
        "In the twin-candidate model, an instance takes a form like i{C\\, C2, M},where M is a possible anaphor and C1 and C2 are two of its antecedent candidates.",
        "We stipulate that C2 should be closer to M than C1 in distance.",
        "An instance is labelled as \"10\" if C1 is preferred to C2 to be the antecedent, or \"01\" if otherwise.",
        "A feature vector would be specified for an instance.",
        "The features may describe the lexical, syntactic, semantic and positional relationships between M and each one of the candidates, C1 or C2 .",
        "In addition, inter-candidate features could be used to represent the relationships between the pair of candidates, e.g. the distance between C1 and C2 in position.",
        "For each anaphor Mana in a given training text, its closet antecedent, Cante, would be selected as the anchor candidate to compare with other candidates.",
        "A set of \"10\" instances, i{Cante, Cp, Mana}, is generated by pairing Mana and Cante, as well as each of the interning candidates Cp.",
        "Also a set of \"01\" instances, i{Ca, Cante, Mana}, is created by pairing Cante and each non-antecedental candidate Ca before Cante.",
        "Consider the example in Table 1.",
        "In the text segment, [4 that company] and [5 the money] are two anaphors with [1 Globalstar] and [2 $600 million] being their antecedents respectively.",
        "Thus the training instances to be created for this text would be:",
        "Based on the training instances, a classifier is trained using a certain machine learning algorithm.",
        "Given the feature vector of a test instance, the classifier would return \"10\" or \"01\" indicating which one of the two candidates under consideration is preferred.",
        "After the classifier is ready, it could be employed to select the antecedent for an encountered anaphor.",
        "The resolution algorithm is shown in Figure 1.",
        "In the algorithm, a round-robin model is employed, in which each candidate is compared with every other candidate and the final winner is determined by the won-lost records.",
        "The round-robin model would be fair for each competitor and the result is reliable to represent the rank of the candidates.",
        "As described in the algorithm, after each match between two candidates, the record of the winning candidate (i.e., the one judged as preferred by the classifier) will increase and that of the loser will decrease.",
        "The algorithm simply uses a unit of one as the increment and decrement.",
        "Therefore, the final record of a candidate is its won-lost difference in the round-robin matches.",

        "In the task of coreference resolution, it is often that an encountered NP is non-anaphoric, that is, no antecedent exists among its possible candidates.",
        "However, the resolution algorithm described in the previous section would always try to pick out a \"best\" candidate as the antecedent for each given NP, and thus could not be applied for coreference resolution directly.",
        "One natural solution to this is to use an anaphoricity determination (AD) module to identify the non-anaphoric NPs in advance (e.g. [5]).",
        "If an NP is judged as anaphoric, then we deploy the resolution algorithm to find its antecedent.",
        "Otherwise we just leave the NP unresolved.",
        "This solution, however, would heavily rely on the performance of the AD module.",
        "Unfortunately, the accuracy that most state-of-the-art AD systems could provide is still not high enough (around 80% as reported in [7]) for our coreference resolution task.",
        "Another possible solution is to set a threshold to avoid selecting a candidate that wins with low confidence (e.g. [6]).",
        "Specifically, for two candidates in a match, we update their match records only if the confidence returned from the classifier is above the specified threshold.",
        "If no candidate has a positive record in the end, we deem the NP in question as non-anaphoric and leave it unresolved.",
        "In other words, a NP would be resolved to a candidate only if the candidate won at least one competitor with confidence above the threshold.",
        "The assumption under this solution is that the classifier would return low confidence for the test instances formed by non-anaphors.",
        "Although it may be true, there exist other cases for which the classifier would also assign low confidence values, for example, when the two candidates of an anaphoric NP both have strong or weak preference.",
        "The solution of using threshold could not discriminate these different cases and thus may not be reliable for coreference resolution.",
        "In fact, the above problem could be addressed if we could teach the classifier to explicitly identify the cases of non-anaphors, instead of using threshold implicitly.",
        "To do this, we need to provide a special set of instances formed by the non-anaphors to train the classifier.",
        "Given a test instance formed by a non-anaphor, the newly learned classifier is supposed to give a class label different from the instances formed by anaphors.",
        "This special label would indicate that the current NP is a non-anaphor, and no preference relationship is held between the two candidates under consideration.",
        "In this way, the twin-candidate model could do the anaphoricity determination by itself, without any additional prepossessing module.",

        "(Here we only showed the results for MUC-7.",
        "Similar results could be obtained for MUC-6).",
        "In line with the results in Table 3, system TC_AD tends to obtain a high precision but low recall, while system TC_THRESH tends to obtain a high recall but low precision.",
        "Comparatively, system TC_NEW produces even recall and precision.",
        "For the range of recall within which the three systems coincide, TC_NEW yields higher precision than the other two systems.",
        "This figure further proves the effectiveness of our modified learning framework.",
        "As mentioned, in systems TC_THRESH and TC_NEW the threshold parameter could be adjusted.",
        "It would be interesting to evaluate the influence of different thresholds on the resolution performance.",
        "In Figure 5 we compared the recall and precision of two systems, with thresholds ranging from 65 to 100.",
        "In TC_THRESH, when the threshold is low, the recall is almost 100% while the precision is quite low.",
        "In such a case, all the markables, regardless anaphors or",
        "Fig.",
        "5.",
        "Performance of TC.THRESH and TC_NEW under different thresholds",
        "non-anaphors, will be resolved.",
        "As a consequence, all the occurring markables in a document tends to be linked together.",
        "In fact, the effective range of the threshold that leads to an acceptable performance is quite short.",
        "The threshold would only work when it is considerably high (above 95).",
        "Before that, the precision remains very low (less than 40%) while the recall keeps going down with the increase of the threshold.",
        "By contrast, in TC_NEW, both the recall and precision vary little unless the threshold is extremely high.",
        "That means, the threshold would not impose much influence on the resolution performance of TC_NEW.",
        "This should be because in the modified framework, the cases of non-anaphors are determined by the special class label \"00\", instead of the threshold as in TC_THRESH.",
        "The purpose of using threshold in TC_NEW is not to identify the non-anaphors, but to improve the accuracy of class labelling.",
        "Indeed, we could obtain a good result without using any threshold in TC_NEW.",
        "These further confirm our claims that the modified learning framework could perform more reliably than the solution of using threshold."

        "With such instances, the resulting classifier could avoid the invalid resolution of non-anaphors, which enables the twin-candidate model to be directly deployed to coreference resolution, without using an additional anaphoricity determination module or using a predefined threshold.",
        "In the paper we evaluated the effectiveness of our modified framework on the MUC data set.",
        "The results show that the system with the new framework outperforms the single-candidate based system, as well as the twin-candidate based systems using other solutions.",
        "Especially, the analysis of the results indicates that our modified framework could lead to more reliable performance than the solution of using threshold.",
