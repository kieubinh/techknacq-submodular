        "This paper reports on a study of semantic role tagging in Chinese, in the absence of a parser.",
        "We investigated the effect of using only lexical information in statistical training; and proposed to identify the relevant headwords in a sentence as a first step to partially locate the corresponding constituents to be labelled.",
        "Experiments were done on a textbook corpus and a news corpus, representing simple data and complex data respectively.",
        "Results suggested that in Chinese, simple lexical features are useful enough when constituent boundaries are known, while parse information might be more important for complicated sentences than simple ones.",
        "Several ways to improve the headword identification results were suggested, and we also plan to explore some class-based techniques for the task, with reference to existing semantic lexicons."

      "text": [
        "As the development of language resources progresses from POS-tagged corpora to syntactically annotated treebanks, the inclusion of semantic information such as predicate-argument relations is becoming indispensable.",
        "The expansion of the Penn Treebank into a Proposition Bank [11] is a typical move in this direction.",
        "Lexical resources also need to be enhanced with semantic information (e.g. [5]).",
        "In fact the ability to identify semantic role relations correctly is essential to many applications such as information extraction and machine translation; and making available resources with this kind of information would in turn facilitate the development of such applications.",
        "Large-scale production of annotated resources is often labour-intensive, and thus needs automatic labelling to streamline the work.",
        "The task can essentially be perceived as a two-phase process, namely to recognise the constituents bearing some semantic relationship to the target verb in a sentence, and then to label them with the corresponding semantic roles.",
        "In their seminal proposal, Gildea and Jurafsky approached the task using various features such as headword, phrase type, and parse tree path [6].",
        "Such features have remained the basic and essential features in subsequent research, irrespective of the variation in the actual learning components.",
        "In addition, parsed sentences are often required, for extracting the path features during training and providing the argument boundaries during testing.",
        "The parse information is deemed important for the performance of role labelling [7, 8].",
        "More precisely, in semantic role labelling, parse information is rather more critical for the identification of boundaries for candidate constituents than for the extraction",
        "Semantic Role Tagging for Chinese at the Lexical Level 805",
        "of training data.",
        "Its limited function in training, for instance, is reflected in the low coverage reported (e.g. [21]).",
        "However, given the imperfection of existing automatic parsers, which are far from producing gold standard parses, many thus resort to shallow syntactic information from simple chunking, though results often turn out to be less satisfactory than with full parses.",
        "This limitation is even more pertinent for the application of semantic role labelling to languages which do not have sophisticated parsing resources.",
        "In the case of Chinese, for example, there is considerable variability in its syntax-semantics interface; and when one has more nested and complex sentences such as those from news articles, it becomes more difficult to capture the sentence structures by typical examples.",
        "It is therefore worthwhile to investigate alternatives to the role labelling task for Chinese under the parsing bottleneck, both in terms of the features used and the shortcut or compromise to at least partially pin down the relevant constituents.",
        "A series of related questions deserve consideration here:",
        "1. how much could we achieve with only parse-independent features in the role labelling process;",
        "2. with constituent boundaries unknown in the absence of parse information, could we at least identify the headwords in the relevant constituents to be tagged; and",
        "3. whether the unknown boundary problem varies with the nature of the dataset, e.g., will the degradation in performance from known boundaries to unknown boundaries be more serious for complicated sentences than for simple sentences.",
        "So in the current study we experiment on the use of parse-independent features for semantic role labelling in Chinese, for locating the headwords of the constituents corresponding to arguments to be labelled.",
        "We will also compare the results on two training and testing datasets.",
        "In Section 2, related work will be reviewed.",
        "In Section 3, the data used in the current study will be introduced.",
        "Our proposed method will be explained in Section 4, and the experiment reported in Section 5.",
        "Results and future work will be discussed in Section 6, followed by conclusions in Section 7."

        "The definition of semantic roles falls on a continuum from abstract ones to very specific ones.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky [6], for instance, used a set of roles defined according to the FrameNet model [2], thus corresponding to the frame elements in individual frames under a particular domain to which a given verb belongs.",
        "Lexical entries (in fact not limited to verbs, in the case of FrameNet) falling under the same frame will share the same set of roles.",
        "Gildea and Palmer [7] defined roles with respect to individual predicates in the PropBank, without explicit naming.",
        "To date PropBank and FrameNet are the two main resources in English for training semantic role labelling systems.",
        "The theoretical treatment of semantic roles is also varied in Chinese.",
        "In practice, for example, the semantic roles in the Sinica Treebank mark not only verbal arguments but also modifier-head relations within individual constituents, following a head-driven principle [4].",
        "In our present study, we use a set of more abstract semantic roles, which are generalisable to most Chinese verbs and are not dependent on particular predicates.",
        "They will be further introduced in Section 3.",
        "The major concerns in automatic semantic role labelling include the handling of alternations (as in \"the window broke\" and \"John broke the window\", where in both cases \"the window\" should be tagged as \"patient\" despite its appearance in different positions in the sentences), and generalisation to unseen constituents and predicates.",
        "For the latter, clustering and semantic lexicons or hierarchies have been used (e.g. [6]), or similar argument structures are assumed for near-synonyms and verbs under the same frame (e.g. [11]).",
        "Approaches in automatic semantic role labelling are mostly statistical, typically making use of a number of features extracted from parsed training sentences.",
        "In Gildea and Jurafsky [6], the features studied include phrase type (pt), governing category (gov), parse tree path (path), position of constituent with respect to the target predicate (position), voice (voice), and headword (h).",
        "The labelling of a constituent then depends on its likelihood to fill each possible role r given the features and the target predicate t, as in the following, for example:",
        "Subsequent studies exploited a variety of implementation of the learning component, including Maximum Entropy (e.g. [1, 12]), Support Vector Machines (e.g. [9, 16]), etc.",
        "Transformation-based approaches were also used (e.g. [10, 19]).",
        "Swier and Stevenson [17] innovated with an unsupervised approach to the problem, using a bootstrapping algorithm, and achieved 87% accuracy.",
        "While the estimation of the probabilities could be relatively straightforward, the key often lies in locating the candidate constituents to be labelled.",
        "A parser of some kind is needed.",
        "Gildea and Hockenmaier [8] compared the effects of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) derivations and traditional Treebank parsing, and found that the former performed better on core arguments, probably due to its ability to capture long range dependencies, but comparable for all arguments.",
        "Gildea and Palmer [7] compared the effects of full parsing and shallow chunking; and found that when constituent boundaries are known, both automatic parses and gold standard parses resulted in about 80% accuracy for subsequent automatic role tagging, but when boundaries are unknown, results with automatic parses dropped to 57% precision and 50% recall.",
        "With chunking only, performance further degraded to below 30%.",
        "Problems mostly arise from arguments which correspond to more than one chunk, and the misplacement of core arguments.",
        "A couple of evaluation exercises for semantic role labelling were organized recently, such as the shared task in CoNLL-2004 using PropBank data [3], and the one in SENSEVAL-3 using the FrameNet dataset [15].",
        "Most systems in SENSEVAL-3 used a parser to obtain full syntactic parses for the sentences, whereas systems participating in the CoNLL task were restricted to using only shallow syntactic information.",
        "Results reported in the former tend to be higher.",
        "Although the dataset may be a factor affecting the labelling performance, it nevertheless reinforces the usefulness of full syntactic information.",
        "According to Carreras and Marquez [3], for English, the state-of-the-art results reach an F1 measure of slightly over 83 using gold standard parse trees and about 77 with real parsing results.",
        "Those based on shallow syntactic information is about 60.",
        "The usefulness of parse information for semantic role labelling would be especially interesting in the case of Chinese, given the flexibility in its syntax-semantics interface (e.g. the object after u£ 'eat' could refer to the Patient as in (Süll 'eat apple', Location as in v'Zlk'Sk 'eat canteen', Duration as in 'eat three years', etc.).",
        "In the absence of sophisticated parsing resources, however, we attempt to investigate how well one could simply use a set of parse-independent features and backward guess the likelihood of headwords to partially locate the candidate constituents to be labelled."

        "This further degradation in performance is nevertheless within expectation, but whether this is also a result of the difference between English and Chinese remains to be seen.",
        "In response to the questions raised in the introduction, firstly, the results for the known constituent condition (F1 of 90.56 and 89.07 for textbook data and news data respectively) have shown that even if we do not use parse-dependent features such as governing category and parse tree path, results are not particularly affected.",
        "In other words, lexical features are already very useful as long as the constituent boundaries are given.",
        "Secondly, in the absence of parse information, the results of identifying the relevant headwords in order to partially locate candidate constituents were not as satisfactory as one would like to see.",
        "One possible way to improve the results, as suggested above, would be to improve the handling of ties.",
        "Other possibilities including a class-based method could also be used, as will be discussed below.",
        "Thirdly, results for news data degraded more seriously than textbook data from the known constituent condition to the headword location condition.",
        "This suggests that complex sentences in Chinese are more affected by the availability of full parse information.",
        "To a certain extent, this might be related to the relative flexibility in the syntax-semantics interface of Chinese; hence when a sentence gets more complicated, there might be more intervening constituents and the parse information would be useful to help identify the relevant ones in semantic role labelling.",
        "In terms of future development, apart from improving the handling of ties in our method, as mentioned in the previous section, we plan to expand our work in several respects, the major part of which is on the generalization to unseen headwords and unseen predicates.",
        "As is with other related studies, the examples available for training for each target verb are very limited; and the availability of training data is also insufficient in the sense that we cannot expect them to cover all target verb types.",
        "Hence it is very important to be able to generalize the process to unseen words and predicates.",
        "To this end, we will experiment with a semantic lexicon like Tongyici Cilin (",
        ", a Chinese thesaurus) in both training and testing, which we expect to improve the overall performance.",
        "Another area of interest is to look at the behaviour of near-synonymous predicates in the tagging process.",
        "Many predicates may be unseen in the training data, but while the probability estimation could be generalized from near-synonyms as suggested by a semantic lexicon, whether the similarity and subtle differences between near-synonyms with respect to the argument structure and the corresponding syntactic realisation could be distinguished would also be worth studying.",
        "Related to this is the possibility of augmenting the feature set with semantic features.",
        "Xue and Palmer [20], for instance, looked into new features such as syntactic frame, lexicalized constituent type, etc., and found that enriching the feature set improved the labelling performance.",
