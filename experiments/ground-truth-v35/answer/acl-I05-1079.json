        "There are several classes of paraphrase that exhibit a degree of regularity.",
        "For example, paraphrasing associated with verb alternation, lexical derivation, compound word decomposition, and paraphrasing of light-verb constructions (LVC(s)) all fall into such classes.",

        "We can also find a range of varieties in paraphrasing of LVCs as we describe in Section 3.",
        "In spite of this complexity, the regularity each paraphrase class exhibits were explained by recent advances in lexical semantics, such as the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) [8] and the Generative Lexicon [17].",
        "According to the LCS, for instance, a wide variety of paraphrases including word association within compounds, transitivity alternation, and lexical derivation, were explained by means of the syntactic and semantic properties of the verb involved.",
        "The systematicity underlying such linguistic accounts is intriguing also from the engineering viewpoint as it could enable us to take a more theoretically motivated but still practical approach to paraphrase generation.",
        "The issue we address in this paper is to empirically clarify (i) what types of regularities underlying paraphrases can be explained by means of lexical semantics and how, and (ii) how lexical semantics theories can be enhanced with feedback from practical use, namely, paraphrase generation.",

        "The real coverage of these 245 (v, c, n) with regard to all LVCs among the corpus falls in the range between the below two:",
        "Lower bound: If every (v, c, n) is an LVC, the coverage of the collection is estimated at 6.47% (492,737/7,621,089) of tokens.",
        "Upper bound: If the dictionaries cover all light-verbs and deverbal nouns, the collection covers 24.1% (492,737/2,044,387) of tokens.",
        "In the experiment, our model generated all the possible paraphrases when a given verb was polysemous with multiple entries in the T-LCS dictionary.",
        "As a result, the model generated 822 paraphrases from the 735 input sentences, at least one for each input.",
        "We then classified the resultant paraphrases as correct and incorrect by comparing them with the gold-standard, where we ignored ordering of syntactic cases, and obtained 624 correct and 198 incorrect paraphrases Recall, precision, and F-measure (a = 0.5) were 0.878 (624/711), 0.759 (624/822), and 0.814, respectively.",
        "As the baseline, we employed a statistical language model developed in [5].",
        "Among all the combinations of the voice and syntactic cases, the baseline model selects the one that has the highest probability.",
        "Although the model is trained on a large amount of data, the generated expression often falls out of the vocabulary.",
        "In such a case, the probability cannot be calculated, and the model outputs nothing for the given sentence.",
        "As a result of an application of this baseline model to the same set of input sentences, we obtained 320 correct and 215 incorrect paraphrases (Recall: 0.450 (320/711), Precision: 0.598 (320/535), and F-measure: 0.514).",

        "The language model can also be complementary used to our LCS-based paraphrase generation.",
        "By filtering implausible paraphrases out, 66 incorrect and 15 correct paraphrases were filtered, and the performance was further improved (Recall: 0.857, Precision: 0.822, and F-measure: 0.839).",
        "Although the performance has room for further improvement, we think the performance is reasonably high under the current stage of the T-LCS dictionary.",
        "In other words, the tendency of errors does not so differ from our expectation.",
        "As we expected in Section 2.2, the ambiguity of dative case \"ni\" (c.f.",
        "(5)) occupied the largest portion of errors (78 /198).",
        "This was because the case assignment was performed by a rule instead of semantic parsing.",
        "Each rule in our model has been created relying on a set of linguistic tests used in the theory of LCS and our linguistic intuition on handling LCS.",
        "However, the rule set was not sufficiently sophisticated, so that led to 59 errors.",
        "Equally, 30 errors occurred due to the immature typology of the T-LCS dictionary.",
        "We consider the improvement of the LCS typology as the primal issue, because our transformation rules depend on it.",
        "For the moment, we have the following two suggestions.",
        "First, more variety of semantic roles should be handled step by step.",
        "For example, we need to handle the object of \"eikyou-suru (to affect),\" which is marked by not accusative but dative.",
        "Second, the necessity of \"Source\" is inconsistent.",
        "Verbs such as \"hairu (to enter)\" do not require this argument (\"BECOMEBEAT\") , while some other verbs, such as \"ukeru (to receive),\" explicitly require it (\"MOVE FROM TO\").",
        "The telicity of \"MOVE FROM TO\" should also be discussed.",
        "With such a feedback from the application and an extensive investigation into lexicology, we have to enhance the typology, and enlarge the dictionary preserving its consistency."

        "The model seemed to properly handle LVC paraphrasing, because their rules were described according to the deep semantic analysis and heavily relied on what were called lexical functions, such as lexical derivation (e.g., S0(affect) = effect) and light-verb generation (e.g., Oper l(attempt ) = make ).",
        "To take this approach, however, a vast amount of lexical knowledge to form each lexical function is required, because they only virtually specify all the choices relevant to LVC paraphrasing for every combination of deverbal noun and light-verb individually.",

        "Their model looks robust due to the availability of resource.",
        "However, their model fails to explain the difference between examples (7) and (9) in the voice selection, because it selects the voice based only on the light-verb irrespective of the deverbal noun: the light-verb \"ukeru (to receive)\" is always mapped to the passive voice.",
