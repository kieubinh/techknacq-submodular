        "A noun compound (NC) is an N made up of two or more nouns, such as golf club or paper submission; we will refer to the rightmost noun as the head noun and the remainder of nouns in the NC as modifiers.",
        "The interpretation of noun compounds is a well-researched area in natural language processing, and has been applied in applications such as question answering and machine translation [1,2,3].",
        "Three basic properties make the interpretation of NCs difficult [4]: (1) the compounding process is extremely productive; (2) the semantic relationship between head noun and modifier in the noun compounds is implicit; and (3) the interpretation can be influenced by contextual and pragmatic factors.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in recognizing the semantic relationship between the head noun and modifier(s) of noun compounds.",
        "We introduce a method based on word similarity between the component nouns in an unseen test instance NC and annotated training instance NCs.",
        "Due to its simplicity, our method is able to interpret NCs with significantly reduced cost.",
        "We also investigate the relative contribution of the head noun and modifier in determining the semantic relation.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we focus exclusively on binary NCs, that is NCs made up of two nouns.",
        "This is partly an empirical decision, in that the majority of NCs occurring in unrestricted text are binary,1 and also partly due to there being existing methods for disambiguating the syntactic structure of higher-arity NCs, effectively decomposing them into multiple binary NCs [3].",
        "Note also that in this paper, we distinguish semantic relations from semantic roles.",
        "The semantic relation in an NC is the underlying relation between the head noun and its modifier, whereas its semantic role is an indication of its relation to the governing verb and other constituents in the sentence context.",
        "There is a significant body of closely-related research on interpreting semantic relations in NCs which relies on handwritten rules.",
        "[5] examined the problem of interpretation of NCs and constructed a set of handwritten rules.",
        "[6] automatically extracted semantic information from an on-line dictionary and manipulated a set of handwritten rules to assign weights to semantic relations.",
        "Recently, there has been work on the automatic (or semi-automatic) interpretation of NCs [4,7,8].",
        "However, most of this work is based on a simplifying assumption as to the scope of semantic relations or the domain of interpretation, making it difficult to compare the performance of NC interpretation in a broader context.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we detail the motivation for our work (Section 2), introduce the WordNet::Similarity system which we use to calculate word similarity (Section 3), outline the set of semantic relations used (Section 4), detail how we collected the data (Section 5), introduce the proposed method (Section 6), and describe experimental results (Section 7)."

        "Most work related to interpreting NCs depends on hand-coded rules [5].",
        "The first attempt at automatic interpretation by [6] showed that it was possible to successfully interpret NCs.",
        "However, the system involved costly handwritten rules involving manual intervention.",
        "[9] estimated the amount of world knowledge required to interpret NCs and claimed that the high cost of data acquisition offsets the benefits of automatic interpretation of NCs.",
        "Recent work [4,7,8] has investigated methods for interpreting NCs automatically with minimal human effort.",
        "[10] introduced a semi-automatic method for recognizing noun-modifier relations.",
        "[4] examined nominalizations (a proper subset of NCs) in terms of whether the modifier is a subject or object of the verb the head noun is derived from (e.g. language understanding = understand language).",
        "[7] assigned hierarchical tags to nouns in medical texts and classified them according to their semantic relations using neural networks.",
        "[8] used the word senses of nouns to classify the semantic relations of NCs.",
        "However, in all this work, there has been some underlying simplifying assumption, in terms of the domain or range of interpretations an NC can occur with, leading to questions of scalability and portability to novel domains/NC types.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a method which uses word similarity based on WordNet.",
        "Word similarity has been used previously in various lexical semantic tasks, including word sense disambiguation [11,12].",
        "[11] showed that term-to-term similarity in a context space can be used to disambiguate word senses.",
        "[12] measured the relatedness of concepts using similarity based on WordNet.",
        "[13] examined the task of disambiguating noun groupings with respect to word senses using similarity between nouns in NCs.",

        "Each training noun is a component noun from the training data, each test noun is a component noun in the input, and Sij provides a measure of the noun-noun similarity in training and test,where tl is the modifier and t2 is the head noun in the NC in question.",
        "The similarities in Table1 were computed by the WUP method [14] as implemented in WordNet::Similarity (see Section 3).",
        "The simple product of the individual similarities (of each modifier and head noun, respectively) gives the similarity of the NC pairing.",
        "For example, the similarity between chocolate milk and apple juice is 0.60, while that between chocolate milk and morning milk is 0.27.",
        "Note that although milk in the input NC also occurs in a training exemplar, the semantic relations for the individual NCs differ.",
        "That is, while apple juice is juice made from apples (MATERIAL), morning milk is milk served in the morning (TIME).",
        "By comparing the similarity of both elements of the input NC, we are able to arrive at the conclusion that chocolate milk is more closely related to chocolate milk,which provides the correct semantic relation of material (i.e. milk made from/flavored with chocolate).",

        "The determining factor is therefore the similarity between the different modifier pairings, and the fact that bank is more similar to loan than is the case for personal.",
        "We also investigate the weight of the head noun and the modifier in determining overall similarity.",
        "We expect for different relations, the weight of the head noun and the modifier will be different.",
