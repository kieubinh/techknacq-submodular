        "We compare the performance of these methods from various angles by adapting the baseline model to four adaptation domains.",
        "In particular, we attempt to interpret the results given in terms of the character error rate (CER) by correlating them with the characteristics of the adaptation domain measured using the information-theoretic notion of cross entropy.",
        "We show that such a metric correlates well with the CER performance of the adaptation methods, and also show that the discriminative methods are not only superior to a MAP-based method in terms of achieving larger CER reduction, but are also more robust against the similarity of background and adaptation domains."

        "In particular, we focus on the so-called cross-domain LM adaptation paradigm, i.e. to adapt a LM trained on one domain to a different domain, for which only a small amount of training data is available.",
        "The LM adaptation methods investigated in this paper can be grouped into two categories: maximum a posterior (MAP) and discriminative training.",
        "Linear interpolation is representative of the MAP methods [1].",
        "The other three methods, including the boosting [2] and perceptron [3] algorithms and minimum sample risk (MSR) method [4], are discriminative methods, each of which uses a different training algorithm.",
        "We carried out experiments over many training data sizes on four distinct adaptation corpora, the characteristics of which were measured using the information-theoretic notion of cross entropy.",
        "We found that discriminative training methods",
        "outperformed the LI method in all cases, and were more robust across different training sets of different domains and sizes.",

        "The task of automatic conversion is called IME in this paper, which stands for Input Method Editor, based on the name of the commonly used Windows-based application.",
        "The performance of IME is typically measured in terms of the character error rate (CER), which is the number of characters wrongly converted from the phonetic string divided by the number of characters in the correct transcript.",
        "Current Japanese IME systems exhibit about 5-15% CER in conversion of real-world data in a wide variety of domains.",
        "In the following, we argue that the IME is a similar problem to speech recognition but is a better choice for evaluating language modeling techniques.",

        "Let A be the input phonetic string (which corresponds to the acoustic signal in speech).",

        "So the decision of Equation (1) depends solely upon P(W), making IME a more direct evaluation test-bed for LM than speech recognition.",

        "Given a language L with its true underlying probability distribution p and another distribution q (e.g. a SLM) which attempts to model L, the cross entropy of L with respect to q is where w1...wn is a word string in L. However, in reality, the underlying p is never known and the corpus size is never infinite.",
        "We therefore make the assumption that L is an ergodic and stationary process [5], and approximate the cross entropy by calculating it for a sufficiently large n instead of calculating it for the limit.",

        "In this paper we are interested in measuring the complexity of the LM adaptation task.",
        "We therefore define the similarity between two domains using the cross entropy.",

        "Discriminative training methods to LM adaptation, on the other hand, aim at using the adaptation data to directly minimize the errors on the adaptation data made by the background model.",
        "These techniques have been applied successfully to the task of language modeling in non-adaptation [8] as well as adaptation scenarios [9] for speech recognition.",
