        "NIL expressions were first introduced for expediting writing or computer input, especially for online chat where the input speed is crucial to prompt and effective communication.",
        "For example, it is rather annoying to input full Chinese sentences in text-based chatting environment, e.g. over the mobile phone.",
        "Thus abbreviations and acronyms are then created by forming words in capital with the first letters of a series of either English words or Chinese Pinyin.",
        "Chinese Pinyin is a popular approach to Chinese character input.",
        "Some Pinyin input methods incorporate lexical intelligence to support word or phrase input.",
        "This improves input rate greatly.",
        "However, Pinyin input is not error free.",
        "Firstly, options are usually prompted to user and selection errors result in homophone, e.g. ^ ^ (ban1 zu2) and ^ ^ (ban1 zhu3) .",
        "Secondly, input with incorrect Pinyin or dialect produces wrong Chinese words with similar pronunciation, e.g. ^^(xi1 fan4) and ^^(xi3 hua-n1) .",
        "Nonetheless, prompt communication spares little time to user to correct such a mistake.",
        "The same mistake in text is constantly repeated, and the wrong word thus becomes accepted by the chat community.",
        "This, in fact, is one common way that a new Chinese NIL expression is created.",
        "We collect a large number of sentences (strictly speaking, not all of them are sentences) from a Chinese BBS system and identify NIL expressions by hand.",
        "An empirical study on NIL expressions in this collection shows that NIL expressions can be classified into four classes as follow based on their origins.",
        "1) Abbreviation (A).",
        "Many Chinese NIL expressions are derived from abbreviation of Chinese Pinyin.",
        "For example, PF equals to^ ^(pei4 fu2) which means admire.",
        "2) Foreign expression (F).",
        "Popular Informal expressions from foreign languages such as English are adopted, e.g. ASAP is used for as soon as possible.",
        "3) Homophone (H).",
        "A NIL expression is sometimes generated by borrowing a word with similar sound (i.e. similar Pinyin).",
        "For example ^ ^ equals ^ which means like.",
        "^^ and^ hold homophony in a Chinese dialect.",
        "4) Transliteration (T) is a transcription from one alphabet to another and a letter-for-letter or sound-for-letter spelling is applied to represent a word in another language.",
        "For example, ^^(ba i4 b a i 4) is transliteration of bye-bye.",
        "A thorough observation, in turn, reveals that, based on the ways NIL expressions are formed and/or their part of speech (POS) attributes, we observe a NIL expression usually takes one of the forms presented in Table 1 and Table 2.",

        "From the linguistic perspective, NIL expressions are rather different from named entities in nature.",
        "Firstly, named entity is typically noun or noun phrase (NP), but NIL expression can be any kind, e.g. number 94 in NIL represents which is a verb meaning exactly be.",
        "Secondly, named entities often have well-defined meanings in text and are tractable from a standard dictionary; but NIL expressions are either unknown to the dictionary or ambiguous.",
        "For example, appears in conventional dictionary with the meaning of Chinese porridge, but in NIL text it represents ^^ which surprisingly represents like.",
        "The issue that concerns us is that these expressions like ^^ may also appear in NIL text with their formal meaning.",
        "This leads to ambiguity and makes it more difficult in NIL processing.",
        "Another notable work is the project of Normalization of Non-standard Words (Sproat et al., 2001) which aims to detect and normalize the Non-Standard Words (NSW) such as digit sequence; capital word or letter sequence; mixed case word; abbreviation; Roman numeral; URL and email address.",
        "In our work, we consider most types of the NSW in English except URL and email address.",
        "Moreover, we consider Chinese NIL expressions that contain same characters as the normal words.",
        "For example, ^ ^ and ^^ both appear in common dictionaries, but they carry anomalous meanings in NIL text.",
        "Ambiguity arises and basically brings NIL expressions recognition beyond the scope of NSW detection.",
