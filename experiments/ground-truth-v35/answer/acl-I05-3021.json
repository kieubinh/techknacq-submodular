        "Word segmentation is to identify lexical items, especially individual word forms, in a text.",
        "It involves two fundamental tasks, both aiming at minimizing segmentation errors: one is to infer out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, also known as unknown (or unseen) word detection, and the other to identify in-vocabulary (IV) words, with an emphasis on disambiguation.",
        "OOV words and ambiguities are the two major causes to segmentation errors.",
        "Accordingly word segmentation approaches can be divided into the categories summarized in Table 1 in terms of the resources in use to tackle these two causes.",
        "The closed and open tracks in CWSB correspond, respectively, to the last two categories, both involving inferring OOV words",
        "beyond disambiguating IV words.",
        "Word discovery and OOV word detection pursue a similar target, i.e., inferring new words.",
        "The continuum connecting them is the size of the lexicon in use: the former assumes few words known and the latter an existing lexicon to some scale.",
        "Inferring new words is an essential task in word segmentation, for a complete lexicon is rarely a realistic assumption in practice.",
        "This paper presents our segmentation system for participation in CWSB-2.",
        "It takes an example-based approach to recognize IV words and follows description length gain (DLG) to infer OOV words in terms of their text compression effect.",
        "Sections 2 and 3 below introduce the example-based and DLG-based segmentation respectively.",
        "Section 4 presents a strategy to combine their strength and Section 5 reports our system’s performance in CWSB-2.",
        "Following error analysis in Section 6, Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "How to utilize as much information as possible from the training corpus to adapt a segmentation system towards a segmentation standard has been a critical issue.",

        "(2003) attempt to integrate case-based learning with statistical models (e.g., n-gram) by extracting transformation rules from the training corpus for disambiguation via error correction; Gao et al.",
        "(2004) adopt a similar strategy for adaptive segmentation, with transformation templates (instead of case-based rules) to modify word boundaries (instead of individual words).",
        "The basic idea of example-based segmentation is very simple: existing pre-segmented strings in training corpus provide reliable examples for segmenting similar strings in input texts.",
        "In contrast to dictionary checking for locating possible words in an input sentence to facilitate later segmentation operations, pre-segmented examples give exact segmentation to copy.",
        "The example-based segmentation can be implemented in the following steps.",
        "1.",
        "Find all exemplar pre-segmented fragments, with regards to a training corpus, and all possible words, with regards to a lexicon, from each character in an input sentence; 2.",
        "Identify the optimal sequence, among all possibilities, of the above items over the sentence following some optimization criterion.",
        "If adopting the minimal number of fragments or words in a sequence as optimization criterion, we have a maximal matching approach to word segmentation.",
        "However, it differs remarkably from the previous maximal matching approaches: it matches pre-segmented fragments, instead of dictionary words, against an input sentence.",
        "It can be carried out by a best-first strategy: repeatedly select the next longest example or word until the entire sentence is properly covered.",
        "Unfortunately, the best-first approach does not guarantee to give the best answer.",
        "For CWSB-2, we implemented a program following the Viterbi algorithm to perform a complete search in terms of the number of fragments, and then words, in a sequence.",
        "However, a serious problem with this example-based approach is the sparse data problem.",
        "Long exemplar fragments are more reliable but small in number, whereas short ones are large in number but less reliable.",
        "In the case of no exemplar fragment available for an input sentence, this approach draws back to the maximal match segmentation with a dictionary.",
        "How to incorporate statistical inference into example-based segmentation to infer more reliable optimal segmentation beyond string matching remains a critical issue for us to tackle."

        "The inconsistency exists not only between the training and test corpora for each track but, more surprisingly, also within individual training corpora.",
        "Some suspected cases are illustrated in Tables 4, 5 and 6.",
        "They are observed to be in a large number in the CWSB-2 corpora.",
        "Scoring with a golden standard involving so many of them appears to be problematic, for it penalizes the systems for handling such cases right and rewards the others for producing “correct” answers.",
        "What",
        "is even more worth noting is that (1) an inconsistent case involves more than one word, and (2) the difference between a correct and an erroneous judgment of a word is 1, in a sense, but the difference between one system that loses it for doing right and another that earns it by doing wrong is surely greater."
