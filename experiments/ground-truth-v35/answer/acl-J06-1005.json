      "text": [
        "Historically, part-whole or meronymy relations have played an important role in linguistics, philosophy, and psychology mainly because a clear understanding of part-whole relations requires a deep interaction of logic, semantics, and pragmatics as they provide the tools needed for our understanding of the world.",
        "The part-whole relation has been considered a fundamental ontological relation since the atomists (Plato, Aristotle, and the Scholastics).",
        "They were the first to give a systematic characterization of parts and wholes, the relation between them, and the inheritance properties of this relation.",
        "However, most of the investigations of part-whole relations have been made since the beginning of the 20th century.",
        "The logical/philosophical studies of meronymy were concerned with formal theories of parts (mereologies), wholes, and their relation in the context of formal ontology.",
        "This school of thought advocates a single, universal, and transitive part-of relation used for modeling various domains such as time and space.",
        "Simons (1986) criticized this standard extensional view and proposed a more adequate account that offers an axiomatic representation of the part-of relation as a strict partial-ordering relation.",
        "The axioms considered were: existence (if A is a part of B then both A and B exist), asymmetry (if A is a part of B then B is not a part of A), supplementarity (if A is a part of B then B has a part C disjoint of A), and transitivity (if 6 For example, in WordNet 1.7 the only part listed for the concept sandwich is bread.",
        "A is a part of B and B is a part of C then A is a part of C).",
        "In 1991, Simons (1991) added two more axioms: extensionality (objects with the same parts are identical) and existence of mereological sum (for any number of objects there exists a whole that consists exactly of those objects).",
        "Linguistics and cognitive psychology researchers focused on different part-whole relations and their role as semantic primitives.",
        "Since there are different ways in which something can be expressed as part of something else, many researchers have claimed that meronymy is a complex relation that \"should be treated as a collection of relations, not as a single relation\" (Iris, Litowitz, and Evens 1988).",
        "Based on psycholinguistic experiments and the way in which the parts contribute to the structure of the wholes, Winston, Chaffin, and Hermann (1987) determined six types of part-whole relations: (1) COMPONENT-INTEGRAL OBJECT,(2) MEMBER-COLLECTION,(3) PORTION-MASS,(4) STUFF-OBJECT,(5) FEATURE-ACTIVITY,and (6)",
        "PLACE-AREA.",
        "They also proposed three relation elements ( functional, homeomerous,and separable)to further classify the six types of meronymy relations.",
        "The functional relational element indicates that the part has a function with respect to its whole, whereas homeomerous means that the part is identical to the other parts making up the whole.",
        "The separable relational element shows that the part can be separated from the whole.",
        "For example, the relation wheel-car is a COMPONENT-INTEGRAL part-whole relation that is functional, non-homeomerous and separable.",
        "This means that the wheel has a specific function with respect to the car, does not resemble the other parts of the car, and can be separated from the car.",
        "The COMPONENT-INTEGRAL relation is the relation between components and the objects to which they belong.",
        "Integral objects have a structure, their components are separable and have a functional relation with their wholes.",
        "For example, kitchen-apartment and aria-opera are COMPONENT-INTEGRAL relations.",
        "The MEMBER-COLLECTION relation represents membership in a collection.",
        "Members are parts, but they cannot be separated from their collections and do not play any functional role with respect to their whole.",
        "For example, soldier-army, professor-faculty, and tree-forest are MEMBER-COLLECTION relations.",
        "PORTION-MASS captures the relations between portions and masses, extensive objects, and physical dimensions.",
        "The parts are separable and similar to each other and to the wholes which they comprise, and do not play any functional role with respect to their whole.",
        "For example, slice-pie and meter-kilometer are PORTION-MASS relations.",
        "The STUFF-OBJECT category encodes the relations between an object and the stuff of which it is partly or entirely made.",
        "The parts are not similar to the wholes that they comprise, cannot be separated from the whole, and have no functional role.",
        "For example, steel-car and alcohol-wine are STUFF-OBJECT relations.",
        "The FEATURE-ACTIVITY relation captures the semantic links within features or phases of various activities or processes.",
        "The parts have a functional role, but they are not similar or separable from the whole.",
        "For example, paying-shopping and chewing-eating are FEATURE-ACTIVITY relations.",
        "PLACE-AREA captures the relation between areas and special places and locations within them.",
        "The parts are similar to their wholes, but they are not separable from them.",
        "For example, oasis-desert and Guadalupe Mountains National Park-Texas are PLACE-AREA relations.",
        "In this paper we use the Winston, Chaffin, and Hermann classification as a criterion for building the training corpus to provide a wide coverage of such subtypes of part-whole relations.",
        "In computational linguistics, although a considerable amount of work has been done on semantic relation detection, the work most similar to the task of identifying part-whole semantic relations is that of Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999).",
        "Hearst developed a method for the automatic acquisition of hypernymy relations by identifying a set of frequently used and mostly unambiguous lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "For example, countries, such as England indicates a hypernymy relation between the words countries and England.",
        "In her paper, she mentions that she tried applying the same method to meronymy, but without much success, as the patterns detected also expressed other semantic relations.",
        "This is consistent with our study of part-whole lexico-syntactic patterns presented in this paper.",
        "In 1999, Berland and Charniak applied statistical methods to a very large corpusto find part-whole relations.",
        "Using Hearst's method, they focused on a small set of genitive patterns and a list of six seeds representing whole objects (book, building, car, hospital, plant,andschool).",
        "Their system's output was an ordered list of possible parts according to some statistical metrics (e.g., the log-likelihood metric (Dunning 1993)).",
        "Although the training corpus used is very large, the coverage of the algorithm is small due to the limited number of patterns used and the small number of wholes allowed.",
        "Moreover, certain words, such as those ending in -ing, -ness,or -ity, were ruled out.",
        "Their accuracy is 55% for the first 50 ranked parts and 70% for the first 20 ranked parts.",
        "As a baseline, they considered as potential parts the head nouns immediately surrounding the target whole object and ranked them based on the same statistical metric.",
        "The baseline accuracy was 8%.",
        "While Berland and Charniak's method focuses solely on identifying parts given a whole, our task targets the identification of both parts and wholes.",
        "Hearst, and Berland and Charniak observed that for ambiguous whole words, such as plant, the method produces the weakest part list of the six seeds considered.",
        "Although they don't provide a one-to-one comparison, Berland and Charniak mention that their method outperforms Hearst's pattern matching algorithm mainly due to the very large corpus used.",
        "However, neither approach addresses the pattern ambiguity problem, i.e., patterns such as genitives that can express different semantic relations in different contexts (the dress of silk encodes a part-whole relation, but the dress of my girl does not).",
        "The ambiguity of these patterns explains our rationale for choosing an approach based on a machine learning method to discover discriminating rules automatically."

        "Pick pairs of concepts C;,C,- among which there is a part-whole relation",
        "For this task, we used the information provided by WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "In WordNet, the nouns are organized into nine hierarchies, each hierarchy being identified by its corresponding root concept: {abstraction}, {act}, {entity}, {event}, {group}, {phenomenon}, {possession}, {psychological feature},and {state}.",
        "The nouns are grouped in concepts or synsets; a concept consisting of a list of synonymous word senses.",
        "For example, {mother#1, female parent#1} is a WordNet concept.",

        "Since the part and whole concepts provided by WordNet can belong to almost any WordNet noun hierarchy, we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine WordNet noun hierarchies, the three WordNet meronymic relations, and the six types of part-whole relations of WCH.",

        "A third judge (one of the authors) checked the correctness of all the mappings and decided on the non-agreed instances.",

        "To arrive at an interpretation of the pair of words selected by the cluster patterns, it is first necessary to identify that both words are nouns, and not other parts of speech.",
        "For example, if Brill's tagger mis-tags an adjective or verb as a noun, then the ISS system will also be affected.",
        "Our classification rule learning approach is based on the WordNet semantic classes of the two concepts that represent the part and the whole, respectively.",
        "Thus, if the WSD system fails to annotate the concepts with the correct senses, the ISS system can generate wrong semantic classes, which leads to wrong conclusions.",
        "For example, the WordNet concept end has 14 senses corresponding to 6 semantic classes (entity, abstraction, event, psychological feature, state,and act) (see Table 20).",

        "For example, the concepts import and export are not listed in WordNet as denoting the act of importing/exporting commodities from a foreign country.",

        "For example, the part-whole instance band#1 ofpeople#1 is detected by the pattern NPX of NPYand the system classifies erroneously band as part, and people as whole.",
        "One way to overcome this is to further classify the patterns based on selectional restrictions on their constituent nouns (e.g., group nouns in of-genitives have different positions for the part and whole concepts).",
        "We present in Table 21 the types of errors and their frequency of occurrence for each cluster and overall.",

        "In this paper we presented a supervised, knowledge-intensive approach to the automatic detection of part-whole relations encoded by the three most frequent clusters of syntactic constructions: (1) genitives and NP have NP clauses, (2) noun compounds, and (3) other NP PP phrases.",
        "The detection of the part-whole relations is difficult due to the highly ambiguous nature of the syntactic constructions, as they can encode other relations than meronymy.",
        "Our method for detection of part-whole relations discovers semi-automatically the part-whole lexico-syntactic patterns and learns automatically the semantic classification rules needed for the disambiguation of these patterns.",
        "We defined the task as a binary classification problem and used an approach that relies on the assumption that the semantic relation between two constituent nouns representing the part and the whole can be detected based on the components' semantic classification rules.",
        "The classification rules are learned automatically through an iterative semantic specialization (ISS) procedure applied on the noun constituents' semantic classes provided by WordNet.",
        "We successfully combined the results of decision tree learning with the WordNet IS-A hierarchy specialization for more accurate learning.",
        "We proved the method is domain independent.",
        "The classification rules learned by our method and listed in several tables can be easily implemented to extract part-whole relations from text.",
        "However, to apply these rules a word sense disambiguation system for nouns is necessary.",
        "Our experiments revealed the importance of word sense disambiguation and WordNet IS-A specialization.",
        "We have directly compared and contrasted the results of our system with a variety of baselines and have shown impressive results.",
        "Combination of word sense disambiguation information with IS-A semantic information in WordNet yields better performance over either WSD or IS-A specialization alone.",
        "Our experiments also showed that the three cluster patterns considered are not alternative ways of encoding part-whole information.",
        "This observation is very important for various text understanding applications.",
        "Moreover, the approach presented can be extended to other semantic relations since the learning procedures are generally applicable and yield good results for sufficiently large training corpora.",
