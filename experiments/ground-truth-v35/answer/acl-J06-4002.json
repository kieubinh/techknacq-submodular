        "The systematic evaluation of natural language processing (NLP) systems is an important prerequisite for assessing their quality and improving their performance.",
        "Traditionally, human involvement is called for in evaluating systems that generate textual output.",
        "Examples include text generation, summarization, and, notably, machine translation.",
        "Human evaluations consider many aspects of automatically generated texts ranging from grammaticality to content selection, fluency, and readability (Teufel and van Halteren 2004; Nenkova 2005; Mani 2001; White and O'Connell 1994).",
        "The relatively high cost of producing human judgments, especially when evaluations must be performed quickly and frequently, has encouraged many researchers to seek ways of evaluating system output automatically.",
        "Papineni et al.",
        "(2002) proposed BLEU, a method for evaluating candidate translations by comparing them against reference translations (using n-gram co-occurrence overlap).",
        "Along the same lines, the content of a system summary can be assessed by measuring its similarity to one or more manual summaries (Hovy and Lin 2003).",
        "Bangalore, Rambow, and Whittaker (2000) introduce a variety of quantitative measures for evaluating the accuracy of an automatically generated sentence against a reference corpus string.",
        "Despite differences in application and form, automatic evaluation methods usually involve the following desiderata.",
        "First, they measure numeric similarity or closeness of system output to one or several gold standards.",
        "Second, they are inexpensive, robust, and ideally language independent.",
        "Third, correlation with human judgments is an important part of creating and testing an automated metric.",
        "For instance, several studies have shown that BLEU correlates with human ratings on machine translation quality (Papineni et al.",
        "2002; Doddington 2002; Coughlin 2003).",
        "Bangalore, Rambow, and Whittaker (2000) demonstrate that tree-based evaluation metrics for",

        "surface generation correlate significantly with human judgments on sentence quality and understandability.",
        "Given their simplicity, automatic evaluation methods cannot be considered as a direct replacement for human evaluations (see Callison-Burch, Osborne, and Koehn [2006] for discussion on some problematic aspects of BLEU).",
        "However, they can be usefully employed during system development, for example, for quickly assessing modeling ideas or for comparing across different system configurations (Papineni et al.",
        "2002; Bangalore, Rambow, and Whittaker 2000).",
        "Automatic methods have concentrated on evaluation aspects concerning lexical choice (e.g., words or phrases shared between reference and system translations), content selection (e.g., document units shared between reference and system summaries), and grammaticality (e.g., how many insertions, substitutions, or deletions are required to transform a generated sentence to a reference string).",
        "Another promising, but, less studied, avenue for automatic evaluation is information ordering.",
        "The task concerns finding an acceptable ordering for a set of preselected information-bearing items (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004).",
        "It is an essential step in concept-to-text generation, multidocument summarization, and other text synthesis problems.",
        "Depending on the application and domain at hand, the items to be ordered may vary greatly from propositions (Karamanis 2003; Dimitromanolaki and Androutsopoulos 2003) to trees (Mellish et al.",
        "1998) or sentences (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004).",
        "It is therefore not surprising that evaluation methods have concentrated primarily on the generated orders, thus abstracting away from the items themselves.",
        "More concretely, Lapata (2003) proposed the use of Kendall's t, a measure of rank correlation, as a means of estimating the distance between a system-generated and a human-generated gold-standard order.",
        "Rank correlation is an appealing way of evaluating information ordering: It is a well-understood and widely used measure of the strength of association between two variables; it is computed straightforwardly and can operate over distinct linguistic units (e.g., sentences, trees, or propositions).",
        "Indeed, several studies have adopted Kendall's t as a performance measure for evaluating the output of information-ordering components both in the context of concept-to-text generation (Karamanis and Mellish 2005; Karamanis 2003) and summarization (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004; Okazaki, Matsuo, and Ishizuka 2004).",
        "Despite its growing popularity, no study to date has investigated whether Kendall's t correlates with human judgments on the information-ordering task.",
        "This is in marked contrast with other automatic evaluation methods that have been shown to correlate with human assessments.",
        "In this article, we aim to rectify this and undertake two studies that examine whether there is indeed a relationship between t and behavioral data.",
        "We first briefly introduce Kendall's t and explain how it can be employed for evaluating information ordering (Section 2).",
        "Next, we present a controlled experimental study that examines whether Kendall's t is correlated with human ratings (Section 3).",
        "A commonly raised criticism of the judgment elicitation methodology is that it is not fine-grained enough to rule out possible confounds.",
        "In the information-ordering task, for example, we cannot be certain that subjects rate a document low because it is genuinely badly organized and, therefore, difficult to comprehend or because they are unfamiliar with its content or simply disinterested or distracted.",
        "Similar confounds also arise in the evaluation of the output of MT systems, where it may be difficult to tease apart whether subjects' ratings reflect their assessment of the quality of the translated text or its subject matter and structure.",
        "To eliminate such confounds, we follow our judgment elicitation study with an on-line reading experiment and demonstrate that t is also correlated with processing time (Section 4).",
        "Our second experiment provides additional evidence for the validity of t as a measure of text well-formedness.",
        "Discussion of our results concludes the article."

        "In common with other automatic evaluation methods, we assume that we have access to a reference output that in most cases will be created by one or several humans.",
        "Our task is to compare a system-produced ordering of items against a reference order.",
        "For ease of exposition, let us assume that our information-ordering component is part of a generation application whose ultimate goal is to generate coherent and understandable text.",
        "It is not crucially important how the items to be ordered are represented.",
        "They can be facts in a database (Duboue and McKeown 2001), propositions (Karamanis 2003), discourse trees (Mellish et al.",
        "1998), or sentences (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004).",
        "Now, we can think of the items as objects for which a ranking must be produced.",
        "Table 1 gives an example of a reference text containing 10 items (A-J) and the orders (i.e., rankings) produced by two hypothetical systems.",
        "We can then calculate how much the system orders differ from the reference order, the underlying assumption being that acceptable orders should be fairly similar to the reference.",
        "A number of metrics can be employed for this purpose, such as Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) for ranked data, Cayley distance, or Kendall's t (see Lebanon and Lafferty [2002] for an overview).",
        "Here we describe Kendall's t (Kendall 1938) and explain why it is an appropriate choice for information-ordering tasks.",
        "Let Y = y1...yn be a set of items to be ranked.",
        "Let n and <r denote two distinct orderings of Y,and S(n, ct) the minimum number of adjacent transpositions needed to bring n to ct. Kendall's t is defined as:",
        "where N is the number of objects (i.e., items) being ranked.",
        "As can be seen, Kendall's t is based on the number transpositions, that is, interchanges of consecutive elements, necessary to rearrange n into ct.",
        "In Table 1 the number of transpositions can be calculated by counting the number of intersections of the lines.",
        "The t between the Reference and System 1 is 0.82, between the Reference and System 2 is 0.24, and between the two systems is 0.15.",
        "The metric ranges from – 1 (inverse ranks) to 1 (identical ranks).",
        "The calculation of t must be appropriately modified when there are tied rankings (Hays 1994; Siegel and Castellan 1988).",
        "Kendall's t seems particularly appropriate for the information-ordering tasks considered in this article.",
        "The metric is sensitive to the fact that some items may be always",
        "Example of reference order and system orders for a text consisting of 10 items.",
        "ABCDEFGHI J",
        "ordered next to each other even though their absolute orders might differ.",
        "It also penalizes inverse rankings.",
        "Comparison between the Reference and System 2 gives a t of 0.24 even though the orders between the two models are identical modulo the beginning and the end.",
        "This seems appropriate given that flipping the introduction in a document with the conclusions seriously disrupts coherence.",
        "Kendall's t is less widely used than Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs).",
        "Both coefficients use the same amount of information in the data, and thus both have the same sensitivity to detect the existence of association.",
        "This means that for a given data set, both measures will lead to rejection of the null hypothesis at the same level of significance.",
        "However, the two measures have different underlying scales, and, numerically, they are not directly comparable to each other.",
        "Siegel and Castellan (1988) express the relationship of the two measures in terms of the inequality:",
        "More importantly, Kendall's t and rs have different interpretations.",
        "Kendall's t can be interpreted as a simple function of the probability of observing concordant and discordant pairs (Kerridge 1975).",
        "In other words, it is the difference between the probability that in the observed data two variables are in the same order versus the probability that they are in different orders (the probability is rescaled to range from – 1 to 1 as is customaryforcorrelation; see equation (1)).",
        "Unfortunately, no simplemeaning can be attributed to rs.",
        "The latter is the same as a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (rp) computed for values consisting of ranks.",
        "Although r represents the percent of variance shared by two variables in the case of rp, its interpretation is less straightforward for rs, where it refers to the percent of variance of two ranks.",
        "It is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions with regard to information ordering based on the variance of ranks.",
        "In practice, while both correlations frequently provide similar answers, there are situations where they diverge.",
        "For example, the statistical distribution of t approaches the normal distribution faster than rs (Kendall and Gibbons 1990), thus offering an advantage for small to moderate sample studies with 30 or fewer data points.",
        "This is crucial when experiments are conducted with a small number of subjects (a situation common in NLP) or test items.",
        "Another related issue concerns sample size.",
        "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a biased statistic (Kendall and Gibbons 1990).",
        "The smaller the sample the more rs diverges from the true population value, usually underestimating it.",
        "In contrast, Kendall's t does not provide a biased estimate of the true correlation.",
        "Furthermore, t maintains good control of type I error rates (i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).",
        "Arndt, Turvey, and Andreasen (1999) undertake an extensive empirical study and show that the number of times t incorrectly signals a significant correlation when there is none is close to the nominal 5% using a p < 0.05 significance criterion.",
        "For a more detailed discussion of the advantages of t over rs, we refer the interested reader to Kendall and Gibbons (1990) and Arndt, Turvey, and",

        "A potential criticism of our previous study is that it is based solely on ratings.",
        "The problem with this off-line measure is that it indicates whether participants find a text easy or difficult to comprehend, without, however, isolating the causes for this difficulty.",
        "For example, the ratings may reflect not only what subjects think about how a text is organized but also their (un)familiarity with its genre or style, their lack of attention, or disinterest in the subject matter.",
        "To ascertain that this is not the case, we conducted a follow-up experiment whose aim was to explore the relationship between Kendall's t and processing effort.",
        "Much work in psychology (McKoon and Ratcliff 1992; Britton 1991) indicates that low-coherence texts require more inferences and therefore take longer to read.",
        "If Kendall's t does indeed capture aspects of overall document organization and coherence, then documents assigned a high t value should take less time to read than documents with low t values.",
        "Unlike ratings, reading times are an immediate measure of processing effort that participants cannot consciously control or modulate.",
        "4.1.1 Design and Materials.",
        "The experiment was designed to assess the relation of Kendall's t with processing effort.",
        "Our selection of materials was informed by the ANOVA results presented in Experiment 1.",
        "We used the same eight reference texts from the previous experiment.",
        "For each text we randomly selected three synthetically generated orders, each from Bin 1 (high t value), Bins 2^ (medium t value), and Bins 5-8(low t value).",
        "In other words, we collapsed Bins 2^ and Bins 5-8, since the ANOVA",
        "3 We cannot apply the commonly used kappa statistic for measuring intersubject agreement since it is appropriate for nominal scales, whereas our texts are rated on an ordinal scale.",
        "Mean reading times (in milliseconds) for three experimental conditions.",
        "revealed that ratings for these bins were not significantly different.",
        "Our set of materials consisted of 8 x 3 = 24 texts.",
        "4.1.2 Procedure.",
        "The presentation of stimuli and collection of responses was controlled by E-Prime software (version 1.1) running on a Dell Optiplex GX270 with an Intel Pentium 4 processor and 512 MB memory.",
        "The experiment started with a practice session comprising two texts, each eight sentences long.",
        "Then eight texts were presented; the presentation followed a Latin square design, thus ensuring that no subject saw the same text twice.",
        "The texts were presented one sentence at a time.",
        "The participant pressed the space bar to proceed from one sentence to the next.",
        "Participants were instructed to read the texts at their own pace and to press the space bar after each sentence once they were certain that they understood it.",
        "Participants' reading time was recorded for each sentence.",
        "After the final sentence was displayed, subjects were asked a comprehension yes/no question to make sure that they were actually reading the texts rather than pressing the space bar randomly.",
        "4.1.3 Subjects.",
        "The experiment was completed by 32 volunteers, all self-reported native speakers of English.",
        "The experiment was administered in the laboratory and subjects were paid £5 for their participation.",
        "None of the subjects had previously participated in Experiment 1.",
        "Sentence reading times were averaged to provide reading times for each text.",
        "As a first step, the reading time data were screened to remove errors and outliers.",
        "Errors consisted of items where the subjects had incorrectly answered the comprehension question.",
        "This affected 12.3% of the data.",
        "Reading times beyond 2.5 standard deviations above or below the mean for a particular participant were replaced with the mean plus this cutoff value.",
        "This adjustment of outliers affected 9.7% of the data.",
        "Mean reading times for each experimental condition (high, medium, low) are shown in Table 4.",
        "ANOVA showed significant differences in reading times [F1 (2,62) = 6.39, p < 0.01; F2(2,14) = 4.23, p < 0.05].",
        "Post hoc Tukey tests revealed that high-T texts were read significantly faster than medium-and low-T texts (a = 0.01).",
        "Reading times for medium-T texts were not significantly different from low-T texts.",
        "4 E-prime is a suite of tools for creating and running experiments while allowing for millisecond precision data collection.",
        "For more information see http://www.pstnet.com/products/e-prime/.",
        "We next examine through correlation analysis whether there is a linear relationship between reading times and t values.",
        "We regressed t values and reading times following the procedure recommended in Lorch and Myers (1990).",
        "The regression yielded a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = – 0.48 (p < 0.01).",
        "Expectedly, reading times are also significantly correlated with human ratings: Pearson's r = – 0.47 (p < 0.01).",
        "To summarize, the results of our second experiment provide additional evidence for the use of Kendall's t as a measure of text well-formedness.",
        "It correlates not only with human ratings but also with reading times.",
        "The latter constitute much more fine-grained behavioral data, directly associated with processing effort: Less well-structured documents tend to have low t values and cause longer reading times, whereas documents with high t values tend to be better organized and cause shorter reading times."

        "In this article, we argue that Kendall's t can be used as an automatic evaluation method for information-ordering tasks.",
        "We have undertaken a judgment elicitation study demonstrating that t correlates reliably with human judgments.",
        "We have also shown that t correlates with processing effort – texts with high t values take less time to read than texts with low t values.",
        "We have presented behavioral evidence collected via two distinct experimental paradigms suggesting that Kendall's t is an ecologically valid measure of document well-formedness and structure.",
        "An attractive feature of the t evaluation method is that it is representation independent.",
        "It can therefore be used to evaluate both symbolic and statistical generation systems.",
        "We do not view t as an alternative to human evaluations; rather we consider its role complementary.",
        "It can be used during system development for tracking incremental progress or as an easy way of assessing whether an idea is promising.",
        "It can also be used to compare systems that employ comparable information-ordering strategies and operate over the same input.",
        "Furthermore, statistical generation systems (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004; Karamanis and Manurung 2002; Mellish et al.",
        "1998) could use t as a means of directly optimizing information ordering, much in the same way MT systems optimize model parameters using BLEU as a measure of translation quality (Och 2003).",
        "The t evaluations presented in this article used a single reference text.",
        "Previous work (Barzilay, Elhadad, and McKeown 2002; Lapata 2003; Karamanis and Mellish 2005) has shown that there may be many acceptable orders for a set of information-bearing items, although topically related sentences seem to appear together (Barzilay, Elhadad, and McKeown 2002).",
        "A straightforward way to incorporate multiple references in the evaluation paradigm discussed here is to compute the t statistic N times for every reference-system output pair and report the mean.",
        "A more interesting future direction is to weight transpositions (see Section 2) according to agreements or disagreements in the set of multiple references.",
        "A possible implementation of this idea would",
        "5 Lorch and Myers (1990) argue that it is not appropriate to average over subjects when dealing with repeated measures designs.",
        "Instead they propose three methods that effect regression analysis on reading times collected from individual subjects.",
        "We refer the interested reader to Lorch and Myers (1990) and Baayen (2004) for further discussion.",
        "6 The correlation coefficients are negative since longer reading times correspond to lower ratings and T values.",
        "be to compute t against one (randomly selected) reference, but change the metric so as to give fractional counts (i.e., less than one) to transpositions that are not uniformly attested in the reference set.",
        "Naturally, Kendall's t is not the only automatic evaluation method that can be employed to assess information ordering.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004) and Barzilay and Lapata (2005) measure accuracy as the percentage of test items for which the system gives preference to the gold-standard reference order.",
        "This measure allows us to compare the output of different systems; however, it only rewards orders identical to the gold standard, and considers all other orders deviating from it deficient.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004) propose an additional evaluation measure based on ranks.",
        "Assuming that a system can exhaustively generate all possible orders for a set of items (with a certain probability), they report the rank given to the reference order when all possible orders are sorted by their probability.",
        "The best possible rank is 0 and the worst rank is N!",
        " – 1.",
        "A system that gives a high rank to the reference order is considered worse than a system that gives it a low rank.",
        "However, not all systems are designed to exhaustively enumerate all possible permutations for a given document or have indeed a scoring mechanism that can rank alternative document renderings.",
        "Duboue and McKeown (2002) employ an alignment algorithm that allows them to compare the output of their algorithm with a gold-standard order.",
        "The alignment algorithm works by considering the similarity between system-generated and gold-standard facts.",
        "The similarity function is domain dependent (Duboue and McKeown [2002] generate postcardiac surgery medical briefings) and would presumably have to be redefined for a different set of facts in another domain.",
        "Kendall's t can be easily used to evaluate the output of automatic systems, irrespectively of the domain or application at hand.",
        "It requires no additional tuning and correlates reliably with behavioral data.",
        "Since it is a similarity measure, it can be used to evaluate system output that is not necessarily identical to the gold standard.",
        "Also note that t could be used to compare across systems operating over similar input/output even if reference texts are not available.",
        "For example, t could identify outlier systems with output radically different from the mean."
