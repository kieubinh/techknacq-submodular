        "The entailment relations between verbs are a natural language counterpart of the commonsense knowledge that certain events and states give rise to other events and states.",
        "For example, there is an entailment relation between the verbs buy and belong, which reflects the commonsense notion that if someone has bought an object, this object belongs to that person.",
        "A lexical resource encoding entailment can serve as a useful tool in many tasks where automatic inferencing over natural language text is required.",
        "In Question Answering, it has been used to establish that a certain sentence found in the corpus can serve as a suitable, albeit implicit answer to a query (Curtis et al., 2005), (Girju, 2003), (Moldovan and Rus, 2001).",
        "In Information Extraction, it can similarly help to recognize relations between named entities in cases when the entities in the text are linked by a linguistic construction that entails a known extraction pattern, but not by the pattern itself.",
        "A lexical entailment resource can contribute to information retrieval tasks via integration into a textual entailment system that aims to recognize entailment between two larger text fragments (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "Since entailment is known to systematically interact with the discourse organization of text (Hobbs, 1985), an entailment resource can be of interest to tasks that deal with structuring a set of individual facts into coherent text.",
        "In Natural Language Generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000) and Multi-Document Summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002) it can be used to order sentences coming from multiple, possibly unrelated sources to produce a coherent document.",
        "The knowledge is essential for compiling answers for procedural questions in a QA system, when sentences containing relevant information are spread across the corpus (Curtis et al., 2005).",
        "The present paper is concerned with the problem of automatic acquisition of verb entailment from text.",
        "In the next section we set the background for the study by describing previous work.",
        "We then define the goal of the study and describe our method for verb entailment acquisition.",
        "After that we present results of its experimental evaluation.",
        "Finally, we draw conclusions and outline future work."

        "The task of verb entailment acquisition appears to have much in common with that of paraphrase acquisition (Lin and Pantel, 2001), (Pang et al., 2003), (Szpektor et al., 2004).",
        "In both tasks the goal is to discover pairs of related verbs and identify map",
        "pings between their argument structures.",
        "The important distinction is that while in a paraphrase the two verbs are semantically equivalent, entailment is a directional, or asymmetric, relation: one verb entails the other, but the converse does not hold.",
        "For example, the verbs buy and purchase paraphrase each other: either of them can substitute its counterpart in most contexts without altering their meaning.",
        "The verb buy entails own so that buy can be replaced with own without introducing any contradicting content into the original sentence.",
        "Replacing own with buy, however, does convey new meaning.",
        "To account for the asymmetric character of entailment, a popular approach has been to use lexicosyntactic patterns indicative of entailment.",
        "In (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) different types of semantic relations between verbs are discovered using surface patterns (like “X-ed by Y-ing” for en-ablement1, which would match “obtained by borrowing”, for example) and assessing the strength of asymmetric relations as mutual information between the two verbs.",
        "(Torisawa, 2003) collected pairs of coordinated verbs, i.e. matching patterns like “X-ed and Y-ed”, and then estimated the probability of entailment using corpus counts.",
        "(Inui et al., 2003) used a similar approach exploiting causative expressions such as because, though, and so.",
        "(Girju, 2003) extracted causal relations between nouns like “Earthquakes generate tsunami” by first using lexico-syntactic patterns to collect relevant data and then using a decision tree classifier to learn the relations.",
        "Although these techniques have been shown to achieve high precision, their reliance on surface patterns limits their coverage in that they address only those relations that are regularly made explicit through concrete natural language expressions, and only within sentences.",
        "The method for noun entailment acquisition by (Geffet and Dagan, 2005) is based on the idea of distributional inclusion, according to which one noun is entailed by the other if the set of occurrence contexts of the former subsumes that of the latter.",
        "However, this approach is likely to pick only a particular kind of verb entailment, that of troponymy (such as",
        "march-walk) and overlook pairs where there is little overlap in the occurrence patterns between the two verbs.",
        "In tasks involving recognition of relations between entities such as Question Answering and Information Extraction, it is crucial to encode the mapping between the argument structures of two verbs.",
        "Pattern-matching often imposes restrictions on the syntactic configurations in which the verbs can appear in the corpus: the patterns employed by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and (Torisawa, 2003) derive pairs of only those verbs that have identical argument structures, and often only those that involve a subject and a direct object.",
        "The method for discovery of inference rules by (Lin and Pantel, 200 1) obtains pairs of verbs with highly varied argument structures, which also do not have to be identical for the two verbs.",
        "While the inference rules the method acquires seem to encompass pairs related by entailment, these pairs are not distinguished from paraphrases and the direction of relation in such pairs is not recognized.",
        "To sum up, a major challenge in entailment acquisition is the need for more generic methods that would cover an unrestricted range of entailment types and learn the mapping between verbs with varied argument structures, eventually yielding resources suitable for robust large-scale applications."

        "In this paper we proposed a novel method for automatic discovery of verb entailment relations from text, a problem that is of potential benefit for many NLP applications.",
        "The central assumption behind the method is that verb entailment relations manifest themselves in the regular co-occurrence of two verbs inside locally coherent text.",
        "Our evaluation has shown that this assumption provides a promising approach for discovery of verb entailment.",
        "The method achieves good performance, demonstrating a closer approximation to the human performance than inference rules, constructed on the basis of distributional similarity between paths in parse trees.",
        "A promising direction along which this work",
        "can be extended is the augmentation of the current algorithm with techniques for coreference resolution.",
        "Coreference, nominal and pronominal, is an important aspect of the linguistic realization of local discourse structure, which our model did not take into account.",
        "As the experimental evaluation suggests, many verbs related by entailment occur close to one another in the text.",
        "It is very likely that many common event participants appearing in such proximity are referred to by coreferential expressions, and therefore noticeable improvement can be expected from applying coreference resolution to the corpus prior to learning entailment patterns from it."
