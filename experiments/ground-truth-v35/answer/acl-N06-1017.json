        "If a system has seen only positive examples, how does it recognize a negative example?",
        "This is the problem addressed by outlier detection, also called novelty detection1 (Markou and Singh, 2003a; Markou and Singh, 2003b; Marsland, 2003): to detect novel or unknown items that differ from all the seen training data.",
        "Outlier detection approaches typically derive some model of “normal” objects from the training set and use a distance measure and a threshold to detect abnormal items.",
        "In this paper, we apply outlier detection techniques to the task of unknown sense detection: the identification of corpus occurrences that are not covered by a given sense inventory.",
        "The training set",
        "against which new occurrences are compared will consist of sense-annotated text.",
        "Unknown sense detection is related to word sense disambiguation (WSD) and to word sense discrimination (Sch¨utze, 1998), but differs from both.",
        "In WSD all senses are assumed known, and the task is to select one of them, while in unknown sense detection the task is to decide whether a given occurrence matches any of the known senses or none of them, and all training instances, regardless of the sense to which they belong, are modeled as one group of known data.",
        "Unknown sense detection also differs from word sense discrimination, where no sense inventory is given and the task is to group occurrences into senses.",
        "In unknown sense detection the model respects the given word senses.",
        "The main motivation for this study comes from shallow semantic parsing, by which we mean a combination of WSD and the automatic assignment of",
        "semantic roles to free text.",
        "In cases where a sense is missing from the inventory, WSD will wrongly assign one of the existing senses.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example, a sentence from the Hound of the Baskervilles, analyzed by the SHALMANESER (Erk and Pado, 2006) shallow semantic parser.",
        "The analysis is based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a resource that lists senses and semantic roles for English expressions.",
        "FrameNet is lacking a sense of “expectation” or “being mentally prepared” for the verb prepare, so prepared has been assigned the sense COOKING CREATION, a possible but improbable analysis2.",
        "Such erroneous labels can be fatal when further processing builds on the results of shallow semantic parsing, e.g. for drawing inferences.",
        "Unknown sense detection can prevent such mistakes.",
        "All sense inventories face the problem of missing senses, either because of their small overall size (as is the case for some non-English WordNets) or when they encounter domain-specific senses.",
        "Our study will be evaluated on FrameNet because of our main aim of improving shallow semantic parsing, but the method we propose is applicable to any sense inventory that has annotated data; in particular, it is also applicable to WordNet.",
        "In this paper we model unknown sense detection as outlier detection, using a simple Nearest Neighbor-based method (Tax and Duin, 2000) that compares the local probability density at each test item with that of its nearest training item.",
        "To our knowledge, there exists no other approach to date to the problem of detecting unknown senses.",
        "There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2005), which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection.",
        "Plan of the paper.",
        "After a brief sketch of FrameNet in Section 2, we describe the experimental setup used throughout this paper in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 tests whether a very simple model suffices for detecting unknown senses: a threshold on confidence scores returned by the SHALMANESER WSD 2Unfortunately, the semantic roles have been mis-assigned by the system.",
