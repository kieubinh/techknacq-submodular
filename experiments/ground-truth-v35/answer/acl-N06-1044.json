        "In other words, the grammar should not lose probability mass with strings or trees of infinite length.",
        "Several methods for the empirical estimation of probabilistic context-free grammars have been proposed in the literature, based on the optimization of some function on the probabilities of the observed data, such as the maximization of the likelihood of",

        "It has been conjectured in (Wetherell, 1980) that these methods always provide probabilistic context-free grammars with the consistency property.",
        "A first result in this direction was presented in (Chaudhuri et al., 1983), by showing that a probabilistic context-free grammar estimated by maximizing the likelihood of a sample of parse trees is always consistent.",
        "In later work by (S´anchez and Benedi, 1997) and (Chi and Geman, 1998), the result was independently extended to expectation maximization, which is an unsupervised method exploited to estimate probabilistic context-free grammars by finding local maxima of the likelihood of a sample of unannotated sentences.",

        "More specifically, in (Chi and Geman, 1998) empty rules and unary rules are not allowed, thus excluding infinite ambiguity, that is, the possibility that some string in the input sample has an infinite number of derivations in the grammar.",
        "The treatment of general form context-free grammars has been an open problem so far.",
        "In this paper we consider several estimation methods for probabilistic context-free grammars, and we show that the resulting grammars have the consistency property.",
