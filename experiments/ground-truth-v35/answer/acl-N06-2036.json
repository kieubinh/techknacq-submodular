        "Word subject domains have been ubiquitously used in dictionaries to help human readers pinpoint the specific sense of a word by specifying technical usage, e.g. see “subject field codes” in Procter (1978).",
        "In computational linguistics, word subject domains have been widely used to improve the performance of machine translation systems.",
        "For example, in a review of commonly used features in automated translation, Mowatt (1999) reports that most of the machine translation systems surveyed made use of word subject domains.",
        "Word subject domains have also been used in information systems.",
        "For example, Sanfilippo (1998) describes a summarization system where subject domains provide users with useful conceptual parameters to tailor summary requests to a user’s interest.",
        "Successful usage of word domains in applications such as machine translation and summarization is strongly dependent on the ability to assign the appropriate subject domain to a word in its context.",
        "Such an assignment requires a process of Word Domain Disambiguation (WDD) because the same word can often be assigned different subject domains out of context (e.g. the word partner can potentially be related to FINANCE or MARRIAGE).",
        "Interestingly enough, word subject domains have been widely used to improve the performance of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms (Wilks and Stevenson 1998, Magnini et al.",
        "2001; Gliozzo et al.",
        "2004).",
        "However, comparatively little effort has been devoted so far to the word domain disambiguation itself.",
        "The most notable exceptions are the work of Magnini and Strapparava (2000) and Suarez & Palomar (2002).",
        "Both studies propose algorithms specific to the WDD task and have focused on the disambiguation of noun domains.",
        "In this paper we explore an alternative approach where word domain disambiguation is achieved via word sense disambiguation.",
        "Moreover, we extend the treatment of WDD to verbs and adjectives.",

        "(2006) to assign a WordNet sense to each noun, verb and adjective.",
        "The extension consisted in extending the training data set so as to include a selection of WordNet examples (full sentences containing a main verb) and the Open Mind Word Expert corpus (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002).",
        "The original hand-coded word sense annotations of the SemCor and Senseval3 corpora and the word sense annotations assigned by the WSD algorithm used in this study were mapped into subject domain annotations using WordNet Domains, as described in the opening paragraph of section 2 above.",
        "The version of the SemCor and Senseval3 corpora where subject domain annotations were generated from hand-coded word senses served as gold standard.",
        "A baseline for both corpora was obtained by assigning to each lemma the subject domain corresponding to sense 1 of the lemma.",
        "WDD results of a tenfold cross-validation for the SemCor data set are given in Table 2.",
        "Accuracy is high across nouns, verbs and adjectives.2 To verify the statistical significance of these results against the baseline, we used a standard proportions comparison test (see Fleiss 1981, p. 30).",
        "According to this test, the accuracy of our system is significantly better than the baseline.",
        "The high accuracy of our WDD algorithm is corroborated by the results for the Senseval3 data set in Table 3.",

        "A more accurate WSD model will in turn yield yet better WDD results, as demonstrated in this paper.",
