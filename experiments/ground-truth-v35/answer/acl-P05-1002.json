        "Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are probabilistic models for labelling sequential data.",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical models that define a conditional distribution over label sequences given an observation sequence.",
        "They allow the use of arbitrary, overlapping, non-independent features as a result of their global conditioning.",
        "This allows us to avoid making unwarranted independence assumptions over the observation sequence, such as those required by typical generative models.",
        "Efficient inference and training methods exist when the graphical structure of the model forms a chain, where each position in a sequence is connected to its adjacent positions.",
        "CRFs have been applied with impressive empirical results to the tasks of named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003), simplified part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Lafferty et al., 2001), noun phrase chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and extraction of tabular data (Pinto et al., 2003), among other tasks.",
        "CRFs are usually estimated using gradient-based methods such as limited memory variable metric (LMVM).",
        "However, even with these efficient methods, training can be slow.",
        "Consequently, most of the tasks to which CRFs have been applied are relatively small scale, having only a small number of training examples and small label sets.",
        "For much larger tasks, with hundreds of labels and millions of examples, current training methods prove intractable.",
        "Although training can potentially be parallelised and thus run more quickly on large clusters of computers, this in itself is not a solution to the problem: tasks can reasonably be expected to increase in size and complexity much faster than any increase in computing power.",
        "In order to provide scalability, the factors which most affect the resource usage and runtime of the training method",
        "must be addressed directly – ideally the dependence on the number of labels should be reduced.",
        "This paper presents an approach which enables CRFs to be used on larger tasks, with a significant reduction in the time and resources needed for training.",
        "This reduction does not come at the cost of performance – the results obtained on benchmark natural language problems compare favourably, and sometimes exceed, the results produced from regular CRF training.",
        "Error correcting output codes (ECOC) (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995) are used to train a community of CRFs on binary tasks, with each discriminating between a subset of the labels and its complement.",
        "Inference is performed by applying these ‘weak’ models to an unknown example, with each component model removing some ambiguity when predicting the label sequence.",
        "Given a sufficient number of binary models predicting suitably diverse label subsets, the label sequence can be inferred while being robust to a number of individual errors from the weak models.",
        "As each of these weak models are binary, individually they can be efficiently trained, even on large problems.",
        "The number of weak learners required to achieve good performance is shown to be relatively small on practical tasks, such that the overall complexity of error-correcting CRF training is found to be much less than that of regular CRF training methods.",
        "We have evaluated the error-correcting CRF on the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition (NER) task (Sang and Meulder, 2003), where we show that the method yields similar generalisation performance to standardly formulated CRFs, while requiring only a fraction of the resources, and no increase in training time.",
        "We have also shown how the error-correcting CRF scales when applied to the larger task of POS tagging the Penn Treebank and also the even larger task of simultaneously noun phrase chunking (NPC) and POS tagging using the CoNLL 2000 dataset (Sang and Buchholz, 2000)."

        "Standard training methods for CRFs suffer greatly from their dependency on the number of labels, making tasks with large label sets either difficult or impossible.",
        "As CRFs are deployed more widely to tasks with larger label sets this problem will become more evident.",
        "The current ‘solutions’ to these scaling problems – namely feature selection, and the use of large clusters – don’t address the heart of the problem: the dependence on the square of number of labels.",
        "Error-correcting CRF training allows CRFs to be applied to larger problems and those with larger label sets than were previously possible, without requiring computationally demanding methods such as feature selection.",
        "On standard tasks we have shown that error-correcting CRFs provide comparable or better performance than the standardly formulated CRF, while requiring less time and space to train.",
        "Only a small number of weak learners were required to obtain good performance on the tasks with large label sets, demonstrating that the method provides efficient scalability to the CRF framework.",
        "Error-correction codes could be applied to other sequence labelling methods, such as the voted perceptron (Roark et al., 2004).",
        "This may yield an increase in performance and efficiency of the method, as its runtime is also heavily dependent on the number of labels.",
        "We plan to apply error-correcting coding to dynamic CRFs, which should result in better modelling of naturally layered tasks, while increasing the efficiency and scalability of the method.",
        "We also plan to develop higher order CRFs, using error-correcting codes to curb the increase in complexity."
