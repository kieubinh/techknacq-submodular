        "Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001).",
        "In particular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly influenced research in NLP.",
        "Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time-consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise.",
        "Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.",
        "Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.",
        "Bur-gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.",
        "Also, lexical-semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.",
        "Some specialist topics are better covered in WORDNET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.",
        "Cia-ramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.",
        "By WORDNET 2.0, coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult.",
        "consistency when classifying similar words into categories.",
        "For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exosphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earth’s atmosphere.",
        "These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semi-automatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.",
        "Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to organise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.",
        "Cia-ramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET’s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.",
        "This paper describes an unsupervised approach to su-persense tagging that does not require annotated sentences.",
        "Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun.",
        "The supersenses of these synonyms are then combined to determine the supersense.",
        "This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1."

        "Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinctions within WORDNET.",

        "The names and descriptions of the noun lex-files are shown in Table 1.",
        "Some lex-files map directly to the top level nodes in the hierarchy, called unique beginners, while others are grouped together as hyponyms of a unique beginner (Fellbaum, 1998, page 30).",

        "Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.",
        "They suggest that supersense tagging is similar to named entity recognition, which also has a very small set of categories with similar granularity (e.g. location and person) for labelling predominantly unseen terms.",
        "Supersense tagging can provide automated or semi-automated assistance to lexicographers adding words to the WORDNET hierarchy.",
        "Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself.",
        "Clearly, this is the ultimate goal, to be able to insert new terms into lexical resources, extending the structure where necessary.",

        "By optimising the parameters on the 1.7.1 test set we can increase that to 64%, indicating that we have not excessively over-tuned on the 1.6 test set.",
        "Our results significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised.",

        "An alternative approach worth exploring is to create context vectors for the supersense categories themselves and compare these against the words.",
        "This has the advantage of producing a much smaller number of vectors to compare against.",
        "In the current system, we must compare a word against the entire vocabulary (over 500 000 headwords), which is much less efficient than a comparison against only 26 supersense context vectors.",
        "The question now becomes how to construct vectors of supersenses.",
        "The most obvious solution is to sum the context vectors across the words which have each supersense.",
        "However, our early experiments suggest that this produces extremely large vectors which do not match well against the much smaller vectors of each unseen word.",
        "Also, the same questions arise in the construction of these vectors.",
        "How are words with multiple supersenses handled?",
        "Our preliminary experiments suggest that only combining the vectors for unambiguous words produces the best results.",
        "One solution would be to take the intersection between vectors across words for each supersense (i.e. to find the common contexts that these words appear in).",
        "However, given the sparseness of the data this may not leave very large context vectors.",
        "A final solution would be to consider a large set of the canonical attributes (Curran and Moens, 2002a) to represent each supersense.",
        "Canonical attributes summarise the key contexts for each headword and are used to improve the efficiency of the similarity comparisons.",
        "There are a number of problems our system does not currently handle.",
        "Firstly, we do not include proper names in our similarity system which means that location entities can be very difficult to identify correctly (as the results demonstrate).",
        "Further, our similarity system does not currently incorporate multi-word terms.",
        "We overcome this by using the synonyms of the last word in the multi-word term.",
        "However, there are 174 multi-word terms (23%) in the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set which we could probably tag more accurately with synonyms for the whole multi-word term.",
        "Finally, we plan to implement a supervised machine learner to replace the fall-back method, which currently has an accuracy of 37% on the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set.",
        "We intend to extend our experiments beyond the Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) set to include previous and more recent versions of WORDNET to compare their difficulty, and also perform experiments over a range of corpus sizes to determine the impact of corpus size on the quality of results.",
        "We would like to move onto the more difficult task of insertion into the hierarchy itself and compare against the initial work by Widdows (2003) using latent semantic analysis.",
        "Here the issue of how to combine vectors is even more interesting since there is the additional structure of the WORDNET inheritance hierarchy and the small synonym sets that can be used for more fine-grained combination of vectors."

        "To classify a previously unseen common noun our approach extracts synonyms which vote using their supersenses in WORDNET 1.6.",
        "We have experimented with several parameters finding that the best configuration uses 50 extracted synonyms, filtered by frequency and number of contexts to increase their reliability.",
        "Each synonym votes for each of its supersenses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor.",
        "Using this approach we have significantly outperformed the supervised multi-class perceptron Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).",
        "This paper also demonstrates the use of a very efficient shallow NLP pipeline to process a massive corpus.",
        "Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag.",
        "This application of semantic similarity demonstrates that an unsupervised methods can outperform supervised methods for some NLP tasks if enough data is available."
