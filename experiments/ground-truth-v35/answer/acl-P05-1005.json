        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of determining the meaning of a word in a given context.",
        "This task has a long history in natural language processing, and is considered to be an intermediate task, success of which is considered to be important for other tasks such as Machine Translation, Language Understanding, and Information Retrieval.",
        "Despite a long history of attempts to solve WSD problem by empirical means, there is not any clear consensus on what it takes to build a high performance implementation of WSD.",
        "Algorithms based on Supervised Learning, in general, show better performance compared to unsupervised systems.",
        "But they suffer from a serious drawback: the difficulty of acquiring considerable amounts of training data, also known as knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "In the typical setting, supervised learning needs training data created for each and every polysemous word; Ng (1997) estimates an effort of 16 person-years for acquiring training data for 3,200 significant words in English.",
        "Mihalcea and Chklovski (2003) provide a similar estimate of an 80 person-year effort for creating manually labelled training data for about 20,000 words in a common English dictionary.",
        "Two basic approaches have been tried as solutions to the lack of training data, namely unsupervised systems and semi-supervised bootstrapping techniques.",
        "Unsupervised systems mostly work on knowledge-based techniques, exploiting sense knowledge encoded in machine-readable dictionary entries, taxonomical hierarchies such as WORD-NET (Fellbaum, 1998), and so on.",
        "Most of the bootstrapping techniques start from a few ‘seed’ labelled examples, classify some unlabelled instances using this knowledge, and iteratively expand their knowledge using information available within newly labelled data.",
        "Some others employ hierarchical relatives such as hypernyms and hyponyms.",
        "In this work, we present another practical alternative: we reduce the WSD problem to a one of finding generic semantic class of a given word instance.",
        "We show that learning such classes can help relieve the problem of knowledge acquisition bottleneck."

        "This can be done because the semantic classes are common to words unlike senses; for learning the properties of a given class, we can use the data from various words.",
        "For instance, the noun crane falls into two semantic classes ANIMAL and ARTEFACT.",
        "We can expect the words such as pelican and eagle (in the bird sense) to have similar usage patterns to those of ANIMAL sense of crane, and to provide common training examples for that particular class.",
        "For learning these classes, we can make use of any training example labelled with WORDNET senses for supervised WSD, as we describe in section 3.1.",
        "Once the classification is done for an instance, the resulting semantic classes can be transformed into finer grained senses using some heuristical mapping, as we show in the next sub section.",
        "This would not guarantee a perfect conversion because such a mapping can miss some finer senses, but as we show in what follows, this problem in itself does not prevent us from attaining good performance in a practical WSD setting."

        "As the general set of classes, we used WORDNET unique beginners, of which there are 25 for nouns, and 15 for verbs.",
        "To simulate this classifier on SENSEVAL English all-words tasks’ data (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004), we mapped the fine-grained senses from official answer keys to their respective beginners.",
        "There is an information loss in this mapping, because each unique beginner can typically include more than one sense.",
        "To see how this ‘classifier’ fares in a fine-grained task, we can map the ‘answers’ back to WORDNET fine-grained senses by picking up the sense with the lowest sense number that falls within each unique beginner.",
        "In principal, this is the most likely sense within the class, because WORDNET senses are said to be",
        "ordered in descending order of frequency.",
        "Since this sense is not necessarily the same as the original sense of the instance, the accuracy of the fine-grained answers will be below 100%.",
        "Figure 1 shows the performance of this transformed fine-grained classifier (CG) for nouns and verbs with SENSEVAL-2 and 3 English all words task data (marked as S2 and S3 respectively), along with the baseline WORDNET first sense (BL), and the best-performer classifiers at each SENSEVAL excercise (CL), SMUaw (Mihalcea, 2002) and GAMBL-AW (Decadt et al., 2004) respectively.",

        "Hence, we can use a generic data set that is large enough, where various words provide training examples for these concepts, instead of relying upon data from the examples of the same word that is being classified.",
        "Unfortunately, simply labelling each instance with its semantic class and then using standard supervised learning algorithms did not work well.",
        "This is probably because the effectiveness of the feature patterns often depend on the actual word being disambiguated and not just its semantic class.",
        "For example, the phrase ‘run the newspaper’ effectively indicates that ‘newspaper’ belongs to the semantic class GROUP.",
        "But ‘run the tape’ indicates that ‘tape’ belongs to the semantic class ARTEFACT.",
        "The collocation ‘run the’ is effective for indicating the GROUP sense only for ‘newspaper’ and closely related words such as ‘department’ or ‘school’.",
        "In this experiment, we use a k-nearest neighbor classifier.",
        "In order to allow training examples of different words from the same semantic class to effectively provide information for each other, we modify the distance between instances in a way that makes the distance between instances of similar words smaller.",
        "This is described in Section 3.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we discuss several related work.",
