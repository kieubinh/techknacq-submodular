        "Semantic compatibility is an important factor for pronoun resolution.",
        "Since pronouns, especially neutral pronouns, carry little semantics of their own, the compatibility between an anaphor and its antecedent candidate is commonly evaluated by examining the relationships between the candidate and the anaphor’s context, based on the statistics that the corresponding predicate-argument tuples occur in a particular large corpus.",
        "Consider the example given in the work of Dagan and Itai (1990):",
        "For anaphor iti, the candidate government should have higher semantic compatibility than money because governmentcollect is supposed to occur more frequently than money collect in a large corpus.",
        "A similar pattern could also be observed for it2.",
        "So far, the corpus-based semantic knowledge has been successfully employed in several anaphora resolution systems.",
        "Dagan and Itai (1990) proposed a heuristics-based approach to pronoun resolution.",
        "It determined the preference of candidates based on predicate-argument frequencies.",
        "Recently, Bean and Riloff (2004) presented an unsupervised approach to coreference resolution, which mined the co-referring NP pairs with similar predicate-arguments from a large corpus using a bootstrapping method.",
        "However, the utility of the corpus-based semantics for pronoun resolution is often argued.",
        "Kehler et al.",
        "(2004), for example, explored the usage of the corpus-based statistics in supervised learning based systems, and found that such information did not produce apparent improvement for the overall pronoun resolution.",
        "Indeed, existing learning-based approaches to anaphor resolution have performed reasonably well using limited and shallow knowledge (e.g., Mitkov (1998), Soon et al.",
        "(2001), Strube and Muller (2003)).",
        "Could the relatively noisy semantic knowledge give us further system improvement?",
        "In this paper we focus on improving pronominal anaphora resolution using automatically computed semantic compatibility information.",
        "We propose to enhance the utility of the statistics-based knowledge from two aspects: Statistics source.",
        "Corpus-based knowledge usually suffers from data sparseness problem.",
        "That is, many predicate-argument tuples would be unseen even in a large corpus.",
        "A possible solution is the",
        "web.",
        "It is believed that the size of the web is thousands of times larger than normal large corpora, and the counts obtained from the web are highly correlated with the counts from large balanced corpora for predicate-argument bi-grams (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "So far the web has been utilized in nominal anaphora resolution (Modjeska et al., 2003; Poesio et al., 2004) to determine the semantic relation between an anaphor and candidate pair.",
        "However, to our knowledge, using the web to help pronoun resolution still remains unexplored.",
        "Learning framework.",
        "Commonly, the predicate-argument statistics is incorporated into anaphora resolution systems as a feature.",
        "What kind of learning framework is suitable for this feature?",
        "Previous approaches to anaphora resolution adopt the single-candidate model, in which the resolution is done on an anaphor and one candidate at a time (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "However, as the purpose of the predicate-argument statistics is to evaluate the preference of the candidates in semantics, it is possible that the statistics-based semantic feature could be more effectively applied in the twin-candidate (Yang et al., 2003) that focusses on the preference relationships among candidates.",
        "In our work we explore the acquisition of the semantic compatibility information from the corpus and the web, and the incorporation of such semantic information in the single-candidate model and the twin-candidate model.",
        "We systematically evaluate the combinations of different statistics sources and learning frameworks in terms of their effectiveness in helping the resolution.",
        "Results on the MUC data set show that for neutral pronoun resolution in which an anaphor has no specific semantic category, the web-based semantic information would be the most effective when applied in the twin-candidate model: Not only could such a system significantly improve the baseline without the semantic feature, it also outperforms the system with the combination of the corpus and the single-candidate model (by 11.5% success).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the acquisition of the semantic compatibility information from the corpus and the web.",
        "Section 3 discusses the application of the statistics in the single-candidate and twin-candidate learning models.",
        "Section 4 gives the experimental results, and finally, Section 5 gives the conclusion."

        "We see that used in isolation, the semantic compatibility feature is able to achieve a success up to 61% around, just 4% lower than the best indicative feature FirstNP.",
        "In combination with other features, the performance could be improved by as large as 18% as opposed to being used alone.",
        "Figure 1 shows the top portion of the pruned decision tree for N-Pron resolution under the TC model.",
        "We could find that: (i) When comparing two candidates which occur in the same sentence as the anaphor, the web-based semantic feature would be examined in the first place, followed by the lexical property of the candidates.",
        "(ii) When two non-pronominal candidates are both in previous sentences before the anaphor, the web-based semantic feature is still required to be examined after FirstNP and ParaStruct.",

        "Our research focussed on improving pronoun resolution using the statistics-based semantic compatibility information.",
        "We explored two issues that affect the utility of the semantic information: statistics source and learning framework.",
        "Specifically, we proposed to utilize the web and the twin-candidate model, in addition to the common combination of the corpus and single-candidate model, to compute and apply the semantic information.",
        "Our experiments systematically evaluated different combinations of statistics sources and learning models.",
        "The results on the newswire domain showed that the web-based semantic compatibility could be the most effectively incorporated in the twin-candidate model for the neutral pronoun resolution.",
        "While the utility is not obvious for personal pronoun resolution, we can still see the improvement on the overall performance.",
        "We believe that the semantic information under such a configuration would be even more effective on technical domains where neutral pronouns take the majority in the pronominal anaphors.",
        "Our future work would have a deep exploration on such domains."
