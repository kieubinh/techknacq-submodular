        "The quality of an automatic summary can be established mainly with two approaches: Human assessments: The output of a number of summarisation systems is compared by human judges, using some set of evaluation guidelines.",
        "Proximity to a gold standard: The best automatic summary is the one that is closest to some reference summary made by humans.",
        "Using human assessments has some clear advantages: the results of the evaluation are interpretable, and we can trace what a system is doing well, and what is doing poorly.",
        "But it also has a couple of serious drawbacks: i) different human assessors reach different conclusions, and ii) the outcome of a comparative evaluation exercise is not directly reusable for new techniques, i.e., a summarisation strategy developed after the comparative exercise cannot be evaluated without additional human assessments made from scratch.",
        "Proximity to a gold standard, on the other hand, is a criterion that can be automated (see Section 6), with the advantages of i) being objective, and ii) once gold standard summaries are built for a comparative evaluation of systems, the resulting testbed can iteratively be used to refine text summarisation techniques and re-evaluate them automatically.",
        "This second approach, however, requires solving a number of non-trivial issues.",
        "For instance, (i) How can we know whether an evaluation metric is good enough for automatic evaluation?, (ii) different users produce different summaries, all of them equally good as gold standards, (iii) if we have several metrics which test different features of a summary, how can we combine them into an optimal test?, (iv) how do we know if our test bed",
        "is reliable, or the evaluation outcome may change by adding, for instance, additional gold standards?",
        "In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic framework, QARLA, that addresses such issues.",
        "Given a set of manual summaries and another set of baseline summaries per task, together with a set of similarity metrics, QARLA provides quantitative measures to (i) select and combine the best (independent) metrics (KING measure), (ii) apply the best set of metrics to evaluate automatic summaries (QUEEN measure), and (iii) test whether evaluating with that test-bed is reliable (JACK measure).",
        "2 Formal constraints on any evaluation framework based on similarity metrics We are looking for a framework to evaluate automatic summarisation systems objectively using similarity metrics to compare summaries.",
        "The input of the framework is:",
        "• A summarisation task (e.g. topic oriented, informative multi-document summarisation on a given domain/corpus).",
        "• A set T of test cases (e.g. topic/document set pairs for the example above) • A set of summaries M produced by humans (models), and a set of automatic summaries A (peers), for every test case.",
        "• A set X of similarity metrics to compare summaries.",
        "An evaluation framework should include, at least: • A measure QM,X (a) E [0, 1] that estimates the quality of an automatic summary a, using the similarity metrics in X to compare the summary with the models in M. With Q, we can compare the quality of automatic summaries.",
        "• A measure KM,A(X) E [0, 1] that estimates the suitability of a set of similarity metrics X for our evaluation purposes.",
        "With K, we can choose the best similarity metrics.",
        "Our main assumption is that all manual summaries are equally optimal and, while they are likely to be different, the best similarity metric is the one that identifies and uses the features that are common to all manual summaries, grouping and separating them from the automatic summaries.",
        "With these assumption in mind, it is useful to think of some formal restrictions that any evaluation framework Q, K must hold.",
        "We will consider the following ones (see illustrations in Figure 1): (1) Given two automatic summaries a, a' and a similarity measure x, if a is more distant to all manual summaries than a', then a cannot be better",
        "(2) A similarity metric x is better when it is able to group manual summaries more closely, while keeping them more distant from automatic summaries: (dm, m' E M.x(m, m') > x (m, m') A Vm E M, a E Ax(a, m) < x (a, m)) --+ Km,A(x) > KM,A(x ) (3) If x is a perfect similarity metric, the quality of a manual summary cannot be zero: Km,A(x) _ � `dm E M.QM,x (m) > 0 (4) The quality of a similarity metric or a summary should not be dependent on scale issues.",
        "In general, if x' = f (x) with f being a growing monotonic function, then KM A(x) = KM A(x') and QM,x (a) = QM,x, (a) .",
        "(5) The quality of a similarity metric should not be sensitive to repeated elements in A, i.e. KM,AU{a} (x) = KM,AU{a,a} (x).",
        "(6) A random metric x should have KM A(x) = 0.",
