        "Annotated corpora have at least two kinds of uses: firstly, as training material and as “gold standard” testing material for the development of tools in computational linguistics, and secondly, as a source of data for theoretical linguists searching for analytically relevant language patterns.",
        "Annotation errors and why they are a problem The high quality annotation present in “gold standard” corpora is generally the result of a manual or semi-automatic mark-up process.",
        "The annotation thus can contain annotation errors from automatic (pre-)processes, human post-editing, or human annotation.",
        "The presence of errors creates problems for both computational and theoretical linguistic uses, from unreliable training and evaluation of natural language processing technology (e.g., van Halteren, 2000; Kvˇetˇon and Oliva, 2002, and the work mentioned below) to low precision and recall of queries for already rare linguistic phenomena.",
        "Investigating the quality of linguistic annotation and improving it where possible thus is a key issue for the use of annotated corpora in computational and theoretical linguistics.",
        "Illustrating the negative impact of annotation errors on computational uses of annotated corpora, van Halteren et al.",
        "(2001) compare taggers trained and tested on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ, Marcus et al., 1993) and the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB, Johansson,1986) corpora and find that the results for the WSJ perform significantly worse.",
        "They report that the lower accuracy figures are caused by inconsistencies in the WSJ annotation and that 44% of the errors for their best tagging system were caused by “inconsistently handled cases.” Turning from training to evaluation, Padro and Marquez (1998) highlight the fact that the true accuracy of a classifier could be much better or worse than reported, depending on the error rate of the corpus used for the evaluation.",
        "Evaluating two taggers on the WSJ, they find tagging accuracy rates for am",
        "biguous words of 91.35% and 92.82%.",
        "Given the estimated 3% error rate of the WSJ tagging (Marcus et al., 1993), they argue that the difference in performance is not sufficient to establish which of the two taggers is actually better.",
        "In sum, corpus annotation errors, especially errors which are inconsistencies, can have a profound impact on the quality of the trained classifiers and the evaluation of their performance.",
        "The problem is compounded for syntactic annotation, given the difficulty of evaluating and comparing syntactic structure assignments, as known from the literature on parser evaluation (e.g., Carroll et al., 2002).",
        "The idea that variation in annotation can indicate annotation errors has been explored to detect errors in part-of-speech (POS) annotation (van Halteren, 2000; Eskin, 2000; Dickinson and Meurers, 2003a) and syntactic annotation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003b).",
        "But, as far as we are aware, the research we report on here is the first approach to error detection for the increasing number of annotations which make use of more general graph structures for the syntactic annotation of free word order languages or the annotation of semantic and discourse properties."

        "For languages with relatively free constituent order, such as German, Dutch, or the Slavic languages, the combinatorial potential of the language encoded in constituency cannot be mapped straightforwardly onto the word order possibilities of those languages.",
        "As a consequence, the treebanks that have been created for German (NEGRA, Skut et al., 1997; VERBMOBIL, Hinrichs et al., 2000; TIGER, Brants et al., 2002) have relaxed the requirement that constituents have to be contiguous.",
        "This makes it possible to syntactically annotate the language data as such, i.e., without requiring postulation of empty elements as placeholders or other theoretically motivated changes to the data.",

        "In addition to their use in syntactic annotation, discontinuous structural annotation is also relevant for semantic and discourse-level annotation – essentially any time that graph structures are needed to encode relations that go beyond ordinary tree structures.",

        "The first heuristic encodes the basic fact that the label assignment for a nucleus is dependent on the context: variation nuclei in long n-grams are likely to be errors.",
