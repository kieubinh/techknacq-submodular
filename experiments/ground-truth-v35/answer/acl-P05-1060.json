        "Much recent statistical information extraction research has applied graphical models to extract information from one particular document after training on a large corpus of annotated data (Leek, 1997; Freitag and McCallum, 1999).1 Such systems are widely applicable, yet there remain many information extraction tasks that are not readily amenable to these methods.",
        "Annotated data required for training statistical extraction systems is sometimes unavailable, while there are examples of the desired information.",
        "Further, the goal may be to find a few interrelated pieces of information that are stated multiple times in a set of documents.",
        "Here, we investigate one task that meets the above criteria.",
        "Given the name of a celebrity such as 1Alternatively, Riloff(1996) trains on in-domain and out-of-domain texts and then has a human filtering step.",
        "Huffman (1995) proposes a method to train a different type of extraction system by example.",
        "“Frank Zappa”, our goal is to extract a set of biographic facts (e.g., birthdate, birth place and occupation) about that person from documents on the Web.",
        "First, we describe a general method of automatic annotation for training from positive and negative examples and use the method to train Rote, Na¨ıve Bayes, and Conditional Random Field models (Section 2).",
        "We then examine how multiple extractions can be combined to form one consensus answer (Section 3).",
        "We compare fusion methods and show that frequency voting outperforms the single highest confidence answer by an average of 11% across the various extractors.",
        "Increasing the number of retrieved documents boosts the overall system accuracy as additional documents which mention the individual in question lead to higher recall.",
        "This improved recall more than compensates for a loss in per-extraction precision from these additional documents.",
        "Next, we present a method for cross-field bootstrapping (Section 4) which improves per-field accuracy by 7%.",
        "We demonstrate that a small training set with only the most relevant documents can be as effective as a larger training set with additional, less relevant documents (Section 5)."

        "Typically, statistical extraction systems (such as HMMs and CRFs) are trained using hand-annotated data.",
        "Annotating the necessary data by hand is time-consuming and brittle, since it may require large-scale re-annotation when the annotation scheme changes.",
        "For the special case of Rote extractors, a more attractive alternative has been proposed by Brin (1998), Agichtein and Gravano (2000), and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).",
        "Essentially, for any text snippet of the form A1pA2gA3, these systems estimate the probability that a relationship r(p, q) holds between entities p and q, given the interstitial context, as2",

        "For each hook, download a separate set of relevant documents (a hook corpus, Dx) from the Web.",
        "4 Then for any particular pattern A2 and an element x, count how often the pattern xA2 predicts y and how often it retrieves a spurious 9.5 This annotation method extends to training other statistical models with positive examples, for example a Na¨ıve Bayes (NB) unigram model.",
        "In this model, instead of looking for an exact A2 pattern as above, each individual word in the pattern A2 is used to predict the presence of a relationship.",
        "We perform add-lambda smoothing for out-of-vocabulary words and thus assign a positive probability to any sequence.",
        "As before, a set of relevant",
        "documents is downloaded for each particular hook.",
        "Then every hook and target is annotated.",
        "From that markup, we can pick out the interstitial A2 patterns and calculate the necessary probabilities.",
        "Since the NB model assigns a positive probability to every sequence, we need to pick out likely targets from those proposed by the NB extractor.",
        "We construct a background model which is a basic un-igram language model, P(A2) = MCA,, P(a).",
        "We then pick targets chosen by the confidence estimate",
        "However, this confidence estimate does not work-well in our dataset.",
        "We propose to use negative examples to estimate P(A2 I r(p, q))6 as well as P(A2 I r(p, q)).",
        "For each relationship, we define the target set Er to be all potential targets and model it using regular expressions.7 In training, for each relationship r(p, q), we markup the hook p, the target q, and all spurious targets (q E {Er – q}) which provide negative examples.",
        "Targets can then be chosen with the following confidence estimate",
        "We call this NB+E in the following experiments.",
        "The above process describes a general method for automatically annotating a corpus with positive and negative examples, and this corpus can be used to train statistical models that rely on annotated data.8 In this paper, we test automatic annotation using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) which have achieved high performance for information extraction.",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical models that estimate the conditional probability of a state sequence given an output sequence",
        "We use the Mallet system (McCallum, 2002) for training and evaluation of the CRFs.",
        "In order to examine the improvement by using negative examples, we train CRFs with two topologies (Figure 1).",

        "An example of the data can be found in Table 1.",
        "In our system, we normalized birthdays, and performed capitalization normalization for the remaining fields.",
        "We did no further normalization, such as normalizing state names to their two letter acronyms (e.g., California – * CA).",
        "Fifteen names were set aside as training data, and the rest were used for testing.",
        "For each name, 150 documents were downloaded from Google to serve as the hook corpus for either training or testing.9 In training, we automatically annotated documents using people in the training set as hooks, and in testing, tried to get targets that exactly matched what was present in the database.",
        "This is a very strict method of evaluation for three reasons.",
        "First, since the facts were automatically collected, they contain",
        "errors and thus the system is tested against wrong answers.10 Second, the extractors might have retrieved information that was simply not present in the database but nevertheless correct (e.g., some-one’s occupation might be listed as writer and the retrieved occupation might be novelist).",
        "Third, since the retrieved targets were not normalized, there system may have retrieved targets that were correct but were not recognized (e.g., the database birthplace is New York, and the system retrieves NY).",
        "In testing, we rejected candidate targets that were not present in our target set models Er.",
        "In some cases, this resulted in the system being unable to find the correct target for a particular relationship, since it was not in the target set.",
        "Before fusion (Section 3), we gathered all the facts extracted by the system and graded them in isolation.",
        "We present the per-extraction precision",
        "We also present the pseudo-recall, which is the average number of times per person a correct target was extracted.",

        "The data show that on average the Rote method has the best precision, 10 These deficiencies in testing also have implications for training, since the models will be trained on annotated data that has errors.",
        "The phenomenon of missing and inaccurate data was most prevalent for occupation and birthplace relationships, though it was observed for other relationships as well.",
        "11It is insufficient to count all text matches as instances that the system should extract.",

        "The data in Figure 2 suggest that there is a gradual drop in extraction precision throughout the corpus, which may be caused by the fact that documents further down the retrieved list are less relevant, and therefore less likely to contain the relevant biographic data.",
