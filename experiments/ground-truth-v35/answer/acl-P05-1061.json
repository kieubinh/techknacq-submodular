        "Most research on text information extraction (IE) has focused on accurate tagging of named entities.",
        "Successful early named-entity taggers were based on finite-state generative models (Bikel et al., 1999).",
        "More recently, discriminatively-trained models have been shown to be more accurate than generative models (McCallum et al., 2000; Lafferty et al., 2001; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).",
        "Both kinds of models have been developed for tagging entities such as people, places and organizations in news material.",
        "However, the rapid development of bioinformatics has recently generated interest on the extraction of biological entities such as genes (Collier et al., 2000) and genomic variations (McDonald et al., 2004b) from biomedical literature.",
        "The next logical step for IE is to begin to develop methods for extracting meaningful relations involving named entities.",
        "Such relations would be extremely useful in applications like question answering, automatic database generation, and intelligent document searching and indexing.",
        "Though not as well studied as entity extraction, relation extraction has still seen a significant amount of work.",
        "We discuss some previous approaches at greater length in Section 2.",
        "Most relation extraction systems focus on the specific problem of extracting binary relations, such as the employee of relation or protein-protein interaction relation.",
        "Very little work has been done in recognizing and extracting more complex relations.",
        "We define a complex relation as any nary relation among n typed entities.",
        "The relation is defined by the schema (t1, ... , tn) where ti E T are entity types.",
        "An instance (or tuple) in the relation is a list of entities (el, ... , en) such that either type(ei) = ti, or ei =1 indicating that the ith element of the tuple is missing.",
        "For example, assume that the entity types are T = {person, job, company} and we are interested in the ternary relation with schema (person, job, company) that relates a person to their job at a particular company.",
        "For the sentence “John Smith is the CEO at Inc. Corp.”, the system would ideally extract the tuple (John Smith, CEO, Inc. Corp.).",
        "However, for the sentence “Everyday John Smith goes to his office at Inc. Corp.”, the system would extract (John Smith, 1, Inc. Corp.), since there is no mention of a job title.",
        "Hence, the goal of complex relation extraction is to identify all instances of the relation of interest in some piece of text, including",
        "incomplete instances.",
        "We present here several simple methods for extracting complex relations.",
        "All the methods start by recognized pairs of entity mentions, that is, binary relation instances, that appear to be arguments of the relation of interest.",
        "Those pairs can be seen as the edges of a graph with entity mentions as nodes.",
        "The algorithms then try to reconstruct complex relations by making tuples from selected maximal cliques in the graph.",
        "The methods are general and can be applied to any complex relation fitting the above definition.",
        "We also assume throughout the paper that the entities and their type are known a priori in the text.",
        "This is a fair assumption given the current high standard of state-of-the-art named-entity extractors.",
        "A primary advantage of factoring complex relations into binary relations is that it allows the use of standard classification algorithms to decide whether particular pairs of entity mentions are related.",
        "In addition, the factoring makes training data less sparse and reduces the computational cost of extraction.",
        "We will discuss these benefits further in Section 4.",
        "We evaluated the methods on a large set of annotated biomedical documents to extract relations related to genomic variations, demonstrating a considerable improvement over a reasonable baseline."

        "Instances are represented by a pair of entities and their position in a shallow parse tree for the containing sentence.",
        "Classification is done by a support-vector classifier with a specialized kernel for that shallow parse representation.",
        "This approach – enumerating all possible entity pairs and classifying each as positive or negative – is the standard method in relation extraction.",
        "The main differences among systems are the choice of trainable classifier and the representation for instances.",
        "For binary relations, this approach is quite tractable: if the relation schema is (ti, t2), the number of potential instances is O (I t i I Jt2 ), where Itlis the number of entity mentions of type t in the text under consideration.",
        "One interesting system that does not belong to the above class is that of Miller et al.",

        "However, it can be argued that this method will encounter problems when considering anything but binary relations.",
        "Complex relations would require a large amount of tree augmentation and most likely result in extremely sparse probability estimates.",
        "Furthermore, by integrating relation extraction with parsing, the system cannot consider long-range dependencies due to the local parsing constraints of current probabilistic parsers.",
        "The higher the arity of a relation, the more likely it is that entities will be spread out within a piece of text, making long range dependencies especially important.",

        "always associated with a verb in the sentence that specifies the relation type.",

        "Most relation extraction systems work primarily on a sentential level and never consider relations that cross sentences or paragraphs.",

        "We presented a method for complex relation extraction, the core of which was to factorize complex relations into sets of binary relations, learn to identify binary relations and then reconstruct the complex relations by finding maximal cliques in graphs that represent relations between pairs of entities.",
        "The primary advantage of this method is that it allows for the use of almost any binary relation classifier, which have been well studied and are often accurate.",
        "We showed that such a method can be successful with an empirical evaluation on a large set of biomedical data annotated with genomic variation relations.",
        "In fact, this approach is both significantly quicker and more accurate then enumerating and classifying all possible instances.",
        "We believe this work provides a good starting point for continued research in this area.",
        "A distinction may be made between the factored system presented here and one that attempts to classify complex relations without factorization.",
        "This is related to the distinction between methods that learn local classifiers that are combined with global constraints after training and methods that incorporate the global constraints into the learning process.",
        "McCallum and Wellner (2003) showed that learning binary co-reference relations globally improves performance over learning relations in isolation.",
        "However, their model relied on the transitive property inherent in the co-reference relation.",
        "Our system can be seen as an instance of a local learner.",
        "Punyakanok",
        "et al. (2004) argued that local learning actually outperforms global learning in cases when local decisions can easily be learnt by the classifier.",
        "Hence, it is reasonable to assume that our binary factorization method will perform well when binary relations can be learnt with high accuracy.",
        "As for future work, there are many things that we plan to look at.",
        "The binary relation classifier we employ is quite simplistic and most likely can be improved by using features over a deeper representation of the data such as parse trees.",
        "Other more powerful binary classifiers should be tried such as those based on tree kernels (Zelenko et al., 2003).",
        "We also plan on running these algorithms on more data sets to test if the algorithms empirically generalize to different domains.",
        "Perhaps the most interesting open problem is how to learn the complex reconstruction phase.",
        "One possibility is recent work on supervised clustering.",
        "Letting the edge probabilities in the graphs represent a distance in some space, it may be possible to learn how to cluster vertices into relational groups.",
        "However, since a vertex/entity can participate in one or more relation, any clustering algorithm would be required to produce non-disjoint clusters.",
        "We mentioned earlier that the only restriction of our complex relation definition is that the arity of the relation must be known in advance.",
        "It turns out that the algorithms we described can actually handle dynamic arity relations.",
        "All that is required is to remove the constraint that maximal cliques must be consistent with the structure of the relation.",
        "This represents another advantage of binary factorization over enumeration, since it would be infeasible to enumerate all possible instances for dynamic arity relations."
