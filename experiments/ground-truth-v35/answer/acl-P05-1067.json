        "In reality, pure statistical systems sometimes suffer from ungrammatical outputs, which are understandable at the phrasal level but sometimes hard to comprehend as a coherent sentence.",
        "In recent years, syntax-based statistical machine translation, which aims at applying statistical models to structural data, has begun to emerge.",
        "With the research advances in natural language parsing, especially the broad-coverage parsers trained from treebanks, for example (Collins, 1999), the utilization of structural analysis of different languages has been made possible.",
        "Ideally, by combining the natural language syntax and machine learning methods, a broad-coverage and linguistically well-motivated statistical MT system can be constructed.",
        "However, structural divergences between languages (Dorr, 1994), which are due to either systematic differences between languages or loose translations in real corpora, pose a major challenge to syntax-based statistical MT.",

        "The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with 0(n3) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "It can be expected that the total decoding time for SDIG can be as short as 0.1 second per sentence.",
        "Neither of the two systems has any specific translation components, which are usually present in real world systems (E.g. components that translate numbers, dates, names, etc.)",
        "It is reasonable to expect that the performance of SDIG can be further improved with such specific optimizations."

        "We noticed that the SDIG system outputs tend to be longer than those of the IBM Model 4 system, and are closer to human translations in length.",
        "This partly explains why the IBM Model 4 system has slightly higher individual n-gram precision scores (while the SDIG system outputs are still better in terms of absolute matches).",
        "The relative orders between the parent and child ETs in the output tree is currently kept the same as the orders in the input tree.",
        "Admittedly, we benefited from the fact that both Chinese and English are SVO languages, and that many of orderings between the arguments and adjuncts can be kept the same.",
        "However, we did notice that this simple “ostrich” treatment caused outputs such as “foreign financial institutions the president of”.",
        "While statistical modeling of children reordering is one possible remedy for this problem, we believe simple linguistic treatment is another, as the output of the SDIG system is an English dependency tree rather than a string of words."

        "A graphical model for the transducer is defined and a polynomial time decoding algorithm is introduced.",
        "The results of our current implementation were evaluated using the NIST and Bleu automatic MT evaluation software.",

        "Future work includes a full-fledged version of SDIG and a more sophisticated MT pipeline with possibly a trigram language model for decoding."
