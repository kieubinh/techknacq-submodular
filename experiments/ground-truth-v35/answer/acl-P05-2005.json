        "Given the usefulness of Named Entities (NEs) in many natural language processing tasks, there has been a lot of work aimed at developing accurate named entity extractors (Borthwick, 1999; Velardi et al., 2001; Ar´evalo et al., 2002; Zhou and Su, 2002; Florian, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003).",
        "Most approaches however, have very low portability, they are designed to perform well over a particular collection or type of document, and their accuracies will drop considerably when used in different domains.",
        "The reason for this is that many NE extractor systems rely heavily on complex linguistic resources, which are typically hand coded, for example regular expressions, grammars, gazetteers and the like.",
        "Adapting a system of this nature to a different collection or language requires a lot of human effort, involving tasks such as rewriting the grammars, acquiring new dictionaries, searching trigger words, and so on.",
        "Even if one has the human resources and the time needed for the adaptation process, there are languages that lack the linguistic resources needed, for instance, dictionaries are available in electronic form for only a handful of languages.",
        "We believe that, by using machine learning techniques, we can adapt an existing hand coded system to different domains and languages with little human effort.",
        "Our goal is to present a method that will facilitate the task of increasing the coverage of named entity extractor systems.",
        "In this setting, we assume that we have available an NE extractor system for Spanish, and we want to adapt it so that it can perform NER accurately in documents from a different language, namely Portuguese.",
        "It is important to emphasize here that we try to avoid the use of complex and costly linguistic tools or techniques, besides the existing NER system, given the language restrictions they pose.",
        "Although, we do need a corpus of the target language.",
        "However, we consider the task of gathering a corpus much easier and faster than that of developing linguistic tools such as parsers, part-of-speech taggers, grammars and the like.",
        "In the next section we present some recent work related to NER.",
        "Section 3 describes the data sets used in our experiments.",
        "Section 4 introduces our approach to NER, and we conclude in Section 5 giving a brief discussion of our findings and proposing research lines for future work."

        "(Bikel et al., 1997) and (Bikel et al., 1999) are other examples of the use of HMMs.",
        "Previous methods for increasing the coverage of hand coded systems include that of Borthwick, he used a maximum entropy approach where he combined the output of three hand coded systems with dictionaries and other orthographic information (Borthwick, 1999).",

        "Our work follows Carreras et al.",
        "approach, but differs in that we apply directly the NER system for Spanish to Portuguese and train a classifier using the output and the real classes.",
        "In (Petasis et al., 2000) a new method for automating the task of extending a proper noun dictionary is presented.",
        "The method combines two learning approaches: an inductive decision-tree classifier and unsupervised probabilistic learning of syntactic and semantic context.",
        "The attributes selected for the experiments include POS tags as well as morphological information whenever available.",
        "One work focused on NE recognition for Spanish is based on discriminating among different kinds of named entities: core NEs, which contain a trigger word as nucleus, syntactically simple weak NEs, formed by single noun phrases, and syntactically complex named entities, comprised of complex noun phrases.",
        "Ar´evalo and colleagues focused on the first two kinds of NEs (Ar´evalo et al., 2002).",
        "The method is a sequence of processes that uses simple attributes combined with external information provided by gazetteers and lists of trigger words.",
        "A context free grammar, manually coded, is used for recognizing syntactic patterns."
