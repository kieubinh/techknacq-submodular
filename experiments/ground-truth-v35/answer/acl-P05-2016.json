        "The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to develop mathematical models of the translation process whose parameters can be automatically estimated from a parallel corpus.",
        "Given a string of foreign words F, we seek to find the English string E which is a “correct” translation of the foreign string.",
        "The first work on SMT done at IBM (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1994), used a noisy-channel model, resulting in what Brown et al.",
        "(1993) call “the Fundamental Equation of Machine Translation”:",
        "In this equation we see that the translation problem is factored into two subproblems.",
        "P(E) is the language model and P(F I E) is the translation model.",
        "The work described here focuses on developing improvements to the translation model.",
        "While the IBM work was groundbreaking, it was also deficient in several ways.",
        "Their model translates words in isolation, and the component which accounts for word order differences between languages is based on linear position in the sentence.",
        "Conspicuously absent is all but the most elementary use of syntactic information.",
        "Several researchers have subsequently formulated models which incorporate the intuition that syntactically close constituents tend to stay close across languages.",
        "Below are descriptions of some of these different methods of integrating syntax.",
        "• Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars (Wu and Wong, 1998): This formalism uses a grammar for English and from it derives a possible grammar for the foreign language.",
        "This derivation includes adding productions where the order of the RHS is reversed from the ordering of the English.",
        "• Syntax-based Statistical Translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001): This model extends the above by allowing all possible permutations of the RHS of the English rules.",
        "• Statistical Phrase-based Translation (Koehn et al., 2003): Here “phrase-based” means “subsequence-based”, as there is no guarantee that the phrases learned by the model will have any relation to what we would think of as syntactic phrases.",
        "• Dependency-based Translation (ˇCmejrek et al., 2003): This model assumes a dependency parser for the foreign language.",
        "The syntactic structure and labels are preserved during translation.",
        "Transfer is purely lexical.",
        "A generator builds an English sentence out of the structure, labels, and translated words."

        "The Czech translations of these articles are provided as part of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (B¨ohmov´a et al., 2001).",
        "In order to learn the parameters for our model, we must first create aligned dependency structures for the sentence pairs in our corpus.",
        "This process begins with the building of dependency structures.",
        "Since Czech is a highly inflected language, morphological tagging is extremely helpful for downstream processing.",
        "We generate the tags using the system described in (Hajiˇc and Hladk´a, 1998).",
        "The tagged sentences are parsed by the Charniak parser, this time trained on Czech data from the PDT.",
        "The resulting phrase structures are converted to tec-togrammatical dependency structures via the procedure documented in (B¨ohmov´a, 2001).",
        "Under this formalism, function words are deleted and any information contained in them is preserved in features attached to the remaining nodes.",
        "Finally, functors (such as agent or patient) are automatically assigned to nodes in the tree (ˇZabokrtsk´y et al., 2002).",
        "On the English side, the process is simpler.",
        "We",
        "parse with the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) and convert the resulting phrase-structure trees to a function-argument formalism, which, like the tec-togrammatic formalism, removes function words.",
