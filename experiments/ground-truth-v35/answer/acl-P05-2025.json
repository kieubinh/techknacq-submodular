        "A name assigned to an entity is often thought to be a unique identifier.",
        "However this is not always true.",
        "We frequently come across multiple people sharing the same name, or cities and towns that have identical names.",
        "For example, the top ten results for a Google search of John Gilbert return six different individuals: A famous actor from the silent film era, a British painter, a professor of Computer Science, etc.",
        "Name ambiguity is relatively common, and makes searching for people, places, or organizations potentially very confusing.",
        "However, in many cases a human can distinguish between the underlying entities associated with an ambiguous name with the help of surrounding context.",
        "For example, a human can easily recognize that a document that mentions Silent Era, Silver Screen, and The Big Parade refers to John Gilbert the actor, and not the professor.",
        "Thus the neighborhood of the ambiguous name reveals distinguishing features about the underlying entity.",
        "Our approach is based on unsupervised learning from raw text, adapting methods originally proposed by (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).",
        "We do not utilize any manually created examples, knowledge bases, dictionaries, or ontologies in formulating our solution.",
        "Our goal is to discriminate among multiple contexts that mention a particular name strictly on the basis of the surrounding contents, and assign meaningful labels to the resulting clusters that identify the underlying entity.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we review related work in name discrimination and cluster labeling.",
        "Next we describe our methodology step-by-step and then review our experimental data and results.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of our results and outline our plans for future work."

        "Each cell contains the value of the log-likelihood ratio for its respective row and column word-pair.",
        "This matrix is both large and sparse, so we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality and smooth the sparsity.",
        "SVD has the effect of compressing similar columns together, and then reorganizing the matrix so that the most significant of these columns come first in the matrix.",
        "This allows the matrix to be represented more compactly by a smaller number of these compressed columns.",
        "The matrix is reduced by a factor equal to the minimum of 10% of the original columns, or 300.",
        "If the original number of columns is less than 3,000 then the matrix is reduced to 10% of the number of columns.",
        "If the matrix has greater than 3,000 columns, then it is reduced to 300.",
        "Each row in the resulting matrix is a vector for the word the row represents.",
        "For the second order representation, each context in the test data is represented by a vector which is created by averaging the word vectors for all the words in the context.",
        "The philosophy behind the second order representation is that it captures indirect relationships between bigrams which cannot be done using the",
        "first order representation.",
        "For example if the word ergonomics occurs along with science, and workplace occurs with science, but not with ergonomics, then workplace and ergonomics are second order co-occurrences by virtue of their respective co-occurrences with science.",

        "For words there is always a debate as to what constitutes a word sense, and how finely drawn a sense distinction should be made.",
        "However, when given an ambiguous name there are distinct underlying entities associated with that name, so evaluation relative to such true categories is realistic.",

        "This corresponds to the findings of (Pedersen et.al., 2005).",
        "The words closest to the target name are most likely to contain identifying information, whereas those that are further away may be more likely to introduce noise.",
        "As the amount and the number of contexts to be clustered (and to be used for feature identification) increases, the order 1 context representation performs better.",
        "This is because in the larger samples of data it is more likely to find an exact match for a feature and thereby achieve overall better results.",
        "We believe that this is why the order 1 results are generally better for the 3-way and 4-way distinctions, as opposed to the 2-way distinctions.",
        "This observation is consistent with earlier findings by Purandare and Pedersen for general English text.",
        "An example of a 2-way clustering is shown in Table 2, where Cluster 0 is assigned to Tony Blair, and Cluster 1 is for Bill Clinton.",
        "In this case the precision is 89.60 ((1629/1818)*100), whereas the recall is 85.69 ((1629/1818+83)*100).",
        "This suggests that there were 83 contexts that the clustering algorithm was unable to assign, and so they were not clustered and removed from the results.",
        "Table 3 shows the contingency matrix for a 3 way ambiguity.",
        "The distribution of contexts in cluster 0 show that the single predominant sense in the cluster is Bill Clinton, but for cluster 1 though the number of contexts indicate clear demarcation between BClinton and TBlair, this distinction gets less clear between TBlair and EBarak.",
        "This suggests that perhaps the level of details in the New York Times regarding Bill Clinton and his activities may have been greater than that for the two non-US leaders, although we will continue to analyze results of this nature.",
        "We can see from the labeling results shown in Table 4 that clustering performance affects the quality of cluster labels.",
