        "Pronoun resolution is the task of finding the correct antecedent for a given pronominal anaphor in a document.",
        "Prior studies have suggested that syntactic knowledge plays an important role in pronoun resolution.",
        "For a practical pronoun resolution system, the syntactic knowledge usually comes from the parse trees of the text.",
        "The issue that arises is how to effectively incorporate the syntactic information embedded in the parse trees to help resolution.",
        "One common solution seen in previous work is to define a set of features that represent particular syntactic knowledge, such as the grammatical role of the antecedent candidates, the governing relations between the candidate and the pronoun, and so on.",
        "These features are calculated by mining the parse trees, and then could be used for resolution by using manually designed rules (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Mitkov, 1998), or using machine-learning methods (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yang et al., 2004; Luo and Zitouni, 2005).",
        "However, such a solution has its limitation.",
        "The syntactic features have to be selected and defined manually, usually by linguistic intuition.",
        "Unfortunately, what kinds of syntactic information are effective for pronoun resolution still remains an open question in this research community.",
        "The heuristically selected feature set may be insufficient to represent all the information necessary for pronoun resolution contained in the parse trees.",
        "In this paper we will explore how to utilize the syntactic parse trees to help learning-based pronoun resolution.",
        "Specifically, we directly utilize the parse trees as a structured feature, and then use a kernel-based method to automatically mine the knowledge embedded in the parse trees.",
        "The structured syntactic feature, together with other normal features, is incorporated in a trainable model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) to learn the decision classifier for resolution.",
        "Indeed, using kernel methods to mine structural knowledge has shown success in some NLP applications like parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2004) and relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhao and Grishman, 2005).",
        "However, to our knowledge, the application of such a technique to the pronoun resolution task still remains unexplored.",
        "Compared with previous work, our approach has several advantages: (1) The approach utilizes the parse trees as a structured feature, which avoids the efforts of decoding the parse trees into a set of syntactic features in a heuristic manner.",
        "(2) The approach is able to put together the structured feature and the normal flat features in a trainable model, which allows different types of",
        "information to be considered in combination for both learning and resolution.",
        "(3) The approach is applicable for practical pronoun resolution as the syntactic information can be automatically obtained from machine-generated parse trees.",
        "And our study shows that the approach works well under the commonly available parsers.",
        "We evaluate our approach on the ACE data set.",
        "The experimental results over the different domains indicate that the structured syntactic feature incorporated with kernels can significantly improve the resolution performance (by 5%-8% in the success rates), and is reliably effective for the pronoun resolution task.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives some related work that utilizes the structured syntactic knowledge to do pronoun resolution.",
        "Section 3 introduces the framework for the pronoun resolution, as well as the baseline feature space and the SVM classifier.",
        "Section 4 presents in detail the structured feature and the kernel functions to incorporate such a feature in the resolution.",

        "The purpose of this paper is to explore how to make use of the structured syntactic knowledge to do pronoun resolution.",
        "Traditionally, syntactic information from parse trees is represented as a set of flat features.",
        "However, the features are usually selected and defined by heuristics and may not necessarily capture all the syntactic information provided by the parse trees.",
        "In the paper, we propose a kernel-based method to incorporate the information from parse trees.",
        "Specifically, we directly utilize the syntactic parse tree as a structured feature, and then apply kernels to such a feature, together with other normal features, to learn the decision classifier and do the resolution.",
        "Our experimental results on ACE data set show that the system with the structured feature included can achieve significant increase in the success rate by around 5%-8%, for all the different domains.",
        "The deeper analysis on various factors like training size, feature set or parsers further proves that the structured feature incorporated with our kernel-based method is reliably effective for the pronoun resolution task."
