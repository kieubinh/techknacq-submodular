        "Since then, most machine learning methods have been applied to WSD, including decision tree, Bayesian model, neural network, SVM, maximum entropy, genetic algorithms, and so on.",
        "For different learning methods, supervised methods usually achieve good performance at a cost of human tagging of training corpus.",
        "The precision improves with larger size of training corpus.",
        "Compared with supervised methods, unsupervised methods do not require tagged corpus, but the precision is usually lower than that of the supervised methods.",
        "Thus, knowledge acquisition is critical to WSD methods.",
        "This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on equivalent pseudowords, which acquires WSD knowledge from raw corpus.",
        "This method first determines equivalent pseudowords for each ambiguous word, and then uses the equivalent pseudowords to replace the ambiguous word in the corpus.",
        "The advantage of this method is that it does not need parallel corpus or seed corpus for training.",
        "Thus, it can use a large-scale monolingual corpus for training to solve the data-sparseness problem.",
