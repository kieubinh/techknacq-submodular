        "As natural language understanding research advances towards deeper knowledge modeling, the tasks become more and more complex: we are interested in more nuanced word characteristics, more linguistic properties, deeper semantic and syntactic features.",
        "One such example, explored in this article, is the mention detection and recognition task in the Automatic Content Extraction project, with the goal of identifying named, nominal or pronominal references to real-world entities – mentions – and labeling them with three types of information: entity type, entity subtype and mention type.",
        "In this article, we investigate three methods of assigning these related tags and compare them on several data sets.",

        "Information extraction is a crucial step toward understanding and processing natural language data, its goal being to identify and categorize important information conveyed in a discourse.",
        "Examples of information extraction tasks are identification of the actors and the objects in written text, the detection and classification of the relations among them, and the events they participate in.",
        "These tasks have applications in, among other fields, summarization, information retrieval, data mining, question answering, and language understanding.",
        "One of the basic tasks of information extraction is the mention detection task.",
        "This task is very similar to named entity recognition (NER), as the objects of interest represent very similar concepts.",
        "The main difference is that the latter will identify, however, only named references, while mention detection seeks named, nominal and pronominal references.",
        "In this paper, we will call the identified references mentions – using the ACE (NIST, 2003) nomenclature – to differentiate them from entities which are the real-world objects (the actual person, location, etc) to which the mentions are referring tol.",
        "Historically, the goal of the NER task was to find named references to entities and quantity references – time, money (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1997).",
        "In recent years, Automatic Content Extraction evaluation (NIST, 2003; NIST, 2004) expanded the task to also identify nominal and pronominal references, and to group the mentions into sets referring to the same entity, making the task more complicated, as it requires a co-reference module.",
        "The set of identified properties has also been extended to include the mention type of a reference (whether it is named, nominal or pronominal), its subtype (a more specific type dependent on the main entity type), and its genericity (whether the entity points to a specific entity, or a generic one 2), besides the customary main entity type.",
        "To our knowledge, little research has been done in the natural language processing context or otherwise on investigating the specific problem of how such multiple labels are best assigned.",
        "This article compares three methods for such an assignment.",
        "The simplest model which can be considered for the task is to create an atomic tag by \"gluing\" together the subtask labels and considering the new label atomic.",
        "This method transforms the problem into a regular sequence classification task, similar to part-of-speech tagging, text chunking, and named entity recognition tasks.",
        "We call this model the all-in-one model.",
        "The immediate drawback of this model is that it creates a large classification space (the crossproduct of the subtask classification spaces) and that, during decoding, partially similar classifications will compete instead of cooperate - more details are presented in Section 3.1.",
        "Despite (or maybe due to) its relative simplicity, this model obtained good results in several instances in the past, for POS tagging in morphologically rich languages (Hajic and Hladka, 1998) 'In a pragmatic sense, entities are sets of mentions which co-refer.",
        "and mention detection (Jing et al., 2003; Florian et al., 2004).",
        "At the opposite end of classification methodology space, one can use a cascade model, which performs the subtasks sequentially in a predefined order.",
        "Under such a model, described in Section 3.3, the user will build separate models for each subtask.",
        "For instance, it could first identify the mention boundaries, then assign the entity type, subtype, and mention level information.",
        "Such a model has the immediate advantage of having smaller classification spaces, with the drawback that it requires a specific model invocation path.",
        "In between the two extremes, one can use a joint model, which models the classification space in the same way as the all-in-one model, but where the classifications are not atomic.",
        "This system incorporates information about sub-model parts, such as whether the current word starts an entity (of any type), or whether the word is part of a nominal mention.",
        "The paper presents a novel contrastive analysis of these three models, comparing them on several datasets in three languages selected from the ACE 2003 and 2004 evaluations.",
        "The methods described here are independent of the underlying classifiers, and can be used with any sequence classifiers.",
        "All experiments in this article use our in-house implementation of a maximum entropy classifier (Florian et al., 2004), which we selected because of its flexibility of integrating arbitrary types of features.",
        "While we agree that the particular choice of classifier will undoubtedly introduce some classifier bias, we want to point out that the described procedures have more to do with the organization of the search space, and will have an impact, one way or another, on most sequence classifiers, including conditional random field classifiers.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the multi-task classification problem and prior work, Section 3.3 presents and contrasts the three meta-classification models.",
        "Section 4 outlines the experimental setup and the obtained results, and Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "Many tasks in Natural Language Processing involve labeling a word or sequence of words with a specific property; classic examples are part-of-speech tagging, text chunking, word sense disambiguation and sentiment classification.",
        "Most of the time, the word labels are atomic labels, containing a very specific piece of information (e.g. the word",
        "is noun plural, or starts a noun phrase, etc).",
        "There are cases, though, where the labels consist of several related, but not entirely correlated, properties; examples include mention detection – the task we are interested in – , syntactic parsing with functional tag assignment (besides identifying the syntactic parse, also label the constituent nodes with their functional category, as defined in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)), and, to a lesser extent, part-of-speech tagging in highly inflected languages.",
        "The particular type of mention detection that we are examining in this paper follows the ACE general definition: each mention in the text (a reference to a real-world entity) is assigned three types of information:5",
        "• An entity type, describing the type of the entity it points to (e.g. person, location, organization, etc) • An entity subtype, further detailing the type (e.g. organizations can be commercial, governmental and non-profit, while locations can be a nation, population center, or an international region) • A mention type, specifying the way the entity is realized – a mention can be named (e.g. John Smith), nominal (e.g. professor), or pronominal (e.g. she).",
        "Such a problem – where the classification consists of several subtasks or attributes – presents additional challenges, when compared to a standard sequence classification task.",
        "Specifically, there are interdependencies between the subtasks that need to be modeled explicitly; predicting the tags independently of each other will likely result in inconsistent classifications.",
        "For instance, in our running example of mention detection, the subtype task is dependent on the entity type; one could not have a person with the subtype non-profit.",
        "On the other hand, the mention type is relatively independent of the entity type and/or subtype: each entity type could be realized under any mention type and vice-versa.",

        "The authors used a back-propagation neural network, and the paradigm was tested on several machine learning tasks.",
        "It also contains an excellent discussion on how and why the MTL paradigm is superior to single-task learning.",
        "Florian and Ngai (2001) used the same multi-task learning strategy with a transformation-based learner to show that usually disjointly handled tasks perform slightly better under a joint model; the experiments there were run on POS tagging and text chunking, Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "Sutton et al.",
        "(2004) investigated the multitask classification problem and used a dynamic conditional random fields method, a generalization of linear-chain conditional random fields, which can be viewed as a probabilistic generalization of cascaded, weighted finite-state transducers.",
        "The subtasks were represented in a single graphical model that explicitly modeled the subtask dependence and the uncertainty between them.",
        "The system, evaluated on POS tagging and base-noun phrase segmentation, improved on the sequential learning strategy.",
        "In a similar spirit to the approach presented in this article, Florian (2002) considers the task of named entity recognition as a two-step process: the first is the identification of mention boundaries and the second is the classification of the identified chunks, therefore considering a label for each word being formed from two sub-labels: one that specifies the position of the current word relative in a mention (outside any mentions, starts a mention, is inside a mention) and a label specifying the mention type .",
        "Experiments on the CoNLL'02 data show that the two-process model yields considerably higher performance.",
        "Hacioglu et al.",
        "(2005) explore the same task, investigating the performance of the AIO and the cascade model, and find that the two models have similar performance, with the AIO model having a slight advantage.",
        "We expand their study by adding the hybrid joint model to the mix, and further investigate different scenarios, showing that the cascade model leads to superior performance most of the time, with a few ties, and show that the cascade model is especially beneficial in cases where partially-labeled data (only some of the component labels are given) is available.",
        "It turns out though, (Hacioglu, 2005) that the cascade model in (Hacioglu et al., 2005) did not change to a \"mention view\" sequence classifications (as we did in Section 3.3) in the tasks following the entity detection, to allow the system to use longer range features."

        "data, and is unable to make effective use of it.",
        "In contrast, the training data for the entity type in the cascade model effectively triples, and this change is reflected positively in the 1.5 increase in F-measure.",
        "Not all properties are equally valuable: the entity type is arguably more interesting than the other properties.",
        "If we restrict ourselves to evaluating the entity type output only (by projecting the output label to the entity type only), the difference in performance between the all-in-one model and cascade is even more pronounced, as shown in Table 4.",
        "The cascade model outperforms here both the all-in-one and joint models in all cases except English'03, where the difference is not statistically significant.",
        "As far as runtime speed is concerned, the AIO and cascade models behave similarly: our implementation tags approximately 500 tokens per second (averaged over the three languages, on a Pentium 3, 1.2Ghz, 2Gb of memory).",
        "Since a MaxEnt implementation is mostly dependent on the number of features that fire on average on a example, and not on the total number of features, the joint model runs twice as slow: the average number of features firing on a particular example is considerably higher.",
        "On average, the joint system can tag approximately 240 words per second.",
        "The train time is also considerably longer; it takes 15 times as long to train the joint model as it takes to train the all-in-one model (60 mins/iteration compared to 4 mins/iteration); the cascade model trains faster than the AIO model.",
        "One last important fact that is worth mentioning is that a system based on the cascade model participated in the ACE'04 competition, yielding very competitive results in all three languages."

        "As natural language processing becomes more sophisticated and powerful, we start focus our attention on more and more properties associated with the objects we are seeking, as they allow for a deeper and more complex representation of the real world.",
        "With this focus comes the question of how this goal should be accomplished - either detect all properties at once, one at a time through a pipeline, or a hybrid model.",
        "This paper presents three methods through which multi-label sequence classification can be achieved, and evaluates and contrasts them on the Automatic Content Extraction task.",
        "On the ACE mention detection task, the cascade model which predicts first the mention boundaries and entity types, followed by mention type and entity subtype outperforms the simple all-in-one model in most cases, and the joint model in a few cases.",
        "Among the proposed models, the cascade approach has the definite advantage that it can easily and productively incorporate additional partially-labeled data.",
        "We also presented a novel modification of the joint system training that allows for the direct incorporation of additional data, which increased the system performance significantly.",
        "The all-in-one model can only incorporate additional data in an indirect way, resulting in little to no overall improvement.",
        "Finally, the performance obtained by the cascade model is very competitive: when paired with a coreference module, it ranked very well in the \"Entity Detection and Tracking\" task in the ACE'04 evaluation."
