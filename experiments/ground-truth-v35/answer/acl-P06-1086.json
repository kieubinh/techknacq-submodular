        "This work is aimed at a unified processing architecture for the morphology of all variants of Arabic, including the dialects.",

        "First, we want to be able to use the analyzer when we do not have a lexicon, or only a partial lexicon.",
        "This is because, despite the similarities between dialects at the morphological and lexical levels, we do cannot assume we have a complete lexicon for every dialect we wish to morphologically analyze.",
        "As a result, we want an on-line analyzer which performs full morphological analysis at run time.",
        "• Second, we want to be able to exploit the ex",
        "isting regularities among the variants, in particular systematic sound changes which operate at the level of the radicals, and pattern changes.",
        "This requires an explicit analysis into root and pattern.",
        ".",
        "Third, the dialects are mainly used in spoken communication and in the rare cases when they are written they do not have standard orthographies, and different (inconsistent) orthographies may be used even within a single written text.",
        "We thus need a representation of morphology that incorporates models of both phonology and orthography.",
        "In addition, we add two general requirements for morphological analyzers.",
        "First, we want both a morphological analyzer and a morphological generator.",
        "Second, we want to use a representation that is defined in terms of a lexeme and attribute-value pairs for morphological features such as aspect or person.",
        "This is because we want our component to be usable in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as natural language generation and machine translation, and the lexeme provides a usable lexicographic abstraction.",
        "Note that the second general requirement (an analysis to a lexemic representation) appears to clash with the first design desideratum (we may not have a lexicon).",
        "We tackle these requirements by doing a full analysis of templatic morphology, rather than “precompiling” the templatic morphology into stems and only analyzing affixational morphology on-line (as is done in (Buckwalter, 2004)).",
        "Our implementation uses the multitape approach of Kiraz (2000).",
        "This is the first large-scale implementation of that approach.",
        "We extend it by adding an additional tape for independently modeling phonology and orthography.",
        "The use of finite state technology makes MAGEAD usable as a generator as well as an analyzer, unlike some morphological analyzers which cannot be converted to generators in a straightforward manner (Buckwalter, 2004; Habash, 2004)."
