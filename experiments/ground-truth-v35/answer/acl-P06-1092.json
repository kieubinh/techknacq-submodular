        "The noisy channel model approach is being successfully applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1985), spelling correction (Kernighan et al., 1990), machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), etc.",
        "In this approach an NLP system is composed of two modules: one is a task-dependent part (an acoustic model for speech recognition) which describes a relationship between an input signal sequence and a word, the other is a language model (LM) which measures the likelihood of a sequence of words as a sentence in the language.",
        "Since the LM is a common part, its improvement augments the accuracies of all NLP systems based on a noisy channel model.",
        "Recently the main research focus of LM is shifting to the adaptation method, how to capture the characteristics of words and expressions in a target domain.",
        "The standard adaptation method is to prepare a corpus in the application domain, count the frequencies of words and word sequences, and manually annotate new words with their input signal sequences to be added to the vocabulary.",
        "It is now easy to gather machine-readable sentences in various domains because of the ease of publication and access via the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefen-stette, 2003).",
        "In addition, traditional machine-readable forms of medical reports or business reports are also available.",
        "When we need to develop an NLP system in various domains, there is a huge but unannotated corpus.",
        "For languages, such as Japanese and Chinese, in which the words are not delimited by whitespace, one encounters a word identification problem before counting the frequencies of words and word sequences.",
        "To solve this problem one must have a good word segmenter in the domain of the corpus.",
        "The only robust and reliable word segmenter in the domain is, however, a word segmenter based on the statistics of the lexicons in the domain!",
        "Thus we are obliged to pay a high cost for the manual annotation of a corpus for each new subject domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for building an NLP system based on a noisy channel model with an almost infinite vocabulary.",
        "In our method, first we estimate the probability of a word boundary existing between two characters at each point of a raw corpus in the target domain.",
        "Using these probabilities we regard the corpus as a stochastically segmented corpus (SSC).",
        "We then estimate word n-gram probabilities from the SSC.",
        "Then we build an NLP system, the phoneme-to-text transcription system in this paper.",
        "To describe the stochastic relationship between a character sequence and its phoneme sequence, we also propose a character-based unknown word model.",
        "With this unknown word model and a word n-gram model estimated from the SSC, the vocabulary of our LM, a set of known words with their context information, is expanded from words in a",
        "small annotated corpus to an almost infinite size, including all substrings appearing in the large corpus in the target domain.",
        "In experiments, we estimated LMs from a relatively small annotated corpus in the general domain and a large raw corpus in the target domain.",
        "A phoneme-to-text transcription system based on our LM and unknown word model eliminated about 10% of the errors in the results of an existing method."

        "Thus the accuracy increase is yielded by the LM improvements.",
        "This fact indicates that we can expect a similar improvement in other generative NLP systems using the noisy channel model by expanding the LM vocabulary with context information to an infinite size."

        "The well-known methods for the unknown word problem are classified into two groups: one is to use an unknown word model and the other is to extract word candidates from a corpus before the application.",
        "Below we describe the relationship",
        "between these methods and the proposed method.",
        "In the method using an unknown word model, first the generation probability of an unknown word is modeled by a character n-gram, and then an NLP system, such as a morphological analyzer, searches for the best solution considering the possibility that all subsequences might be unknown words (Nagata, 1994; Bazzi and Glass, 2000).",
        "In the same way, we can build a phoneme-to-text transcription system which can enumerate unknown word candidates, but the LM is not able to refer to lexical context information to choose the appropriate word, since the unknown words are modeled to be generated from a single state.",
        "We solved this problem by allowing the LM to refer to information from an SSC.",
        "When a machine-readable corpus in the target domain is available, we can extract word candidates from the corpus with a certain criterion and use them in application.",
        "An advantage of this method is that all of the occurrences of each candidate in the corpus are considered.",
        "Nagata (1996) proposed a method calculating word candidates with their uni-gram frequencies using a forward-backward algorithm.",
        "and reported that the accuracy of a morphological analyzer can be improved by adding the extracted words to its vocabulary.",
        "Comparing our method with this research, it can be said that our method executes the word candidate enumeration and their context calculation dynamically at the time of the solution search for an NLP task, phoneme-to-text transcription here.",
        "One of the advantages of our framework is that the system considers all substrings in the corpus as word candidates (that is the recall of the word extraction is 100%) and a higher accuracy is expected using a consistent criterion, namely the generation probability, for the word candidate enumeration process and solution search process.",
        "The framework we propose in this paper, enlarging the vocabulary to an almost infinite size, is general and applicable to many other NLP systems based on the noisy channel model, such as speech recognition, statistical machine translation, etc.",
        "Our framework is potentially capable of improving the accuracies in these tasks as well."

        "The transcription system equipped with an infinite vocabulary showed a higher accuracy than the baseline model and the model based on the existing method.",
