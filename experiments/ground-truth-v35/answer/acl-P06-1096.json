        "The generative, noisy-channel paradigm has historically served as the foundation for most of the work in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1994).",
        "At the same time, discriminative methods have provided substantial improvements over generative models on a wide range of NLP tasks.",
        "They allow one to easily encode domain knowledge in the form of features.",
        "Moreover, parameters are tuned to directly minimize error rather than to maximize joint likelihood, which may not correspond well to the task objective.",
        "In this paper, we present an end-to-end discriminative approach to machine translation.",
        "The proposed system is phrase-based, as in Koehn et al.",
        "(2003), but uses an online perceptron training scheme to learn model parameters.",
        "Unlike minimum error rate training (Och, 2003), our system is able to exploit large numbers of specific features in the same manner as static reranking systems (Shen et al., 2004; Och et al., 2004).",
        "However, unlike static rerankers, our system does not rely on a baseline translation system.",
        "Instead, it updates based on its own n-best lists.",
        "As parameter estimates improve, the system produces better n-best lists, which can in turn enable better updates in future training iterations.",
        "In this paper, we focus on two aspects of the problem of discriminative translation: the inherent difficulty of learning from reference translations, and the challenge of engineering effective features for this task.",
        "Discriminative learning from reference translations is inherently problematic because standard discriminative methods need to know which outputs are correct and which are not.",
        "However, a proposed translation that differs from a reference translation need not be incorrect.",
        "It may differ in word choice, literalness, or style, yet be fully acceptable.",
        "Pushing our system to avoid such alternate translations is undesirable.",
        "On the other hand, even if a system produces a reference translation, it may do so by abusing the hidden structure (sentence segmentation and alignment).",
        "We can therefore never be entirely sure whether or not a proposed output is safe to update towards.",
        "We discuss this issue in detail in Section 5, where we show that conservative updates (which push the system towards a local variant of the current prediction) are more effective than more aggressive updates (which try to directly update towards the reference).",
        "The second major contribution of this work is an investigation of an array of features for our model.",
        "We show how our features quantitatively increase BLEU score, as well as how they qualitatively interact on specific examples.",
        "We first consider learning weights for individual phrases and part-of-speech patterns, showing gains from each.",
        "We then present a novel way to parameterize and introduce learning into the initial phrase extraction process.",
        "In particular, we introduce alignment constellation features, which allow us to weight phrases based on the word alignment pattern that led to their extraction.",
        "This kind of",
        "feature provides a potential way to initially extract phrases more aggressively and then later down-weight undesirable patterns, essentially learning a weighted extraction heuristic.",
        "Finally, we use POS features to parameterize a distortion model in a limited distortion decoder (Zens and Ney, 2004; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005).",
        "We show that overall, BLEU score increases from 28.4 to 29.6 on French-English."

        "Machine translation can be seen as a structured classification task, in which the goal is to learn a mapping from an input (French) sentence x to an output (English) sentence y.",
        "Given this setup, discriminative methods allow us to define a broad class of features Φ that operate on (x, y).",
        "For example, some features would measure the fluency of y and others would measure the faithfulness of y as a translation of x.",
        "However, the translation task in this framework differs from traditional applications of discriminative structured classification such as POS tagging and parsing in a fundamental way.",
        "Whereas in POS tagging, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the words x and the tags y, the correspondence between x and y in machine translation is not only much more complex, but is in fact unknown.",
        "Therefore, we introduce a hidden correspondence structure h and work with the feature vector Φ(x, y, h).",
        "The phrase-based model of Koehn et al.",
        "(2003) is an instance of this framework.",
        "In their model, the correspondence h consists of (1) the segmentation of the input sentence into phrases, (2) the segmentation of the output sentence into the same number of phrases, and (3) a bijection between the input and output phrases.",
        "The feature vector Φ(x, y, h) contains four components: the log probability of the output sentence y under a language model, the score of translating x into y based on a phrase table, a distortion score, and a length penalty.1 In Section 6, we vastly increase the number of features to take advantage of the full power of discriminative training.",
        "Another example of this framework is the hierarchical model of Chiang (2005).",
        "In this model the correspondence h is a synchronous parse tree",
        "over input and output sentences, and features include the scores of various productions used in the tree.",

        "In principle, w could have been tuned by maximizing conditional probability or maximizing margin.",
        "However, these two options require either marginalization or numerical optimization, neither of which is tractable over the space of output sentences y and correspondences h. In contrast, the perceptron algorithm requires only a decoder that computes f (x; w).",

        "We explored the following three ways to choose the target (yt, ht):",

        "• Hybrid updating: Do a bold update if the reference is reachable.",

        "In this regard, dynamic reranking remedies one of the main weaknesses of static reranking, which is that the performance of the system is directly limited by the quality of the baseline classifier.",
        "Hybrid updating combines the two strategies: it makes full use of the training data as in local updating, but still tries to make swift progress towards the reference translation as in bold updating.",

        "This is not the full story, however, since the hybrid approach (which makes the same number of updates) performs significantly worse than local updating when using the limited distortion decoder.",
        "To see the problem with bold updating, recall the example in Figure 1.",
        "Bold updating tries to reach the reference at all costs, even if it means abusing the hidden correspondence in the process.",
        "In the example, the alignment (’, a) is unreasonable, but the algorithm has no way to recognize this.",
        "Local updating is much more stable since it only updates towards sentences in the n-best list.",

        "Limited distortion decoding actually performs worse than monotonic decoding with bold updating, but better with local updating.",
        "Another difference between bold updating and local updating is that the BLEU score on the training data is dramatically higher for bold updating than for local (or hybrid) updating: 80 for the former versus 40 for the latter.",

        "This approach only works in practice with a small handful of parameters.",
        "The second approach is to use reranking, in which a baseline classifier generates an n-best list of candidate translations, and a separate discriminative classifier chooses amongst them (Shen et al., 2004; Och et al., 2004).",
        "The major limitation of a reranking system is its dependence on the underlying baseline system, which bounds the potential improvement from discriminative training.",
        "In machine translation, this limitation is a real concern; it is common for all translations on moderately-sized n-best lists to be of poor quality.",
