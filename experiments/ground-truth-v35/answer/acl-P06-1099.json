        "Research on domain-specific automatic term recognition (ATR) and on general-language collocation extraction (CE) has gone mostly separate ways in the last decade although their underlying procedures and goals turn out to be rather similar.",
        "In both cases, linguistic filters (POS taggers, phrase chunkers, (shallow) parsers) initially collect candidates from large text corpora and then frequency or statistics-based evidence or association measures yield scores indicating to what degree a candidate qualifies as a term or a collocation.",
        "While term mining and collocation mining, as a whole, involve almost the same analytical processing steps, such as orthographic and morphological normalization, normalization of term or collocation variation etc., it is exactly the measure which grades termhood or collocativity of a candidate on which alternative approaches diverge.",
        "Still, the output of such mining algorithms look similar.",
        "It is typically constituted by a ranked list on which, ideally, the true terms or collocations are placed in the top portion of the list, while the non-terms / non-collocations occur in its bottom portion.",
        "While there have been lots of approaches to come up with a fully adequate ATR/CE metric (cf.",
        "Section 2), we have made observations in our experiments that seem to indicate that simplicity rules, i.e., frequency of occurrence is the dominating factor for the ranking in the result lists even when much smarter statistical machinery is employed.",
        "In this paper, we will discuss data which reveals that purely statistics-based measures exhibit virtually no difference compared with frequency of occurrence counts, while linguistically more informed measures do reveal such a marked difference – for the problem of term and collocation mining at least."

        "Although there has been a fair amount of work employing linguistically sophisticated analysis of candidate items (e.g., on CE by Lin (1998) and Lin (1999) as well as on ATR by Daille (1996), Jacquemin (1999), and Jacquemin (2001)), these approaches are limited by the difficulty to port grammatical specifications to other domains (in the case of ATR) or by the error-proneness of full general-language parsers (in the case of CE).",
        "Therefore, most recent approaches in both areas have backed off to more shallow linguistic filtering techniques, such as POS tagging and phrase chunking (e.g., Frantzi et al.",

        "Among the most widespread ones, both for ATR and CE, are statistical and information-theoretic measures, such as t-test, log-likelihood, entropy, and mutual information.",

        "Because various metrics assign a score to the candidates indicating as to what degree they qualify as a collocation or term (or not), these candidates should ideally be ranked in such a way that the following two conditions are met:",
        "• true collocations or terms (i.e., the true positives) are ranked in the upper portion of the output list.",
        "• non-collocations or non-terms (i.e., the true negatives) are ranked in the lower part of the output list.1",
        "While a trivial solution to the problem might be to simply count the number of occurrences of candidates in the data, employing more sophisticated statistics-based / information-theoretic or even linguistically-motivated algorithms for grading term and collocation candidates is guided by the assumption that this additional level of sophistication yields more adequate rankings relative to these two conditions.",
        "Several studies (e.g., Evert and Krenn (2001), Krenn and Evert (2001), Frantzi et al.",
        "(2000), Wermter and Hahn (2004)), however, have already observed that ranking the candidates merely by their frequency of occurrence fares quite well 1Obviously, this goal is similar to ranking documents according to their relevance for information retrieval.",
        "compared with various more sophisticated association measures (AMs such as t-test, log-likelihood, etc.).",
        "In particular, the precision/recall value comparison between the various AMs exhibits a rather inconclusive picture in Evert and Krenn (2001) and Krenn and Evert (2001) as to whether sophisticated statistical AMs are actually more viable than frequency counting.",
        "Commonly used statistical significance testing (e.g., the McNemar or the Wilcoxon sign rank tests; see (Sachs, 1984)) does not seem to provide an appropriate evaluation ground either.",
        "Although Evert and Krenn (2001) and Wermter and Hahn (2004) provide significance testing of some AMs with respect to mere frequency counting for collocation extraction, they do not differentiate whether this is due to differences in the ranking of true positives or true negatives or a combination thereof.2 As for studies on ATR (e.g., Wermter and Hahn (2005) or Nenadi´c et al.",
        "(2004)), no statistical testing of the term extraction algorithms to mere frequency counting was performed.",
        "But after all, these kinds of commonly used statistical significance tests may not provide the right machinery in the first place.",
        "By design, they are rather limited (or focused) in their scope in that they just check whether a null hypothesis can be rejected or not.",
        "In such a sense, they do not provide a way to determine, e.g., to which degree of magnitude some differences pertain and thus do not offer the facilities to devise qualitative criteria to test whether an AM is superior to co-occurrence frequency counting.",
        "The purpose of this study is therefore to postulate a set of criteria for the qualitative testing of differences among the various CE and ATR metrics.",
        "We do this by taking up the two conditions above which state that a good CE or ATR algorithm would rank most of the true positives in a candidate set in the upper portion and most of the true negatives in the lower portion of the output.",
        "Thus, compared to co-occurrence frequency counting, a superior CE/ATR algorithm should achieve the following four objectives: 2I n particular Evert and Krenn (2001) use the chi-square test which assumes independent samples and is thus not really suitable for testing the significance of differences of two or more measures which are typically run on the same set of candidates (i.e., a dependent sample).",
        "Wermter and Hahn (2004) use the McNemar test for dependent samples, which only examines the differences in which two metrics do not coincide.",

Evert and Krenn (2001) and Krenn and Evert (2001)) and also for ATR (see Wermter and Hahn (2005)).",
        "Concerning more recent linguistically grounded AMs, we looked at limited syntagmatic modifiability (LSM) for CE (Wermter and Hahn, 2004) and limited paradigmatic modifiability (LPM) for ATR (Wermter and Hahn, 2005).",

        "The first two criteria examine how conservative an association measure is with respect to Frequency, i.e., a superior AM at least should keep the status-quo (or even improve it) by keeping the true positives in the upper portion and the true negatives in the lower one.",
        "In meeting criteria 1 for CE, Table 2 shows that t-test behaves very similar to Frequency in keeping roughly the same amount of TPs in each of the upper three subportions.",
        "LSM even promotes its TPs from the third into the first two upper subportion (i.e., by a 7 and 2-point increase in the first and in the second subportion as well as a 12-point decrease in the third subportion, compared to Frequency).",
        "With respect to the same criterion for ATR (see Table 3), Frequency and t-test again show quite similar distributions of TPs in the top three subportions.",
        "LPM, on the other hand, demonstrates a modest increase (by 4 points) in the top upper subportion, but decreases in the second and third one so that a small fraction of TPs gets demoted to the lower three subportions (6.6%, 3.8% and 2.1%).",
        "Regarding criterion 2 for CE (see Table 2), t-test’s share of TNs in the lower three subportions is slightly less than that of Frequency, leading to a 15-point increase in the adjacent third upper subportion.",
        "This local ”spilling over” to the upper portion is comparatively small considering the change that occurs with respect to LSM.",
        "Here, TNs appear in the second (12.5%) and the third (17.9%) upper subportions.",
        "For ATR, t-test once more shows a very similar distribution compared to Frequency, whereas LPM again promotes some of its lower TNs into the upper subportions (7%, 11.8% and 15.2%).",
        "Criteria 3 and 4 examine the kinds of re-rankings (i.e., demoting upper portion TNs and promoting lower portion TPs) which an AM needs to perform in order to qualify as being superior to Frequency.",
        "These criteria look at how well an AM is able to undo the unfavorable ranking of TPs and TNs by Frequency.",
        "As for criterion 3 (the demotion of TNs from the upper portion) in CE, Table 2 shows that t-test is only marginally able to undo the unfavorable rankings in its third upper subportion (11 percentage points less of TNs).",
        "This causes a small fraction of TNs getting demoted to",
        "the lower three subportions (viz. 2.8%, 1.4%, and 5.8%).",
        "A view from another angle on this rather slight re-ranking is offered by the scatterplot in Figure 2, in which the rankings of the upper portion TNs of Frequency are plotted against their ranking in t-test.",
        "Here it can be seen that, in terms of the rank subportions considered, the t-test TNs are concentrated along the same line as the Frequency TNs, with only a few being able to break this line and",
        "get demoted to a lower subportion.",
        "A strikingly similar picture holds for this criterion in ATR: as can be witnessed from Figure 4, the vast majority of upper portion t-test TNs is stuck on the same line as in Frequency.",
        "The similarity of t-test in both CE and ATR is even more remarkable given the fact in the actual number of upper portion TNs is more than four times higher in ATR (13040) than in CE (3076).",
        "A look at the actual figures in Table 3 indicates that t-test is even",
        "less able to deviate from Frequency’s TN distribution (i.e., the third upper subportion is only occupied by 4.7 points less TNs, with the other two subportions essentially remaining the same as in Frequency).",
        "The two linguistically rooted measures, LSM for CE and LPM for ATR, offer quite a different picture regarding this criterion.",
        "With LSM, almost one third (32%) of the upper portion TNs get demoted to the three lower portions (see Table 2); with LPM, this proportion even amounts to 40.6% (see Table 3).",
        "The scatterplots in Figure 1 and Figure 3 visualize this from another perspective: in particular, LPM completely breaks the original Frequency ranking pattern and scatters the upper portion TNs in almost all possible directions, with the vast majority of them thus getting demoted to a lower rank than in Frequency.",
        "Although LSM stays more in line, still substantially more upper portion TNs get demoted than with t-test.",
        "With regard to Criterion 4 (the promotion of TPs from the lower portion) in CE, t-test manages to promote 11.3% of its lower portion TPs to the adjacent third upper subportion, but at the same time demotes more TPs to the third lower subportion (34.5% compared to 28% in Frequency; see Table 2).",
        "Figure 6 thus shows the t-test TPs to be a bit more dispersed in the lower portion.",
        "For ATR, the t-test distribution of TPs differs even less from Frequency.",
        "Table 3 reveals that only 8.7% of the lower portion TPs get promoted to the adjacent third upper portion.",
        "The staggered groupinlpr g of lower portion t-test TPs (visualized in the respective scatterplot in Figure 8) actually indicates that there are certain plateaus beyond which the TPs cannot get promoted.",
        "The two non-standard measures, LSM and LPM, once more present a very different picture.",
        "Regarding LSM, 56% of all lower portion TPs get promoted to the upper three subportions.",
        "The majority of these (52.4%) gets placed the third upper subportion.",
        "This can also be seen in the respective scatterplot in Figure 5 which shows a marked concentration of lower portion TPs in the third upper subportion.",
        "With respect to LPM, even 62.6% of all lower portion TPs make it to the upper portions – with the majority (23.9%) even getting promoted to the first upper subportion.",
        "The respective scatterplot in Figure 7 additionally shows that this upward movement of TPs, like the downward movement of TNs in Figure 3, is quite dispersed."
