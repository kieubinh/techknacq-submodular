        "Natural Language Processing applications often need to rely on large amount of lexical semantic knowledge to achieve good performances.",
        "Asymmetric verb relations are part of it.",
        "Consider for example the question “What college did Marcus Camby play for?”.",
        "A question answering (QA) system could find the answer in the snippet “Marcus Camby won for Massachusetts” as the question verb play is related to the verb win.",
        "The vice-versa is not true.",
        "If the question is “What college did Marcus Camby won for?”, the snippet “Marcus Camby played for Massachusetts” cannot be used.",
        "Winnig entails playing but not vice-versa, as the relation between win and play is asymmetric.",
        "Recently, many automatically built verb lexical-semantic resources have been proposed to support lexical inferences, such as (Resnik and Diab, 2000; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Glickman and Dagan, 2003).",
        "All these resources focus on symmetric semantic relations, such as verb similarity.",
        "Yet, not enough attention has been paid so far to the study of asymmetric verb relations, that are often the only way to produce correct inferences, as the example above shows.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel approach to identify asymmetric relations between verbs.",
        "The main idea is that asymmetric entailment relations between verbs can be analysed in the context of class-level and word-level selectional preferences (Resnik, 1993).",
        "Selectional preferences indicate an entailment relation between a verb and its arguments.",
        "For example, the selectional preference {human} win may be read as a smooth constraint: if x is the subject of win then it is likely that x is a human, i.e. win(x) – * human(x).",
        "It follows that selectional preferences like {player} win may be read as suggesting the entailment relation",
        "Selectional preferences have been often used to infer semantic relations among verbs and to build symmetric semantic resources as in (Resnik and Diab, 2000; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Glickman and Dagan, 2003).",
        "However, in those cases these are exploited in a different way.",
        "The assumption is that verbs are semantically related if they share similar selectional preferences.",
        "Then, according to the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1964), verbs occurring in similar sentences are likely to be semantically related.",
        "The Distributional Hypothesis suggests a generic equivalence between words.",
        "Related methods can then only discover symmetric relations.",
        "These methods can incidentally find verb pairs as (win,play) where an asymmetric entailment relation holds, but they cannot state the direction of entailment (e.g., win – *play).",
        "As we investigate the idea that a single relevant verb selectional preference (as {player}",
        "win) could produce an entailment relation between verbs, our starting point can not be the Distributional Hypothesis.",
        "Our assumption is that some point-wise assertions carry relevant semantic information (as in (Robison, 1970)).",
        "We do not derive a semantic relation between verbs by comparing their selectional preferences, but we use point-wise corpus-induced selectional preferences.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Sec. 2 we discuss the intuition behind our research.",
        "In Sec. 3 we describe different types of verb entailment.",
        "In Sec. 4 we introduce our model for detecting entailment relations among verbs .",
        "In Sec. 5 we review related works that are used both for comparison and for building combined methods.",

        "Selectional restrictions are strictly related to entailment.",
        "When a verb or a noun expects a modifier having a predefined property it means that the truth value of the related sentences strongly depends on the satisfiability of these expectations.",
        "For example, “X is blue” implies the expectation that X has a colour.",
        "This expectation may be seen as a sort of entailment between “being a modifier of that verb or noun” and “having a property”.",
        "If the sentence is “The number three is blue”, then the sentence is false as the underlying entailment blue (x) – * has_colour(x) does not hold (cf. (Resnik, 1993)).",
        "In particular, this rule applies to verb logical subjects: if a verb v has a selectional restriction requiring its logical subjects to satisfy a property c, it follows that the implication:",
        "should be verified for each logical subject x of the verb v. The implication can also be read as: if x has the property of doing the action v this implies that x has the property c. For example, if the verb is to eat, the selectional restrictions of to eat would imply that its subjects have the property of being animate.",
        "Resnik (1993) introduced a smoothed version of selectional restrictions called selectional preferences.",
        "These preferences describe the desired properties a modifier should have.",
        "The claim is that if a selectional preference holds, it is more probable that x has the property c given that it modifies v rather than x has this property in the general case, i.e.:",
        "The probabilistic setting of selectional preferences also suggests an entailment: the implication v(x) – * c(x) holds with a given degree of certainty.",
        "This definition is strictly related to the probabilistic textual entailment setting in (Glickman et al., 2005).",
        "We can use selectional preferences, intended as probabilistic entailment rules, to induce entailment relations among verbs.",
        "In our case, if a verb vt expects that the subject “has the property of doing an action vh”, this may be used to induce that the verb vt probably entails the verb vh, i.e.:",
        "As for class-based selectional preference acquisition, corpora can be used to estimate these particular kinds of preferences.",
        "For example, the sentence “John McEnroe won the match...” contributes to probability estimation of the class-based selectional preference win(x) – * human (x) (since John McEnroe is a human).",
        "In particular contexts, it contributes also to the induction of the entailment relation between win and play, as John McEnroe has the property of playing.",
        "However, as the example shows, classes relevant for acquiring selectional preferences (such as human) are explicit, as they do not depend from the context.",
        "On the contrary, properties such as “having the property of doing an action” are less explicit, as they depend more strongly on the context of sentences.",
        "Thus, properties useful to derive entailment relations among verbs are more difficult to find.",
        "For example, it is easier to derive that John McEnroe is a human (as it is a stable property) than that he has the property of playing.",
        "Indeed, this latter property may be relevant only in the context of the previous sentence.",
        "However, there is a way to overcome this limitation: agentive nouns such as runner make explicit this kind of property and often play subject roles in sentences.",
        "Agentive nouns usually denote the “doer” or “performer” ofsome action.",
        "This is exactly what is needed to make clearer the relevant property vh (x) of the noun playing the logical subject role.",
        "The action vh will be the one entailed by the verb vt heading the sentence.",
        "As an example in the sentence “the player wins”, the action play",
        "evocated by the agentive noun player is entailed by win."

        "In WordNet, verbs are organized in synonymy sets (synsets) and different kinds of semantic relations can hold between two verbs (i.e. two synsets): troponymy, causation, backward-presupposition, and temporal inclusion.",
        "All these relations are intended as specific types of lexical entailment.",
        "According to the definition in (Miller, 1995) lexical entailment holds between two verbs vt and vh when the sentence Someone vt entails the sentence Someone vh (e.g. “Someone wins” entails “Someone plays”).",
        "Lexical entailment is then an asymmetric relation.",
        "The four types of WordNet lexical entailment can be classified looking at the temporal relation between the entailing verb vt and the entailed verb vh.",

        "The relation of temporal inclusion captures those entailment pairs in which the action of one verb is temporally included in the action of the other (e.g. snore – sleep).",
        "Backward-presupposition stands when the entailed verb vh happens before the entailing verb vt and it is necessary for vt. For example, win entails play via backward-presupposition as it temporally follows and presupposes play.",
        "Finally, in causation the entailing verb vt necessarily causes vh.",
        "In this case, the temporal relation is thus inverted with respect to backward-presupposition, since vt precedes vh.",

        "The two verbs have the same subject.",
        "The only exception is causation: in this case the subject of the entailed verb vh is usually the object of vt (e.g., X give Y – * Yhave).",
        "In most cases the subject of vt carries out an action that changes the state of the object of vt, that is then described by vh.",
        "The intuition described in Sec. 2 is then applicable only for some kinds of verb entailments.",
        "First, the causation relation can not be captured since the two verbs should have the same subject (cf. eq.",
        "(2)).",
        "Secondly, troponymy seems to be less interesting than the other relations, since our focus is more on a logic type of entailment (i.e., vt and vh express two different actions one depending from the other).",
        "We then focus our study and our experiments on backward-presupposition and temporal inclusion.",

In order to understand which of the two patterns has the best discrimination power a comparison of the AROC values is needed.",
