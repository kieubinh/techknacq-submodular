      "heading": "3.1 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "Most of the previous work on spelling correction concentrates on the problem of designing better error models based on properties of character strings.",
        "This direction ever evolves from simple Damerau-Levenshtein distance (Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966) to probabilistic models that estimate string edit probabilities from corpus (Church and Gale, 1991; Mayes et al., 1991; Ris-tad and Yianilos, 1997; Brill and Moore, 2000; and Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005).",
        "In the mentioned methods, however, the similarities between two strings are modeled on the average of many misspelling-correction pairs, which may cause many idiosyncratic spelling errors to be ignored.",
        "Some of those are typical word-level cognitive errors.",
        "For instance, given the query term adventura, a character string-based error model usually assigns similar similarities to its two most probable corrections adventure and aventura.",
        "Taking into account that adventure has a much higher frequency of occurring, it is most likely that adventure would be generated as a suggestion.",
        "However, our observation into the query logs reveals that adventura in most cases is actually a common misspelling of aventura.",
        "Two annotators were asked to judge 36 randomly sampled queries that contain more than one term, and they agreed upon that 35 of them should be aventura.",
        "To solve this problem, we consider alternative methods to make use of the information beyond a",
        "term’s character strings.",
        "Distributional similarity provides such a dimension to view the possibility that one word can be replaced by another based on the statistics of words co-occuring with them.",
        "Distributional similarity has been proposed to perform tasks such as language model smoothing and word clustering, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been explored in estimating similarities between misspellings and their corrections.",
        "In this section, we will only involve the consine metric for illustration purpose.",
        "Query logs can serve as an excellent corpus for distributional similarity estimation.",
        "This is because query logs are not only an up-to-date term base, but also a comprehensive spelling error repository (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005).",
        "Given enough size of query logs, some misspellings, such as adventura, will occur so frequently that we can obtain reliable statistics of their typical usage.",
        "Essential to our method is the observation of high distributional similarity between frequently occurring spelling errors and their corrections, but low between irrelevant terms.",
        "For example, we observe that adventura occurred more than 3,300 times in a set of logged queries that spanned three months, and its context was similar to that of aventura.",
        "Both of them usually appeared after words like peurto and lyrics, and were followed by mall, palace and resort.",
        "Further computation shows that, in the tf (term frequency) vector space based on surrounding words, the cosine value between them is approximately 0.8, which indicates these two terms are used in a very similar way among all the users trying to search aventura.",
        "The cosine between adventura and adventure is less than 0.03 and basically we can conclude that they are two irrelevant terms, although their spellings are similar.",
        "Distributional similarity is also helpful to address another challenge for query spelling correction: differentiating valid OOV terms from frequently occurring misspellings.",
        "butional similarity between each pair of words provides the necessary information to make correction classification that vacuum is a spelling error while seraphin is a valid OOV term."

        "in which each correction candidate c satisfies the constraint that the edit distance between c and q is less than a given threshold δ, the model is to find c* in C with the highest probability:",

        "Instead of directly optimize (1), source channel model tries to solve an equivalent problem by applying Bayes’s rule and dropping the constant denominator:",
        "In this approach, two component generative models are involved: source model P(c) that generates the user’s intended query c and error model P(q|c) that generates the real query q given c. These two component models can be independently estimated.",
        "In practice, for a multi-term query, the source model can be approximated with an n-gram statistical language model, which is estimated with tokenized query logs.",
        "Taking bigram model for example, c is a correction candidate containing n terms, c = c1c2 ... cn , then P(c) can be written as the product of consecutive bigram probabilities:",
        "Similarly, the error model probability of a query is decomposed into generation probabilities of individual terms which are assumed to be independently generated:",
        "Previous proposed methods for error model estimation are all based on the similarity between the character strings of qi and ci as described in 3.1.",
        "Here we describe a distributional similarity-based method for this problem.",
        "Essentially there are different ways to estimate distributional similarity between two words (Dagan et al., 1997), and the one we propose to use is confusion probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992).",
        "Formally, confusion probability Pc estimates the possibility that one word w1 can be replaced by another word w2:",
        "where w belongs to the set of words that co-occur with both w1 and w2.",
        "From the spelling correction point of view, given w1 to be a valid word and w2 one of its spelling errors, Pc (w2 |w1) actually estimates opportunity that w1 is misspelled as w2 in query logs.",
        "Compared to other similarity measures such as cosine or Euclidean distance, confusion probability is of interest because it defines a probabilistic distribution rather than a generic measure.",
        "This property makes it more theoretically sound to be used as error model probability in the Bayesian framework of the source channel model.",
        "Thus it can be applied and evaluated independently.",
        "However, before using confusion probability as our error model, we have to solve two problems: probability renormalization and smoothing.",
        "Unlike string edit-based error models, which distribute a major portion of probability over terms with similar spellings, confusion probability distributes probability over the entire vocabulary in the training data.",
        "This property may cause the problem of unfair comparison between different correction candidates if we directly use (3) as the error model probability.",
        "This is because the synonyms of different candidates may share different portion of confusion probabilities.",
        "This problem can be solved by renormalizing the probabilities only over a term’s possible correction candidates and itself.",
        "To obtain better estimation, here we also require that the frequency of a correction candidate should be higher than that of the query term, based on the observation that correct spellings generally occur more often in query logs.",
        "Formally, given a word w and its correction candidate set C, the confusion probability of a word w′ conditioned on w can be redefined as",
        "where Pc ′ (w′ |w) is the original definition of confusion probability.",
        "In addition, we might also have the zero-probability problem when the query term has not appeared or there are few context words for it in the query logs.",
        "In such cases there is no distributional similarity information available to any known terms.",
        "To solve this problem, we define the final error model probability as the linear combination of confusion probability and a string edit-based error model probability Ped (q |c) :",
