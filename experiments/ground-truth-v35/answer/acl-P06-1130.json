        "Our probabilistic generation grammars bear a conceptual similarity to Kaplan and Wedekind’s “refinement” grammars.",
        "It would be interesting to explore possible connections between the treebank-based empirical work presented here and the theoretical constructs in Kaplan and Wedekind’s proofs.",
        "We presented a full set of generation experiments on varying sentence lengths training on Sections 02–21 of the Penn Treebank and evaluating on Section 23 strings.",
        "Sentences of length <20 achieve coverage of 95.26%, BLEU score of 0.7227 and string accuracy of 0.7476 against the raw Section 23 text.",
        "Sentences of all lengths achieve coverage of 89.49%, BLEU score of 0.6979 and string accuracy of 0.7012.",
        "Our method is robust and can cope with noise in the f-structure input to generation and will attempt to produce partial output rather than fail."
