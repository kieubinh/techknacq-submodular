        "We base our GRE approach on an extension of the incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "The motivation for basing our approach on this algorithm is its polynomial complexity.",
        "The algorithm iterates through the properties of the target and for each property computes the set of distractor objects for which (a) the conjunction of the properties selected so far, and (b) the current property hold.",
        "A property is added to the list of selected properties if it reduces the size of the distractor object set.",
        "The algorithm succeeds when all the distractors have been ruled out, it fails if all the properties have been processed and there are still some distractor objects.",
        "The algorithm can be refined by ordering the checking of properties according to fixed preferences, e.g. first a taxonomic description of the target, second an absolute property such as colour, third a relative property such as size.",
        "(Dale and Reiter, 1995) also stipulate that the type description of the target should be included in the description even if its inclusion does not make the target distinguishable.",
        "We extend the original incremental algorithm in two ways.",
        "First we integrate a model of object salience by modifying the condition under which a description is deemed to be distinguishing: it is, if all the distractors have been ruled out or if the salience of the target object is greater than the highest salience score ascribed to any of the current distractors.",
        "This is motivated by the observation that people can easily resolve un-derdetermined references using salience (Duwe and Strohner, 1997).",
        "We model the influence of visual and discourse salience using a function salience(L), Equation 1.",
        "The function returns a value between 0 and 1 to represent the relative salience of a landmark L in the scene.",
        "The relative salience of an object is the average of its visual salience (Svzs) and discourse salience (Sdzsc),",
        "Visual salience Svzs is computed using the algorithm of (Kelleher and van Genabith, 2004).",
        "Computing a relative salience for each object in a scene is based on its perceivable size and its centrality relative to the viewer focus of attention, returning scores in the range of 0 to 1.",
        "The discourse salience (Sdzsc) of an object is computed based on recency of mention (Hajicov´a, 1993) except we represent the maximum overall salience in the scene as 1, and use 0 to indicate that the landmark is not salient in the current context.",
        "Algorithm 1 gives the basic algorithm with salience.",
        "Algorithm 1 The Basic Incremental Algorithm",
        "Secondly, we extend the incremental algorithm in how we construct the context model used by the algorithm.",
        "The context model determines to a large degree the output of the incremental algorithm.",
        "However, Dale and Reiter do not define how this set should be constructed, they only write: “[w]e define the context set to be the set of entities that the hearer is currently assumed to be attending to” (Dale and Reiter, 1995, pg.",
        "236).",
        "Before applying the incremental algorithm we must construct a context model in which we can check whether or not the description generated distinguishes the target object.",
        "To constrain the combinatorial explosion in relational scene model construction we construct a series of reduced scene models, rather than one complex exhaustive model.",
        "This construction is driven by a hierarchy of spatial relations and the partitioning of the context model into objects that may and may not function as landmarks.",

        "Below we motivate and develop the ordering of relations used.",
        "We can reasonably asssume that it takes less effort to describe one object than two.",
        "Following the Principle of Minimal Cooperative Effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), one should only use a locative expression when there is no distinguishing description of the target object using a simple feature based approach.",
        "Also, the Principle of Sensitivity (Dale and Reiter, 1995) states that when producing a referring expression, one should prefer features the hearer is known to be able to interpret and see.",
        "This points to a preference, due to cognitive load, for descriptions that identify an object using purely physical and easily perceivable features ahead of descriptions that use spatial expressions.",
        "Experimental results support this (van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2004).",
        "Similarly, we can distinguish between the cognitive loads of processing different forms of spatial relations.",
        "In comparing the cognitive load associated with different spatial relations it is important to recognize that they are represented and processed at several levels of abstraction.",
        "For example, the geometric level, where metric properties are dealt with, the functional level, where the specific properties of spatial entities deriving from their functions in space are considered, and the pragmatic level, which gathers the underlying principles that people use in order to discard wrong relations or to deduce more information (Edwards and Moulin, 1998).",
        "Our discussion is grounded at the geometric level.",
        "Focusing on static prepositions, we assume topological prepositions have a lower perceptual load than projective ones, as perceiving two objects being close to each other is easier than the processing required to handle frame of reference ambiguity (Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin, 1994; Carlson-Radvansky and Logan, 1997).",
        "Figure 4 lists the preferences, further discerning objects type as the easiest to process, before absolute grad-able predicates (e.g. color), which is still easier than relative Figure 4: Cognitive load gradable predicates (e.g. size) (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "We can refine the topological versus projective preference further if we consider their contrastive and relative uses of these relations (§2).",
        "Perceiving and interpreting a contrastive use of a spatial relation is computationally easier than judging a relative use.",
        "Finally, within projective prepositions, psycholinguistic data indicates a perceptually based ordering of the relations: above/below are easier to percieve and interpret than in front of/behind which in turn are easier than to the right of/to the left of (Bryant et al., 1992; Gapp, 1995).",
        "In sum, we propose the following ordering: topological contrastive < topological relative < projective constrastive < projective relative.",
        "For each level of this hierarchy we require a computational model of the semantics of the relation at that level that accomodates both contrastive and relative representations.",
        "In §2 we noted that the distinctions between the semantics of the different topological prepositions is often based on functional and pragmatic issues.3 Currently, however, more psycholinguistic data is required to distinguish the cognitive load associated with the different topological prepositions.",
        "We use the model of topological proximity developed in (Kelleher et al., 2006) to model all the relations at this level.",
        "Using this model we can define the extent of a region proximal to an object.",
        "If the target or one of the distractor objects is the only object within the region of proximity around a given landmark this is taken to model a contrastive use of a topological relation relative to that landmark.",
        "If the landmark’s region of proximity contains more than one object from the target and distractor object set then it is a relative use of a topological relation.",
        "We handle the issue of frame of reference ambiguity and model the semantics of projective prepostions using the framework developed in (Kelleher et al., 2006).",

        "These characteristics are indicative of salient objects and empirical results support this correlation between object salience and landmark selection (Beun and Cremers, 1998).",

        "However, the construction of such a model is prone to the issue of combinatorial explosion both in terms of the number objects in the context (the location of each object in the scene must be checked against all the other objects in the scene) and number of inter-object spatial relations (as a greater number of spatial relations will require a greater number of comparisons between each pair of objects.",
        "We have presented a framework that addresses this issue by: (a) contextually defining the set of objects in the context that may function as a landmark, and (b) sequencing the order in which spatial relations are considered using a cognitively motivated hierarchy of relations.",
        "Defining the set of objects in the scene that may function as a landmark reduces the number of object pairs that a spatial relation must be computed over.",
        "Sequencing the consideration of spatial relations means that in each context model only one relation needs to be checked and in some instances the agent need not compute some of the spatial relations, as it may have succeeded in generating a distinguishing locative using a relation earlier in the sequence.",
        "A further advantage of our approach stems from the partitioning of the context into those objects that may function as a landmark and those that may not.",
        "As a result of this partitioning the algorithm avoids the issue of infinite recursion, as the partitioning of the context stops the algorithm from distinguishing a landmark using its target.",
        "We have employed the approach in a system for Human-Robot Interaction, in the setting of object",
        "manipulation in natural scenes.",
