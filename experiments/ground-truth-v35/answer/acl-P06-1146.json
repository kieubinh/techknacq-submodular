        "Recent years have witnessed increased interest in data-driven methods for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, ranging from part-of-speech tagging, to parsing, and semantic role labelling.",
        "The success of these methods is due partly to the availability of large amounts of training data annotated with rich linguistic information.",
        "Unfortunately, such resources are largely absent for almost all languages except English.",
        "Given the data requirements for supervised learning, and the current paucity of suitable data for many languages, methods for generating annotations (semi-)automatically are becoming increasingly popular.",
        "Annotation projection tackles this problem by leveraging parallel corpora and the high-accuracy tools (e.g., parsers, taggers) available for a few languages.",
        "Specifically, through the use of word alignments, annotations are transfered from resource-rich languages onto low density ones.",
        "The projection process can be decomposed into three steps: (a) determining the units of projection; these are typically words but can also be chunks or syntactic constituents; (b) inducing alignments between the projection units and projecting annotations along these alignments; (c) reducing the amount of noise in the projected annotations, often due to errors and omissions in the word alignment.",
        "The degree to which analyses are parallel across languages is crucial for the success of projection approaches.",
        "A number of recent studies rely on this notion of parallelism and demonstrate that annotations can be adequately projected for parts of speech (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hi and Hwa, 2005), chunks (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), and dependencies (Hwa et al., 2002).",
        "In previous work (Padó and Lapata, 2005) we considered the annotation projection of semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents such as AGENT, PATIENT, or INSTRUMENT.",
        "Semantic roles exhibit a high degree of parallelism across languages (Boas, 2005) and thus appear amenable to projection.",
        "Furthermore, corpora labelled with semantic role information can be used to train shallow semantic parsers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), which could in turn benefit applications in need of broad-coverage semantic analysis.",
        "Examples include question answering, information extraction, and notably machine translation.",
        "Our experiments concentrated primarily on the first projection step, i.e., establishing the right level of linguistic analysis for effecting projection.",
        "We showed that projection schemes based on constituent alignments significantly outperform schemes that rely exclusively on word alignments.",
        "A local optimisation strategy was used to find constituent alignments, while relying on a simple filtering technique to handle noise.",
        "The study described here generalises our earlier semantic role projection framework in two important ways.",
        "First, we formalise constituent projection as the search for a minimum weight edge cover in a weighted bipartite graph.",
        "This formalisation",
        "efficiently yields constituent alignments that are globally optimal.",
        "Second, we propose tree pruning as a general noise reduction strategy, which exploits both structural and linguistic information to enable projection.",
        "Furthermore, we quantitatively assess the impact of noise on the task by evaluating both on automatic and manual word alignments.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the task of role-semantic projection and the syntax-based framework introduced in Padó and Lapata (2005).",
        "Section 3 explains how semantic role projection can be modelled with minimum weight edge covers in bipartite graphs.",
        "Section 4 presents our tree pruning strategy.",
        "We present our evaluation framework and results in Section 5.",
        "A discussion of related and future work concludes the paper."

        "Semantic role projection is illustrated in Figure 1 using English and German as the source-target language pair.",
        "We assume a FrameNet-style semantic analysis (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "In this paradigm, the semantics of predicates and their arguments are described in terms of frames, conceptual structures which model prototypical situations.",
        "The English sentence Kim promised to be on time in Figure 1 is an instance of the COMMITMENT frame.",
        "In this particular example, the frame introduces two roles, i.e., SPEAKER (Kim) and MESSAGE (to be on time).",
        "Other possible, though unrealised, roles are ADDRESSEE, MESSAGE, and TOPIC.",
        "The COMMITMENT frame can be introduced by promise and several other verbs and nouns such as consent or threat.",
        "We also assume that frame-semantic annotations can be obtained reliably through shallow semantic parsing.1 Following the assignment of semantic roles on the English side, (imperfect) word alignments are used to infer semantic alignments between constituents (e.g., to be on time is aligned with pünktlich zu kommen), and the role labels are transferred from one language to the other.",
        "Note that role projection can only take place if the source predicate (here promised) is word-aligned to a target predicate (here versprach ) evoking the same frame; if this is not the case (e.g., in metaphors), projected roles will not be generally appropriate.",
        "We represent the source and target sentences as sets of linguistic units, Us and Ut, respectively.",
        "The assignment of semantic roles on the source side is a function roles : R – * 2Us from roles to sets of source units.",
        "Constituent alignments are obtained in two steps.",
        "First, a real-valued function sim : Us x Ut – * R estimates pairwise similarities between source and target units.",
        "To make our model robust to alignment noise, we use only content words to compute the similarity function.",
        "Next, a decision procedure uses the similarity function to determine the set of semantically equivalent, i.e., aligned units A C_ Us x Ut.",
        "Once A is known, semantic projection reduces to transferring the semantic roles from the source units onto their aligned target counterparts:",
        "In Padó and Lapata (2005), we evaluated two main parameters within this framework: (a) the choice of linguistic units and (b) methods for computing semantic alignments.",
        "Our results revealed that constituent-based models outperformed word-based ones by a wide margin (0.65 Fscore vs. 0.46), thus demonstrating the importance of bracketing in amending errors and omissions in the automatic word alignment.",
        "We also compared two simplistic alignment schemes, backward alignment and forward alignment.",
        "The first scheme aligns each target constituent to its most similar source constituent, whereas the second (A f) aligns each source constituent to its most similar target constituent: A f = { (us, ut) I ut = argmax sim (us, u�t) }",
        "An example constituent alignment obtained from the forward scheme is shown in Figure 2 (left side).",
        "The nodes represent constituents in the source and target language and the edges indicate the resulting alignment.",
        "Forward alignment generally outperformed backward alignment (0.65 Fscore vs. 0.45).",
        "Both procedures have a time complexity quadratic in the maximal number of sentence nodes: O(1Us11 Ut1) = O(max(1Us1, 1Ut1)2).",
        "A shortcoming common to both decision procedures is that they are local, i.e., they optimise the alignment for each node independently of all other nodes.",
        "Consider again Figure 2.",
        "Here, the forward procedure creates alignments for all source nodes, but leaves constituents from the target set unaligned (see target node (1)).",
        "Moreover, local alignment methods constitute a rather weak model of semantic equivalence since they allow one target node to correspond to any number of source nodes (see target node (3) in Figure 2, which is aligned to three source nodes).",
        "In fact, by allowing any alignment between constituents, the local models can disregard important linguistic information, thus potentially leading to suboptimal results.",
        "We investigate this possibility by proposing well-understood global optimisation models which suitably constrain the resulting alignments.",
        "Besides matching constituents reliably, poor word alignments are a major stumbling block for achieving accurate projections.",
        "Previous research addresses this problem in a post-processing step, by reestimating parameter values (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), by applying transformation rules (Hwa et al., 2002), by using manually labelled data (Hi and Hwa, 2005), or by relying on linguistic criteria (Padó and Lapata, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present a novel filtering technique based on tree pruning which removes extraneous constituents in a preprocessing stage, thereby disassociating filtering from the alignment computation.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we present the details of our global optimisation and filtering techniques.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a novel method for obtaining constituent alignments between parallel sentences and have shown that it is useful for semantic role projection.",
        "A key aspect of our approach is the formalisation of constituent alignment as the search for a minimum weight edge cover in a bipartite graph.",
        "This formalisation provides efficient mechanisms for aligning constituents and yields results superior to heuristic approaches.",
        "Furthermore, we have shown that tree-based noise filtering techniques are essential for good performance.",
        "Our approach rests on the assumption that constituent alignment can be determined solely from the lexical similarity between constituents.",
        "Although this allows us to model constituent alignments efficiently as edge covers, it falls short of modelling translational divergences such as substitutions or insertions/deletions.",
        "In future work, we will investigate minimal tree edit distance (Bille, 2005) and related formalisms which are defined on tree structures and can therefore model divergences explicitly.",
        "However, it is an open question whether cross-linguistic syntactic analyses are similar enough to allow for structure-driven computation of alignments.",
