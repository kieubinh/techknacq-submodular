        "This paper focuses on two issues related to conversational QA.",
        "The first issue is concerned with user intent.",
        "In conversational systems, understanding user intent is the key to the success of the interaction.",
        "In the context of interactive QA, one question is what type of user intent should be captured.",
        "Unlike most dialog systems where user intent can be characterized by dialog acts such as question, reply, and statement, in interactive QA, user inputs are already in the form of question.",
        "Then the problems become whether there are different types of intent behind these questions that should be handled differently by a QA system and how to automatically identify them.",
        "The second issue is concerned with problematic situations during interaction.",
        "In spoken dialog systems, many problematic situations could arise from insufficient speech recognition and language understanding performance.",
        "Recent work has shown that the capability to automatically identify problematic situations (e.g., speech recognition errors) can help control and adapt dialog strategies to improve performance (Litman and Pan, 2000).",
        "Similarly, QA systems also face challenges of technology limitation from language understanding and information retrieval.",
        "Thus one question is, in the context of interactive QA, how to characterize problematic situations and automatically identify them when they occur.",
        "In interactive QA, these two issues are intertwined.",
        "Questions formed by a user not only depend on his/her information goals, but are also influenced by the answers from the system.",
        "Problematic situations will impact user intent in the",
        "follow-up questions, which will further influence system performance.",
        "Both the awareness of problematic situations and understanding of user intent will allow QA systems to adapt better strategies during interaction and move towards intelligent conversational QA.",
        "To address these two questions, we conducted a user study where users interacted with a controlled QA system to find information of interest.",
        "These controlled studies allowed us to focus on the interaction aspect rather than information retrieval or answer extraction aspects.",
        "Our studies indicate that in basic interactive QA where users always ask questions and the system always provides some kind of answers, there are different types of user intent that are tied to different kinds of system performance (e.g., problematic/error free situations).",

        "Open domain question answering (QA) systems are designed to automatically locate answers from large collections of documents to users’ natural language questions.",
        "In the past few years, automated question answering techniques have advanced tremendously, partly motivated by a series of evaluations conducted at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) (Voorhees, 2001; Voorhees, 2004).",
        "To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; Small et al., 2003; Harabagiu et al., 2005).",
        "For example, NIST initiated a special task on context question answering in TREC 10 (Voorhees, 2001), which later became a regular task in TREC 2004 (Voorhees, 2004) and 2005.",
        "The motivation is that users tend to ask a sequence of related questions rather than isolated single questions to satisfy their information needs.",
        "Therefore, the context QA task was designed to investigate the system capability to track context through a series of questions.",
        "Based on context QA, some work has been done to identify clarification relations between questions (Boni and Man-andhar, 2003).",
        "However context QA is different from interactive QA in that context questions are specified ahead of time rather than incrementally as in an interactive setting.",
        "Interactive QA has been applied to process complex questions.",
        "For analytical and non-factual questions, it is hard to anticipate answers.",
        "Clarification dialogues can be applied to negotiate with users about the intent of their questions (Small et al., 2003).",
        "Recently, an architecture for interactive question answering has been proposed based on a notion of predictive questioning (Harabagiu et al., 2005).",
        "The idea is that, given a complex question, the system can automatically identify a set of potential follow-up questions from a large collection of question-answer pairs.",
        "The empirical results have shown the system with predictive questioning is more efficient and effective for users to accomplish information seeking tasks in a particular domain (Harabagiu et al., 2005).",
        "The work reported in this paper addresses a different aspect of interactive question answering.",
        "Both issues raised earlier (Section 1) are inspired by earlier work on intelligent conversational systems.",
        "Automated identification of user intent has played an important role in conversational systems.",
        "Tremendous amounts of work has focused on this aspect (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "To improve dialog performance, much effort has also been put on techniques to automatically detect errors during interaction.",
        "It has shown that during human machine dialog, there are sufficient cues for machines to automatically identify error conditions (Levow, 1998; Litman et al., 1999; Hirschberg et al., 2001; Walker et al., 2002).",
        "The awareness of erroneous situations can help systems make intelligent decisions about how to best guide human partners through the conversation and accomplish the tasks.",
        "Motivated by these earlier studies, the goal of this paper is to investigate whether these two issues can be applied in question answering to facilitate intelligent conversational QA."

        "Users were not aware of the existence of this human wizard and were led to believe they were interacting with a real QA system.",
        "This controlled setting allowed us to focus on the interaction aspect rather than information retrieval or answer extraction aspect of question answering.",
        "More specifically, during interaction after each question was issued, a random number generator was used to decide if a problematic situation should be introduced.",
        "If the number indicated no, the wizard would retrieve a passage from a database with correct question/answer pairs.",
        "Note that in our experiments we used specific task scenarios (described later), so it was possible to anticipate user information needs and create this database.",
        "If the number indicated that a problematic situation should be introduced, then the Lemur retrieval engine 1 was used on the AQUAINT collection to retrieve the answer.",
        "Our assumption is that AQUAINT data are not likely to provide an exact answer given our specific scenarios, but they can provide a passage that is most related to the question.",
        "The use of the random number generator was to control the ratio between the occurrence of problematic situations and error-free situations.",
        "In our initial investigation, since we are interested in observing user behavior in problematic situations, we set the ratio as 50/50.",
        "In our future work, we will vary this ratio (e.g., 70/30) to reflect the performance of state-of-the-art factoid QA and investigate the implication of this ratio in automated performance assessment."

        "First, questions formed during interactive QA tend to be self-contained and free of definite noun phrases, pronouns, or ellipsis.",
        "Only one question in the entire data set has a pronoun (i.e., What are the best movies with Tom Cruise in them?).",
        "Even in this case, the pronoun them did not refer to any entities that occurred previously in the",

        "This phenomenon could be caused by how the answers are presented.",
        "Unlike specific answer entities, the answer passages provided by our system do not support the natural use of referring expressions in the follow-up questions.",
        "Another possible explanation could be that in an interactive environment, users seem to be more aware of the potential limitation of a computer system and thus tend to specify self-contained questions in a hope to reduce the system’s inference load.",
        "The second observation is about user behavior in response to different system performances (i.e., problematic or error-free situations).",
        "We were hoping to see different strategies users might apply to deal with the problematic situations.",
        "However, based on the data, we found that when a problem occurred, users either rephrased their questions (i.e., the same question expressed in a different way) or gave up the question and went on specifying a new question.",

        "This may limit users’ expectation in the kind of questions that can be handled by the system.",
        "Our assumption is that, once the QA system becomes more intelligent and able to carry on conversation, different types of questions (i.e., other than rephrase or new) will be observed.",
        "This hypothesis certainly needs to be validated in a conversational setting.",
        "The third observation is that the rephrased questions seem to strongly correlate with problematic situations, although not always.",
        "New questions cannot distinguish a problematic situation from an error-free situation.",
        "Table 1 shows the statistics from our data about different combinations of new/rephrase questions and performance situations2.",
        "What is interesting is that these different combinations can reflect different types of user intent behind the questions.",
        "More specifically, given a question, four types of user intent can be captured with respect to the context (e.g., the previous question and answer) Continue indicates that the user is satisfied with the previous answer and now moves on to this new question.",
        "Switch indicates that the user has given up on the previous question and now moves on to this",

        "Table 1 summarizes these different types of intent together with the number of corresponding occurrences from both structured and unstructured scenarios.",
        "Since in the unstructured scenarios it was hard to anticipate user’s questions and therefore take a correct action to respond to a problematic/error-free situation, the distribution of these two situations is much more skewed than the distribution for the structured scenarios.",
        "Also as mentioned earlier, in unstructured scenarios, users lacked the motivation to pursue specific information, so the ratio between switch and retry is much larger than that observed in the structured scenarios.",
        "Nevertheless, we did observe different user behavior in response to different situations.",
