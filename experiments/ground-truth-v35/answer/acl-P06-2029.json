        "We combine the attachment predictions made by a simple model of lexical attraction with a full-fledged parser of German to determine the actual benefit of the subtask to parsing.",
        "We show that the combination of data-driven and rule-based components can reduce the number of all parsing errors by 14% and raise the attachment accuracy for dependency parsing of German to an unprecedented 92%."

        "Most NLP applications are either data-driven (classification tasks are solved by comparing possible solutions to previous problems and their solutions) or rule-based (general rules are formulated which must be applicable to all cases that might be encountered).",
        "Both methods face obvious problems: The data-driven approach is at the mercy of its training set and cannot easily avoid mistakes that result from biased or scarce data.",
        "On the other hand, the rule-based approach depends entirely on the ability of a computational linguist to anticipate every construction that might ever occur.",
        "These handicaps are part of the reason why, despite great advances, many tasks in computational linguistics still cannot be performed nearly as well by computers as by human informants.",
        "Applied to the subtask of syntax analysis, the dichotomy manifests itself in the existence of learnt and handwritten grammars of natural languages.",
        "A great many formalisms have been advanced that fall into either of the two variants, but even the best of them cannot be said to interpret arbitrary input consistently in the same way that a human reader would.",
        "Because the handicaps of different methods are to some degree complementary, it seems likely that a combination of approaches could yield better results than either alone.",
        "We therefore integrate a data-driven classifier for the special task of PP attachment into an existing rule-based parser and measure the effect that the additional information has on the overall accuracy."

        "PP attachment disambiguation has often been studied as a benchmark test for empirical methods in natural language processing.",
        "Prepositions allow subordination to many different attachment sites, and the choice between them is influenced by factors from many different linguistic levels, which are generally subject to preferential rather than rigorous regularities.",
        "For this reason, PP attachment is a comparatively difficult subtask for rule-based syntax analysis and has often been attacked by statistical methods.",
        "Because probabilistic approaches solve PP attachment as a natural subtask of parsing anyhow, the obvious application of a PP attacher is to integrate it into a rule-based system.",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, so far this has rarely been done.",
        "One reason for this is that many rule-driven syntax analyzers provide no obvious way to integrate uncertain, statistical information into their decisions.",
        "Another is the traditional emphasis on PP attachment as a binary classification task; since (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), research has concentrated on resolving the ambiguity in the category pattern ‘V+N+P+N’, i.e. predicting the PP attachment to either the verb or the first noun.",
        "It is often assumed that the correct attachment is always among these",
        "two options, so that all problem instances can be solved correctly despite the simplification.",
        "This task is sufficient to measure the relative quality of different probability models, but it is quite different from what a parser must actually do: It is easier because the set of possible answers is pre-filtered so that only a binary decision remains, and the baseline performance for pure guessing is already 50%.",
        "But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned.",
        "Instead of the accuracy of PP attachers in the isolated decision between two words, we investigate the problem of situated PP attachment.",
        "In this task, all nouns and verbs in a sentence are potential attachment points for a preposition; the computer must find suitable attachments for one or more prepositions in parallel, while building a globally coherent syntax structure at the same time."

        "Statistical PP attachment is based on the observation that the identities of content words can be used to predict which prepositional phrases modify which words, and achieve better-than-chance accuracy.",
        "This is apparently because, as heads of their respective phrases, they are representative enough that they can serve as a crude approximation of the semantic structure that could be derived from the phrases.",
        "Consider the following example (the last sentence in our test set): Die Firmen m¨ussen noch die Bedenken der EU-Kommission gegen die Fusion ausr¨aumen.",
        "(The companies have yet to address the Commission’s concerns about the merger.)",
        "In this sentence, the preferred analysis will pair the preposition ‘gegen’ (against, about, versus) with the noun ‘Bedenken’ (concerns), since the proposition is clearly that the concerns pertain to the merger.",
        "A syntax tree of this interpretation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Note that there are at least three different syntactically plausible attachment sites for the preposition.",
        "In fact, there are even more, since a parser can make no initial assumptions about the global structure of the syntax tree that it will construct; for instance, the possibility that ‘gegen’ attaches to the noun ‘Firmen’ (companies) cannot be ruled out when beginning to parse."

        "For the following experiments, we used the dependency parser of German described in (Foth et al., 2005).",
        "This system is especially suited to our goals for several reasons.",
        "Firstly, the parser achieves the highest published dependency-based accuracy on unrestricted written German input, but still has a comparatively high error rate for prepositions.",
        "In particular, it mis-attaches the preposition ‘gegen’ in the example sentence.",
        "Second, although rule-based in nature, it uses numerical penalties to arbitrate between different disambiguation rules.",
        "It is therefore easy to add another rule of varying strength, which depends on the output of an external statistical predictor, to guide the parser when it has no other means of making an attachment decision.",
        "Finally, the parser and grammar are freely available for use and modification (http: //nats-www.",
        "informatik.",
        "uni-hamburg.de/download).",
        "(Schr¨oder, 2002) models syntax structure as labelled dependency trees as shown in the example.",
        "A grammar in this formalism is written as a set of constraints that license well-formed partial syntax structures.",
        "For instance, general projectivity rules ensure that the dependency tree corresponds to a properly nested syntax structure without crossing brackets1.",
        "Other constraints require an auxiliary verb to be modified by a full verb, or prescribe morphosyntactical agreement between a determiner and its regent (the word modified by the determiner).",
        "Although the Constraint Satisfaction Problem that this formalism defines is, in theory, infeasibly hard, it can nevertheless be solved approximatively with heuristic solution methods, and achieve competitive parsing accuracy.",
        "To allow the resolution of true ambiguity (the existence of different structures neither of which is strictly ungrammatical), weighted constraints can be written that the solution should satisfy, if this is possible.",
        "The goal is then to build the structure that violates as few constraints as possible, and preferentially violates weak rather than strong constraints.",
        "This allows preferences to be expressed rather than hard rules.",
        "For instance, agreement constraints could actually be declared as violable, since typing errors, reformulations, etc.",
        "can",
        "and do actually lead to mis-inflected phrases.",
        "In this way robustness against many types of error can be achieved while still preferring the correct variant.",
        "For more about the WCDG parser, see (Schr¨oder, 2002; Foth and Menzel, 2006) .",
        "The grammar of German available for this parser relies heavily on weighted constraints both to cope with many kinds of imperfect input and to resolve true ambiguities.",
        "For the example sentence, it retrieves the desired dependencies except for constructing the implausible dependency ‘ausr¨aumen’+‘gegen’ (address against).",
        "Let us briefly review the relevant constraints that cause this error: • General structural, valence and agreement constraints determine the macro structure of the sentence in the desired way.",
        "For instance, the finite and the full verb must combine to form an auxiliary phrase, because this is the only way of accounting for all words while satisfying valence and category constraints.",
        "For the same reasons both determiners must be paired with their respective nouns.",
        "Also, the prepositional phrase itself is correctly predicted.",
        "• General category constraints ensure that the preposition can attach to nouns and verbs, but not, say, to a determiner or to punctuation.",
        "• A weak constraint on adjuncts says that adjuncts are usually close to their regent.",
        "The penalty of this constraint varies according to the length of the dependency that it is applied to, so that shorter dependencies are generally preferred.",
        "• A slightly stronger constraint prefers attachment of the preposition to the verb, since",
        "overall verb attachment is more common than noun attachment in German.",
        "Therefore, the verb attachment leads to the globally best solution for this sentence.",
        "There are no lexicalized rules that capture the particular plausibility of the phrase ‘Bedenken gegen’ (concerns about).",
        "A constraint that describes this individual word pair would be trivial to write, but it is not feasible to model the general phenomenon in this way; thousands of constraints would be needed just to reflect the more important collocations in a language, and the exact set of collocating words is impossible to predict accurately.",
        "Data-driven information would be much more suitable for curing this lexical blind spot."

        "The usual way to retrieve the lexical preference of a word such as ‘Bedenken’ for ‘gegen’ is to obtain a large corpus and assume that it is representative of the entire language; in particular, that collocations in this corpus are representative of collocations that will be encountered in future input.",
        "The assumption is of course not entirely true, but it can nevertheless be preferable to rely on such uncertain knowledge rather than remain undecided, on the reasonable assumption that it will lead to more correct than wrong decisions.",
        "Note that the same reasoning applies to many of the violable constraints in a WCDG: although they do not hold on all possible structures, they hold more often than they fail, and therefore can be useful for analysing unknown input.",
        "Different measures have been used to gauge the strength of a lexical preference, but in general the efficacy of the statistical approach depends more on the suitability of the training corpus than on details of the collocation measure.",
        "Since our focus",
        "is not on finding the best extraction method, but on judging the benefit of statistical components to parsing, we employ a collocation measure related to the idea of mutual information: a collocation between a word w and a preposition p is judged more likely the more often it appears, and the less often its component words appear.",
        "By normalizing against the total number t of utterances we derive a measure of Lexical Attraction for each possible collocation:",
        "For instance, if we assume that the word ‘Bedenken’ occurs in one out of 2,000 sentences of German and the word ‘gegen’ occurs in one sentence out of 31 (these figures were taken from the unsupervised experiment described later), then pure chance would make the two words co-occur in one sentence out of 62,000.",
        "If the LA score is higher than 1, i. e. we observe a much higher frequency of co-occurrences in a large corpus, we can assume that the two events are not statistically independent – in other words, that there is a positive correlation between the two words.",

        "To obtain the counts to base our estimates of attraction on, we first turned to the dependency treebank that accompanies the WCDG parsing suite.",
        "This corpus contains some 59,000 sentences with 1,000,000 words with complete syntactic annotations, 61% of which are drawn from online technical newscasts, 33% from literature and 6% from law texts.",
        "We used the entire corpus except for the test set as a source for counting PP attachments directly.",
        "All verbs, nouns and prepositions were first reduced to their base forms in order to reduce the parameter space.",
        "Compound nouns were reduced to their base nouns, so that ‘EU-Kommission’ is treated the same as ‘Kommission’, on the assumption that the compound exerts similar attractions as the base noun.",
        "In contrast, German verbs with prefixes usually differ markedly in their preferences from the base verb.",
        "Since forms of verbs such as ‘ausr¨aumen’ (address) can be split into two parts",
        "(‘NP r¨aumte NP aus’), such separated verbs were reassembled before stemming.",
        "Although the information retrieved from complete syntax trees is valuable, it is clearly insufficient for estimating many valid collocations.",
        "In particular, even for a comparatively strong collocation such as ‘Bedenken’+‘gegen’ we can expect only very few instances.",
        "(There are, in fact, 4 such instances, well above chance level but still a very small number.)",
        "Therefore we used the archived text from 18 volumes of the newspaper tageszeitung as a second source.",
        "This corpus contains about 295,000,000 words and should allow us to detect many more collocations.",
        "In fact, we do find 2338 instances of ‘Bedenken’+‘gegen’ in the same sentence.",
        "Of course, since we have no syntactic annotations for this corpus (and it would be infeasible to create them even by fully automatic parsing), not all of these instances may indicate a syntactic dependency.",
        "(Ratnaparkhi, 1998) solved this problem by regarding only prepositions in syntactically unambiguous configurations.",
        "Unfortunately, his patterns cannot directly be applied to German sentences because of their freer word order.",
        "As an approximation it would be possible to count only pairs of adjacent content words and prepositions.",
        "However, this would introduce systematic biases into the counts, because nouns do in fact very often occur adjacently to prepositions that modify them, but many verbs do not.",

        "anklagen wegen etw.’ (to sue s.o.",
        "for s.th.)",
        "gives rise to a strong collocation between the verb ‘anklagen’ and the preposition ‘wegen’; however, in the predominant sentence types of German, the two words are virtually never adjacent, because either the preposition kernel or the direct object must intervene.",
        "Therefore, we relax the adjacency condition for verb attachment and also count prepositions that occur within a fixed distance of their suspected regent.",
        "Table 1 shows the detailed values when judging the example sentence according to the unparsed corpus.",
        "The strong collocation that we would expect for ‘Bedenken’+‘gegen’ is indeed",
        "observed, with a value of 4.96.",
        "However, the verb attachment also has a score above 1, indicating that ‘gegen’+‘ausr¨aumen’ (to address about) are also positively correlated.",
        "This is almost certainly a misleading figure, since those two words do not form a plausible verb phrase; it is much more probable that the very strong, in fact idiomatic, correlation ‘Bedenken ausr¨aumen’ (to address concerns) causes many co-occurrences of all three words.",
        "Therefore our figures falsely suggest that ‘gegen’ would often attach to ‘ausr¨aumen’, when it is in fact the direct object of that verb that it is attracted to.",
        "(Volk, 2002) already suggested that this counting method introduced a general bias toward verb attachment, and when comparing the results for very frequent words (for which more reliable evidence is available from the treebank) we find that verb attachments are in fact systematically overestimated.",
        "We therefore adopted his approach and artificially inflated all noun+preposition counts by a constant factor i.",
        "To estimate an appropriate value for this factor, we extracted 178 instances of the standard verb+noun+preposition configuration from our corpus, of which 80 were verb attachments (V) and 98 were noun attachments (N).",
        "Table 2 shows the performance of the predictor for this binary decision task.",
        "Taken as it is, it retrieves most verb attachments, but less than half of the noun attachments, while higher values of i can improve the recall both for noun attachments and overall.",
        "The performance achieved falls somewhat short of the highest figures reported previously for PP attachment for German (Volk, 2002); this is at least in part due to our simple model that ignores the kernel noun of the PP.",
        "However, it could well be good enough to be integrated into a full parser and provide a benefit to it.",
        "Also, the syntactical configuration in this standard benchmark is not the predominant one in complete German sentences; in fact fewer than 10% of all prepositions occur in this context.",
        "The best performance on the triple task is therefore not guaranteed to be the best choice for full parsing.",

        "Their predicted relative order of plausibility should of course be reflected, so that dependencies with a high lexical attraction are preferred over those with lower lexical attraction.",
        "At the same time, the information should not be given too much weight compared to the existing grammar rules, since it is heuristic in nature and should certainly not override important principles such as valence or agreement.",
        "The penalties of WCDG constraints range from 0.0 (hard constraint) through 1.0 (a constraint with this penalty has no effect whatsoever and is only useful for debugging).",

        "Figure 2):",

        "For instance, this mapping will interpret a strong lexical attraction of 5 as the penalty 0.989 (almost perfect) and a lexical attraction of only 0.5 as the penalty 0.95 (somewhat dispreferred).",
        "The overall range of PP attachment penalties is limited to the interval [0.8 – 1.0], which ensures that the judgement of the statistical module will usually come into play only when no other evidence is available; preliminary experiments showed that a stronger integration of the component yields no additional advantage.",
        "In any case, the exact figure depends closely on the valuation of the existing constraints of the grammar and is of little importance as such.",

        "Using a stochastic variant of Constraint Dependency Grammar (Wang and Harper, 2004) reached a 92.4% labelled F-score on the Penn Treebank, which slightly outperforms (Collins, 1999) who reports 92.0% on dependency structures automatically derived from phrase structure results."

        "Corpus-based data has been shown to provide a significant benefit when used to guide a rule-based dependency parser of German, reducing the error rate for situated PP attachment by one third.",
        "Prepositions still remain the largest source of attachment errors; many reasons can be tracked down for individual errors, such as faulty POS tagging, misinterpreted global sentence structure, genuinely ambiguous constructions, failure of the attraction heuristics, or simply lack of processing time.",
        "However, considering that even human arbiters often agree only on 90% of PP attachments, the results appear promising.",
        "In particular, many attachment errors that strongly disagree with human intuition (such as in the example sentence) were in fact prevented.",
        "Thus, the addition of a corpus-based knowledge source to the system yielded a much greater benefit than could have been achieved with the same effort by writing individual constraints.",
        "One obvious further task is to improve our simple-minded model of lexical attraction.",
        "For instance, some remaining errors suggest that taking the kernel noun into account would yield a higher attachment precision; this will require a redesign of the extraction tools to keep the parameter space manageable.",
        "Also, other subordination types than ‘PP’ may benefit from similar knowledge; e.g., in many German sentences the roles of subject and object are syntactically ambiguous and can only be understood correctly through world knowledge.",
        "This is another area in which synergy between lexical attraction estimates and general symbolic rules appears possible."
