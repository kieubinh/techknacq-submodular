        "Algorithms for the Generation of Referring Expressions (GRE) seek a set of properties that distinguish an intended referent from its distractors in a knowledge base.",
        "Much of the GRE literature has focused on developing efficient content determination strategies that output the best available description according to some interpretation of the Gricean maxims (Dale and Reiter, 1995), especially Brevity.",
        "Work on reference to sets has also proceeded within this general framework (van Deemter, 2002; Gardent, 2002; Horacek, 2004).",
        "One problem that has not received much attention is that of conceptual coherence in the generation of plural references, i.e. the ascription of related properties to elements of a set, so that the resulting description constitutes a coherent cover for the plurality.",
        "As an example, consider a reference to {e1, e3} in Table 1 using the Incremental Algorithm (IA) (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "IA searches along an ordered list of attributes, selecting properties of the intended referents that remove some distractors.",
        "Assuming the ordering in the top row, IA would yield the postgraduate and the chef, which is fine in case occupation is the relevant attribute in the discourse, but otherwise is arguably worse than an alternative like the italian and the maltese, because it is more difficult to see what a postgraduate and a chef have in common.",
        "Such examples lead us to hypothesise the following constraint: Conceptual Coherence Constraint (CC): As far as possible, describe objects using related properties.",
        "Related issues have been raised in the formal semantics literature.",
        "Aloni (2002) argues that an appropriate answer to a question of the form ‘Wh x?’ must conceptualise the different instantiations of x using a perspective which is relevant given the hearer’s information state and the context.",
        "Kron-feld (1989) distinguishes a description’s functional relevance – i.e. its success in distinguishing a referent – from its conversational relevance, which arises in part from implicatures.",
        "In our example, describing e1 as the postgraduate carries the im-plicature that the entity’s academic role is relevant.",
        "When two entities are described using contrasting properties, say the student and the italian, the contrast may be misleading for the listener.",
        "Any attempt to port these observations to the GRE scenario must do so without sacrificing logical completeness.",
        "While a GRE algorithm should attempt to find the most coherent description available, it should not fail in the absence of a coherent set of properties.",
        "This paper aims to achieve a dual goal.",
        "First (§2), we will show that the CC can be explained and modelled in terms of lexical semantic forces within a description, a claim supported by the results of two experiments.",
        "Our focus on ‘low-level’, lexical, determinants of adequacy constitutes a departure from the standard Gricean view.",
        "Second, we describe an algorithm",

        "This information is represented as a set of triples (rel, w, w'), where rel is a grammatical relation, w the word of interest and w' its co-argument in rel (e.g. (premodifies, dog, domestic )).",

        "The context made it clear which of the three entities had to be referred to.",
        "Our hypothesis was that participants would prefer to use semantically similar properties for the plural reference, even if dissimilar properties were also available.",

        "In half the discourses, the distinguishing properties of each entity were nouns; thus, although all three entities belonged to the same ontological category (e.g. all human), they had distinct types (e.g. duke, prince, bachelor).",
        "In the other half, entities were of the same type, that is the NPs introducing them had the same nominal head, but had distinguishing adjectival modifiers.",
        "For counterbalancing, two versions of each discourse were constructed, such that, if {e1, e2} was the target set in Version 1, then {e2, e3} was the target in Version 2.",

        "Nouns (or types, as we shall sometimes call them) have the function of categorising objects; thus similar types facilitate the mental representation of a plurality in a conceptually coherent way.",
        "According to the definition in (1), this is because similarity of two types implies a greater likelihood of their being used in the same predicate-argument structures.",
        "As a result, it is easier to map the elements of a plurality to a common role in a sentence.",
        "A related proposal has been made by Moxey and Sanford (1995), whose Scenario Mapping Principle holds that a plural reference is licensed to the extent that the elements of the plurality can be mapped to a common role in the discourse.",
        "This is influenced by how easy it is to conceive of such a role for the referents.",
        "Our results can be viewed as providing a handle on the notion of ‘ease of conception of a common role’; in particular we propose that likelihood of occurrence in the same linguistic contexts directly reflects the extent to which two types can be mapped to a single plural role.",
        "As regards modifiers, while it is probably premature to suggest that CC plays no role in modifier selection, it is likely that modifiers play a different role from nouns.",
        "Previous work has shown that",
        "restrictions on the plausibility of adjective-noun combinations exist (Lapata et al., 1999), and that using unlikely combinations (e.g. the immaculate kitchen rather than the spotless kitchen) impacts processing in online tasks (Murphy, 1984).",
        "Unlike types, which have a categorisation function, modifiers have the role of adding information about an element of a category.",
        "This would partially explain the experimental results: When elements of a plurality have identical types (as in the modifier version of our experiment), the CC is already satisfied, and selection of modifiers would presumably depend on respecting adjective-noun combination restrictions.",

        "If H3 were confirmed, then earlier algorithms were (also) on the right track by taking brevity into account.",
        "Confirmation of H2 would be interpreted as meaning that, in references to sets, conceptual coherence is more important than brevity (defined as the number of disjuncts in a disjunctive reference to a set).",
        "Materials, design and procedure Six discourses were constructed, each introducing three entities.",
        "Each set of three could be described using all 4 possible combinations of +b x +c (see Figure 4).",
        "Entities were human in two of the discourses, and artefacts of various kinds in the remainder.",
        "Properties of entities were introduced textually; the order of presentation was randomised.",
        "A forced-choice task was used.",
        "Each discourse was presented with 2 possible continuations consisting of a sentence with a plural subject NP, and participants were asked to indicate the one they found most natural.",
        "The 6 comparisons corresponded to 6 sub-conditions:",
        "Participants saw each discourse in a single condition.",
        "They were randomly divided into six groups, so that each discourse was used for a different condition in each group.",
        "39 native English speakers, all undergraduates at the University of Aberdeen, took part in the study.",
        "Results and discussion Results were coded according to whether a participant’s choice was +b",
        "and/or +c.",
        "Table 4 displays response proportions.",
        "Overall, the conditions had a significant impact on responses, both by subjects (Friedman x2 = 107.3,p < .001) and by items (x2 = 30.2,p < .001).",
        "When coherence was kept constant (C 1 a and C1b), the likelihood of a response being +b was no different from – b (C1a: x2 = .023,p = .8; C1b: x2 = .64,p = .4); the conditions C1a and C1b did not differ significantly (x2 = .46,p = .5).",
        "By contrast, conditions where brevity was kept constant (C2a and C2b) resulted in very significantly higher proportions of +c choices (C2a: x2 = 16.03,p < .001; C2b: x2 = 13.56,p < .001).",
        "No difference was observed between C2a and C2b (x2 = .08, p = .8).",
        "In the tradeoff case (C3a), participants were much more likely to select a +c description than a +b one (x2 = 39.0,p < .001); a majority opted for the (+b, +c) description in the control case (x2 = 39.0,p < .001).",
        "The results strongly support H1 and H2, since participants’ choices are impacted by Coherence.",
        "They do not indicate a preference for brief descriptions, a finding that echoes Jordan’s (2000), to the effect that speakers often relinquish brevity in favour of observing task or discourse constraints.",
        "Since this experiment compared our algorithm against the current state of the art in references to sets, these results do not necessarily warrant the affirmation of the null hypothesis in the case of H3.",
        "We limited Brevity to number of disjuncts, omitting negation, and varying only between length 2 or 3.",
        "Longer or more complex descriptions might evince different tendencies.",
        "Nevertheless, the results show a strong impact of Coherence, compared to (a kind of) brevity, in strong support of the algorithm presented above, as a realisation of the Coherence Model."
