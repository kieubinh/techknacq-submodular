        "In 'traditional' pipelined system architectures, NE tagging is one of the first steps in the pipeline.",
        "NE errors adversely affect subsequent stages, and error rates are often compounded by later stages.",
        "However, (Roth and Yi 2002, 2004) and our recent work have focused on incorporating richer linguistic analysis, using the “feedback” from later stages to improve name taggers.",
        "We expanded our last year’s model (Ji and Grishman, 2005) that used the results of coreference analysis and relation extraction, by adding ‘feedback’ from more information extraction components – name structure parsing, cross-document coreference, and event extraction – to incrementally re-rank the multiple hypotheses from a baseline name tagger.",
        "While together these components produced a further improvement on last year’s model, our goal in this paper is to look behind the overall performance figures in order to understand how these varied components contribute to the improvement, and compare the remaining system errors with the human annotator’s performance.",
        "To this end, we shall decompose the task of name tagging into two subtasks",
        "• Name Identification – The process of identifying name boundaries in the sentence.",
        "• Name Classification – Given the correct",
        "name boundaries, assigning the appropriate name types to them.",
        "and observe the effects that different components have on errors of each type.",
        "Errors of identification will be further subdivided by type (missing names, spurious names, and boundary errors).",
        "We believe such detailed understanding of the benefits of joint inference is a prerequisite for further improvements in name tagging performance.",
        "After summarizing some prior work in this area, describing our baseline NE tagger, and analyzing its errors, we shall illustrate, through a series of examples, the potential for feedback to improve NE performance.",
        "We then present some details on how this improvement can be achieved through hypothesis reranking in the extraction pipeline, and analyze the results in terms of different types of identification and classification errors."

        "Compared to the system, the human annotator’s identification accuracy was much more skewed (52.3% missing, 13.5% spurious), suggesting that a major source of identification error was not difference in judgement but rather names which were simply overlooked by one annotator and picked up by the other.",
