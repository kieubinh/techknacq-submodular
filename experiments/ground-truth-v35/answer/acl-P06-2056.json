        "The theme of this paper is the following assumption: The uncertainty of tokens coming after a sequence helps determine whether a given position is at a boundary.",
        "(A) Intuitively, as illustrated in Figure 1, the variety of successive tokens at each character inside a word monotonically decreases according to the offset length, because the longer the preceding character n-gram, the longer the preceding context and the more it restricts the appearance of possible next tokens.",
        "For example, it is easier to guess which character comes after \"natura\" than after \"na\" .",
        "On the other hand, the uncertainty at the position of a word border becomes greater, and the complexity increases, as the position is out of context.",
        "With the same example, it is difficult to guess which character comes after \"natural \".",
        "This suggests that a word border can be detected by focusing on the differentials of the uncertainty of branching.",
        "In this paper, we report our study on applying this assumption to Chinese word seg",
        "successive tokens and a word boundary mentation by formalizing the uncertainty of successive tokens via the branching entropy (which we mathematically define in the next section.",
        "Our intention in this paper is above all to study the fundamental and scientific statistical property underlying language data, so that it can be applied to language engineering.",
        "The above assumption (A) dates back to the fundamental work done by Harris (Harris, 1955), where he says that when the number of different tokens coming after every prefix of a word marks the maximum value, then the location corresponds to the morpheme boundary.",
        "Recently, with the increasing availability of corpora, this property underlying language has been tested through segmentation into words and morphemes.",
        "Kempe (Kempe, 1999) reports a preliminary experiment to detect word borders in German and English texts by monitoring the entropy of successive characters for 4-grams.",
        "Also, the second author of this paper (Tanaka-Ishii, 2005) have shown how Japanese and Chinese can be segmented into words by formalizing the uncertainty with the branching entropy.",
        "Even though the test data was limited to a small amount in this work, the report suggested how assumption",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics (A) holds better when each of the sequence elements forms a semantic unit.",
        "This motivated our work to conduct a further, larger-scale test in the Chinese language, which is the only human language consisting entirely of ideograms (i.e., semantic units).",
        "In this sense, the choice of Chinese as the language in our work is essential.",
        "If the assumption holds well, the most important and direct application is unsupervised text segmentation into words.",
        "Many works in unsupervised segmentation so far could be interpreted as formulating assumption (A) in a similar sense where branching stays low inside words but increases at a word or morpheme border.",
        "None of these works, however, is directly based on (A), and they introduce other factors within their overall methodologies.",
        "Some works are based on in-word branching frequencies formulated in an original evaluation function, as in (Ando and Lee, 2000) (boundary precision =84.5%, recall= 78.0%, tested on 12500 Japanese ideogram words).",
        "Sun et al.",
        "(Sun et al., 1998) uses mutual information (boundary p=91.8%, no report for recall, 1588 Chinese characters), and Feng(Feng et al., 2004) incorporates branching counts in the evaluation function to be optimized for obtaining boundaries (word precision=76%, recall=78%, 2000 sentences).",
        "From the performance results listed here, we can see that unsupervised segmentation is more difficult, by far, than supervised segmentation; therefore, the algorithms are complex, and previous studies have tended to be limited in terms of both the test corpus size and the target.",
        "In contrast, as assumption (A) is simple, we keep this simplicity in our formalization and directly test the assumption on a large-scale test corpus consisting of 1001 KB manually segmented data with the training corpus consisting of 200 MB of Chinese text.",
        "Chinese is such an important language that supervised segmentation methods are already very mature.",
        "The current state-of-the-art segmentation software developed by (Low et al., 2005), which ranks as the best in the SIGHAN bakeoff (Emerson, 2005), attains word precision and recall of 96.9% and 96.8%, respectively, on the PKU track.",
        "There is also free",
        "software such as (Zhang et al., 2003) whose performance is also high.",
        "Even then, as most supervised methods learn on manually segmented newspaper data, when the input text is not from newspapers, the performance can be insufficient.",
        "Given that the construction of learning data is costly, we believe the performance can be raised by combining the supervised and unsupervised methods.",
        "Consequently, this paper verifies assumption (A) in a fundamental manner for Chinese text and addresses the questions of why and to what extent (A) holds, when applying it to the Chinese word segmentation problem.",

        "Given a set of elements X and a set of n-gram sequences Xn formed of x, the conditional entropy of an element occurring after an n-gram sequence Xn is defined as",
        "where P(x) = P(X = x), P(xlxn) = P(X = xlXn = xn), and P(X = x) indicates the probability of occurrence of x.",
        "A well-known observation on language data states that H(X lXn) decreases as n increases (Bell et al., 1990).",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows how H(X lXn) shifts when n increases from 1 to 8 characters, where n is the length of a word prefix.",
        "This is calculated for all words existing in the test corpus, with the entropy being measured in the learning data (the learning and test data are defined in �4).",
        "This phenomenon indicates that X will become easier to estimate as the context of Xn",
        "gets longer.",
        "This can be intuitively understood: it is easy to guess that \"e\" will follow after \"Hello!",
        "How ar\" , but it is difficult to guess what comes after the short string \"He\".",
        "The last term – log P(xIxn) in the above formula indicates the information of a token of x coming after xn, and thus the branching after xn.",
        "The latter half of the formula, the local entropy value for a given xn, H (XIXn = xn)= – X P(xI xn) log P(xI xn)� x�� (2) indicates the average information of branching for a specific n-gram sequence xn.",
        "As our interest in this paper is this local entropy, we denote H(X IXn = xn) simply as h(xn) in the rest of this paper.",
        "The decrease in H(X IXn) globally indicates that given an n-length sequence xn and another (n+1)-length sequence yn+1, the following inequality holds on average:",
        "One reason why inequality (3) holds for language data is that there is context in language, and yn+1 carries a longer context as compared with xn.",
        "Therefore, if we suppose that xn is the prefix of xn+1, then it is very likely that",
        "holds, because the longer the preceding n-gram, the longer the same context.",
        "For example, it is easier to guess what comes after x6=\"natura\" than what comes after x5 = \"natur\".",
        "Therefore, the decrease in H(X IXn) can be expressed as the concept that if the context is longer, the uncertainty of the branching decreases on average.",
        "Then, taking the logical contraposition, if the uncertainty does not decrease, the context is not longer, which can be interpreted as the following: If the entropy of successive tokens increases, the location is at a context border.",
        "(B) For example, in the case of x7 = \"natural\", the entropy h(\"natural\") should be larger than h(\"natura\"), because it is uncertain what character will allow x7 to succeed.",
        "In the next section, we utilize assumption (B) to detect context boundaries.",
        "Figure 3: Our model for boundary detection based on the entropy of branching 3 Boundary Detection Using the Entropy of Branching Assumption (B) gives a hint on how to utilize the branching entropy as an indicator of the context boundary.",
        "When two semantic units, both longer than 1, are put together, the entropy would appear as in the first figure of Figure 3.",
        "The first semantic unit is from offsets 0 to 4, and the second is from 4 to 8, with each unit formed by elements of X.",
        "In the figure, one possible transition of the branching degree is shown, where the plot at k on the horizontal axis denotes the entropy for h(x0,k) and xn,m denotes the substring between offsets n and m. Ideally, the entropy would take a maximum at 4, because it will decrease as k is increased in the ranges of k < 4 and 4 < k < 8, and at k = 4, it will rise.",
        "Therefore, the position at k = 4 is detected as the \"local maximum value\" when monitoring h(x0,k) over k. The boundary condition after such observation can be redefined as the following: Bmax Boundaries are locations where the entropy is locally maximized.",
        "A similar method is proposed by Harris (Harris, 1955), where morpheme borders can be detected by using the local maximum of the number of different tokens coming after a prefix.",
        "This only holds, however, for semantic units longer than 1.",
        "Units often have a length of",
        "1, especially in our case with Chinese characters as elements, so that there are many one-character words.",
        "If a unit has length 1, then the situation will look like the second graph in Figure 3, where three semantic units, x0,4, x4,5, and x5,8, are present, with the middle unit having length 1.",
        "First, at k = 4, the value of h increases.",
        "At k = 5, the value may increase or decrease, because the longer context results in an uncertainty decrease, though an uncertainty decrease does not necessarily mean a longer context.",
        "When h increases at k = 5, the situation will look like the second graph.",
        "In this case, the condition Bmax will not suffice, and we need a second boundary condition: Bincrease Boundaries are locations where the entropy is increased.",
        "On the other hand, when h decreases at k = 5, then even Bincrease cannot be applied to detect k = 5 as a boundary.",
        "We have other chances to detect k = 5, however, by considering h(xi,k), where 0 < i < k. According to inequality (3), then, a similar trend should be present for plots of h(xi,k), assuming that h(x0,n) > h(x0,n+i); then, we have",
        "The value h(xi,k) would hopefully rise for some i if the boundary at k = 5 is important, although h(xi,k) can increase or decrease at k = 5, just as in the case for h(x0,n).",
        "Therefore, when the target language consists of many one-element units, Bincrease is crucial for collecting all boundaries.",
        "Note that the boundaries detected by Bmax are included in those detected by the condition Bincrease, and also that Bincrease is a boundary condition representing the assumption (B) more directly.",
        "So far, we have considered only regular-order processing: the branching degree is calculated for successive elements of xn.",
        "We can also consider the reverse order, which involves calculating h for the previous element of xn.",
        "In the case of the previous element, the question is whether the head of xn forms the beginning of a context boundary.",
