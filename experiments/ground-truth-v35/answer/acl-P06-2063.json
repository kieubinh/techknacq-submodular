        "Many opinions are being expressed on the Web in such settings as product reviews, personal blogs, and news group message boards.",
        "People increasingly participate to express their opinions online.",
        "This trend has raised many interesting and challenging research topics such as subjectivity detection, semantic orientation classification, and review classification.",
        "Subjectivity detection is the task of identifying subjective words, expressions, and sentences.",
        "(Wiebe et al., 1999; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al., 2003).",
        "Identifying subjectivity helps separate opinions from fact, which may be useful in question answering, summarization, etc.",
        "Semantic orientation classification is a task of determining positive or negative sentiment of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).",
        "Sentiment of phrases and sentences has also been studied in (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "Document level sentiment classification is mostly applied to reviews, where systems assign a positive or negative sentiment for a whole review document (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002).",
        "Building on this work, more sophisticated problems in the opinion domain have been studied by many researchers.",
        "(Bethard et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006) identified the holder (source) of opinions expressed in sentences using various techniques.",
        "(Wilson et al., 2004) focused on the strength of opinion clauses, finding strong and weak opinions.",
        "(Chklovski, 2006) presented a system that aggregates and quantifies degree assessment of opinions scattered throughout web pages.",
        "Beyond document level sentiment classification in online product reviews, (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) concentrated on mining and summarizing reviews by extracting opinion sentences regarding product features.",
        "In this paper, we focus on another challenging yet critical problem of opinion analysis, identifying reasons for opinions, especially for opinions in online product reviews.",
        "The opinion reason identification problem in online reviews seeks to answer the question “What are the reasons that the author of this review likes or dislikes the product?” For example, in hotel reviews, information such as “found 189 positive reviews and 65 negative reviews” may not fully satisfy the information needs of different users.",
        "More useful information would be “This hotel is great for families with young infants” or “Elevators are grouped according to floors, which makes the wait short”.",
        "This work differs in important ways from studies in (Hu and Liu, 2004) and (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).",
        "These approaches extract features",
        "of products and identify sentences that contain opinions about those features by using opinion words and phrases.",
        "Here, we focus on extracting pros and cons which include not only sentences that contain opinion-bearing expressions about products and features but also sentences with reasons why an author of a review writes the review.",
        "Following are examples identified by our system.",
        "It creates duplicate files.",
        "Video drains battery.",
        "It won't play music from all music stores Even though finding reasons in opinion-bearing texts is a critical part of in-depth opinion assessment, no study has been done in this particular vein partly because there is no annotated data.",
        "Labeling each sentence is a time-consuming and costly task.",
        "In this paper, we propose a framework for automatically identifying reasons in online reviews and introduce a novel technique to automatically label training data for this task.",
        "We assume reasons in an online review document are closely related to pros and cons represented in the text.",
        "We leverage the fact that reviews on some websites such as epinions.com already contain pros and cons written by the same author as the reviews.",
        "We use those pros and cons to automatically label sentences in the reviews on which we subsequently train our classification system.",
        "We then apply the resulting system to extract pros and cons from reviews in other websites which do not have specified pros and cons.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a definition of reasons in online reviews in terms of pros and cons.",
        "Section 3 presents our approach to identify them and Section 4 explains our automatic data labeling process.",
        "Section 5 describes experimental and results and finally, in Section 6, we conclude with future work."

        "First, we take a look at how researchers in Computational Linguistics define an opinion for their studies.",
        "It is difficult to define what an opinion means in a computational model because of the difficulty of determining the unit of an opinion.",
        "In general, researchers study opinion at three different levels: word level, sentence level, and document level.",
        "Word level opinion analysis includes word sentiment classification, which views single lexical items (such as good or bad) as sentiment carriers, allowing one to classify words into positive and negative semantic categories.",
        "Studies in sentence level opinion regard the sentence as a minimum unit of opinion.",
        "Researchers try to identify opinion-bearing sentences, classify their sentiment, and identify opinion holders and topics of opinion sentences.",
        "Document level opinion analysis has been mostly applied to review classification, in which a whole document written for a review is judged as carrying either positive or negative sentiment.",
        "Many researchers, however, consider a whole document as the unit of an opinion to be too coarse.",
        "In our study, we take the approach that a review text has a main opinion (recommendation or not) about a given product, but also includes various reasons for recommendation or non-recommendation, which are valuable to identify.",
        "Therefore, we focus on detecting those reasons in online product review.",
        "We also assume that reasons in a review are closely related to pros and cons expressed in the review.",
        "Pros in a product review are sentences that describe reasons why an author of the review likes the product.",
        "Cons are reasons why the author doesn’t like the product.",
        "Based on our observation in online reviews, most reviews have both pros and cons even if sometimes one of them dominates."

        "They investigate the intuition that there are certain words that are frequently used in pro and con sentences which are likely to represent reasons why an author writes a review.",
        "Examples of such words and phrases are: “because” and “that’s why ”.",
        "For positional features, we first find paragraph boundaries in review texts using html tags such as <br> and <p>.",
        "After finding paragraph boundaries, we add features indicating the first, the second, the last, and the second last sentence in a paragraph.",
        "These features test the intuition used in document summarization that important sentences that contain topics in a text have certain positional patterns in a paragraph (Lin and Hovy, 1997), which may apply because reasons like pros and cons in a review document are most important sentences that summarize the whole point of the review.",
        "For opinion-bearing word features, we used preselected opinion-bearing words produced by a combination of two methods.",
        "The first method derived a list of opinion-bearing words from a large news corpus by separating opinion articles such as letters or editorials from news articles which simply reported news or events.",
        "The second method calculated semantic orientations of words based on WordNet2 synonyms.",
        "In our previous work (Kim and Hovy, 2005), we demonstrated that the list of words produced by a combination of those two methods performed very well in detecting opinion bearing sentences.",
        "Both algorithms are described in that paper.",
        "The motivation for including the list of opinion-bearing words as one of our features is that pro and con sentences are quite likely to contain opinion-bearing expressions (even though some of them are only facts), such as “The waiting time was horrible” and “Their portion size of food was extremely generous!” in restaurant reviews.",
        "We presumed pro and con sentences containing only facts, such as “The battery lasted 3 hours, not 5 hours like they advertised”, would be captured by lexical or positional features.",
