        "From the experimental results based on Kazawa’s method, we found that limiting the number of pooled summaries could produce better results than using all the pooled summaries.",
        "However, the number of summaries that can be evaluated by this method was limited.",
        "To improve the Coverage of Kazawa’s method, more summaries and their evaluation results are required, because the Coverage is critically dependent on the number and variety of pooled summaries.",
        "We also investigated an automatic method based on Yasuda’s method and found that the method using ROUGE-2 and 3 could accurately estimate manual scores, and could outperform Kazawa’s method and the other automatic methods tested.",
        "From these results, we can conclude that the automatic method performed the best when ROUGE-2 or 3 is used as a similarity measure, and a regression analysis is used for combining manual method."
