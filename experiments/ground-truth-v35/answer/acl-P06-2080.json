        "Natural language semantic parsing is an interesting problem in NLP (Manning and Schütze, 1999) as it would very likely be part of any interesting NLP applications (Allen, 1995).",
        "For example, the necessary of semantic parsing for most of NLP application and the ability to map natural language to a formal query or command language is critical for developing more user-friendly interfaces.",
        "Recent approaches have focused on using structured prediction for dealing with syntactic parsing (B. Taskar et.",
        "al., 2004) and text chunking problems (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "For semantic parsing, Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) proposed a method for mapping a NL sentence to its logical form by structured classification using a log-linear model that represents a distribution over syntactic and semantic analyses conditioned on the input sentence.",

        "al., 2004) present a discriminative approach to parsing inspired by the large-margin criterion underlying support vector machines in which the loss function is factorized analogous to the decoding process.",

        "Following the successes of the SSVM algorithm to structured prediction, in this paper we exploit the use of SSVM to the semantic parsing problem by modifying the loss function, feature representation, maximization algorithm in the original algorithm for structured outputs (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",
        "Beside that, forming committees or ensembles of learned systems is known to improve accuracy and bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble methods that typically achieve better accuracy than a single classifier (Dietterich, 2000).",
        "This leads to employing ensemble learning models for SSVM is worth to investigate.",
        "The first problem of forming an ensemble learning for semantic parsing is how to obtain individual parsers with respect to the fact that each individual parser performs well enough as well as they make different types of errors.",
        "The second one is that of combining outputs from individual semantic parsers.",
        "The natural way is to use the majority voting strategy that the semantic tree with highest frequency among the outputs obtained by individual parsers is selected.",
        "However, it is not sure that the majority voting technique is effective for combining complex outputs such as a logical form structure.",
        "Thus, a better combination method for semantic tree output should be investigated.",

        "For the averaging phase, the switching model is used subtrees mined from the corpus and a boosting-based algorithm to select the most appropriate output.",
