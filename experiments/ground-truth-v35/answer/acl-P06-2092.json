        "Aligning parallel text, i.e. automatically setting the sentences or words in one text into correspondence with their equivalents in a translation, is a very useful preprocessing step for a range of applications, including but not limited to machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), cross-language information retrieval (Hiemstra, 1996), dictionary creation (Smadja et al., 1996) and induction of NLP-tools (Kuhn, 2004).",
        "Aligned corpora can be also be used in translation studies (Neumann and Hansen-Schirra, 2005).",
        "The alignment of sentences can be done sufficiently well using cues such as sentence length (Gale and Church, 1993) or cognates (Simard et al., 1992).",
        "Word alignment, however, is almost exclusively done using statistics (Brown et al., 1993; Hiemstra, 1996; Vogel et al., 1999; Toutanova et al., 2002).",
        "Hence it is difficult to align so-called rare events, i.e. tokens with a frequency below 10.",
        "This is a considerable drawback, as rare events make up more than half of the vocabulary of any corpus.",
        "Another problem is the correct alignment of multiword units like idioms.",
        "Then, differences in word order are not modelled well by the statistical algorithms.",
        "In order to find solutions to these problems, we have developed a hybrid alignment architecture: it uses statistical information extracted directly from a corpus, and rules or heuristics based on the linguistic information as given by the corpus’ annotation.",
        "Additionally, it is not necessary to compute sentence alignment prior to aligning at the word level.",
        "Instead, the system is capable of interactively and incrementally computing sentence and word alignment, along with alignment at the paragraph and phrase level.",
        "The simultaneous alignment at different levels of granularity imposes restrictions on the way text alignment is computed: we are using a constrained best-first strategy for this purpose.",
        "Although we are currently developing and testing the alignment system for the language pair English-German, we have made sure that it can easily be extended to new language pairs.",
        "In fact, we are currently adding Swedish and French to the set of supported languages.",

        "Additionally, emphasis was laid on the development of language-independent algorithms.",
        "Ideally, such algorithms would not be tailored to align a specific language pair, but would be applicable to any two languages.",

        "Sentence alignment strategies fall roughly into three categories: length-based approaches (Gale and Church, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993) are based on the assumption that the length proportions of a sentence and its translation are roughly the same.",
        "Anchor-based algorithms align sentences based on cues like corpus-specific markup and orthographic similarity (Simard et al., 1992).",
        "The third approach uses bilingual lexical information, e.g. estimated from the corpus (Kay and R¨oscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Fung and McKeown, 1994).",
        "Hybrid methods (Tschorn, 2002) combine these standard approaches such that the shortcomings of one approach are counterbalanced by the strength of another component: length-based methods are very sensitive towards deletions in that a single omission can cause the alignment to go on a wrong track from the point where it occurred to the end of the corpus.",
        "Strategies that assume that orthographic similarity entails translational equivalence rely on the relatedness of the language pair in question.",
        "In closely-related languages like English and French, the amount of orthographically similar words that share the same meaning is higher than in unrelated languages like English and Chinese, were orthographic or even phonetic similarity may only indicate translational equivalence for names.",

        "Both hapax legomena and rare events obviously do not provide sufficient information for statistical analysis.",
        "In the case of word alignment, it is easy to see that they are hard to align: there is virtually no frequency or co-occurrence data with which to compute the alignment.",
        "On the other hand, five to ten percent of a corpus’ vocabulary consists of highly frequent words, i.e. words with frequencies of 100 or above.",
        "These types have the advantage of occurring frequently enough for statistical analysis, however, as they occur at virtually every position in a corpus, they can correspond to anything if alignment decisions are taken on the basis of statistics only.",
        "One solution to this problem would be to use statistics-free rules for alignment, i.e. rules that are insensitive to the rarity or frequency of a word.",
        "However, this means that statistical models either have to be abandoned completely, or that effort has to be put in finding a means to combine both alignment approaches into one single, hybrid system.",

        "The latter approach is clearly insufficient for word alignment quality: it assumes that composi-tionality holds for both the multiword unit and its translation, i.e. that the meaning of the whole unit is made up of the meaning of its part.",
