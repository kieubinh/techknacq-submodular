        "The importance of robust techniques for predicate-argument transformation has motivated the development of large-scale text corpora with predicate-argument annotations such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "These corpora typically take a pragmatic approach to the predicate-argument representations of sentences, where predicates correspond to single word triggers in the surface form of the sentence (typically verb lemmas), and arguments can be identified as substrings of the sentence.",
        "Along with the development of annotated corpora, researchers have developed new techniques for automatically identifying the arguments of predications by labeling text segments in sentences with semantic roles.",

        "However, the encoding of individual parse tree paths for predicates is wholly dependent on the characteristics of the parse tree of a sentence, for which competing approaches could be taken.",

        "A parse tree path can be described as a sequence of transitions up and down a parse tree from the target word to the governing node, as exemplified in Figure 1.",
        "The encoding of the parse tree path feature is dependent on the syntactic representation that is produced by the parser.",
        "This, in turn, is dependant on the training corpus used to build the parser, and the conditioning factors in its probability model.",
        "As result, encodings of parse tree paths can vary greatly depending on the parser that is used, yielding parse tree paths that vary in their ability to generalize across sentences.",
        "In this paper we explore the characteristics of parse tree paths with respect to different approaches to automated parsing.",
        "We were particularly interested in comparing traditional constituency parsing (as exemplified in Figure 1) with dependency parsing, specifically the Minipar system built by Lin (1998).",
        "Minipar is increasingly being used in semantics-based nlp applications (e.g. Pantel & Lin, 2002).",

        "Our motivation for exploring the use of Minipar in for the creation of parse tree paths can be seen by comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2, where",
        "the Minipar path is both shorter and simpler for the same predicate-argument relationship, and could be encoded in various ways that take advantage of the additional semantic and lexical information that is provided.",
        "To compare traditional constituency parsing with dependency parsing, we evaluated the accuracy of argument labeling using parse tree paths generated by two leading constituency parsers and three variations of parse tree paths generated by Minipar, as follows: Charniak: We used the Charniak parser (2000) to extract parse tree paths similar to those found in Palmer et al.",
