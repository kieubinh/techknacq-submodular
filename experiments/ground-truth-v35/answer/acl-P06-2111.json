        "Systems based on distributional similarity provide ranked lists of semantically related words according to the similarity of their contexts.",
        "Synonyms are expected to be among the highest ranks followed by (co)hyponyms and hypernyms, since the highest degree of semantic relatedness next to identity is synonymy.",

        "on the other hand.",
        "In this paper we have defined context in a multilingual setting.",
        "In particular, translations of a word into other languages found in parallel corpora are seen as the (translational) context of that word.",
        "We assume that words that share translational contexts are semantically related.",
        "Hence, relatedness of words is measured using distributional similarity in the same way as in the monolingual case but with a different type of context.",
        "Finding translations in parallel data can be approx-'One can define the context of a word in a non-syntactic monolingual way, that is as the document in which it occurs or the n words surrounding it.",
        "From experiments we have done and also building on the observations made by other researchers (Kilgarriff and Yallop, 2000) we can state that this approach generates a type of semantic similarity that is of a looser kind, an associative kind,for example doctor and disease.",

        "Parallel corpora are mostly used for tasks related to WSD.",
        "This paper shows that multilingual word alignments can be applied to acquire synonyms automatically without the need for resources such as bilingual dictionaries.",
        "A comparison with a monolingual syntax-based method shows that the alignment-based method is able to extract synonyms with much greater precision and recall.",
        "A human evaluation shows that the synonyms the alignment-based method finds are often missing in EWN.",
        "This leads us to believe that the precision scores attained by using EWN as a gold standard are too pessimistic.",
        "Furthermore it is good news that we seem to be able to find synonyms that are not yet covered by existing resources.",
        "The precision scores are still not satisfactory and we see plenty of future directions.",
        "We would like to use linguistic processing such as PoS-tagging for word alignment to increase the accuracy of the alignment itself, to deal with compounds more effectively and to be able to filter out proposed synonyms that are of a different word class than the target word.",
        "Furthermore we would like to make use of the distributional similarity score to set a threshold that will remove a lot of errors.",
        "The last thing that remains for future work is to find a more adequate way to combine the",
        "syntax-based and the alignment-based methods."
