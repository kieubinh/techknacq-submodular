        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is generally taken as an intermediate task like part-of-speech (POS) tagging in natural language processing, but it has not so far achieved the sufficient precision for application as POS tagging (for the history of WSD, cf. Ide and Véronis (1998)).",
        "It is partly due to the nature of its complexity and difficulty, and to the widespread disagreement and controversy on its necessity in language engineering, and to the representation of the senses of words, as well as to the validity of its evaluation (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000).",
        "However the endeavour to automatically achieve WSD has been continuous since the earliest work of the 1950’s.",
        "In this paper we specifically investigate the role of semantic hierarchies of lexical knowledge on WSD, using datasets and evaluation methods from SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig,",
        "2000) as these are well known and accepted in the community of computational linguistics.",
        "With respect to whether or not they employ the training materials provided, SENSEVAL roughly categorizes the participating systems into “unsupervised systems” and “supervised systems”.",
        "Those that don’t use the training data are not usually truly unsupervised, being based on lexical knowledge bases such as dictionaries, thesauri or semantic nets to discriminate word senses; conversely the “supervised” systems learn from corpora marked up with word senses.",
        "The fundamental assumption, in our “unsupervised” technique for WSD in this paper, is that the similarity of contextual features of the target with the predefined features of its sense in the lexical knowledge base provides a quantitative cue for identifying the true sense of the target.",
        "The lexical ambiguity of polysemy and ho-monymy, whose distinction is however not absolute as sometimes the senses of word may be intermediate, is the main object of WSD.",
        "Verbs, with their more flexible roles in a sentence, tend to be more polysemous than nouns, so worsening the computational feasibility.",
        "In this paper we disambiguated the sense of a word after its POS tagging has assigned them either a noun or a verb tag.",
        "Furthermore, we deal with nouns and verbs separately."

        "They first computationally employed WordNet to form a “greedy” lexical chain as a substitute of the context to solve the matter of malapropism, where the word sense is decided by its preceding words.",
        "Around the same time, Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) realized a “non-greedy” lexical chain, which determined the word sense after processing of all words, in the context of text summarization.",

        "In this paper we defined the lexical hub and proposed its use for processing word sense disambiguation, achieving results that are comparatively better than most unsupervised systems of SENSEVAL-2 in the literature.",
        "Since WordNet only organizes the paradigmatic relations of words, unlike previous methods, which are only based on WordNet, we fed the syntagmatic relations of words from the EAT into the noun and verb similarity metrics, and significantly improved the results of WSD, given that no back-off was applied.",
        "Moreover, we only utilized the unordered raw context information without any pragmatic knowledge and syntactic information; there is still a lot of work to fuse them in the future research.",
        "In terms of the heuristics evaluated, richness of sense or word connectivity is much more important than the strength of individual word or sense linkages.",
        "An interesting question is whether these results will be borne out in other datasets.",
        "In the forthcoming work we will investigate their validity in the lexical task of SEN-SEVAL-3."
