        "An interesting and important problem in the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) domain is the creation of sub-sentential alignment in a parallel corpus (a bilingual corpus already aligned at the sentence level).",
        "These alignments can later be used to, for example, train SMT systems or extract bilingual lexicons.",
        "Many algorithms have already been proposed for sub-sentential alignment.",
        "Some of them focus on word-to-word alignment ((Brown,97) or (Melamed,97)).",
        "Others allow the generation of phrase-level alignments, such as (Och et al., 1999), (Marcu and Wong, 2002) or (Zhang, Vogel, Waibel, 2003).",
        "However, with the exception of Marcu and Wong, these phrase-level alignment algorithms still place their analyses at the word level; whether by first creating a word-to-word alignment or by computing correlation coefficients between pairs of individual words.",
        "This is, in our opinion, a limitation of these algorithms; mainly because it makes them rely heavily on our capacity to segment a sentence in words.",
        "And defining what a word is is not as easy as it might seem.",
        "In peculiar, in many Asians writings systems (Japanese, Chinese or Thai, for example), there is not a special symbol to delimit words (such as the blank in most non-Asian writing systems).",
        "Current systems usually work around this problem by using a segmentation tool to pre-process the data.",
        "There are however two major disadvantages: - These tools usually need a lot of linguistic knowledge, such as lexical dictionaries and hand-crafted segmentation rules.",
        "So using them somehow reduces the “purity” and universality of the statistical approach.",
        "- These tools are not perfect.",
        "They tend to be very dependent on the domain of the text they are used with.",
        "Besides, they cannot take advantage of the fact that there exist a translation of the sentence in another language.",
        "(Xu, Zens and Ney,2004) have overcome part of these objections by using multiple segmentations of a Chinese sentence and letting a SMT system choose the best one, as well as creating a segmentation lexicon dictionary by considering every Chinese character to be a word in itself and then creating a phrase alignment.",
        "However, it is probable that this technique would meet much more difficulties with Thai, for example (whose characters, unlike Chinese, bear no specific sense) or even Japanese (which use both ideograms and phonetic characters).",
        "Besides, even for more “computer-friendly” languages, relying too much on typographic words may not be the best way to create an alignment.",
        "For example, the translation of a set phrase may contain no word that is a translation of the individual words of this set phrase.",
        "And one could consider languages such as German, which tend to merge words that are in relation in a single typographic word.",
        "For such languages, it could be a good thing to be able to create alignment at an even more basic level than the typographic words.",
        "These thoughts are the main motivations for the development of the alignment algorithm we will expose in this paper.",
        "Its main advantage is that it can be applied whatever is the smallest",

        "And even when working at the character level, it can use larger sequence of characters to create correct alignments.",
        "The problem of the segmentation and of the alignment will be resolved simultaneously: a sentence and its translation will mutually induce a segmentation on one another.",
        "Another advantage of this algorithm is that it is purely statistical: it will not require any information other than the parallel corpus we want to align.",
        "It should be noted here that the phrase-level joint-probability model presented in (Marcu and Wong) can pretend to have the same qualities.",
        "However, it was only applied to word-segmented texts by its authors.",
        "Making use of the EM training, it is also much more complex than our approach.",
        "Before describing our algorithm, we will explain in detail a method for extracting the co-occurrence counts of any substring in a parallel corpus.",

        "For two sentences with N1 and N2 words respectively, there are N1*N2 words that co-occur; but the number of substrings that co-occur is roughly proportional to (N1*N2)^2.",
        "Of course, most substrings in a pair of sentences are not unique in the corpus, which reduces the number of values to be stored.",
        "Still, in most cases, it remains impractical.",
        "For example, the Japanese-English BTEC corpus has more than 11 million unique English (word-) substrings and more than 8 million unique Japanese (character-) substrings.",
        "So there are potentially 88,000 billion co-occurrence values to be stored.",
        "Again, most of these substrings do not co-occur in the corpus, so that non-zero co-occurrences values are only a fraction of this figure.",
        "However, a rough estimation we performed showed that there still would be close to a billion values to store.",
        "With a bigger corpus such as the European Parliament Corpus (more than 600,000 sentences per languages) we have more than 698 millions unique English (word-) substrings and 875 millions unique French (word-) substrings.",
        "And things get much worse if we want to try to work with characters substrings.",
        "To handle this problem, we decided not to try and store the co-occurrences count beforehand, but rather to compute them “on-the-fly”, when they are needed.",

        "Given two substrings S, and S2, we can use their occurrence and co-occurrence counts to compute a correlation coefficient (such as the chi-square statistic, the point-wise mutual information or the Dice coefficient).",

        "This idea needs, however, to be refined.",
        "First, we have to take care of the indirect association problem.",
        "The problem, which was described in (Melamed, 1997) in a word-to-word alignment context, is as follows: if e, is the translation of f, and f2 has a strong monolingual association with f,, e, and f2 will also have a strong correlation.",
        "Melamed assumed that indirect associations are weaker than direct ones, and provided a Competitive Linking Algorithm that does not allow for a word already aligned to be linked to another one.",
        "We will make the same assumption and apply the same solution.",
        "So our algorithm will align the substring pairs with the highest correlation first, and will forbid the subsequent alignment of substrings having a part in common with an already aligned substring.",
        "A side-effect of this procedure is that we will be constrained to produce a single segmentation on both sentences and a single alignment between the components of this segmentation.",
        "According to the application, this might be what we are looking for or not.",
        "But it must be noted that, most of the time, alignments with various granularities are possible, and we will only be able to find one of them.",
        "We will discuss the issue of the granularity of the alignment in part 3.3.",
        "Besides, our approach implicitly considers that the translation of a substring is a substring (there are no discontinuities).",
        "This is of course not the case in general (for example, the English word “not” is usually translated in French by “ne ...pas”).",
        "However, there is most of the time a granularity of alignment at which there is no discontinuity in the alignment components.",
        "Also, it is frequent that a word or a sequence of words in a sentence has no equivalent in the opposite sentence.",
        "That is why it will not be mandatory for our algorithm to align every element of the sentences at all cost.",
        "If, at any point, the substrings that are yet to be linked have correlation coefficients below a certain threshold, the algorithm will not go further.",
        "So, the algorithm can be described as follow: 1 Compute a correlation coefficient for all the substrings pairs in e and f and mark all the elements in e and f as free.",
        "2- Among the substrings which contain only free element, find the pair with the highest correlation.",
