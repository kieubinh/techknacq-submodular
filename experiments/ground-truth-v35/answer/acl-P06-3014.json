        "There are many ways to make use of parsers’ output.",
        "One particular form of data that can be extracted from parses is information about subcategorization.",
        "Subcategorization data comes in two forms: subcategorization frame (SCF) and subcategorization cue (SCC).",
        "SCFs differ from SCCs in that SCFs contain only arguments while SCCs contain both arguments and adjuncts.",
        "Both SCFs and SCCs have been crucial to NLP tasks.",
        "For example, SCFs have been used for verb disambiguation and classification (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Lapata and Brew, 2004; Merlo et al., 2005) and SCCs for semantic role labeling (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Punyakanok et al., 2005).",
        "Current technology for automatically acquiring subcategorization data from corpora usually relies on statistical parsers to generate SCCs.",
        "While great efforts have been made in parsing written texts and extracting subcategorization data from written texts, spoken corpora have received little attention.",
        "This is understandable given that spoken language poses several challenges that are absent in written texts, including disfluency, uncertainty about utterance segmentation and lack of punctuation.",
        "Roland and Jurafsky (1998) have suggested that there are substantial subcategorization differences between written corpora and spoken corpora.",
        "For example, while written corpora show a much higher percentage of passive structures, spoken corpora usually have a higher percentage of zero-anaphora constructions.",
        "We believe that subcategorization data derived from spoken language, if of acceptable quality, would be of more value to NLP tasks involving a syntactic analysis of spoken language, but we do not pursue it here.",

        "For the task of semantic role labeling, the total number of dependents correctly retrieved from the parser’s output affects the accuracy level of the task.",
