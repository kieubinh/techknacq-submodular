        "The primary target audience of the Applied NLP course were masters students, and to a lesser extent, PhD students, in the School of Information Management and Systems.",
        "(Nevertheless, PhD students in computer science and other fields also took the course.)",
        "MIMS students (as the SIMS masters students are known) pursue a professional degree studying information at the intersection of technology and social sciences.",
        "The students’ technical backgrounds vary widely; each year a significant fraction have Computer Science undergraduate degrees, and another significant fraction have social science or humanities backgrounds.",
        "All students have an interest in technology and are required to take some challenging technical courses, but most non-CS background students are uncomfortable with advanced mathematics and are not as comfortable with coding as CS students are.",
        "A key aspect of the program is the capstone final project, completed in the last semester, that (ideally) combines knowledge and skills obtained from throughout the program.",
        "Most students form a team of 3-4 students and build a system, usually to meet the requirements of an outside client or customer (although some students write policy papers and others get involved in research with faculty mem",
        "bers).",
        "Often the execution of these projects makes use of user-centered design, including a needs assessment, and iterative design and testing of the artifact.",
        "These projects often also have a backend design component using database design principles, document engineering modeling, or information architecture and organization principles, with sensitivity to legal considerations for privacy and intellectual property.",
        "Students are required to present their work to an audience of students, faculty, and professionals, produce a written report, and produce a website that describes and demonstrates their work.",
        "In many cases these projects would benefit greatly from content analysis.",
        "Past projects have included a system to query on and monitor news topics as they occur across time and sources, a system to analyze when and where company names are mentioned in text and graph interconnections among them, a system to allow customization of news channels by topic, and systems to search and analyze blogs.",
        "Our past course offerings in this space focused on information retrieval with very little emphasis on content analysis, so students were using only IR-type techniques for these projects.",
        "The state of the art in NLP had advanced sufficiently that the available tools can be employed for a number of projects like these.",
        "Furthermore, it is important for students attempting such projects to have an understanding of what is currently feasible and what is too ambitious.",
        "In fact, I find that this is a key aspect of teaching an applied class: learning what is possible with existing tools, what is feasible but requires more expertise than can be engineered in a semester with existing tools, and what is beyond the scope of current techniques."

        "The main challenges for a hands-on course as I’d envisioned surrounded finding usable interoperable tools, and defining feasible assignments that make use of programming without letting it interfere with learning.",
        "There is of course the inevitable decision of which programming language(s) to work with.",
        "Scripting tools such as python are fast and easy to prototype with, but require the students to learn a new programming language.",
        "Java is attractive because many tools are written in it and the MIMS students were familiar with java – they are required to use it for two of their required courses but still tend to struggle with it.",
        "I did not consider perl since python is a more principled language and is growing in acceptance and in tool availability.",
        "In the end I decided to require the students to learn python because I wanted to use NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002).",
        "One goal of NLTK is to remove the emphasis on programming to enable students to achieve results quickly; and this aligned with my primary goal.",
        "NLTK seemed promising because it contained some well-written tutorials on n-grams, POS tagging and chunking, and contained text categorization modules.",
        "(I also wanted support for entity extraction, which NLTK does not supply.)",
        "NLTK is written in python, and so I decided to try it and have the students learn a new programming language.",
        "As will be described in detail below, our use of NLTK was somewhat successful, but we experienced numerous problems as well.",
        "I made a rather large mistake early on by not spending time introducing python, since I wanted the assignments to correspond to the lectures and did not want to spend lecture time on the programming language itself.",
        "I instructed students who had registered for the course to learn python during the summer, but (not surprisingly) many of did not and had to struggle in the first few weeks.",
        "In retrospect, I realize I should have allowed time for people to learn python, perhaps via a lab session that met only during the first few weeks of class.",
        "Another sticking point was student exposure to regular expressions.",
        "Regex’s were very important and useful practical tools both for tokenization assignments and for shallow parsing.",
        "I assumed that the MIMS students had gotten practice with regular expressions because they are required to take a computer concepts foundations course which I designed several years ago.",
        "Unfortunately, the lecturer who took over the class from me had decided to omit regex’s and related topics.",
        "I realized that I had to do some remedial coverage of the topic, which of course bored the CS students and which was not complete enough for the MIMS students.",
        "Again this suggests that perhaps some kind of lab is needed for getting people caught up in topics, or that perhaps",
        "the first few weeks of the class should be optional for more advanced students.",
        "I was also unable to find an appropriate textbook.",
        "Neither Sch¨utze & Manning nor Jurafsky & Martin focus on the right topics.",
        "The closest in terms of topic is Natural Language Processing for Online Applications by Peter Jackson & Isabelle Moulinier, but much of this book focuses on Information Retrieval (which we teach in two other courses) and did not go into depth on the topics I most cared about.",

        "I touched on it briefly in the second shallow parsing lecture and felt this level of coverage was acceptable because shallow parsing is often as useful if not more so than full parsing for most applications.",
        "Note also the lack of coverage of word sense disambiguation.",
        "This topic is rich in algorithms, but was omitted primarily due to time constraints, but in part because of the lack of well-known applications.",
        "Based on the kinds of capstone projects the MIMS students have done in the past, I knew that the most important techniques for their needs surrounded text categorization and information extraction/entity recognition.",
        "There are terrific software resources for text categorization and the field is fairly mature, so I had my PhD students Preslav Nakov and Barbara Rosario gave the lectures on this topic, in order to provide them with teaching experience.",
        "The functionality provided by named entity recognition is very important for a wide range of real-world applications.",
        "Unfortunately, none of the free tools that we tried were particularly successful.",
        "Those that are available are difficult to configure and get running in a short amount of time, and have virtually no documentation.",

        "Unfortunately, we had to make a mid-course correction when I suddenly realized that text categorization was no longer available in NLTK.",
        "After looking at a number of tools, we decided to use the Weka toolkit for categorization (Witten and Frank, 2000).",
        "We did not want the students to feel they had wasted their time learning python and NLTK, so we decided to make it easy for the students to reuse their python code by providing an interface between it and Weka.",
        "My PhD student Preslav Nakov provided great help by writing code to translate the output of our python code into the input format expected by Weka.",
        "(Weka is written in java but has command line and GUI interfaces, and can read in input files and store models as output files.)",

        "The intention was to show the students that it is easier to automatically distinguish the heterogeneous groups than the homogeneous ones.",
        "We set up the code to allow students to adjust the size of their training and development sets, and to separate out a reserved test set that would be used for comparing students’ solutions.",
        "We challenged the students to get the best scores possible on the held out test set, telling them not to use this test set until they were completely finished training and testing on the development set.",

        "Students remarked on liking reading research papers rather than a textbook (they also liked the relatively light reading load, which I feel was appropriate given the heavy assignment load).",
        "Some students",
        "wanted more emphasis on real-world applications; I think it would be useful to have guest speakers from industry talk about this if possible.",
        "I would like to see more research tools developed to a point to which they can be applied more successfully, especially in the area of information extraction.",
        "I would also recommend to colleagues that careful control be retained over assignments and projects to ensure feasibility in the outcome.",
        "It is more difficult to get good results on class projects in NLP than in other areas I’ve taught.",
        "As we so often see in text analysis work, it can often be difficult to do better than simple word counts for many projects.",
        "I am interested in hearing ideas about how to accommodate both the somewhat technical and the highly technical students, especially in the early parts of the course.",
        "Perhaps the best solution is to offer an optional laboratory section, at least for the first few weeks, but perhaps for the entire term, but this solution obviously requires more resources.",
        "When designing this course I did a fairly extensive web search looking for courses that offered what I was interested in, but didn’t find much.",
        "I used the proceedings of the ACL-02 workshop on teaching NLP (where I learned about NLTK) as well as the NLP Universe.",
        "I think it would be a good idea to start an archive of teaching resources; ACM SIGCHI is in the midst of creating such an educational digital library and this example is worth studying.9"
