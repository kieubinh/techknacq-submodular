        "Goal-oriented spoken dialog systems aim to identify intents of humans, expressed in natural language, and take actions accordingly to satisfy their requests.",
        "The intent of each speaker is identified using a natural language understanding component.",
        "This step can be seen as a multi-label, multi-class call classification problem for customer care applications (Gorin et al., 1997; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999; Gupta et al., To appear, among others).",
        "As an example, consider the utterance I would like to know my account balance, from a financial domain customer care application.",
        "Assuming that the utterance is recognized correctly by the automatic speech recognizer (ASR), the corresponding intent (call-type) would be Request(Balance) and the action would be telling the balance to the user after prompting for the account number or routing this call to the billing department.",
        "Typically these application specific call-types are pre-designed and large amounts of utterances manually labeled with call-types are used for training call classification systems.",
        "For classification, generally word grams are used as features: In the How May I Help You?",
        "(HMIHY) call routing system, selected word -grams, namely salient phrases, which are salient to certain call-types play an important role (Gorin et al., 1997).",
        "For instance, for the above example, the salient phrase “account balance” is strongly associated with the call-type Re-quest(Balance).",
        "Instead of using salient phrases, one can leave the decision of determining useful features (word -grams) to a classification algorithm used as described in (Di Fabbrizio et al., 2002) and (Gupta et al., To appear).",
        "An alternative would be using a vector space model for classification where call-types and utterances are represented as vectors including word grams (Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999).",
        "Call classification is similar to text categorization, except the following: The utterances are much shorter than typical documents used for text categorization (such as broadcast news or newspaper articles).",
        "Since it deals with spontaneous speech, the utterances frequently include disfluencies or are ungrammatical, and ASR output is very noisy, typically one out of every four words is misrecognized (Riccardi and Hakkani-T¨ur, 2003).",
        "Even though the shortness of the utterances may imply the easiness of the call classification task, unfortunately this is not the case.",
        "The call classification error rates typically range between 15% to 30% depending on the application (Gupta et al., To appear).",
        "This is mainly due to the data sparseness problem because of the nature of the input.",
        "Even for simple call-types like Request(Balance), there are many ways of uttering the same intent.",
        "For instance, in one of the applications we used in our experiments, as a response to the greeting prompt, there are 2,697 unique utterances out of 3,547 utterances for that call-type.",
        "Some examples include: I would like to know my account balance How much do I owe you How much is my bill What is my current bill account balance You can help me by telling me what my phone bill is ...",
        "Given this data sparseness, current classification approaches require an extensive amount of labeled data in order to train a call classification system with a reasonable performance.",
        "In this paper, we present methods for extending the classifier’s feature set by generalizing word sequences using syntactic and semantic information represented in compact graphs, called syntactic and semantic graphs (SSGs).",
        "For each sentence or utterance, these graphs include lexical information (words), syntactic information (such as the part of speech tags of the words and the syntactic parse of the utterance), and semantic information (such as the named entities and semantic role labels).",
        "The generalization is expected to help reduce the data sparseness problem by applying various groupings on word sequences.",
        "Furthermore, the classifier is provided with additional syntactic and semantic information which might be useful for the call classification task.",
        "In the following section, we describe the syntactic and semantic graphs.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our approach for call classification using SSGs.",
        "In Section 4, we present the computation of syntactic and semantic information for SSGs.",
        "In the last Section, we present our experiments and results using a spoken dialog system AT&T VoiceTone R Spoken Dialog System (Gupta et al., To appear)."

        "Figure 1 shows the graph for the example sentence I paid six dollars, where bos and eos denote the beginning and end of the sentence, respectively.",
        "Syntactic and semantic graphs are also directed acyclic graphs, formed by adding transitions encoding syntactic and semantic categories of words or word sequences to the word graph.",
        "The first additional information is the part of speech tags of the words.",
        "In the graph, as a parallel transition for each word of the utterance, the part of speech category of the word is added, as shown in Figure 2 for the example sentence.",
        "Note that, the word is prefixed by the token WORD: and the part-of-speech tag is prefixed by the token POS: , in order to distinguish between different types of transitions in the graph.",
        "The other type of information that is encoded in these graphs is the syntactic parse of each utterance, namely the syntactic phrases with their head words.",
        "For example in the sentence I paid six dollars, six dollars is a noun phrase with the head word dollars.",
        "In Figure 2, the labels of the transitions for syntactic phrases are prefixed by the token PHRASE:.",
        "There",
        "fore, six dollars is also represented by the transition labeled PHRASE:NP dollars.",
        "As an alternative, one may drop the head word of the phrase from the representation, or insert an epsilon transition parallel to the transitions of the modifiers of the head word to eliminate them from some -grams.",
        "Generic named entity tags, such as person, location and organization names and task-dependent named entity tags, such as drug names in a medical domain, are also incorporated into the graph, where applicable.",
        "For instance, for the example sentence, six dollars is a monetary amount, so the arc NE: m is inserted parallel to that sequence.",
        "As another source of semantic information, semantic role labels of the utterance components are incorporated to the SSGs.",
        "The semantic role labels represent the predicate/argument structure of each sentence: Given a predicate, the goal is to identify all of its arguments and their semantic roles.",
        "For example, in the example sentence the predicate is pay, the agent of this predicate is I and the amount is six dollars.",
        "In the graph, the labels of the transitions for semantic roles are prefixed by the token SRL: and the corresponding predicate.",
        "For example, the sequence six dollars is the amount of the predicate pay, and this is shown by the transition with label SRL:pay.A1 following the PropBank notation (Kingsbury et al., 2002)1.",
        "In this work, we were only able to incorporate part-of-speech tags, syntactic parses, named entity tags and semantic role labels in the syntactic and semantic graphs.",

        "We expect the SSGs to help call classification because of the following reasons: First of all, the additional information is expected to provide some generalization, by allowing new grams to be encoded in the utterance graph since SSGs provide syntactic and semantic groupings.",
        "For example, the words a and the both have the part-of-speech tag category DT (determiner), or all the numbers are mapped to a cardinal number (CD), like the six in the example sentence.",

        "The head words of the syntactic phrases and predicate of the arguments are included in the SSGs.",

        "As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the gram WORD: copy WORD: of PHRASE: NP bill appears for both utterances, since both subsequences my bill and a past due bill are nothing but noun phrases with the head word bill.",
        "Another motivation is that, when using simply the word grams in an utterance, the classifier is only given lexical information.",
