        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the central problems in Natural Language Processing.",
        "The difficulty of this task lies in the fact that context features and the corresponding statistical distribution are different for each individual word.",
        "Traditionally, WSD involves training the context classification models for each ambiguous word.",
        "(Gale et al.",
        "1992) uses the Naïve Bayes method for context classification which requires a manually annotated corpus for each ambiguous word.",
        "This causes a serious Knowledge Bottleneck.",
        "The bottleneck is particularly serious when considering the domain dependency of word senses.",
        "To overcome the Knowledge Bottleneck, unsupervised or weakly supervised learning approaches have been proposed.",
        "These include the bootstrapping approach (Yarowsky 1995) and the context clustering approach (Schiitze 1998).",
        "The above unsupervised or weakly supervised learning approaches are less subject to the Knowledge Bottleneck.",
        "For example, (Yarowsky 1995) only requires sense number and a few seeds for each sense of an ambiguous word (hereafter called keyword).",
        "(Schiitze 1998) may only need minimal annotation to map the resulting context clusters onto external thesaurus for benchmarking and application-related purposes.",
        "Both methods are based on trigger words only.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach based on learning word-independent context pair classification model.",
        "This idea may be traced back to (Schiitze 1998) where context clusters based on generic Euclidean distance are regarded as distinct word senses.",
        "Different from (Schiitze 1998), we observe that generic context clusters may not always correspond to distinct word senses.",
        "Therefore, we used supervised machine learning to model the relationships between the context distinctness and the sense distinctness.",
        "Although supervised machine learning is used for the context pair classification model, our overall system belongs to the weakly supervised category because the learned context pair classification",
        "model is independent of the keyword for disambiguation.",
        "Our system does not need human-annotated instances for each target ambiguous word.",
        "The weak supervision is performed by using a limited amount of existing annotated corpus which does not need to include the target word set.",
        "The insight is that the correlation regularity between the sense distinction and the context distinction can be captured at Part-of-Speech category level, independent of individual words or word senses.",
        "Since context determines the sense of a word, a reasonable hypothesis is that there is some mechanism in the human comprehension process that will decide when two contexts are similar (or dissimilar) enough to trigger our interpretation of a word in the contexts as one meaning (or as two different meanings).",
        "We can model this mechanism by capturing the sense distinction regularity at category level.",
        "In the light of this, a maximum entropy model is trained to determine if a pair of contexts of the same keyword refers to the same or different word senses.",
        "The maximum entropy modeling is based on heterogeneous context features that involve both trigger words and parsing structures.",
        "To ensure the resulting model’s independency of individual words, the keywords used in training are different from the keywords used in benchmarking.",
        "For any target keyword, a collection of contexts is retrieved from a large raw document pool.",
        "Context clustering is performed to derive the optimal context clusters which globally fit the local context pair classification results.",
        "Here statistical annealing is used for its optimal performance.",
        "In benchmarking, a mapping procedure is required to correlate the context clusters with external ontology senses.",
        "In what follows, Section 2 formulates the maximum entropy model for context pair classification.",
        "The context clustering algorithm, including the object function of the clustering and the statistical annealing-based optimization, is described in Section 3.",

        "In this section, we study the context pair classification task, i.e. given a pair of contexts C, and Cj of the same target word, are they referring to the same sense?",
        "This task is formulated as comparing the following conditional probabilities: PrS, = Sj CS,,j and PrS, # Sj CS,,j .",
        "Unlike traditional context classification for WSD where statistical model is trained for each individual word, our context pair classification model is trained for each Part-of-speech (POS) category.",
        "The reason for choosing POS as the appropriate category for learning the context similarity is that the parsing structures, hence the context representation, are different for different POS categories.",
        "The training corpora are constructed using the Senseval-2 English Lexical Sample training corpus.",
        "To ensure the resulting model’s independency of individual words, the target words used for benchmarking (which will be the ambiguous words used in Senseval-3 English Lexicon Sample task) are carefully removed in the corpus construction process.",

        "Positive instances are constructed using context pairs referring to the same sense of a word.",
        "Negative instances are constructed using context pairs that refer to different senses of a word.",
        "For each POS category, we have constructed about 36,000 instances, half positive and half negative.",
        "The instances are represented as pairwise context similarities, taking the form of f } .",
        "Before presenting the context similarity features we used, we first introduce the two categories of the involved context features: i) Co-occurring trigger words within a predefined window size equal to 50 words to both sides of the keyword.",
        "The trigger words are learned from a TIPSTER document pool containing ~170 million words of AP and WSJ news articles.",
        "Following (Schiitze 1998), 2 is used to measure the cohesion between the keyword and a co-occurring word.",
        "In our ex",
        "periment, all the words are first sorted based on its 2 with the keyword, and then the top 2,000 words are selected as trigger words.",
        "ii) Parsing relationships associated with the keyword automatically decoded by a broad-coverage parser, with F-measure (i.e. the precision-recall combined score) at about 85% (reference temporarily omitted for the sake of blind review).",
        "The logical dependency relationships being utilized are listed below.",
        "Based on the above context features, the following three categories of context similarity features are defined: (1) VSM-based (Vector Space Model based) trigger word similarity: the trigger words around the keyword are represented as a vector, and the word i in context j is weighted as follows:",
        "where tf (i, j) is the frequency of word i in the j-th context; D is the number of documents in the pool; and df (i) is the number of documents containing the word i.",
        "D and df (i) are estimated using the document pool introduced above.",
        "The cosine of the angle between two resulting vectors is used as the context similarity measure.",
        "(2) LSA-based (Latent Semantic Analysis based) trigger word similarity: LSA (Deerwester et al.",
        "1990) is a technique used to uncover the underlying semantics based on co-occurrence data.",
        "The first step of LSA is to construct word-vs.-document co-occurrence matrix.",
        "Then singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed on this co-occurring matrix.",
        "The key idea of LSA is to reduce noise or insignificant association patterns by filtering the insignificant components uncovered by SVD.",
        "This is done by keeping only the top k singular values.",
        "By using the resulting word-vs.document co-occurrence matrix after the filtering, each word can be represented as a vector in the semantic space.",
        "In our experiment, we constructed the original word-vs.-document co-occurring matrix as follows: 100,000 documents from the TIPSTER corpus were used to construct the co-occurring matrix.",
        "We processed these documents using our POS tagger, and selected the top n most frequently mentioned words from each POS category as base words: top 20,000 common nouns top 40,000 proper names top 10,000 verbs top 10,000 adjectives top 2,000 adverbs In performing SVD, we set k (i.e. the number of nonzero singular values) as 200, following the practice reported in (Deerwester et al.",
        "1990) and (Landauer & Dumais, 1997).",
        "Using the LSA scheme described above, each word is represented as a vector in the semantic space.",
        "The co-occurring trigger words are represented as a vector summation.",
        "Then the cosine of the angle between the two resulting vector summations is computed, and used as the context similarity measure.",
        "(3) LSA-based parsing relationship similarity: each relationship is in the form of R (w) .",
        "Using LSA, each word w is represented as a",
        "semantic vector Vw .",
        "The similarity between R (w1) and R (w2) is represented as the cosine of the angle between Vw1 and Vw2.",
        "Two special values are assigned to two exceptional cases: (i) when no relationship R is decoded in both contexts; (ii) when the relationship R is decoded only for one context.",
        "In matching parsing relationships in a context pair, if only exact node match counts, very few cases can be covered, hence significantly reducing the effect of the parser in this task.",
        "To solve this problem, LSA is used as a type of synonym expansion in matching.",
        "For example, using LSA, the following word similarity values are generated: similarity(good, good) 1.00 similarity(good, pretty) 0.79 similarity(good, great) 0.72 Given a context pair of a noun keyword, suppose the first context involves a relationship has-adjective-modifier whose value is good, and the second context involves the same relationship has-adjective-modifier with the value pretty, then the system assigns 0.79 as the similarity value for this relationship pair.",
        "To facilitate the maximum entropy modeling in the later stage, all the three categories of the resulting similarity values are discretized into 10 integers.",
        "Now the pairwise context similarity is represented as a set of similarity features, e.g. { V SM-Trigger-Words-S imilairty-equal-to-2, LSA-Trigger-Words-Similarity-equal-to-1, LSA-Subject-Similarity-equal-to-2}.",
        "In addition to the three categories of basic context similarity features defined above, we also define induced context similarity features by combining basic context similarity features using the logical and operator.",
        "With induced features, the context similarity vector in the previous example is represented as",
        "and LSA-Trigger-Word-Similarity-equal-to-1 and LSA-Subject-Similarity-equal-to-2] } The induced features provide direct and fine-grained information, but suffer from less sampling space.",
        "Combining basic features and induced features under a smoothing scheme, maximum entropy modeling may achieve optimal performance.",
        "Using the context similarity features defined above, the training corpora for the context pair classification model is in the following format: Instance _0 tag--”positive” {VSM-Trigger-WordSimilairty-equal-to-2, ...} Instance _1 tag--”negative” {VSM-Trigger-WordSimilairty-equal-to-0, ...} where positive tag denotes a context pair associated with same sense, and negative tag denotes a context pair associated with different senses.",
        "The maximum entropy modeling is used to compute the conditional probabilities PrSi = Sj CSi ,j and PrSi � Sj CSi,j: once the context pair CSi ,j is represented as { f } , the conditional probability is given as Pr(t{fa}) 1 i iwt,f (1) Z where t E Si = Sj, Si # Sj } , Z is the normalization factor, wt ,f is the weight associated with tag t and feature f .",
        "Using the training corpora constructed above, the weights can be computed based on Iterative Scaling algorithm (Pietra etc.",
