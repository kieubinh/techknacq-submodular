        "Most prior research in part-of-speech (POS) tagging has focused on supervised learning over a tagset such as the Penn Treebank tagset for English, which is restricted to features that are morphologically distinguished in the focus language.",
        "Thus the only verb person/number distinction made in the Brown Corpus/Penn Treebank tagset is VBZ (3rd-person-singular-present), with no corresponding person/number distinction in other tenses.",
        "Similarly, adjectives in English POS tagsets typically have no distinctions for person, number or case because such properties have no morphological surface distinction, although they do for many other languages.",
        "This essential limitation of the Brown/Penn POS subtag inventory to morphologically realized distinctions in English dramatically simplifies the problem by reducing the tag entropy per surface form (the adjective tall has only one POS tag (JJ) rather than numerous singular, plural, nominative, accusative, etc.",
        "variants), increasing both the standalone effectiveness of lexical prior models and word-suffix models for part-of-speech tagging.",
        "However, for many multilingual applications, including feature-based word alignment in bilingual corpora and machine translation into morphologically richer languages, it is helpful to extract finer-grained lexical analyses on the English side that more closely parallel the morphologically realized tagset of the second (source or target) language.",
        "In particular, prior work on translingual part-of-speech tagger projection via parallel bilingual corpora (e.g. Yarowsky et al., 2001) has been limited to inducing part-of-speech taggers in second languages (such as French or Czech) that only assign tags at the granularity of their source language (i.e.",
        "This paper presents an original approach to part-of-speech tagging of fine-grained features (such as case, aspect, and adjective person/number) in languages such as English where these properties are generally not morphologically marked.",
        "The goals of such rich lexical tagging in English are to provide additional features for word alignment models in bilingual corpora (for statistical machine translation), and to provide an information source for part-of-speech tagger induction in new languages via tag projection across bilingual corpora.",
        "First, we present a classifier-combination approach to tagging English bitext with very fine-grained part-of-speech tags necessary for annotating morphologically richer languages such as Czech and French, combining the extracted features of three major English parsers, and achieve fine-grained-tag-level syntactic analysis accuracy higher than any individual parser.",
        "Second, we present experimental results for the cross-language projection of part-of-speech taggers in Czech and French via word-aligned bitext, achieving successful fine-grained part-of-speech tagging of these languages without any Czech or French training data of any kind.",
        "the Penn Treebank-granularity distinctions from English).",
        "The much richer English tagsets achieved here can allow these tagger projection techniques to transfer richer tag distinctions (such as case and verb person/number) that are important to the full analysis of these languages, using only bilingual corpora with the morphologically impoverished English.",
        "For quickly retargetable machine translation, the primary focus of effort is overcoming the extreme scarcity of resources for the low density source language.",
        "Sparsity of conditioning events for a translation model can be greatly reduced by the availability of automatic source-language analysis.",
        "In this research we attempt to induce models for the automatic analysis of morphological features such as case, tense, number, and polarity in both the source and target languages with this end in mind."
