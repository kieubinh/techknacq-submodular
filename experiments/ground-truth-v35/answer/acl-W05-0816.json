        "Aligned parallel corpora are collections of pairs of sentences where one sentence is a translation of the other.",

        "Such corpora are useful for statistical NLP, algorithms based on unsupervised learning, automatic creation of resources, and many other applications.",
        "Over the last fifteen years, several algorithms have been proposed for sentence alignment.",
        "Their performance as reported is excellent (in most cases not less",
        "than 95%, and usually 98 to 99% and above).",
        "The evaluation is performed in terms of precision, and sometimes also recall.",
        "The figures are given for one or (less frequently) more corpus sizes.",
        "While this does give an indication of the performance of an algorithm, the variation in performance under varying conditions has not been considered in most cases.",
        "Very little information is given about the conditions under which evaluation was performed.",
        "This gives the impression that the algorithm will perform with the reported precision and recall under all conditions.",
        "We have tested several algorithms under different conditions and our results show that the performance of a sentence alignment algorithm varies significantly, depending on the conditions of testing.",
        "Based on these results, we propose a method of evaluation that will give a better estimate of the performance of a sentence alignment algorithm and will allow a more meaningful comparison.",
        "Our view is that unless this is done, it will not be possible to pick up the best algorithm for certain set of conditions.",
        "Those who want to align parallel corpora may end up picking up a less suitable algorithm for their purposes.",
        "We have used the proposed method for comparing four algorithms under different conditions.",
        "Finally, we also suggest some guidelines for using these algorithms for actual alignment."

      "heading": "3 Factors in Performance",
      "text": [
        "As stated above, the performance of a sentence alignment algorithm depends on some identifiable factors.",
        "We can even make predictions about whether the performance will increase or decrease.",
        "However, as the results given later show, the algorithms don’t always behave in a predictable way.",
        "For example, one of the algorithms did worse rather than better on an ‘easier’ corpus.",
        "This variation in performance is quite significant and it cannot be ignored for actual alignment (table-1).",
        "Some of these factors have been indicated in earlier papers, but these were not taken into account while evaluating, nor were their effects studied.",
        "Translation of a text can be fairly literal or it can be a recreation, with a whole range between these two extremes.",
        "Paragraphs and/or sentences can be dropped or added.",
        "In actual corpora, there can even be noise (sentences which are not translations at all and may not even be part of the actual text).",
        "This can happen due to fact that the texts have been extracted from some other format such as web pages.",
        "While translating, sentences can also be merged or split.",
        "Thus, the SL and TL corpora may differ in size.",
        "All these factors affect the performance of an algorithm in terms of, say, precision, recall and F-measure.",
        "For example, we can expect the performance to worsen if there is an increase in additions, deletions, or noise.",
        "And if the texts were translated fairly literally, statistical algorithms are likely to perform better.",
        "However, our results show that this does not happen for all the algorithms.",
        "The linguistic distance between SL and TL can also play a role in performance.",
        "The simplest measure of this distance is in terms of the distance on the family tree model.",
        "Other measures could be the number of cognate words or some measure based on syntactic features.",
        "For our purposes, it may not be necessary to have a quantitative measure of linguistic distance.",
        "The important point is that for languages that are distant, some algorithms may not perform too well, if they rely on some closeness between languages.",
        "For example, an algorithm based on cognates is likely to work better for English-French or English-German than for English-Hindi, because there are fewer cognates for English-Hindi.",
        "It won’t be without a basis to say that Hindi is more distant from English than is German.",
        "English and German belong to the Indo-Germanic branch whereas Hindi belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch.",
        "There are many more cognates between English and German than between English and Hindi.",
        "Similarly, as compared to French, Hindi is also distant from English in terms of morphology.",
        "The vibhaktis of Hindi can adversely affect the performance of sentence length (especially word count) as well as word correspondence based algorithms.",
        "From the syntactic point of view, Hindi is a comparatively free word order language, but with a preference for the SOV (subject-object-verb) order, whereas English is more of a fixed word order and SVO type language.",
        "For sentence length and IBM model-1 based sentence",
        "alignment, this doesn’t matter since they don’t take the word order into account.",
        "However, Melamed’s algorithm (Melamed, 1996), though it allows ‘non-monotonic chains’ (thus taking care of some difference in word order), is somewhat sensitive to the word order.",
        "As Melamed states, how it will fare with languages with more word variation than English and French is an open question.",
        "Another aspect of the performance which may not seem important from NLP-research point of view, is its speed.",
        "Someone who has to use these algorithms for actual alignment of large corpora (say, more than 1000 sentences) will have to realize the importance of speed.",
        "Any algorithm which does worse than O(n) is bound to create problems for large sizes.",
        "Obviously, an algorithm that can align 5000 sentences in 1 hour is preferable to the one which takes three days, even if the latter is marginally more accurate.",
        "Similarly, the one which takes 2 minutes for 100 sentences, but 16 minutes for 200 sentences will be difficult to use for practical purposes.",
        "Actual corpora may be as large as a million sentences.",
        "As an estimate of the speed, we also give the runtimes for the various runs of all the four algorithms tested.",
        "Some algorithms, like those based on cognate matching, may even be sensitive to the encoding or notation used for the text.",
        "One of the algorithms tested (Melamed, 1996) gave worse performance when we used a notation called ITRANS for the Hindi text, instead of the WX-notation.1"

        "We used a systematic evaluation method for selecting a sentence alignment algorithm with English and Hindi as the language pair.",
        "We tested four algorithms for different corpus types and sizes, for the same and different sizes of SL and TL corpora, as well as presence and absence of noise.",
        "The evaluation scheme we have described can be used for a more meaningful comparison of sentence alignment algorithms.",
        "The results of the evaluation show that the performance depends on various factors.",
        "The direction of this variation (increase or decrease) was as predicted in most of the cases, but some results were unexpected.",
        "We also presented some suggestions on using an algorithm for actual alignment."
