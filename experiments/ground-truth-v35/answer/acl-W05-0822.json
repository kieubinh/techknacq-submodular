        "The rapid growth of the Internet has led to a rapid growth in the need for information exchange among different languages.",

        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), a data-driven approach to producing translation systems, is becoming a practical solution to the longstanding goal of cheap natural language processing.",
        "In this paper, we describe Portage, a statistical phrase-based machine translation system, which we evaluated on all different language pairs that were provided for the shared task.",
        "As Portage is a very",
        "new system, our main goal in participating in the workshop was to test it out on different language pairs, and to establish baseline performance for the purpose of comparison against other systems and against future improvements.",
        "To do this, we used a fairly standard configuration for phrase-based SMT, described in the next section.",
        "Of the language pairs in the shared task, French-English is particularly interesting to us in light of Canada’s demographics and policy of official bilingualism.",
        "We therefore divided our participation into two parts: one stream for French-English and another for Finnish-, German-, and Spanish-English.",
        "For the French-English stream, we tested the use of additional data resources along with hand-coded rules for translating numbers and dates.",
        "For the other streams, we used only the provided resources in a purely statistical framework (although we also investigated several automatic methods of coping with Finnish morphology).",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the architecture of the Portage system, including its hand-coded rules for French-English.",
        "Experimental results for the four pairs of languages are reported in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 concludes and gives pointers to future work."

        "Portage operates in three main phases: preprocessing of raw data into tokens, with translation suggestions for some words or phrases generated by rules; decoding to produce one or more translation hypotheses; and error-driven rescoring to choose the best final hypothesis.",

      "text": [
        "Preprocessing is a necessary first step in order to convert raw texts in both source and target languages into a format suitable for both model training and decoding (Foster et al., 2003).",
        "For the supplied Europarl corpora, we relied on the existing segmentation and tokenization, except for French, which we manipulated slightly to bring into line with our existing conventions (e.g., converting l ’ an into l’ an).",
        "For the Hansard corpus used to supplement our French-English resources (described in section 3 below), we used our own alignment based on Moore’s algorithm (Moore, 2002), segmentation, and tokenization procedures.",
        "Languages with rich morphology are often problematic for statistical machine translation because the available data lacks instances of all possible forms of a word to efficiently train a translation system.",
        "In a language like German, new words can be formed by compounding (writing two or more words together without a space or a hyphen in between).",
        "Segmentation is a crucial step in preprocessing languages such as German and Finnish texts.",
        "In addition to these simple operations, we also developed a rule-based component to detect numbers and dates in the source text and identify their translation in the target text.",
        "This component was developed on the Hansard corpus, and applied to the French-English texts (i.e. Europarl and Hansard), on the development data in both languages, and on the test data."

      "heading": "2.2 Decoding",
      "text": [
        "Decoding is the central phase in SMT, involving a search for the hypotheses t that have highest probabilities of being translations of the current source sentence s according to a model for P(t|s).",
        "Our model for P(t|s) is a log-linear combination of four main components: one or more trigram language models, one or more phrase translation models, a distortion model, and a word-length feature.",
        "The trigram language model is implemented in the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "The phrase-based translation model is similar to the one described in (Koehn, 2004), and relies on symmetrized IBM model 2 word-alignments for phrase pair induction.",
        "The distortion model is also very similar to Koehn’s, with the exception of a final cost to account for sentence endings.",
        "To set weights on the components of the log-linear model, we implemented Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003).",
        "This essentially involves generating, in an iterative process, a set of nbest translation hypotheses that are representative of the entire search space for a given set of source sentences.",
        "Once this is accomplished, a variant of Powell’s algorithm is used to find weights that optimize BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) over these hypotheses, compared to reference translations.",
        "Unfortunately, our implementation of this algorithm converged only very slowly to a satisfactory final nbest list, so we used two different ad hoc strategies for setting weights: choosing the best values encountered during the iterations of Och’s algorithm (French-English), and a grid search (all other languages).",
        "To perform the actual translation, we used our decoder, Canoe, which implements a dynamic-programming beam search algorithm based on that of Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004).",
        "Canoe is input-output compatible with Pharaoh , with the exception of a few extensions such as the ability to decode either backwards or forwards."

    {
      "heading": "2.3 Rescoring",
      "text": [
        "To improve raw output from Canoe, we used a rescoring strategy: have Canoe generate a list of nbest translations rather than just one, then reorder the list using a model trained with Och’s method to optimize BLEU score.",
        "This is identical to the final pass of the algorithm described in the previous section, except for the use of a more powerful log-linear model than would have been feasible to use inside the decoder.",
        "In addition to the four basic features of the initial model, our rescoring model included IBM2 model probabilities in both directions (i.e., P(s|t) and P(t|s)); and an IBM1-based feature designed to detect whether any words in one language seemed to be left without satisfactory translations in the other language.",
        "This missing-word feature was also applied in both directions."

        "A noteworthy feature of these results is that the improvement given by the out-of-domain Hansard corpus was very slight.",
