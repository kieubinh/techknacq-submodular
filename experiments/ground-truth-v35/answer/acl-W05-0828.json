      "text": [
        "”The problem of robust, efficient and reliable speech-to-speech translation can only be cracked by the combined muscle of deep and shallow processing approaches.” (Wahlster, 2001) Although this statement has been coined in the context of VerbMo-bil, aiming at translation for direct communication, it appears also realistic for many other translation scenarios, where demands on robustness, coverage, or adaptability on the input side and quality on the output side go beyond today’s technological possibilities.",
        "The increasing availability of MT engines and the need for better quality has motivated considerable efforts to combine multiple engines into one “super-engine” that is hopefully better than any of its ingredients, an idea pionieered in (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "So far, the larger group of related publications has focused on the task of selecting, from a set of translation candidates obtained from different engines, one translation that looks most promising (Tidhar and K¨ussner, 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Callison-Burch and Flournoy, 2001; Akiba et al., 2002; Nomoto, 2004).",
        "But also the more challenging problem of decomposing the candidates and reassembling from the pieces a new sentence, hopefully better than any of the given inputs, has recently gained considerable attention (Rayner and Carter, 1997; Hogan and Frederking, 1998; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005).",
        "Although statistical MT approaches currently come out as winners in most comparative evaluations, it is clear that the achievable quality of methods relying purely on lookup of fixed phrases will be limited by the simple fact that for any given combination of topic, application scenario, language pair, and text style there will never be sufficient amounts of preexisting translations to satisfy the needs of purely data-driven approaches.",
        "Rule-based approaches can exploit the effort that goes into single entries in their knowledge repositories in a broader way, as these entries can be unfolded, via rule applications, into large numbers of possible usages.",
        "However, this increased generality comes at significant costs for the acquisition of the required knowledge, which needs to be encoded by specialists in formalisms requiring extensive training to be used.",
        "In order to push the limits of today’s MT technology, integrative approaches will have to be developed that combine the relative advantages of",
        "both paradigms and use them to compensate for their disadvantages.",
        "In particular, it should be possible to turn single instances of words and constructions found in training data into internal representations that allow them to be used in more general ways.",
        "In a first step towards the development of integrated solutions, we need to investigate the relative strengths and weaknesses of competing systems on the level of the target text, i.e. find out which sentences and which constructions are rendered well by which type of engine.",
        "In a second step, such an analysis will then make it possible to take the outcomes of various engines apart and reassemble from the building blocks new translations that avoid errors made by the individual engines, i.e. to find integrated solutions that improve over the best of the candidates they have been built from.",
        "Once this can be done, the third and final step will involve feed back of corrections into the individual systems, such that differences between system behaviour can trigger (potentially after manual resolution of unclear cases) system updates and mutual learning.",
        "In the long term, one would hope to achieve a setup where a group of MT engines can converge to a committee that typically disagrees only in truly difficult cases.",
        "In such a committee, remaining dissent between the members would be a symptom of unresolved ambiguity, that would warrant the cost of manual intervention by the fact that the system as a whole can actually learn from the additional evidence.",
        "We expect this setup to be particularly effective when existing MT engines have to be ported to new application domains.",
        "Here, a rule-based engine would be able to profit from its more generic knowledge during the early stages of the transition and could teach unseen correspondences of known words and phrases to the SMT engine, whereas the SMT system would bring in its abilities to apply known phrase pairs in novel contexts and quickly learn new vocabulary from examples."

        "In the general picture laid out in the preceding section, statistical MT plays an important role for several reasons.",
        "On one hand, the construction of a relatively well-performing phrase-based SMT system from a given set of parallel corpora is no more overly difficult, especially if – as in the case in this shared task – word alignments and a decoder are provided.",
        "Furthermore, once the second task in our chain will have been surmounted, it will be relatively easy to feed back building blocks of improved translations into the phrase table, which constitutes the central resource of the SMT system Therefore, SMT facilitates experiments aiming at dynamic and interactive adaptation, the results of which should then also be applicable to MT engines that represent knowledge in a more condensed form.",
        "In order to collect material for testing these ideas, we constructed phrase tables for all four languages, following roughly the procedure given in (Koehn, 2004) but deviating in one detail related to the treatment of unaligned words at the beginning or end of the phrases1.",
        "We used the Pharaoh decoder as described on http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/mt-sharedtask/ after normalization of all tables to lower case."

        "As our main interest is in the integration of statistical and rule-based MT, we tried to collect results from “conventional” MT systems that had more or less uniform characteristics across the languages involved.",
        "We could not find MT engines supporting all four source languages, and therefore decided to drop Finnish for this part of the experiment.",
        "We sent the texts of the other three languages through several incarnations of Systran-based MT Web-services2 and through an installation of Lernout & Hauspie Power Translator Pro, Version 6.43.3 1We used slightly more restrictive conditions that resulted in a 5.76% reduction of phrase table size 2 The results were incomplete and different, but sufficiently close to each other so that it did not seem worthwhile to explore the differences systematically.",
        "Instead we ranked the services according to errors in an informal comparison and took for each sentence the first available translation in this order.",
        "3After having collected or computed all translations, we observed that in the case of French, both systems were quite sensitive to the fact that the apostrophes were formatted as separate tokens in the source texts (l ’ homme instead of l’homme).",
        "We therefore modified and retranslated the French texts, but did not explore possible effects of similar transformations in the other languages."

        "We implemented two different ways to select, out of a set of alternative translations of a given sentence, one that looks most promising.",
        "The first approach is purely heuristic and is limited to the case where more than two candidates are given.",
        "For each candidate, we collect a set of features, consisting of words and word n-grams (n E 12, 3, 4}).",
        "Each of these features is weighted by the number of candidates it appears in, and the candidate with the largest feature weight per word is taken.",
        "This can be seen as the similarity of each of the candidate to a prototypical version composed as a weighted mixture of the collection, or as being remotely related to a sentence-specific language model derived from the candidates.",
        "The heuristic measure was used to select “favorite” from each group of competing translations obtained from the same source sentence, yielding a fourth set of translations for the sentences given in DE, FR, and ES.",
        "A particularity of the shared task is the fact that the source sentences of the development and test sets form a parallel corpus.",
        "Therefore, we can not only integrate multiple translations of the same source sentence into a hopefully better version, but we can merge the translations of corresponding parts from different source languages into a target form that combines their advantages.",
        "This approach, called triangulation in (Kay, 1997), can be motivated by the fact that most cases of translation for dissemination involve multiple target languages; hence one can assume that, except for the very first of them, renderings in multiple languages exist and can be used as input to the next step4.",
        "See also (Och and Ney, 2001) for some related empirical evidence.",
        "In order to obtain a first impression of the potential of triangulation in the domain of parliament debates, we applied the selection heuristics to a set of four translations, one from Finnish, the other three the result of the selections mentioned above."

        "These results show that in each group of translations for a given source language, the statistical engine came out best.",
        "Furthermore, our heuristic approach for the selection of the best among a small set of candidate translations did not result in an increase of the measured BLEU score, but typically gave a score that was only slightly better than the second best of the ingredients.",
        "This somewhat disappointing result can be explained in two ways.",
        "Apparently, the selection heuristic does not give effective estimates of translation quality for the candidates.",
        "Furthermore, the granularity on which the choices have to bee made is too coarse, i.e. the pieces for which the symbolic engines do produce better translations than the SMT engine are accompanied by too many bad choices so that the net effect is negative."

        "However, a correct implementation for obtaining these estimates was not available in time, so the selections generated from the statistical language model could not be used for official submissions, but were generated and evaluated after the closing date.",

        "When we started the experiments reported here, the hope was to find relatively simple methods to select the best among a small set of candidate translations and to achieve significant improvements of a hybrid architecture over a purely statistical approach.",
        "Although we could indeed measure certain improvements, these are not yet big enough for a conclusive “proof of concept”.",
        "We have started a refinement of our approach that can not only pick the best among translations of complete sentences, but also judge the quality of the building blocks from which the translations are composed.",
        "First informal results look very promising.",
        "Once we can replace single phrases that appear in one translation by better alternatives taken from a competing candidate, chances are good that a significant increase of the overall translation quality can be achieved."
