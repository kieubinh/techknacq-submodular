        "2.1 QUEEN: Estimating the quality of an automatic summary",
        "QUEEN operates under the assumption that a summary is better if it is closer to the model summaries according to all metrics; it is defined as the probability, measured on M x M x M, that for every metric in X the automatic summary a is closer to a model than two models to each other:",
        "where a is the automatic summary being evaluated, (m, m', m'') are three models in M, and x(a, m) stands for the similarity of m to a.",
        "QUEEN is stated as a probability, and therefore its range of values is [0, 1].",
        "We can think of the QUEEN measure as using a set of tests (every similarity metric in X) to falsify the hypothesis that a given summary a is a model.",
        "Given (a, m, m', m''), we test x(a, m) > x(m', m'') for each metric x. a is accepted as a model only if it passes the test for every metric.",
        "QUEEN(a) is, then, the probability of acceptance for a in the sample space M x M x M. This measure has some interesting properties: (i) it is able to combine different similarity metrics into a single evaluation measure; (ii) it is not affected by the scale properties of individual metrics, i.e. it does not require metric normalisation and it is not affected by metric weighting.",
        "(iii) Peers which are very far from the set of models all receive QUEEN=0.",
        "In other words, QUEEN does not distinguish between very poor summarisation strategies.",
        "(iv) The value of QUEEN is maximised for peers that “merge” with the models under all metrics in X.",
        "(v) The universal quantifier on the metric parameter x implies that adding redundant metrics do not bias the result of QUEEN.",
        "Now the question is: which similarity metrics are adequate to evaluate summaries?",
        "Imagine that we use a similarity metric based on sentence co-selection; it might happen that humans do not agree on which sentences to select, and therefore emulating their sentence selection behaviour is both easy (nobody agrees with each other) and useless.",
        "We need to take into account which are the features that human summaries do share, and evaluate according to them.",
        "This is provided by the KING measure.",
        "2.2 KING: estimating the quality of similarity metrics The measure KINGM,A(X) estimates the quality of a set of similarity metrics X using a set of models M and a set of peers A.",
        "KING is defined as the probability that a model has higher QUEEN value than any peer in a test sample.",
        "Formally:",
        "For example, an ideal metric that puts all models together-would give QUEEN(m) = 1 for all models, and QUEEN(a) = 0 for all peers which are not put together with the models, obtaining KING = 1.",
        "KING satisfies several interesting properties: (i) KING does not depend on the scale properties of the metric; (ii) Adding repeated or very similar peers do not alter the KING measure, which avoids one way of biasing the measure.",
        "(iii) the KING value of random and constant metrics is zero or close to zero.",
        "2.3 JACK: reliability of the peer set Once we detect a difference in quality between two summarisation systems, the question is now whether this result is reliable.",
        "Would we get the same results using a different test set (different examples, different human summarisers (models) or different baseline systems)?",
        "The first step is obviously to apply statistical significance tests to the results.",
        "But even if they give a positive result, it might be insufficient.",
        "The problem is that the estimation of the probabilities in KING assumes that the sample sets M, A are not biased.",
        "If M, A are biased, the results can be statistically significant and yet unreliable.",
        "The set of examples and the behaviour of human summarisers (models) should be somehow controlled either for homogeneity (if the intended profile of examples and/or users is narrow) or representativity (if it is wide).",
        "But how to know whether the set of automatic summaries is representative and therefore is not penalising certain automatic summarisation strategies?",
        "This is addressed by the JACK measure:",
        "i.e. the probability over all model summaries m of finding a couple of automatic summaries a, a' which are closer to m than to each other according to all metrics.",
        "This measure satisfies three desirable properties: (i) it can be enlarged by increasing the similarity of the peers to the models (the x(m, a) factor in the inequalities), i.e. enhancing the quality of the peer set; (ii) it can also be enlarged by decreasing the similarity between automatic summaries (the x(a, a') factor in the inequality), i.e. augmenting the diversity of (independent) automatic summarisation strategies represented in the test bed; (iii) adding elements to A cannot diminish the JACK value, because of the existential quantifier on a, a'."
