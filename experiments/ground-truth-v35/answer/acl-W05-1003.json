        "The assumption that concept attributes and, more in general, features1 are an important aspect of conceptual representation is widespread in all disciplines involved with conceptual representations, from Artificial Intelligence / Knowledge Representation (starting with at least (Woods, 1975) and down to (Baader et al., 2003)), Linguistics (e.g., in the theories of the lexicon based on typed feature structures and/or Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon theory: (Pustejovsky 1995)) and Psychology (Murphy 2002, Vinson et al. 2003).",
        "This being the case, it is surprising how little attention has been devoted to this aspect of lexical representation in work on large-scale lexical semantics in Computational Linguistics.",
        "The most extensive resource at 1 The term attribute is used informally here to indicate the type of relational information about concepts that is expressed using so-called roles in Description Logics (Baader et al., 2003) – i.e., excluding IS-A style information (that cars are vehicles, for instance).",
        "It is meant to be a more restrictive term than the term feature, often used to indicate any property of concepts, particularly in Psychology.",
        "We are carrying out a systematic analysis of the sets of features used in work such as (Vinson et al., 2003) (see Discussion).",
        "our disposal, WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) contains very little information that would be considered as being about ‘attributes’ – only information about parts, not about qualities such as height, or even to the values of such attributes in the adjective network – and this information is still very sparse.",
        "On the other hand, the only work on the extraction of lexical semantic relations we are aware of has concentrated on the type of relations found in WordNet: hyponymy (Hearst, 1998; Caraballo, 1999) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Poesio et al., 2002).2 The work discussed here could be perhaps best described as an example of empirical ontology: using linguistics and philosophical ideas to improve the results of empirical work on lexical / ontology acquisition, and vice versa, using findings from empirical analysis to question some of the assumptions of theoretical work on ontology and the lexicon.",
        "Specifically, we discuss work on the acquisition of (nominal) concept attributes whose goal is twofold: on the one hand, to clarify the notion of ‘attribute’ and its role in lexical semantics, if any; on the other, to develop methods to acquire such information automatically (e.g., to supplement WordNet).",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "After a short review of relevant literature on extracting semantic relations and on attributes in the lexicon, we discuss our classification of attributes, followed by the features we used to classify them.",
        "We then discuss our training methods and the results we achieved."

        "The work discussed here belongs to a line of research attempting to acquire information about lexical and other semantic relations other than similarity / synonymy by identifying syntactic constructions that are often (but not always!)",
        "used to express such relations.",
        "The earliest work of this type we are aware of is the work by Hearst (1998) on acquiring information about hyponymy (= IS-A links) by searching for instances of patterns such as NP {, NP}* or other NP (as in, e.g., bruises .... broken bones and other INJURIES).",
        "A similar approach was used by Berland and Charniak (1999) and Poesio et al. (2002) to extract information about part-of relations using patterns such as the N of the N is .... (as in the wheel of the CAR is) and by Girju and Moldovan (2002) and Sanchez-Graillet and Poesio (2004) to extract causal relations.",
        "In previous work (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004) we used this same approach to extract attributes, using the pattern “the * of the C [is|was]” (suggested by, e.g., (Woods, 1975) as a test for ‘attributehood’) to search for attributes of concept C in the Web, using the Google API.",
        "Although the information extracted this way proved a useful addition to our lexical representations from a clustering perspective, from the point of view of lexicon building this approach results in too many false positives, as very few syntactic constructions are used to express exclusively one type of semantic relation.",
        "For example, the ‘attributes’ of deer extracted using the text pattern above include “the majority of the deer,” “the lake of the deer,” and “the picture of the deer.” Girju and Moldovan (2002) addressed the problem of false positives for causal relations by developing WordNet-based filters to remove unlikely candidates.",

        "According to Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon theory (1995), an integral part of a lexical entry is its Qualia Structure, which consists of four ‘roles’:4 the Formal Role, specifying what type of object it is: e.g., in the case of a book, that it has a shape, a color, etc.",

        "The scheme we used to classify the training data in the experiment discussed below consists of six categories:",
        "• Qualities: Analogous to Guarino’s qualities and Pustejovsky’s formal ‘role’.",
        "(E.g., “the color of the car”.)",
        "• Parts: Related to Guarino’s non-relational attributes and Pustejovsky’s constitutive ‘roles’.",
        "(E.g., “the hood of the car”).",
        "• Related-Objects: A new category intro",
        "duced to cover the numerous physical objects which are ‘related’ to an object but are not part of it – e.g., “the track of the deer”.",
        "• Activities: These include both the types of activities which are part of Pustejovsky’s telic ‘role’ and those which would be included in his agentive ‘role’.",
        "(E.g., “the repairing of the car”.)",
        "• Related-Agents: For the activities in which the concept in question is acted upon, the agent of the activity: e.g., “the writer of the book”, “the driver of the car”.",
        "• Non-Attributes: This category covers the",
        "cases in which the construction “the N of the N” expresses other semantic relations, as in: “the last of the deer”, “the majority of the deer,” “the lake of the deer,” and “in the case of the deer”.",
        "We will quickly add that (i) we do not view this classification as definitive – in fact, we already collapsed the classes ‘part’ and ‘related objects’ in the experiments discussed below – and (ii) not all of these distinctions are very easy even for human judges to do.",
        "For example, design, as an attribute of a car, can be judged to be a quality if we think of it as taking values such as modern and standard; on the other hand, design might also be viewed as an activity in other contexts discussing the designing process.",
        "Another type of difficulty is that a given attribute may express different things for different objects.",
        "For example, introduction is a part of a book, and an activity for a product.",
        "An additional difficulty results from the strong similarity between parts and related-objects.",
        "For example, “key” is a related-object to a car but it is not part of it.",
        "We will return to this issue and to agreement on this classification scheme when discussing the experiment.",
        "One difference from previous work is that we use additional linguistic constructions to extract candidate attributes.",
        "The construction “the X of the Y is” used in our previous work is only one example of genitive construction.",
        "Quirk et al. (1985) list eight types of genitives in English, four of which are useful for our purposes:",

        "Nouns in WordNet are linked to their derivationally related verbs, but there is no indication about which is derived from which.",
        "We use a heuristic based on length to decide this: the system checks if the noun contains more letters than the most similar related verb.",

        "Clustering the concepts using only filtered candidate attributes improved the clustering purity from 0.657 to 0.672.",
        "This improvement in purity is not significant.",
        "However, clustering using only the attributes sanctioned by the 2-way classifier improved the purity further to 0.693, and this improvement in purity from the initial purity was significant (t = 2.646, df = 801, p < 0.05).",

        "The lexicon does not simply contain information about synonymy and hyponymy relations; it also contains information about the attributes of the concepts expressed by senses, as in Qualia structures.",
        "In previous work, we developed techniques for mining candidate attributes from the Web; in this paper we presented a method for improving the quality of attributes thus extracted, based on a classification for attributes derived from work in linguistics and philosophy, and a classifier that automatically tags candidate attributes with such classes.",
        "Both the 2-way and the 5-way classifiers achieve good precision and recall.",
        "Our work also reveals, however, that the notion of attribute is not fully understood.",
        "On the one hand, that attribute judgments are not always easy for humans even given a scheme; on the other hand, the results for certain types of attributes, especially activities and qualities, could certainly be improved.",
        "We also found that whereas attributes of physical objects are relatively easy to classify, the attributes of other types of concepts are harder –particularly with activities.",
        "(See the Appendix for examples.)",
        "Our longer term goal is thus to further clarify the notion of attribute, possibly refining our classification scheme, in collaboration with linguists, philosophers, and psycholinguists.",
        "One comparison we are particularly interested in pursuing at the moment is that with feature lists used by psychologist, for whom knowledge representation is entirely concept-based, and virtually every property of a concept counts as an attribute, including properties that would be viewed as IS-A links and what would be considered a value.",
