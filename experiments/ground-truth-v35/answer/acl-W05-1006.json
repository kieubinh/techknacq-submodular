        "Natural language is full of idiomatic and metaphorical uses.",
        "However, language resources such as dictionaries and lexical knowledge bases give at best poor coverage of such phenomena.",
        "In many cases, knowledge bases will mistakenly ‘recognize’ a word and this can lead to more harm than good: for example, a typical mistake of blunt logic would be to assume that “somebody let the cat out of the bag” implied that “somebody let some mammal out of some container.” Idiomatic generation of natural language is, if anything, an even greater challenge than idiomatic language understanding.",
        "As pointed out decades ago by Fillmore (1967), a complete knowledge of English requires not only an understanding of the semantics of the word good, but also an awareness",
        "that this special adjective (alone) can occur with the word any to construct phrases like “Is this paper any good at all?",
        "”, and traditional lexical resources were not designed to provide this information.",
        "There are many more general examples occur: for example, “the big bad wolf” sounds right and the “the bad big wolf” sounds wrong, even though both versions are syntactically and semantically plausible.",
        "Such examples are perhaps ‘idiomatic’, though we would perhaps not call them ‘idioms’, since they are compositional and can sometimes be predicted by general pattern of word-ordering.",
        "In general, the goal of manually creating a complete lexicon of idioms and idiomatic usage patterns in any language is unattainable, and automatic extraction and modelling techniques have been developed to fill this ever-evolving need.",
        "Firstly, automatically identifying potential idioms and bringing them to the attention of a lexicographer can be used to improve coverage and reduce the time a lexicographer must spend in searching for such examples.",
        "Secondly and more ambitiously, the goal of such work is to enable computers to recognize idioms independently so that the inevitable lack of coverage in language resources does not impede their ability to respond intelligently to natural language input.",
        "In attempting a first-pass at this task, the experiments described in this paper proceed as follows.",
        "We focus on a particular class of idioms that can be extracted using lexicosyntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992), which are fixed patterns in text that suggest that the words occurring in them have some interesting relationship.",
        "The patterns we focus on are occurrences of the form “A and/or B”, where A and",
        "B are both nouns.",
        "Examples include “football and cricket” and “hue and cry.” From this list, we extract those examples for which there is a strong preference on the ordering of the participants.",
        "For example, we do see the pattern “cricket and football,” but rarely if ever encounter the pattern “cry and hue.” Using this technique, 4173 potential idioms were extracted.",
        "This included a number of both true idioms, and words that have regular semantic relationships but do appear to have interesting orderings on these relationships (such as earlier before later, strong before weak, prototype before variant).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 elaborates on some of the previous works that motivate the techniques we have used.",
        "Section 3 describes the precise method used to extract idioms through their asymmetric appearance in a large corpus.",
        "Section 4 presents and analyses several classes of results.",
        "Section 5 describes the methods attempted to filter these results into pairs of words that are more and less contextually related to one another.",
        "These include a statistical method that analyses the original corpus for evidence of semantic relatedness, and a combinatoric method that relies on link-analysis on the resulting graph structure."

        "This section describes previous work in extracting information from text, and inferring semantic or idiomatic properties of words from the information so derived.",
        "The main technique used in this paper to extract groups of words that are semantically or idiomatically related is a form of lexicosyntactic pattern recognition.",
        "Lexicosyntactic patterns were pioneered by Marti Hearst (Hearst, 1992; Hearst and Sch¨utze, 1993) in the early 1990’s, to enable the addition of new information to lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The main insight of this sort of work is that certain regular patterns in word-usage can reflect underlying semantic relationships.",
        "For example, the phrase “France, Germany, Italy, and other European countries” suggests that France, Germany and Italy are part of the class of European countries.",
        "Such hierarchical examples are quite sparse, and greater coverage was later attained by Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998) in extracting relations not of hierarchy but of similarity, by finding conjunctions or co-ordinations such as “cloves, cinammon, and nutmeg” and “cars and trucks.” This work was extended by Caraballo (1999), who built classes of related words in this fashion and then reasoned that if a hierarchical relationship could be extracted for any member of this class, it could be applied to all members of the class.",
        "This technique can often mistakenly reason across an ambiguous middle-term, a situation that was improved upon by Cederberg and Widdows (2003), by combining pattern-based extraction with contextual filtering using latent semantic analysis.",
        "Prior work in discovering non-compositional phrases has been carried out by Lin (1999) and Baldwin et al.",
        "(2003), who also used LSA to distinguish between compositional and non-compositional verb-particle constructions and noun-noun compounds.",
        "At the same time, work in analyzing idioms and asymmetry within linguistics has become more sophisticated, as discussed by Benor and Levy (2004), and many of the semantic factors underlying our results can be understood from a sophisticated theoretical perspective.",
        "Other motivating and related themes of work for this paper include collocation extraction and example based machine translation.",
        "In the work of Smadja (1993) on extracting collocations, preference was given to constructions whose constituents appear in a fixed order, a similar (and more generally implemented) version of our assumption here that asymmetric constructions are more idiomatic than symmetric ones.",
        "Recent advances in example-based machine translation (EBMT) have emphasized the fact that examining patterns of language use can significantly improve idiomatic language generation (Carl and Way, 2003)."

      "text": [
        "This section of the paper describes the techniques used to extract potentially idiomatic patterns from text, as deduced from previously successful experiments in lexical acquisition.",
        "The main extraction technique is to use lexicosyntactic patterns of the form “A, B and/or C” to find nouns that are linked in some way.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence from the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "Ships laden with nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves or coriander once battled the Seven Seas to bring home their precious cargo.",
        "Since the BNC is tagged for parts-of-speech, we know that the words highlighted in bold are nouns.",
        "Since the phrase “nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves or coriander” fits the pattern “A, B, C or D”, we create nodes for each of these nouns and create links between them all.",
        "When applied to the whole of the BNC, these links can be aggregated to form a graph with 99,454 nodes (nouns) and 587,475 links, as described by Widdows and Dorow (2002).",
        "This graph was originally used for lexical acquisition, since clusters of words in the graph often map to recognized semantic classes with great accuracy (> 80%, (Widdows and Dorow, 2002)).",
        "However, for the sake of smoothing over sparse data, these results made the assumption that the links between nodes were symmetric, rather than directed.",
        "In other words, when the pattern “A and/or B” was encountered, a link from A to B and a link from B to A was introduced.",
        "The nature of symmetric and antisymmetric relationships is examined in detail by Widdows (2004).",
        "For the purposes of this paper, it suffices to say that the assumption of symmetry (like the assumption of transitivity) is a powerful tool for improving recall in lexical acquisition, but also leads to serious lapses in precision if the directed nature of links is overlooked, especially if symmetrized links are used to infer semantic similarity.",
        "This problem was brought strikingly to our attention by the examples in Figure 1.",
        "In spite of appearing to be a circle of related concepts, many of the nouns in this group are not similar at all, and many of the links in this graph are derived from very very different contexts.",
        "In Figure 1, cat and mouse are linked (they are re both animals and the phrase “cat and mouse” is used quite often): but then mouse and keyboard are also linked because they are both objects used in computing.",
        "A keyboard, as well as being a typewriter or computer keyboard, is also",
        "used to mean (part of) a musical instrument such as an organ or piano, and keyboard is linked to violin.",
        "A violin and a fiddle are the same instrument (as often happens with synonyms, they don’t appear together often but have many neighbours in common).",
        "The unlikely circle is completed (it turns out) because of the phrase from the nursery rhyme Hey diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow jumped over the moon; It became clear from examples such as these that idiomatic links, like ambiguous words, were a serious problem when using the graph model for lexical acquisition.",
        "However, with ambiguous words, this obstacle has been gradually turned into an opportunity, since we have also developed ways to used the apparent flaws in the model to detect which words are ambiguous in the first place (Widdows, 2004, Ch 4).",
        "It is now proposed that we can take the same opportunity for certain idioms: that is, to use the properties of the graph model to work out which links arise from idiomatic usage rather than semantic similarity."

        "We therefore formed the hypothesis that if the phrase “A and/or B” occurs frequently in a corpus, but the phrase “B and/or A” is absent, then the link between A and B should be attributed to idiomatic usage rather than semantic similarity.",
