        "Although significant improvements in efficiency have been made, parsing speed is still not high enough for practical applications.",
        "The recent introduction of probabilistic models of wide-coverage unification-based grammars (Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) has opened up the novel possibility of increasing parsing speed by guiding the search path using probabilities.",

        "The behavior of their algorithms is like that of the Viterbi algorithm for PCFG parsing, so the correct parse with the highest probability is guaranteed.",
        "The interesting point of this approach is that, once the exhaustive parsing is completed, the probabilities of non-local dependencies, which cannot be computed during parsing, are computed after making a packed parse forest.",
        "Probabilistic models where probabilities are assigned to the CFG backbone of the unification-based grammar have been developed (Kasper et al., 1996; Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Kiefer et al., 2002), and the most probable parse is found by PCFG parsing.",
        "This model is based on PCFG and not probabilistic unification-based grammar parsing.",
        "Geman and Johnson (Geman and Johnson, 2002) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most probable parse in a packed parse forest generated by unification-based grammars without expanding the forest.",

        "Given a sentence, an HPSG computes a set of phrasal signs, i.e., feature structures, as a result of parsing.",
        "Previous studies (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2000; Miyao et al., 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) defined a probabilistic model of unification-based grammars as a log-linear model or maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "The probability of parse result T assigned to given sentence w = (w1, ... , wn) is",

Intuitively, the probability is defined as the normalized product of the weights exp(Ai) when a characteristic corresponding to fi appears in parse result T. Model parameters Ai are estimated using numer",
        "ical optimization methods (Malouf, 2002) so as to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data.",
        "However, the above model cannot be easily estimated because the estimation requires the computation of p(Tlw) for all parse candidates assigned to sentence w. Because the number of parse candidates is exponentially related to the length of the sentence, the estimation is intractable for long sentences.",
        "To make the model estimation tractable, Geman and Johnson (Geman and Johnson, 2002) and Miyao and Tsujii (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for estimating p(T1w).",
        "They assumed that features are functions on nodes in a packed parse forest.",
        "That is, parse tree T is represented by a set of nodes, i.e., T = {c}, and the parse forest is represented by an and/or graph of the nodes.",
        "From this assumption, we can redefine the probability as A packed parse forest has a structure similar to a chart of CFG parsing, and c corresponds to an edge in the chart.",
        "This assumption corresponds to the independence assumption in PCFG; that is, only a nonterminal symbol of a mother is considered in further processing by ignoring the structure of its daughters.",
        "With this assumption, we can compute the figures of merit (FOMs) of partial parse results.",
        "This assumption restricts the possibility of feature functions that represent non-local dependencies expressed in a parse result.",
        "Since unification-based grammars can express semantic relations, such as predicate-argument relations, in their structure, the assumption unjustifiably restricts the flexibility of probabilistic modeling.",
        "However, previous research (Miyao et al., 2003; Clark and Curran, 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004) showed that predicate-argument relations can be represented under the assumption of feature locality.",

        "Many of the techniques for improving the parsing efficiency of deep linguistic analysis have been developed in the framework of lexicalized grammars such as lexical functional grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Shabes et al., 1988), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) or combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steed-man, 2000).",
        "Most of them were developed for exhaustive parsing, i.e., producing all parse results that are given by the grammar (Matsumoto et al., 1983; Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993; van Noord, 1997; Kiefer et al., 1999; Malouf et al., 2000; Torisawa et al., 2000; Oepen et al., 2002; Penn and Munteanu, 2003).",
        "The strategy of exhaustive parsing has been widely used in grammar development and in parameter training for probabilistic models.",
        "We tested three of these techniques.",
        "Quick check Quick check filters out non-unifiable feature structures (Malouf et al., 2000).",
        "Suppose we have two non-unifiable feature structures.",
        "They are destructively unified by traversing and modifying them, and then finally they are found to be not unifiable in the middle of the unification process.",
        "Quick check quickly judges their unifiability by peeping the values of the given paths.",
        "If one of the path values is not unifiable, the two feature structures cannot be unified because of the necessary condition of unification.",
        "In our implementation of quick check, each edge had two types of arrays.",
        "One contained the path values of the edge’s sign; we call this the sign array.",
        "The other contained the path values of the right daughter of a schema such that its left daughter is unified with the edge’s sign; we call this a schema array.",
        "When we apply a schema to two edges, e1 and e2, the schema array of e1 and the sign array of e2 are quickly checked.",
        "If it fails, then quick check returns a unification failure.",
        "If it succeeds, the signs are unified with the schemata, and the result of unification is returned.",
        "Large constituent inhibition (Kaplan et al., 2004) It is unlikely for a large medial edge to contribute to the final parsing result if it spans more than 20 words and is not adjacent to the beginning or ending of the sentence.",
        "Large constituent inhibition prevents the parser from generating medial edges that span more than some word length.",
        "HPSG parsing with a CFG chunk parser A hybrid of deep parsing and shallow parsing was recently found to improve the efficiency of deep parsing (Daum et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2003; Frank, 2004).",
        "As a preprocessor, the shallow parsing must be very fast and achieve high precision but not high recall so that the",
        "total parsing performance in terms of precision, recall and speed is not degraded.",
        "Because there is trade-off between speed and accuracy in this approach, the total parsing performance for large-scale corpora like the Penn treebank should be measured.",
        "We introduce a CFG chunk parser (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005a) as a preprocessor of HPSG parsing.",
        "Chunk parsers meet the requirements for preprocessors; they are very fast and have high precision.",
        "The grammar for the chunk parser is automatically extracted from the CFG treebank translated from the HPSG treebank, which is generated during grammar extraction from the Penn treebank.",
        "The principal idea of using the chunk parser is to use the bracket information, i.e., parse trees without non-terminal symbols, and prevent the HPSG parser from generating edges that cross brackets."
