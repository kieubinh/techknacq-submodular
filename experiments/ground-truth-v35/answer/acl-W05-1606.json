        "Generating referring expressions is a traditional, standard task in natural language generation.",
        "Over the past two decades, a number of algorithms have been proposed which differ among each other in terms of efficiency and coverage.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, all algorithms share the assumption that objects can be identified by a description consisting of attribute values ascribed to these objects.",
        "Moreover, the results are specified in a way that implicitly assumes complete agreement about these properties, provided they are known to the audience.",
        "We feel that this assumption may be too strong in reality so that, for instance, a dialog system in which the reference generation algorithm is embedded is unlikely to behave adequately when a misunderstanding occurs due to a perception mismatch.",
        "In this paper, we address this problem by incorporating measures to deal with uncertainties into a standard algorithm that generates referring expressions.",
        "In order to represent uncertainties, we propose two complementary measures expressing the likelihood of object identification.",
        "We define computation schemes for combining descriptions with boolean combinations of attribute values, and we extend the incremental standard reference generation algorithm by adapting property selection and termination criteria.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we motivate our approach in more detail.",
        "Then we introduce our method for representing aspects of uncertainty.",
        "We follow by illustrating the propagation of uncertainty assessments for several attribute values, including boolean combinations, and we give examples of the effects.",
        "Then we describe extensions to the incremental algorithm, and we discuss their impact."

        "In the scope of this paper, we adopt the terminology originally formulated in [Dale 1988] and later used by several others.",
        "A referential description [Donellan 1966] serves the purpose of letting the hearer or reader identify a particular object or set of objects in a given situation.",
        "The referring expression to be generated is required to be a distinguishing description, that is a description of the enitties being referred to, but not to any other object in the context set.",
        "A context set is defined as the set of the entities the addressee is currently assumed to be attending to – this is similar to the set of entities in the focus spaces of the discourse focus stack in Grosz' and Sidner's [1986] theory of discourse structure.",
        "Moreover, the contrast set (or the set of potential distractors [McDonald 1981]) is defined to entail all elements of the context set except the intended referents.",
        "Generating referring expressions is pursued since the eighties [Appelt 1985, Kronfeld 1986, Appelt and Kronfeld 1987].",
        "Subsequent years were characterized by a debate about computational efficiency versus minimality of the elements appearing in the resulting referring expression [Dale 1988, Reiter 1990, Reiter and Dale 1992].",
        "In the mid-nineties, this debate seemed to be settled in favor of the incremental approach [Dale and Reiter 1995] – motivated by results of psychological experiments [Levelt 1989, Pechmann 1989], certain non-minimal expressions are tolerated in favor of adopting the fast strategy of incrementally selecting ambiguity-reducing attributes from a domain-dependent preference list.",
        "Recently, algorithms have been applied to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals [Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001], and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations [van Deemter 2002].",
        "To avoid the generation of redundant descriptions that is typical for incremental approaches, Gardent [2002] and Horacek [2003] proposed exhaustive resp.",
        "best-first searches.",
        "All these procedures more or less share the design of the underlying knowledge base.",
        "Objects are conceived in terms of sets of attributes, each with an atomic value as its filler.",
        "Some models distinguish specializations of these values according to a taxonomic hierarchy, so that the most accurate value can be replaced by one of its generalizations if there are reasons to assume this alternative is preferable – due to insufficient knowledge attributed to the audience, or to prevent unintended implications.",
        "A few approaches also deal with relations to other objects, whose representation differs from that of attributes only by the reference to the related object.",
        "Typically, a user model is assumed to guide the choice among available descriptors; the user model expresses taxonomic knowledge attributed to the user, indicating for a descriptor whether it is known to the user or not.",
        "While a knowledge base developed and interpreted in this manner is adequate for generating referring expressions in most application-relevant settings, there may be circumstances in which uncertainties are prominent, so that the simple boolean attribution of properties to objects becomes problematic and may prove insufficient.",
        "Uncertainties may manifest themselves in at least the following three factors:",
        "• Uncertainty about knowledge",
        "There may not be sufficient evidence to assume that the user is or is not acquainted with a specific term.",
        "In fact, most of today's user model components assign some probability to statements about a user's knowledge or capabilities, for example on the basis of inferences obtained through a belief network [Pearl 1988].",
        "• Uncertainty about perception capabilities",
        "There is an increasing number of applications with natural language interaction where the objects of the discourse do not appear on the computer screen (e.g., ubiquitous tools guiding a user in environments such as airports and tourist attraction areas, e.g., [Wahlster 2004]).",
        "In such situations, perception and recognition of object properties is much harder to assess; for example, the visibility of some object or of one of its parts may not be derivable with complete certainty.",
        "• Uncertainty about conceptual agreement",
        "While ascribing a value to an attribute is straightforward for certain categories of attributes, problems may occur, e.g., in connection with vagueness.",
        "This concept may be relevant for a number of commonly used properties such as size and shape, and even with colors, transitions between adjacent color tones may not be firmly categorized as one of the two candidates.",
        "To illustrate these manifestations of uncertainty, let us consider a scenario with three similar dogs, one of which is a bassett, which is also the intended referent.",
        "In addition, the bassett is brownish and has a long tail.",
        "The other two dogs have shorter tails and their skin is also brown, but with some white resp.",
        "black portions.",
        "Furthermore, we assume that the audience has little knowledge about dog specifics, that is, it is not very likely that they may recognize the intended referent as a bassett.",
        "We also assume that the tails of the dogs cannot be observed easily by the audience under the given local circumstances.",
        "Hence, the three attributes “category”, “color”, and “tail length” each fall into one of the categories of uncertainty introduced above: the categorization of the intended referent as a bassett is associated with uncertainty about knowledge, the limited visibility which may not enable the spectators to see the tails of the dogs in each moment constitutes an uncertainty about perception capabilities, and the similarity of the dogs' colors may yield uncertainty about conceptual agreement, that is, it is doubtfull whether the descriptor “brownish” is attributed only to the intended referent or also to some of the other dogs in the given situation.",
        "Apparently, these uncertainties have consequences on building human-adequate referring expressions, especially in contexts where most of the descriptors available are associated with some kind of uncertainty.",
        "Intuitively, we would expect people to produce referring expressions with several of these descriptors, being redundant in case they are all recognized, but also hoping that the identification will succeed if the audience can identify only some part of the overall description in the given situation.",
        "Moreover, we would expect people only to use descriptors that have some reasonable chance of being understood.",
        "Unfortunately, traditional generation algorithms do not enable us to model such a behavior, since none of the options available does justice to the uncertainty involved.",
        "If a descriptor is modeled as applying to all entities (e.g., for “brownish”), it will never be chosen since it yields no discrimination.",
        "A similar consequence is obtained when the capabilities of the audience are interpreted pessimistically.",
        "Finally, if a descriptor is assumed to be understood, it might be chosen without considering any of the other candidates associated with uncertainty.",
        "Thus, modeling in the existing algorithms forces us to make crisp decisions, with strong impacts on the result of the algorithm.",
        "Redundant expressions motivated by uncertainties about recognition cannot be generated under any modeling alternative.",
        "There are only a few computational approaches which address the problem of uncertainty about the recognition of referring expressions.",
        "For example, [Edmonds 1994] and [Heeman and Hirst 1995] describe both plan-based methods, where a vague and partial description is produced initially, which is narrowed and ultimately confirmed in the subsequent discourse.",
        "However, the documented examples do only emphasize incomplete, but never incorrect interpretations.",
        "An approach that fits better to our intentions is the work by Goodman [1987], which emphasizes reference identification and associated failures in task-oriented dialogs [Goodman 1986].",
        "This case study demonstrates various impacts of limitations and discrepancies of expertise on referential identification: subjects exhibit uncertainty in identification, which manifests itself in tentative actions and changes of mind, they misinterpret descriptions (e.g., 'outlet' interpreted as 'hole'), and they may find no appropriate referent at all.",
        "In the latter case, subject even undertake attempts to repair an otherwise uninterpretable description by relaxing descriptors.",
        "In the following, we interpret some of these findings for our model of uncertainty, including a model of a repair mechanism."

        "Basically, our model of uncertainty combines the three kinds of uncertainty described in the previous section.",
        "Each of them is expressed in terms of a probability, associated with a triple consisting of an object, an attribute applicable to that object, and the value ascribed to this pair.",
        "The following probabilities each express the likelihood that the user recognizes a description correctly from the perspectives of: pK The user is acquainted with the terms mentioned pP The user can perceive the properties uttered pA The user agrees to the applicability of the terms used In order to identify an intended referent successfully, all three factors must be assessed positively, so that the probability of recognition p becomes the product of these three probabilities.",
        "Since the individual properties refer to factors outside the scope of proper generation, we only deal with p in the scope of this paper, although it is clear that this assessment requires contributions from several sources.",
        "The concept of using individual probabilities to represent manifestations of uncertainty is not only simple, it also fits to knowledge sources where data about these probabilities could be found.",
        "For example, user models, the potential sources for assessing pK, typically assign assessments to user capabilities on the basis of belief networks.",
        "Similar considerations hold for representations of vague properties, which fall under the concept of term agreement.",
        "These properties can be modeled by fuzzy logic systems [Zadeh 1984, 1996], which allow for an interpretation in terms of a single probability value, representing the likelihood that a precise value is perceived as a given vague term.",
        "The association of a probability with the applicability of a descriptor to an object not only expresses the somehow direct likelihood of success of this task, but the application of this likelihood to several candidate objects also gives an indication of the likelihood of success of the overall identification goal.",
        "If a descriptor is assumed to be associated with several candidate objects by the audience, with certain degrees typically different among these objects, several cases can be distinguished: (1) correct identification, where the audience relates the description only to those objects to which this descriptor indeed applies, (2) misinterpretation, where none of these objects, but others are associated with the descriptor by the audience, (3) ambiguity, which is a combination of (1) and (2), and, finally, (4) the case of an uninterpretable description, where the audience does not relate the descriptor to any of the candidate objects.",
        "In the last case, people are known to make an attempt to repair their unsuccessful interpretation, since they assume that the expression communicated is indeed intended to refer to some object or objects in the domain of discourse, according to the work by Goodman.",
        "In order to simulate the effect of this behavior, we compute the probability of the occurrence of an uninterpretable description, which we call the repair factor, and we increase the probability of identification of the candidate objects (which we call our repair mechanism), based on the amount of the repair factor and the context of these objects in the overall identification task.",

        "Thus, for the likelihood ofrecognition failure, a mechanismis required that simulates identification repair underthese conditions.",
        "Apartfromthe likelihoodoffailure, repairshouldbe guided by potential confusability ofobjects inview ofsome givendescriptor.",
        "Hence, while we thinkit is virtually impossible to confuse an animal and a piece of equipment, atleastunderanyreasonable conditions ofvisibi-lity, we assume thatobjects ofsome degree ofappearance similarity(size and shape) may potentiallybe confused with each other.",

        "Fromthe hearers perspective, those objects are candidates which the hearer thinks the speakermighthave confusedinproducing abadly interpretable description.",
        "Since the latter constellation corresponds to the situation presentforrepairattempts, we model potential candidates quasi “objectively” by incorpor-atingannotations inthe knowledge base.",

        "In order to keep the repair mechanism simple, we approximate confusability of an object by augmenting its representation with annotations of all property-value combinations that do not apply to it, but which could somehow be perceived as holding for this object.",
        "The potentially large amount of data created this way can be significantly reduced by making use of inheritance.",
        "For example, one can state that blue and purple (physical) objects can be confused, by making annotations about confusability with blue for purple objects, and vice-versa.",
        "This annotation is then inherited to all entities that are specializations of (physical) objects.",
        "The proper repair is then simulated by collecting all candidates to which the descriptor in question could arguably apply, and by assigning these candidates a probability of identification through repair, according to the repair factor, as assessed above.",
        "There are two kinds of candidates: (1) those to which the descriptor is recognized with some probability, and (2) those to which it could apply with some relaxation, that is, which contains a suitable confusability annotation.",
        "The repair factor, which is computed according to the schema in Figure 1, is then evenly distributed among these two sets of candidates, provided the added probabilities of recognition and repair do not get greater than 1 for some object; this can only be the case if the number of objects to identify is close to the number of candidates.",
        "In such a case, the extra amount is distributed recursively among the remaining candidates, always respecting the upper limit of 1.",
        "If the number of objects to identify even exceeds the number of candidates, the effect of the repair mechanism results in a modification of the number of objects to identify, reducing it to the number of available candidates.",
        "The computation of the probability of identification through repair is illustrated in Figure 2.",

        "Since a single descriptor is rarely sufficient for identifying one or several objects in scenarios of interesting complexity, boolean compositions of descriptors are generated for this purpose, conjunctions being required for building identifying expressions for single objects.",

        "While this distribution is an equal one for the case of a single descriptor, apart from using the upper limit of 1 for the total probability, such an even distribution would not do full justice here.",
        "We propose to distribute the likelihood proportionally to the probabilities of recognition for each descriptor, which makes repair more likely applicable to those objects which are also more likely to be identified anyway.",
        "In order to perform this operation properly, “average” probabilities (ap) for only reparable descriptors must be estimated.",
        "Moreover, we want to favor repairs for objects which require fewer “average” probabilities for this computation, by incorporating a \"scale-down factor” (sdf) for each additional repair.",
        "The computation schema is given in Figure 4.",
        "For concrete computations, we choose 0.5 for both factors ap and sdf – see the examples in Figure 5.",
        "The first one demonstrates the partitioning of the repair factor according to the number of attributes which require repair.",
        "Specifically, the first three objects get the same share of the repair factor, while the fourth object gets only half of it, since its identification is the only one which requires",

        "Specifically, this example demonstrates that the probability of identification for an object (the second one) that is only identifiable through the repair mechanism can even become higher than the probability of identification for an object (the second one) that does not require repair for being identified.",
        "However, such an effect is only possible in the context of descriptors applicable with some degree of confidence to both candidates, but strongly favoring the object whose identification relies on the repair mechanism due to mismatch with another descriptor.",
        "This is the most critical effect in choosing descriptors.",
        "The incorproation of disjunctions and negations is more local, since this extension only generalizes the probability of recognition of a single property.",

        "For example, disjunctions of similar colors or shapes may reduce the uncertainty through combining the identifiability of both.",
        "A simple way to model this constellation is by assigning probabilities to the set of applicable values so that their sum does not exceed 1, thereby modeling exclusion of the co-occurrence of more than one value.",
        "Consequently, the associated probabilities can simply be added.",
        "Propagation of the “confusable” annotation is treated similarly – if at least one of the descriptors is marked as “confusable”, this also holds for the disjunction.",

        "These two factors have adverse effects: while a more specific value has the potential of excluding an increasing number of potential distractors, its probability of recognition when applied to the intended referent may be lower than that of a less specific value.",
        "Consequently, it is not necessarily the case that an improved discriminatory power leads to a better overall effect.",
        "Hence, the choice of a value requires a minimal probability of recognition (pmin, [N6]), and calls to Dominate replace calls to RulesOut.",
        "Additional variants of descriptors can be generated by enhancing the interface function MoreSpecificValue, also building disjunctions of values excluding each other, to cover cases described at the end of Section 4, that is, building disjunctions of descriptors by composing descriptors (possibly vague ones) that cover adjacent value ranges.",
        "The third factor, the termination criterion, is adapted to uncertainties by enhancing it in two ways: (1) a complexity limit is applied to the specifications in the description L [N3]; while this cut-off may serve practical considerations also without conditions of uncertainty (for a partitioning into sequences of descriptions [Horacek 2004]), it gains on relevance in uncertain environments.",
        "(2) a certain degree of being Dominant in the probability of identification over all potential distractors is considered sufficient (4p2, [N4]) rather than requiring the ultimate exclusion of all potential distractors.",
        "Finally, the conditions under which descriptors are selected, give rise to an optional optimization step.",
        "The prerequisite for this step is the distinction between descriptors which definitively exclude at least one potential distractor (Lro in the extended algorithm, [N1]) and others which only affect their associated probabilities of identification, but do not make them 0.",
        "Then all subsets of the description built which contain at least Lro are examined [N5] whether they yield a better preference over all potential distractors in terms of their probabilities of identification [N9].",
        "Through this measure, an early chosen descriptor with a probability of identification lower for the intended referent than for some potential distractors can finally be discarded, provided the discriminating effect on other potential distractors is also achieved by later chosen descriptors.",
        "In the example in Appendix II, all descriptors are categorized as optional ones, but for the one expressing the head noun – which is precisely the reason why it is not optional.",
        "Altogether, the algorithm selects descriptors which either exclude some potential distractors definitively, makes some of them rely on the repair mechanism, or simply increases the probability of identification of the intended referent considerably in comparison to elements of the contrast set.",
        "While this selection process works reasonably in most cases, it may turn out as problematic when several of the descriptors chosen are associated with limited probabilities of recognition for the intended referent in comparison to potential distractors not completely excluded.",
        "As a consequence, these potential distractors may be judged superior in terms of the probability of identification even though they rely on the repair mechanism (see example 3 in Figure 5).",
        "This risk can be circumvented by using a relatively high pmin parameter, but this measure may easily lead to the exclusion of an otherwise beneficial descriptor under normal conditions.",
        "An improvement can be obtained by the call to the procedure Optimize.",
        "If one of the first two descriptors used in example 3 in Figure 5 does not definitively exclude a potential distractor, the procedure Optimize tests descriptor combinations without it, and one of those may yield a better result – see also the example in Appendix II.",
        "A possible variations would be to allow just a single violation of the pmin restriction, for a descriptor with very good discriminatory power.",
        "So far, we have only elaborated changes for incorporating uncertainty concepts to the reference algorithm per se.",
        "Handling boolean combinations of descriptors through applying the reference algorithm to increasingly complex combinations also works with uncertainties, since all computations required are defined.",
        "More difficulties arise with ambitious control regimes, which rely on cut-off techniques, in addition to the complexity cut-off, such as dominance and value cut-offs, as introduced in [Horacek 2004].",
        "A complexity cut-off is already included in the extended reference algorithm.",
        "The two other cut-offs can be generalized, but this is likely to be associated with a significant loss of efficiency.",
        "In order for a descriptor to dominate another one, the dominating one must not only exclude all potential distractors that its competitor does, but it must also favor the intended referents over all potential distractors in terms of the associated probabilities of identification – this requirement reduces the application frequency of this cut-off considerably.",
        "A value cut-off, in turn, is applicable to a partial solution if a solution has already been found, and there are no descriptor combinations untested for the partial solution which may yield a solution with less complex specifications.",
        "This condition can also be met in the environment associated with uncertainties.",
        "In this environment, however, there is another factor that has an impact on the quality of the solution, that is the probability of identification, which cannot be assessed prior to actually choosing a descriptor and testing its effects."

        "In this paper, we have presented an approach for generating referential descriptions under conditions of uncertainty.",
        "The approach combines a proper recognition of objects associated with some degree of uncertainty, as well as identification through a repair mechanism, motivated by the need to identify objects even for descriptions that originally appear uninterpretable.",
        "On these lines, we have reinterpreted concepts of algorithms generating referring expressions in view of uncertainties about the appearance of objects.",
        "Incorporating measures of uncertainty in such an algorithm attacks strong assumptions and effects underlying most of the existing algorithms:",
        "• They typically require crisp specifications concerning attribution of descriptors to referents and knowledge of the audience.",
        "Especially the connection to modern user models may require coarse-grained interpretations here.",
        "• A single result is produced even if several reasonable variants exist, and this choice is implicitly determined by the preference ordering imposed on the descriptors.",
        "• The interaction with other components of an NL generation system and an embedding dialog system is rather limited.",
        "Reference generation is typically conceived as a pure functional service, with no feedback, taking into account syntactic constraints, at best (e.g., [Horacek 1997]).",
        "An embedding dialog system has no chance to find out possible sources for an identification failure.",
        "The algorithm incorporating measures to deal with uncertainties provides facilities to improve this situation:",
        "• Specifications concerning attribution of descriptors to referents and knowledge of the audience can be done in a direct fashion, requiring no interpretations.",
        "• There are some parameters to control the choice of descriptors, the conciseness and expected effectiveness of the result, including an afterwards optimization which only requires recalculation of probabilities.",
        "• The probabilities of identification associated with the",
        "intended referents and those potential distractors that fall under the repair facility give an indication about the likelihood of success of the identification task and also about potential sources for a failure.",
        "Moreover, the situation about probabilities and descriptors may suggest variants in building surface expressions, such as putting emphasis on a critical descriptor."

        "In this section, we demonstrate the functionality of the extended algorithm by an example that illustrates several features of this algorithm.",
        "As in the discussion in Section 2, the scenario consists of three similar dogs, one of which is a bassett, which is also the intended referent.",
        "In addition, the bassett is brownish and has a long tail.",
        "The other two dogs have shorter tails and their skin is also brownish, but with some white resp.",
        "black portions, which makes the descriptor 'brownish' less appropriate than for the bassett.",
        "To make the example suitable for our purposes, the audience is assumed to have little knowledge about dog specifics, that is, they may recognize the intended referent as a bassett, but this is not very likely (we assume the category identification has a likelihood of 30%).",
        "In addition, it is assumed that the tails of the dogs, specifically the one of the bassett, cannot be observed easily by the audience (again, we assume the recognition has a likelihood of 30%).",
        "Both, dog category and tail length are potentially confusable for all dogs.",
        "These properties and associated probabilities of identification as listed below.",
        "Probabilities of identification (per attribute-value and object) bassett: p(dog1) = 0.3, p(dog2) = 0.0, p(dog3) = 0.0 brownish: p(dog1) = 0.9, p(dog2) = 0.8, p(dog3) = 0.8 long-tail: p(dog1) = 0.3, p(dog2) = 0.0, p(dog3) = 0.0 Hence, the intended referent r is {dog1}, and the contrast set C is {dog2, dog3}.",
        "For demonstration purposes, we choose the following parameterizations:",
        "• The attributes are considered according to the ordered preference list P = (color, category, tail-length), which in some sense reflects the ease of perception of color • We choose 5% (0.05) for Ap1, which indicates suffi",
        "cient dominance, and 30% (0.3) for Apmin, which indicates sufficient identification potenial (it always succeeds in the example); similarly, we choose 50% (0.5) for Ap2 which indicates sufficient discrimination (it never succeeds here, hence all descriptors are tried) • We allow a maximum complexity of 3 descriptors, so that this cut-off criterion does not apply in our simple example, and we use the optional optimization step • In order to compute probabilities of identification, we need to choose a values for the ”scale-down factor”, which will be 0.5, as mentioned in Section 4.",
        "Since no disjunctions and negations of descriptors are needed for our example, no further parameters are required.",
        "We now illustrate the generation process step by step.",
        "In the first step, “brownish” is chosen as the value of the attribute “color” of dog1, and its contribution to discriminate the intended referent from the elements of the contrast set is checked.",
        "To start with, its identification potential, 0.9, is far higher than pmin (0.25).Since this descriptor is also applicable to both other dogs, dog2 and dog3, but with lower probability, these two objects still remain in the contrast set.",
        "Despite this limited discrimination, the attribute is chosen because it achieves more than the minimal dominance required: 0.9 - 0.8 equals 0.1, which is higher than Ap2 (0.05).",
        "Thus, the situation after step 1 is as follows (we neglect the repair factor, which is as low as 0.1 x 0.2 x 0.2):",
        "In the next step, “bassett” is chosen as the value of the attribute “category” of dog1, and again its contribution to discriminate the intended referent from the elements of the contrast set is checked.",
        "Its identification potential, 0.3, is sufficient, since it is higher than pmin (0.25).",
        "This descriptor is not applicable to the other dogs, dog2 and dog3.",
        "Nevertheless, they still remain in the contrast set since they potentially are subject to the repair mechanism.",
        "The probabilities of identification are computed according to the schema in Figure 4: the product of the probabilities of \"bassett\" and \"brownish\" associated with dog1 yields 0.27.",
        "The repair factor, the complementing 0.73, is distributed evenly among all three dogs.",
        "Hence, the degree of dominance of this descriptor amounts to 0.27, which is higher than Ap2 (0.05).",
        "Thus, the situation after step 2 is as follows: pr(dog1) = 0.513, pr(dog2) = pr(dog3) = 0.243 Apr = pr(dog1) - Max(pr(dog2), pr(dog3)) = 0.27 > Ap1 In the last step, “long” is chosen as the value of the attribute “tail-length”.",
        "Again, its identification potential, 0.3, is sufficient, since it is higher than pmin (0.25).",
        "As in the previous step, dog2 and dog3 still remain in the contrast set since they potentially are subject to the repair mechanism.",
        "The product of the probabilities for dog1 results from the previous one, multiplied by 0.3, which yields 0.081.",
        "The repair factor, the complementing 0.919, is distributed by giving two parts to dog1 (the scale-down factor applies) and one part to each of the other dogs.",
        "Hence, the degree of dominance of this descriptor amounts to 0.31075, which is higher than Ap2 (0.05), which gives the final situation:",
        "Optimization attempts show that “bassett” only is slightly inferior (pr(dog1) = 0.53, pr(dog2) = pr(dog3) = 0.23, Apr = 0.3), while “bassett” together with “long-tailed” is slightly superior (pr(dog1) = 0.545, pr(dog2) = pr(dog3) = 0.225, Apr = 0.32) to the combination of all descriptors.",
        "Hence, the example demonstrates benefits and risks are comparable when only limited discrimination is possible by each descriptor."
