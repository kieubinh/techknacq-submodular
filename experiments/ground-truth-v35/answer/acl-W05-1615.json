        "various ways, and comparing this to their rating of manually authored texts (for example, [Lester and Porter, 1997])",
        "• Automatically comparing generated texts to a corpus of",

        "Each of these techniques is effective under different application contexts in which NLG systems operate.",
        "For instance, a corpus based technique is effective when a high quality corpus is available.",
        "The appeal of post-edit evaluation as done with SUMTIME-MOUSAM is that (A) the edits should indicate actual mistakes instead of just differences in how things can be said and (B) the amount of post-editing required is a very important practical measure of how useful the system is to real users (forecasters in our case).",
        "Post-edit evaluations are a standard technique in Machine Translation [Hutchins and Somers, 1992].",

        "This includes breaking sentences up into phrases, where each phrase describes the weather at one point in time.",
        "For example, the pre-edit text in Figure 2 would be broken up into three phrases:",
        "A. Pre-edit Text: SW 20-25 backing SSW 28-33 by midday, then gradually increasing 34-39 by midnight.",
        "B. Post-edit Text: SW 22-27 gradually increasing SSW 34-39.",
        "The Figure 2 post-edit text is divided into two phrases: B1 SW 22-27 B2 gradually increasing SSW 34-39 The second step is to align phrases from these two tables as a preparation for comparison in the next step.",
        "Alignment is a complex activity and is described in detail next.",
        "To start with we generate an exhaustive list of all the possible combinations of phase alignments.",
        "For example, consider the texts in Figure 2.",
        "Here we generate the following list of possible alignments: {(A1, B1), (A1, B2), (A2, B1), (A2, B2), (A3, B1), (A3, B2)} Next, we compute match scores for each of these possible alignments and use them for selecting the right alignments.",
        "For each unedited phrase Ai, the alignment with the highest matching score is selected.",
        "For the purpose of computing the match scores, phrases are parsed using ‘parts of speech’ designed for weather sublanguage such as direction, speed and time.",
        "The total match score of a pair of phrases is computed as the sum of the match scores for their constituents.",
        "Match score (MS) for a pair of constituents depends upon their part of speech and also their degree of match.",
        "MS is defined as a product of two terms as explained below:",
        "• Match score due to degree of match: we assign a match score of 2 for exact matches, 1 for partial matches and 0 for mismatches.",
        "• Weight factor denoting importance of constituents for",
        "alignment: Constituents belonging to certain parts of speech (POS) are more significant for alignment than others.",
        "For example, times are more significant for alignment than verbs.",
        "Also weights are varied for the same POS based on its context in the phrase.",
        "For example, direction receives higher weight if it occurs in a phrase without a time or speed.",
        "This is because in such phrases direction is the only means for alignment.",
        "Continuing with our example sentences in Figure 2, we show below how we find an alignment for A3.",
        "As described earlier, A3 can be aligned to either B 1 or B2.",
        "The MS for (A3, B1) is zero as shown in Table 3.",

        "We processed 2728 forecast pairs (pre-edited and post-edited).",
        "These were divided into 73041 phrases.",
        "Out of these, the alignment procedure failed to align 7608 (10%) phrases.",
        "For instance, in the example of Section 3.2, phrase A2 was not aligned with any B phrase.",
        "Alignment failure generally indicates that the forecaster is unhappy with SUMTIME-MOUSAM’s segmentation that is with the system’s content determination.",
        "We have manually analysed some of these cases, and in general it seems the forecasters are performing more sophisticated data analysis than SUMTIME-MOUSAM, and are also more sensitive to which changes are significant enough to be reported to the user.",
        "We have manually inspected alignment quality of 100 random phrase pairs to determine cases where our alignment procedure erroneously aligned phrases.",
        "We found one case of improper alignment.",
        "The pre-edited phrase ‘soon becoming variable’ has not been aligned to its corresponding identical post-edited phrase.",
        "Inspection of the rest of the corpus showed that this error repeated 54 times in the whole corpus.",
        "These cases have been classified as alignment failures and therefore do not affect the post-edit analysis.",
        "For example, consider the Wind 1 0m data shown in Table 6.",
        "Our content determination algorithm first segments the data in table 6 (see Sripada et al. [2002] for more details).",
        "Segmentation is the process of fitting straight lines to a data set in such a way that a minimum error is introduced by the lines.",
        "Since the direction data is constant at ESE, there is only one segment for this data.",
        "Wind speed data however is segmented by two lines as shown in Figure 3, one line joining the point (0,12) with (15,8) and the second joining the point (15,8) with (24,13).",
        "Our content selection algorithm therefore selects data points",
        "(0,12), (15,8) and (24,13) to be included in the forecast.",
        "In this case our system produced: “ESE 10-15 gradually easing 10 or less by mid afternoon then increasing 11-16 by midnight” However, forecasters view this data as a special case and don’t segment it the way we do.",
        "Here the wind speed is always in the range of ‘10-15’ except at 1500 and 1800 hours.",
        "Therefore they mention the change as an additional information to an otherwise constant wind speed.",
        "In this case, the forecaster edited text is: “ESE 10-15 decreasing 10 or less for a time later”.",
        "Talking about the segmentation differences, one of the forecasters at Weathernews told us that another factor affecting segmentation is related to the end user.",
        "End users of the marine forecasts are oil company staff who schedule activities on the oilrigs in the North Sea.",
        "Over the years forecasters at Weathernews have acquired a good understanding of the informational needs of the oil company staff.",
        "So they use the forecast statements as messages to the end users about the weather and know what kind of messages will be useful to the end users.",
        "In the example texts shown in Figure 2 the forecaster could have thought that the important message to communicate about wind is that it is increasing monotonically and is likely to be in the range between 22 (the actual initial wind speed) and 39.",
        "Everything else distracts this primary message and therefore needs to be avoided.",
        "Once again there is post segmentation reasoning used by the forecasters.",
        "We are investigating better pattern matching techniques and better user models to improve our content selection.",
        "Going back to the successfully aligned phrases, 43914 (60%) are perfect matches, and the remaining 21519 (30%) are mismatches.",
        "Table 7 summarises the mismatches.",
        "Here, each mismatch is classified as",
        "• Ellipses: additions and deletions.",
        "For example, deleting the time phrase by midnight in the (A3, B2) pair.",
        "These generally indicate problems with SUMTrME-MOUSAM’s aggregation and ellipsis.",
        "• Data replacements: changes (replaces) to constituents",
        "that directly convey NWP data, such as wind speed and direction.",
        "For example, changing 20-25 to 22-27 in the (A1, B1) pair.",
        "These can indicate content problems.",
        "They also occur when forecasters believe the NWP data is incorrect but decide to just correct the forecast text and not the data (eg, skip generate-and-edit step described in section 2.3).",
        "• Lexical replacements: All other changes (replaces).",
        "For",
        "example, if the conjunction ‘then’ was replaced by ‘and’.",
        "This generally indicates a problem in SUMTrME-MOUSAM’s lexicalisation strategy.",
        "For each pair of phrases compared in the evaluation, we have counted the number of times each edit operation such as add, delete and replace is performed by forecasters.",
        "For example consider the two phrase pairs shown in Table 5.",
        "For the first phrase pair of ‘SW 20-25’ and ‘SW 22-27’ forecasters performed zero add, zero delete and one replace operation (‘20-25’ is replaced by ‘22-27’).",
        "For the second phrase pair of ‘then gradually increasing 34-39 by midnight’ and ‘gradually increasing SSW 34-39’ forecasters performed one add (added ‘SSW’), two delete (deleted ‘then’ and ‘by midnight’) and zero replace operations.",
        "We hypothesized that forecasters were making significantly more add and delete operations than replace operations.",
        "For verifying this, we have performed a pairwise t-test.",
        "Variable1 for the t-test represents the sum of the counts of add and delete operations for each pair of phrases.",
        "Variable2 represents the count of replace operations.",
        "For example, for the two phrase pairs shown in Table 5, variable1 has values of zero and three where as variable2 has values of one and zero.",
        "This test showed (with a p value less than 10-20) that forecasters were performing more additions and deletions than replacements.",
        "In other words, ellipsis is the main problem in our system.",
        "Most (25235 out of 35874, 70%) of these errors are deletions, where the forecaster deletes words from SUMTrME-MOUSAM’s texts.",
        "A manual analysis of some ellipsis cases has highlighted some general phenomena.",
        "First of all, many ellipsis cases are “downstream” consequences of earlier changes.",
        "For example, if we look at the (A3, B2) pair above, this contains three ellipsis changes: then was deleted, SSW was added, and by midnight was deleted.",
        "The first two of these changes are a direct consequence of the deletion of phrase A2.",
        "If SUMTrME-MOUSAM’s content determination system was changed so that it did not generate A2, then the micro planner would have expressed A3 as gradually increasing SSW 34-39 by midnight, which is identical to B2 except for by midnight.",
        "The deletion of by midnight is an example of another common phenomenon, which is disagreement among individuals as to how text should be written.",
        "As described in [Reiter et al., 2003], some forecasters elide the last time phrase in simple sentences such as this one, and some do not.",
        "An earlier version of SUMTrME-MOUSAM in fact would have elided this time phrase, but we changed the behavior of the system in this regard after consultation.",
        "Ellipsis errors are inevitable in cases where the different forecasters disagree about when to elide.",
        "However, since post-editors can delete words more quickly than they can add words, it probably makes sense from a practical perspective to be conservative about elision, and only elide in unambiguous cases.",
        "We will not further discuss data replacement errors, since they reflect either content problems or cases where NWP data was not corrected at the input time but edited directly in the final text.",
        "We have discussed lexical replacement errors in detail elsewhere [Reiter and Sripada, 2002].",
        "In general terms, some errors reflect problems with SUMTIME-MOUSAM; for example, the system overuses then as a connective, so forecasters often replaced then by alternative connectives such as and.",
        "However, many lexical replacement errors simply reflected the lexical preferences of individual forecasters [Reiter and Sripada, 2002].",
        "For example, SUMTIME-MOUSAM always uses the verb easing to indicate a reduction in wind speed.",
        "Most forecasters were happy with this, but 3 individuals usually changed this to decreasing.",
        "A general observation is that some forecasters post-edited texts much more than others.",
        "For example, while overall 28% of phrases were edited, edit rates by individual forecasters varied from 4% to 93%.",
        "We do not know why edit rates vary so much, although it may be significant the individual with the highest (93%) edit rate is one of the most experienced forecasters, who takes well justified pride in producing well-crafted forecasts.",
        "Summarizing the results of our evaluation:",
        "1.",
        "SUMTIME-MOUSAM’s content determination can definitely be improved, by using more sophisticated segmentation techniques.",

        "improved in places, for example by varying connectives.",

        "We are currently carrying out another evaluation of SUM-TIME-MOUSAM by the end users, oilrig staff and other marine staff who regularly read weather forecasts.",
        "In this study we compare user’s comprehension of weather information from human written and computer generated forecast texts.",
        "We also measure user ratings (preference) of human written and computer generated texts.",
        "Preliminary results from our study indicate that users make fewer mistakes on comprehension questions when they are shown texts that use computer generated words with human selected content.",

        "As stated in Section 2.1, we were attracted to post-edit evaluation because we believed that (A) people would only edit things that were clearly wrong; and (B) post-editing was an important usefulness metric from the perspective of our users (forecasters).",
        "Looking back, (B) was certainly true.",
        "The amount of post-editing that generated texts require is a crucial component of the cost of using SUMTIME-MOUSAM, and hence of the attractiveness of the system to users (forecasters).",
        "Although we have not measured the time required for performing post-edits, we have used edit-distance measures used in MT evaluations as an approximate cost metric.",
        "We have computed our cost metric by setting different cost (weight) values to different edit operations.",
        "Cost of add and replace operations is set to 5 and cost of delete is set to 1 as used in Suet al [1992].",
        "The ratio of the cost of edits and the cost of writing the entire forecast manually (adding all the words) is computed to be 0.15.",
        "(A) however was perhaps less true than we had hoped.",
        "Wagner [1998] also described post-edited texts in MT as at times noisy.",
        "Our analysis of manually written forecasts [Reiter and Sripada, 2002] had highlighted a number of “noise” elements that made it more difficult to extract information from such corpora.",
        "Basically there are many ways of communicating information in text, and the fact that a generated text doesn’t match a corpus text does not mean that the generated text is wrong.",
        "We assumed that people would only post-edit mistakes, where the generated text was wrong or sub-optimal, and hence post-edit data would be better for evaluation purposes than corpus comparisons.",
        "In fact, however, there were many justifications for post-edits:",
        "1.",
        "Fixing problems in the generated texts (such as overuse of then); 2.",
        "Refining/optimizing the texts (such as using for a time); 3.",
        "Individual preferences (such as easing vs decreasing); and 4.",
        "Downstream consequences of earlier changes (such as introducing SSW in B2, in the example of Section 3.2).",
        "We wanted to use our post-edit data to improve the system, not just to quantify its performance, and we discovered that we could not do this without attempting to analyze why post-edits were made.",
        "Probably the best way of doing this was to discuss post-edits with the forecasters.",
        "Alternatively, we could have asked forecasters to fill in problem sheets to capture their explanation of post-edits.",
        "Such feedback from the forecasters would have allowed us to reason with post-edit data to improve our system.",
        "In [Reiter et al., 2003] we explained that we found that analysis of human-written corpora was more useful if it was combined with directly working with domain experts; and essentially this (perhaps not surprisingly) is our conclusion about post-edit data as well.",
        "One of the lessons we learnt from this exercise has been that post-edit evaluations are useful to compute a cost metric to quantify the usefulness of a system.",
        "For example, as described earlier, we have computed a cost metric, 0.15 signifying the post-editing effort.",
        "Post-edit evaluations are also useful in revealing general problem areas in a system.",
        "For example, as described in section 3.3, our evaluation showed that ellipsis related problems are more serious in our system than others.",
        "However, post-edit evaluations are not affective in discovering specific problems in a system.",
        "The main reason for this is that many post-edits, as stated earlier, do not actually fix problems in the generated text at all.",
        "The real post-edits that fixed problems in the generated text were buried among the other noisy post-edits.",
        "This lesson of course is the result of our method of post-edit evaluation.",
        "Post-editing was not supported by SUMTIME-MOUSAM and forecasters used Marfors (see section 2.3) to perform post-editing.",
        "Therefore, we had to accept the post-edit data with all the noise.",
        "In MT, post-editors often work under predefined guidelines on post-editing and also use post-editing tools.",
        "For example, post-editing tools automatically revise texts to fix ‘down-stream’ consequences of human edits.",
        "If post-edit tools are similarly integrated into NLG systems, there is going to be a significant reduction in the number of noisy post-edits allowing us to focus on real post-edits.",
        "Because post-editing is subjective varying from individual to individual, we need to understand the post-editing behaviour of individuals to analyze the noisy post-edit data.",
        "Although we have data on forecaster variations in our post-edit corpus, these variations have not been observed from different forecasters post-editing the same text.",
        "This we could have achieved by performing a pilot before the actual evaluation.",
        "For the pilot all the forecasters post-edit the same set of forecasts, thus revealing their individual preferences.",
        "Post-edit data from the pilot would have enabled us to factor out the effects of forecaster variation from the real evaluation data.",
        "As described above noise in the post-edit data can be reduced by using post-edit tools and by performing a pilot before the real evaluation.",
        "This means that post-edit evaluations need preparation in the form of developing post-edit tools and carrying out pilot studies.",
        "This is another lesson we learnt from our current evaluation.",
        "Although analyzing the post-edit data was a major endeavour for us, the overall cost of post-edit evaluation was not much compared to the effort that would have been required to conduct end user experiments on 2728 texts.",
        "Of course, this was only true because SUMTIME-MOUSAM texts were being post-edited in any case by Weathernews.",
        "The cost-effectiveness of post-edit evaluation is less clear if the evaluators must organize and pay for the post-editing, as Mitkov and An Ha [2003] did.",
        "In this context we should speculate that when more and more NLG systems are deployed in the real world, post-editing will be accepted as a component in the process of automatic text generation much in the same way post-editing is now a part of MT."
