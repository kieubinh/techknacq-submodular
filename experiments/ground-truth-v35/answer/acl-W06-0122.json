        "Sequence labeling and segmentation tasks have been studied extensively in the fields of computational linguistics and information extraction.",
        "Several tasks, including, word segmentation, and semantic role labeling, provide rich information for various applications, such as segmentation in Chinese information retrieval and named entity recognition in biomedical literature mining.",
        "Probabilistic state automata models, such as the Hidden Markov model (HMM) [6] and conditional random fields (CRF) [5] are some of best, and therefore most popular, approaches for sequence labeling tasks.",
        "Both HMM and CRF consider that the state transition and the state prediction are conditional on the observation of data.",
        "The advantage of the CRF model is that richer feature sets can be considered, because, unlike HMM, it does not make a dependence assumption.",
        "However, the obvious drawback of the CRF model is that it needs more computing resources, so we can not apply all the features of the model.",
        "One possible way to resolve this problem is to effectively combine the results of various individual classifiers trained with different feature sets.",
        "In this paper, we use two ensemble methods to combine the results of the classifiers.",
        "We also combine the results generated by two machine learning models: maximum entropy (ME) [1] and CRF.",
        "One ensemble method is based on the majority vote [3], and the other is the memory based learner [7].",
        "Although the ensemble methods have been applied in some sequence labeling tasks [2],[3], similar work in Chinese named entity recognition is scarce.",
        "Our Chinese named entity tagger uses a character-based model.",
        "For English named entity tasks, a character-based NER model proposed by Dan Klein [4] proves the usefulness of substrings within words.",
        "In Chinese NER, the character-based model is more straightforward, since there are no spaces between Chinese words and each Chinese character is actually meaningful.",
        "Another reason for using a character-based model is that it can avoid the errors sometimes made by a Chinese word segmentor.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the Section 2, we introduce the machine learning models, the features we apply in the machine learning models, and the ensemble methods.",
        "In Section 3, we briefly describe the experimental data and the experiment results.",
