        "In Chinese word segmentation, there are two problems still remain, one is the resolution of ambiguity, and the other is the identification of so-called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or unknown words.",
        "In order to resolve these two problems, a two-stage statistical word segmentation strategy is adopted in our system.",
        "The first stage is optional, and the whole segmentation can be accomplished in the second stage.",
        "In the first stage, the n-gram language model is employed to implement basic word segmentation including disambiguation.",
        "In the second stage, a language tagging template named POC-NLW (position of a character within an n-length word) is introduced to accomplish unknown word identification as template-based character tagging.",

        "In the first stage, the basic word segmentation is accomplished.",
        "The key issue in this stage is the ambiguity problem, which is mainly caused by the fact that a Chinese character can occur in different word internal positions in different words (Xue, 2003).",
        "A lot of machine learning techniques have been applied to resolve this problem, the n-gram language model is one of the most popular ones among them (Fu and Luke, 2003; Li et al., 2005).",
        "As such, we also employed n-gram model in this stage.",
        "When a sentence is inputted, it is first segmented into a sequence of individual characters (e.g. ASCII strings, basic Chinese characters, punitions, numerals and so on), marked as C1,,,.",
        "According to the system’s dictionary, several word sequences W1,m will be constructed as candidates.",
        "The function of the n-gram model is to find out the best word sequence W* corresponds to C1,,,, which has the maximum integrated probability, i.e.,",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics The Maximum Likelihood method was used to estimate the word n-gram probabilities used in our model, and the linear interpolation method (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980) was applied to smooth these estimated probabilities."

        "The n-gram method is based on the exiting grams in the model, so it is good at judging the connecting relationship among known words, but does not have the ability to deal with unknown words in substance.",
        "Therefore, another OOV word identification model is required.",
        "OOV words are regarded as words that do not exist in a system’s machine-readable dictionary, and a more detailed definition can be found in (Wu and Jiang, 2000).",
        "In general, Chinese word can be created through compounding or abbreviating of most of existing characters and words.",
        "Thus, the key to solve the OOV word identification lies on whether the new word creation mechanisms in Chinese language can be extracted.",
        "Therefore, a POC-NLW language tagging template is introduced to explore such information on the character-level within words."

        "Many character-level based works have been done for the Chinese word segmentation, including the LMR tagging methods (Xue, 2003; Na-kagawa.",
        "2004), the IWP mechanism (Wu and Jiang, 2000).",
        "Based on these previous works, this POC-NLW template was derived.",
        "Assume that the length of a word is the number of component characters in it, the template is consist of two component: L,n,,x and a Wl-Pn tag set.",
        "L,n,,x to denote the maximum length of a word expressed by the template; a Wl-Pn tag denotes that this tag is assigned to a character at the nth position within a l-length word, n =1,2,.. •,l .",
        "Apparently, the size of this tag set is (Lmax + 1) × Lmax / 2 For example, the Chinese word “AK ” is tagged as: A W2P1, K W2P2 and “rP QA” is tagged as:",
        "In the example, two words are tagged by the template respectively, and the Chinese character “A” has been assigned two different tags.",
        "In a sense, the Chinese word creation mechanisms could be extracted through statistics of the tags for each character on a certain large corpus.",
        "On the other hand, while a character sequence in a sentence is tagged by this template, the word boundaries are obvious.",
        "Meanwhile, the word segmentation is implemented.",
        "In addition, in this template, known words and unknown words are both regarded as sequences of individual characters.",
        "Thus, the basic word segmentation process, the disambiguation process and the OOV word identification process can be accomplished in a unified process.",
        "Thereby, this model can also be used alone to implement the word segmentation task.",

        "Form the description of POC-NLW template, it can be found that the word segmentation could be implemented as POC-NLW tagging, which is similar to the so-called part-of-speech (POS) tagging problem.",
        "In POS tagging, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was applied as one of the most significant methods, as described in detail in (Brants, 2000).",
        "The HMM method can achieve high accuracy in tagging with low processing costs, so it was adopted in our model.",
        "According to the definition of POC-NLW template, the state set of HMM corresponds to the Wl-Pn tag set, and the symbol set is composed of all characters.",
        "However, the initial state probability matrix and the state transition probability matrix are not composed of all of the tags in the state set.",
        "To express more clearly, we define two subset of the state set:",
        "• Begin Tag Set (BTS): this set is consisted of tag which can occur in the begging position in a word.",
        "Apparently, these tags must have the Wl-P1 form.",
        "• End Tag Set (ETS): correspond to BTS,",
        "tags in this set should occur in the end position, and their form should be like Wl-Pl.",
        "Apparently, the size of BTS is L,n,,x as well as of ETS.",
        "Thus, the initial state probability matrix corresponds to BTS instead of the whole state set.",
        "On the other hand, because of the word internal continuity, if the current tag Wl-Pn is not in ETS, than the next tag must be Wl-P(n+1).",
        "In other words, the case in which the transition probability is need is that when the current tag is in ETS and the next tag belongs to BTS.",
        "So, the state transition matrix in our model corresponds to ETS × BTS.",
        "The probabilities used in HMM were defined similarly to those in POS tagging, and were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood method from the training corpus.",
        "In the two-stage strategy, the output word sequence of the first stage is transferred into the second stage.",
        "The items in the sequence, including individual characters and words, which do not have a bigram or trigram relationship with the surrounding items, are picked out with its surrounding items to compose several sequences of items.",
        "These item sequences are processed by the HMM tagger to form new item sequences.",
        "At last, these processed items sequences are combined into the whole word sequence as the final output."

        "On the other hand, the performances of OOV identification on UPUC are much better than on MSRA, while the performances of overall segmentation accuracy on UPUC are worse than on MSRA.",

        "In the PKU test data, the rate of OOV words according is 0.058 while in MSR is 0.026.",
