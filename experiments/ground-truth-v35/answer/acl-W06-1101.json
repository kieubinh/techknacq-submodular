        "While many CL areas make frequent use of such notions, it has received little focused attention, an honorable exception being Lebart & Rajman (2000).",
        "In information retrieval (IR), also the focus of Lebart & Rajman’s work, similarity is at heart of most techniques seeking an optimal match between query and document.",
        "Techniques in vector space models operationalize this via (weighted) cosine measures, but older tf/idf models were also arguably aiming at a notion of similarity.",
        "Word sense disambiguation models often work with a notion of similarity among the contexts within which word (senses) appear, and MT identifies candidate lexical translation equivalents via a comparable measure of similarity.",
        "Many learning algorithms currently popular in CL, including not only supervised techniques such as memory-based learning (k-nn) and support-vector machines, but also unsupervised techniques such as Kohonen maps and clustering, rely essentially on measures of similarity for their processing.",
        "Notions of similarity are often invoked in linguistic areas such as dialectology, historical linguistics, stylometry, second-language learning (as a measure of learners’ proficiency), psycholinguistics (accounting for lexical “neighborhood” effects, where neighborhoods are defined by similarity) and even in theoretical linguistics (novel accounts of the phonological constraints on semitic roots).",
        "This volume reports on a workshop aimed at bringing together researchers employing various measures of linguistic distance or similarity, including novel proposals, especially to demonstrate the importance of the abstract properties of such measures (consistency, validity, stability over corpus size, computability, fidelity to the mathematical distance axioms), but also to exchange information on how to analyze distance information further.",
        "We assume that there is always a “hidden variable” in the similarity relation, so that we should always speak of similarity with respect to some property, and we suspect that there is such a plethora of measures in part because researchers are often inexplicit on this point.",
        "It is useful to tease the different notions apart.",
        "Finally, it is most intriguing to try to make a start on understanding how some of the different notions might construed as alternative realizations of a single abstract notion."

        "Laver goes on to sketch the work that has been done on phonetic similarity, or, more exactly, phonetic distance, in particular, the empirical derivation of confusion matrices, which indicate the likelihood with which people or speech recognition systems confusion one sound for another.",
        "Miller & Nicely (1955) founded this approach with studies of how humans confused some sounds more readily than others.",
        "Although “con-fusability” is a reasonable reflection of phonetic similarity, it is perhaps worth noting that confusion matrices are often asymmetric, suggesting that something more complex is at play.",
        "Clark & Yallop (1995, p. 319ff) discuss this line of work further, suggesting more sophisticated analyses which aggregate confusion matrices based on segments.",
        "In addition to the phonetic interest (above), phonologists have likewise shown interest in the question of similarity, especially in recent work.",
        "Al-bright and Hayes (2003) have proposed a model of phonological learning which relies on “minimal generalization”.",
        "The idea is that children learn e.g. rules of allomorphy on the basis not merely of rules and individual lexical exceptions (the earlier standard wisdom), but rather on the basis of slight but reliable generalizations.",
        "An example is the formation of the past tense of verbs ending in [iq], ‘ing’ (fling, sing, sting, spring, string) that build past tenses as ‘ung’ [Aq].",
        "We omit details but note that the “minimal generalization” is minimally DISTANT in pronunciation.",
        "Frisch, Pierrehumbert & Broe (2004) have also kindled an interest in segmental similarity among phonologists with their claim that syllables in Semitic languages are constrained to have unlike consonants in syllable onset and coda.",
        "Their work has not gone unchallenged (Bailey and Hahn, 2005; Hahn and Bailey, 2005), but it has certainly created further theoretical interest in phonological similarity.",
        "There has been a great deal of attention in psycholinguistics to the the problem of word recognition, and several models appeal explicitly to the “degree of phonetic similarity among the words” (Luce and Pisoni, 1998, p. 1), but most of these models employ relatively simple notions of sequence similarity and/or, e.g., the idea that distance may be operationalized by the number or replacements needed to derive one word from another – ignoring the problem of similarity among words of different lengths (Vitevitch and Luce, 1999).",
        "Perhaps more sophisticated computational models of pronunciation distance could play a role in these models in the future.",
        "Kessler (1995) showed how to employ edit distance to operationalize pronunciation difference in order to investigate dialectology more precisely, an idea which, particular, Heeringa (2004) pursued at great length.",

        "Several of the contributions to this volume build on these earlier efforts or are relevant to them.",

        "(this volume) investigate several extensions of the fundamental edit distance algorithm for use in dialectology, including sensitivity to order and context as well syllabicity constraints, which they argue to be preferable, and length normalization and graded weighting schemes, which they argue against.",

        "They embed this insight into a scheme in which n-grams are ranked (sorted) by frequency, and the difference in the rankings is used to assay language differences.",

        "Although there is less interest in similarity at the syntactic level among linguistic theorists, there is still one important areas of theoretical research in which it could play an important role and several interdisciplinary studies in which similarity and/or distant is absolutely crucial.",
        "Syntactic TYPOLOGY is an area of linguistic theory which seeks to identify syntactic features which tend to be associated with one another in all languages (Comrie, 1989; Croft, 2001).",
        "The fundamental vision is that some sorts of languages may be more similar to one another – typologically – than would first appear.",
        "Further, there are two interdisciplinary linguistic studies in which similarity and/or distance plays a great role, including similarity at the syntactic level (without, however, exclusively focusing on syntax).",
        "LANGUAGE CONTACT studies seek to identify the elements of one language which have been adopted in a second in a situation in which two or more languages are used in the same community (Thomason and Kaufmann, 1988; van Coetsem, 1988).",
        "Naturally, these may be non-syntactic, but syntactic CONTAMINATION is a central concept which is recognized in contaminated varieties which have become more similar to the languages which are the source of contamination.",
        "Essentially the same phenomena is studied in SECOND-LANGUAGE LEARNING, in which syntactic patterns from a dominant, usually first, language are imposed on a second.",
        "Here the focus is on the psychology of the individual language user as opposed to the collective habits of the language community.",
        "Nerbonne and Wiersma (this volume) collect frequency distributions of part-of-speech (POS) trigrams and explore simple measures of distance between these.",
        "They approach issues of statistical significance using permutation tests, which requires attention to tricky issues of normalization between the frequency distributions.",
        "Homola & Kuboˇn (this volume) join Nerbonne and Wiersma in advocating a surface-oriented measure of syntactic difference, but base their measure on dependency trees rather than POS tags, a more abstract level of analysis.",
        "From there they propose an analogue to edit distance to gauge the degree of difference.",
        "The difference between two tree is the sum of the costs of the tree-editing operations needed to obtain one tree from another (Noetzel and Selkow, 1999).",
        "Emms (this volume) concentrates on applications of the notion ‘tree similarity’ in particular in order to identify text which is syntactically similar to questions and which may therefore be expected to constitute an answer to the question.",
        "He is able to show that the tree-distance measure outperforms sequence distance measures, at least if lexical information is also emphasized.",
        "K¨ubler (this volume) uses the similarity measure in memory-based learning to parse.",
        "This is a surprising approach, since memory-based techniques are normally used in classification tasks where the target is one of a small number of potential classifications.",
        "In parsing, the targets may be arbitrarily complex, so a key step is select an initial structure in a memory-based way, and then to adapt it further.",
        "In this paper K¨ubler first applies chunking to the sentence to be parsed and selects an initial parse based on chunk similarity."

        "While similarity as such has not been a prominent term in theoretical and computational research on natural language semantics, the study of LEXICAL SEMANTICS, which attempts to identify regularities of and systematic relations among word meanings, is more often than not predicated on an implicit notion of ’semantic similarity’.",
        "Research on the lexical semantics of verbs tries to identify verb classes whose members exhibit similar syntactic and semantic behavior.",
        "In logic-based theories of word meaning (e.g., Vendler (1967) and Dowty (1979)), verb classes are identified by similarity patterns of inference, while Levin’s (1993) study of English verb classes demonstrates that similarities of word meanings for verbs can be gleaned from their syntactic behavior, in particular from their ability or inability to participate in diatheses, i.e. patterns of argument alternations.",
        "With the increasing availability of large electronic corpora, recent computational research on word meaning has focused on capturing the notion of ‘context similarity’ of words.",

Firth: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps.” (Firth, 1957, p. 11) Context similarity has been used as a means of extracting collocations from corpora, e.g. by Church & Hanks (1990) and by Dunning (1993), of identifying word senses, e.g. by Yarowski (1995) and by Sch¨utze (1998), of clustering verb classes, e.g. by Schulte im Walde (2003), and of inducing selectional restrictions of verbs, e.g. by Resnik (1993), by Abe & Li (1996), by Rooth et al.",

        "While originally developed for English, both approaches have been successfully generalized to other languages.",
        "The three approaches to word meaning discussed above try to capture different aspects of the notion of semantic similarity, all of which are highly relevant for current and future research in computational linguistics.",

        "Zesch and Gurevych (this volume) discuss how measures of semantic similarity – and more generally: semantic relatedness – can be obtained by similarity judgments of informants who are presented with word pairs and who, for each pair, are asked to rate the degree of semantic relatedness on a predefined scale.",
        "Such similarity judgments can provide important empirical evidence for taxonomic models of word meanings such as wordnets, which thus far rely mostly on expert knowledge of lexicographers.",

        "They draw attention to the fact that, depending on which underlying models are in use, different notions of semantic similarity emerge and conjecture that different similarity metrics may be needed for different NLP tasks.",
        "Dagan (this volume) also explores the idea that different notions of semantic similarity are needed when dealing with semantic disambiguation and language modeling tasks on the one hand and with applications such as information extraction, summarization, and information retrieval on the other hand.",
        "Dridan and Bond (this volume) and Hachey (this volume) both consider semantic similarity from an application-oriented perspective.",
        "Dridan and Bond employ the framework of robust minimal recursion semantics in order to obtain a more adequate measure of sentence similarity than can be obtained by word-overlap metrics for bag-of-words representations of sentences.",
        "They show that such a more fine-grained measure, which is based on compact representations of predicate-logic, yields better performance for paraphrase detection as well as for sentence selection in question-answering tasks than simple word-overlap metrics.",
        "Hachey considers an automatic content extraction (ACE) task, a particular subtask of information extraction.",
        "He demonstrates that representations based on term co-occurrence outperform representations based on term-by-document matrices for the task of identifying relationships between named objects in texts."
