        "A challenge in learning the semantics of mul-tiword expressions (MWEs) is their varying degrees of compositionality – the contribution of each component word to the overall semantics of the expression.",
        "MWEs fall on a range from fully compositional (i.e., each component contributes its meaning, as in frying pan) to non-compositional or idiomatic (as in hit the roof).",
        "Because of this variation, researchers have explored automatic methods for learning whether, or the degree to which, an MWE is compositional (e.g., Lin, 1999; Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Fazly et al., 2005).",
        "However, such work leaves unaddressed the basic issue of which of the possible meanings of a component word is contributed when the MWE is (at least partly) compositional.",
        "Words are notoriously ambiguous, so that even if it can be determined that an MWE is compositional, its meaning is still unknown, since the actual semantic contribution of the components is yet to be determined.",
        "We address this problem in the domain of verb-particle constructions (VPCs) in English, a rich source of MWEs.",
        "VPCs combine a verb with any of a finite set of particles, as in jump up, figure out, or give in.",
        "Particles such as up, out, or in, with their literal meaning based in physical spatial relations, show a variety of metaphorical and aspectual meaning extensions, as exemplified here for the particle up:",

        "Cognitive linguistic analysis, as in Lindner (1981), can provide the basis for elaborating this type of semantic variation.",
        "Given such a sense inventory for a particle, our goal is to automatically determine its meaning when used with a given verb in a VPC.",
        "We classify VPCs according to their particle sense, using statistical features that capture the semantic and syntactic properties of verbs and particles.",
        "We contrast these with simple word co-occurrence features, which are often used to indicate the semantics of a target word.",
        "In our experiments, we focus on VPCs using the particle up because it is highly frequent and has a wide range of meanings.",
        "However, it is worth emphasizing that our feature space draws on general properties of VPCs, and is not specific to this particle.",

        "Given our use of features which capture the statistical behaviour relevant to a VPC across a corpus, we assume that the outcome of type classification yields the predominant sense of the particle in the VPC.",
        "Predominant sense identification is a useful component of sense disambiguation of word tokens (McCarthy et al., 2004), and we presume our VPC type classification work will form the basis for later token disambiguation.",

        "Note that the features are still quite simple, and straightforward to extract from a corpus – i.e., linguistically informed does not mean expensive (although the slot features do require access to chunked text).",
        "Interestingly, in determining the semantic nearest neighbor of German particle verbs, Schulte im Walde (2005) found that WCFs that are restricted to the arguments of the verb outperform simple window-based co-occurrence features.",
        "Although her task is quite different from ours, similarly restricting our WCFs may enable them to encode more linguistically-relevant information.",
        "The accuracies we achieve with the linguistic features correspond to a 30–31% reduction in error rate over the chance baseline for the 3-way task, and an 18–26% reduction in error rate for the 2-way task.",
        "Although we expected that the 2-way task may be easier, since it requires less fine-grained distinctions, it is clear that combining senses that have some motivation for being treated separately comes at a price.",
        "The reductions in error rate that we achieve with our best features are quite respectable for a first attempt at addressing this problem, but more work clearly remains.",
        "There is a relatively high variability in performance across the verification and test sets, indicating that we need a larger number of experimental expressions to be able to draw firmer conclusions.",
        "Even if our current results extend to larger datasets, we intend to explore other feature approaches, such as word co-occurrence features for specific syntactic slots as suggested above, in order to improve the performance."

        "In contrast, our work assumes that the particle of every VPC contributes compositionally to its meaning.",
        "We draw on cognitive linguistic analysis that posits a rich set of literal and metaphorical meaning possibilities of a particle, which has been previously overlooked in computational work on VPCs.",
        "In this first investigation of particle meaning in VPCs, we choose to focus on type-based classification, partly due to the significant extra expense of manually annotating sufficient numbers of tokens in text.",
        "As noted earlier, though, VPCs can take on different meanings, indicating a shortcoming of type-based work.",
        "Patrick and Fletcher (2005) classify VPC tokens, considering each as compositional, non-compositional or not a VPC.",
        "Again, however, it is important to recognize which of the possible meaning components is being contributed.",
        "In this vein, Uchiyama et al.",
        "(2005) tackle token classification of Japanese compound verbs (similar to VPCs) as aspectual, spatial, or adverbial.",
        "In the future, we aim to extend the scope of our work, to determine the meaning of a particle in a VPC token, along the lines of our sense classes here.",
        "This will almost certainly require semantic classification of the verb token (La-pata and Brew, 2004), similar to our approach here of using the semantic class of a verb type as indicative of the meaning of a particle type.",
        "Particle semantics has clear relations to preposition semantics.",
        "Some research has focused on the sense disambiguation of specific prepositions (e.g., Alam, 2004), while other work has classified preposition tokens according to their semantic role (O’Hara and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "Moreover, two large lexical resources of preposition senses are currently under construction, The Preposition Project (Litkowski, 2005) and PrepNet (Saint-Dizier, 2005).",
        "These resources were not suitable as the basis for our sense classes because they do not address the range of metaphorical extensions that a preposition/particle can take on, but future work may enable larger scale studies of the type needed to adequately address VPC semantics."
