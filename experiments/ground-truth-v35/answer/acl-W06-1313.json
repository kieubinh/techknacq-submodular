        "Dialogue systems are built for many different purposes, including information gathering (e.g., (Aust et al., 1995)), performing simple transactions (e.g, (Walker and Hirschman, 2000)), collaborative interaction (e.g., (Allen et al., 1996)), tutoring (e.g., (Rose et al., 2003)), and training (e.g. (Traum and Rickel, 2002)).",
        "Aspects of the purpose, as well as features of the domain itself (e.g., train timetables, air flight bookings, schedule maintenance, physics, and platoon-level military operations) will have a profound effect on the nature of the dialogue which a system will need to engage in.",
        "Issues such as initiative, error correction, flexibility in phrasing and dialogue structure may depend crucially on these factors.",
        "The information state approach to dialogue managers (Larsson and Traum, 2000) has been an attempt to cast some of these differences within the same framework.",
        "In this approach, a theory of dialogue is constructed by providing information structure elements, a set of dialogue moves that can be recognized and produced and are used to modify the nature of these elements, a set of update rules that govern the dynamics of how the information is changed as dialogue moves are performed, and an update strategy.",
        "Many different dialogue systems have been built according to this general approach (e.g., (Cooper and Larsson, 1999; Matheson et al., 2000; Lemon et al., 2001; Johnston et al., 2002; Traum and Rickel, 2002; Purver, 2002)).",
        "In this paper, we present an information-state based dialogue manager for a new domain: training call for fire dialogues.",
        "Like other dialogue systems used as role-players in training applications, the structure of the dialogue is not completely free for a dialogue designer to specify based on issues of dialogue efficiency.",
        "The dialogue system must conform as much as possible to the type of dialogue that a trainee would actually encounter in the types of interaction he or she is being trained for.",
        "In particular, for military radio dialogues, much of the protocol for interaction is specified by convention (e.g., (Army, 2001)).",
        "Still, there is a fair amount of flexibility in how other aspects of the dialogue progress.",
        "This dialogue manager is part of a system we call Radiobot-CFF.",
        "Radiobots are a general class of dialogue systems meant to speak over the radio in military simulations.",
        "Our most extended effort to date is the Radiobot-CFF system, which engages in “call for fire” dialogues to train artillery observers within a virtual reality training simulation.",
        "Our dialogue system can operate according to three different use cases, depending on how much control a human operator/trainer would like to exercise over the dialogue.",
        "There is a fully automatic mode in which the Radiobot-CFF system engages unassisted in dialogue with the user, a semi-automatic mode in which the Radiobot-CFF system fills in forms (which can be edited) and the operator can approve or change communication with a simulator or trainee, and a passive mode in which the operator is engaging in the dialogue and the Radiobot-CFF system is just observing.",

        "In section 3, we describe some aspects of “call for fire dialogues”, especially the differences in initiative and purposes of different phases in the dialogue.",
        "In section 4, we describe the information-state based dialogue model we have developed for this domain.",
        "This includes dialogue moves, information components, and update rules.",

        "JFETS-UTM trains soldiers to make Calls for Fire (CFFs), in which a Forward Observer (FO) team locates an enemy target and requests an artillery fire mission by radio from a Fire Direction Center (FDC).",
        "The training room resembles a battle-scarred apartment in a Middle Eastern country.",
        "A window shows a virtual city displayed by a rear-projected computer screen, and the soldiers use binoculars with computer displays at their ends to search for targets.",
        "Ordinarily, two trainers control a UTM session.",
        "One communicates with the FO via a simulated radio, and the other decides what the artillery fire should be and inputs it to a GUI for the simulator.",
        "It is our goal to replace those two trainers with one trainer focusing on assessment while Radiobot-CFF handles the radio communications and interfaces with the virtual world.",
        "Radiobot-CFF is composed of several pipelined components.",
        "A Speech Recognition component is implemented using the SONIC speech recognition system (Pellom, 2001) with custom language and acoustic models.",
        "An Interpreter component tags the ASR output with its its dialogue move and parameter labels using two separate Conditional Random Field (Sha and Pereira, 2003; McCallum, 2002) taggers trained on hand-annotated utterances.",
        "A Dialogue Manager processes the tagged output, sending a reply to the FO (via a template-based Generator) and, when necessary, a message to the artillery simulator FireSim XXI1 to make decisions on what type of fire to send.",

        "CFFs can generally be divided into three phases.",
        "In the first phase (utterances 1-6 in Figure 1) the FOs identify themselves and important information about the CFF, including their coordinates, the kind of fire they are requesting, the location of the target, and the kind of target.",
        "In utterance 1 in Figure 1 the FO performs an identification, giving his own call sign and that of the FDC he is calling, and also specifies a method of fire (“adjust fire”) and a method of targeting (“polar”.)",
        "Note that when speakers expect a reply, they end their utterance with “over” as in utterance 1, otherwise with “out” as in the confirmation in utterance 2.",
        "In utterance 3 the FO gives target coordinates, and in utterance 5 the FO identifies the target as a BMP (a type of light tank) and requests ICM rounds (“improved conventional munitions”.)",
        "These turns typically follow one another",
        "in quick sequence.",
        "In the second phase of a CFF, (utterances 7-12 in Figure 1), after the FDC decides what kind of fire they will send, they inform the FO in a message to observer (MTO) as in utterance 7.",
        "This includes the units that will fire (“kilo alpha”), the kind of ammunition (“high explosive”), the number of rounds and method of fire (“4 rounds adjust fire”), and the target number (“alpha bravo one zero zero zero”).",
        "CFFs are requests rather than orders, and they may be denied in full or in part.",
        "In this example, the FO’s request for ICM rounds was denied in favor of High Explosive rounds.",
        "Next the FDC informs the FO when the fire mission has been shot, as in utterance 9, and when the fire is about to land, as in utterance 11.",
        "Each of these are confirmed by the FO.",
        "In the third phase, (utterances 13-20 in Figure 1) the FO regains dialogue initiative.",
        "Depending on the observed results, the FO may request that the fire be repeated with an adjust in location or method of fire.",
        "In utterance 13 the FO requests that the shot be resent to a location 50 meters to the right of the previous shot as a “fire for effect” all-out bombardment rather than an “adjust fire” targeting fire.",
        "This is followed by the abbreviated FDC-initiated phase of utterances 15-18.",
        "In utterance 19 the FO ends the mission, describing the results and number of casualties.",
        "Besides the behavior shown, at any turn either participant may request or initiate an intelligence report or request the status of a mission.",

        "The dialogue moves that provide information include those in which the FOs transmit their Observer Coordinates (grid location on a map), a generic Situation Report, or one of the various components of a fire mission request ranging from call sign Identification to final End of Mission.",
        "The dialogue moves that confirm information include those that confirm the MTO and other FDC-initiated utterances, or a general report on scenario Intel.",
        "The final group includes requests to check radio functionality, to repeat the previous utterance, for status of a shot, to stand by for transmission of information, and finally a set of commands such as “check fire” requesting cancellation of a submitted fire mission.",

        "By dividing the components into multiple classes we separate those that are simulator-specific from more general aspects of the domain.",
