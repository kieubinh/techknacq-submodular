        "Coordination of phrases of different syntactic categories has posed a problem for generative systems based only on syntactic categories.",
        "Although some prefer to treat them as exceptional cases that should require some extra mechanism (as for elliptical constructions), or to allow for unrestricted cross-category coordination, they can be naturally derived in a grammatic functional generative approach.",
        "In this paper we explore the ideia on how mixing syntactic categories and grammatical functions in the label set of a Tree Adjoining Grammar allows us to develop grammars that elegantly handle both the cases of same and cross-category coordination in an uniform way."

        "Generative grammars that we commonly hear about in computational linguistics are usually based on syntactic categories.",
        "This is also the case when the formalism used is the Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs).",
        "Large scale handcrafted grammars for many languages have been built based on this paradigm (Joshi, 2001; XTAG Research Group, 2001; Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Abeill´e and Candito, 2000; Candito, 1998; Becker, 1993; Frank, 2002; Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Abeill´e and Rambow, 2000) as well as grammars extracted from corpora (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000; Hwa, 1999; Xia et al., 2001; Xia, 2001).",
        "The latter is partly due to the fact that large scale annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994; Bies et al., 1995) give primacy to syntactic categories.",
        "After all this is the most strongly sedimented generative approach at least since (Chomsky, 1957).",
        "Computational approaches of grammar based on grammatical function such as that of Susumu Kuno (Kuno, 1987) have been given less importance.",
        "Although we can think of simply inserting functional labels in elementary trees or use them in a meta-level to generate the grammar, such as in (Candito, 1998; Kinyon, 2000; Cl´ement and Kinyon, 2003), such tags are generally not seen as an essential part of the derivational process.",
        "Nevertheless coordination is such an inherently functional phenomenon as we show next.",
        "Consider the sentences in (1) and (2).",
        "These are examples of regular coordination between phrases of the same category.",
        "They can easily be handled in the traditional grammar approaches of syntactic category.",
        "(1) She flew [PP on May 1st and on July 4th ].",
        "(2) They sell [ADJP electric and electronic ] products.",
        "Now look at the cases in (3) and (4).",
        "They are different in the sense that the coordination is across categories.",
        "This poses a strong problem to the traditional grammar of syntactic categories.",
        "This has been noticed for TAGs in (Prolo, 2002).",
        "Recently this has also been tackled in the HPSG framework by (Sag, 2003) and (Abeill´e, 2004).",
        "The Penn Treebank calls this constituents UCP for “Unlike Coordinated Phrases” (Bies et al., 1995).",
        "The problem is that we would need rules of the kind below (using context-free rules for short – see (Prolo, 2002) for TAGs).",
        "Basically all pairs of constituents can be coordinated but we can not assign to the resulting constituents either of the sub-constituent tags.",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "(3) She flew [??",
        "yesterday and on July 4th ].",
        "(4) They sell [??",
        "electronic and computer ] de",
        "vices.",
        "However, UCP coordination is not random.",
        "Two constituents can be coordinated only when they are fulfilling the same grammatical function (with respect to a third head).",
        "In (3) they are playing the role of adverbial adjuncts of went.",
        "Either one can engage in that relation individually and hence they can be coordinated while playing that role.",
        "Likewise in (4) the adjective electronic and the noun computer are both fine as left NP modifiers.",
        "Therefore they can be conjoined as such.",
        "As a final example, consider the sentences in (5).",
        "Because the direct object of the verb know can be realized as either an NP or a sentential complement, they can be coordinated in that role as shown in (6).",
        "(5) I know the answer.",
        "I know that you don’t know it.",
        "(6) I know [ the answer and that you don’t know it ].",
        "Clearly the recursive process of conjoining the constituents is at the grammatic functional level.",
        "We show next how we can solve this problem elegantly by mixing grammatical function and syntactic category in the set of symbols for the tree nodes of a TAG."

        "The elementary trees in our grammar are the projection of a lexical item as usual in Lexicalized TAGs.",

        "Finally, in Figure 3 we can see the trees for coordination of left adnominal adjuncts.",
        "Notice that they adjoin at the function node (AdnAdjLeft) therefore allowing for the coordination of anything that can fulfill that role, be them equal categories as in (2) or the UCP case in (4).",
        "In Figure 4 we show an additional example with a PP right NP modifier.",
        "It should be straightforward to see how to build trees for AdnAdjRight coordination of constituents realized by a PP or a relative clause.",
        "In Figure 5 we finally get to subcategorization.",
        "In any approach to grammar development we have to make decisions between explicitly modeling certain restrictions in the tree structure or through features (of a feature based TAG).",
        "That can be seen ubiquitously in the XTAG grammar (XTAG Research Group, 2001).",
        "We can use the tree of the figure with verbs such like eat and know, having trees to realize the direct object as either an NP or a sentence.",
        "Features in the lexical items would prevent the derivation of eat with a sentential complement.",
        "Another approach would be to further detail the tree into one with a built in NP object 'Figures generally show templates where a diamond indicates where the lexical item would be substituted in, though occasionally we insert the lexical item itself.",
        "and another with a sentential complement.",
        "However, realization constraints would still have to be present to allow for the coordination of only the constituents that are allowed for the specific verb.",
        "For the reader unfamiliar with grammar modeling we notice this is not a drawback of the approach.",
        "Constraints beyond those represented in the structure are constantly made as a way to avoid irrational growth of a grammar.",

        "This information could otherwise be hidden in node features, which are generally used to represent information that would be costly to maintain explicit in the tree structure.",
        "Finally we can see that this structure can be easily incorporated in a supervised grammar inference algorithm such as that of (Xia, 2001), provided the annotated corpus has grammatical function information.",
