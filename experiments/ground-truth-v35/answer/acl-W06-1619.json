        "For the last decade, accurate and wide-coverage parsing for real-world text has been intensively and extensively pursued.",
        "In most of state-of-the-art parsers, probabilistic events are defined over phrase structures because phrase structures are supposed to dominate syntactic configurations of sentences.",
        "For example, probabilities were defined over grammar rules in probabilistic CFG (Collins, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003; Char-niak and Johnson, 2005) or over complex phrase structures of head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) or combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Clark and Curran, 2004b; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005).",
        "Although these studies vary in the design of the probabilistic models, the fundamental conception of probabilistic modeling is intended to capture characteristics of phrase structures or grammar rules.",
        "Although lexical information, such as head words, is known to significantly improve the parsing accuracy, it was also used to augment information on phrase structures.",
        "Another interesting approach to this problem was using supertagging (Clark and Curran, 2004b; Clark and Curran, 2004a; Wang and Harper, 2004; Nasr and Rambow, 2004), which was originally developed for lexicalized tree adjoining grammars (LTAG) (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",
        "Supertag-ging is a process where words in an input sentence are tagged with ‘supertags,’ which are lexical entries in lexicalized grammars, e.g., elementary trees in LTAG, lexical categories in CCG, and lexical entries in HPSG.",
        "Supertagging was, in the first place, a technique to reduce the cost of parsing with lexicalized grammars; ambiguity in assigning lexical entries to words is reduced by the lightweight process of supertagging before the heavy process of parsing.",
        "Bangalore and Joshi (1999) claimed that if words can be assigned correct supertags, syntactic parsing is almost trivial.",
        "What this means is that if supertags are correctly assigned, syntactic structures are almost de",
        "termined because supertags include rich syntactic information such as subcategorization frames.",
        "Nasr and Rambow (2004) showed that the accuracy of LTAG parsing reached about 97%, assuming that the correct supertags were given.",
        "The concept of supertagging is simple and interesting, and the effects of this were recently demonstrated in the case of a CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004a) with the result of a drastic improvement in the parsing speed.",
        "Wang and Harper (2004) also demonstrated the effects of supertagging with a statistical constraint dependency grammar (CDG) parser.",
        "They achieved accuracy as high as the state-of-the-art parsers.",
        "However, a supertagger itself was used as an external tagger that enumerates candidates of lexical entries or filters out unlikely lexical entries just to help parsing, and the best parse trees were selected mainly according to the probabilistic model for phrase structures or dependencies with/without the probabilistic model for supertagging.",
        "We investigate an extreme case of HPSG parsing in which the probabilistic model is defined with only the probabilities of lexical entry selection; i.e., the model is never sensitive to characteristics of phrase structures.",
        "The model is simply defined as the product of the supertagging probabilities, which are provided by the discriminative method with machine learning features of word trigrams and part-of-speech (POS) 5-grams as defined in the CCG supertagging (Clark and Curran, 2004a).",
        "The model is implemented in an HPSG parser instead of the phrase-structure-based probabilistic model; i.e., the parser returns the parse tree assigned the highest probability of supertagging among the parse trees licensed by an HPSG.",
        "Though the model uses only the probabilities of lexical entry selection, the experiments revealed that it was as accurate as the previous phrase-structure-based model.",
        "Interestingly, this means that accurate parsing is possible using rather simple mechanisms.",
        "We also tested a hybrid model of the supertagging and the previous phrase-structure-based probabilistic model.",
        "In the hybrid model, the probabilities of the previous model are multiplied by the supertagging probabilities instead of a preliminary probabilistic model, which is introduced to help the process of estimation by filtering unlikely lexical entries (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005).",
        "In the previous model, the preliminary probabilistic model is defined as the probability of unigram supertagging.",
        "So, the hybrid model can be regarded as an extension of supertagging from unigram to n-gram.",
        "The hybrid model can also be regarded as a variant of the statistical CDG parser (Wang, 2003; Wang and Harper, 2004), in which the parse tree probabilities are defined as the product of the supertagging probabilities and the dependency probabilities.",
        "In the experiments, we observed that the hybrid model significantly improved the parsing speed, by around three to four times speed-ups, and accuracy, by around two points in both precision and recall, over the previous model.",
        "This implies that finer probabilistic model of lexical entry selection can improve the phrase-structure-based model."

        "The structures of sentences are explained using combinations of schemata and lexical entries.",
        "Both schemata and lexical entries are represented by typed feature structures, and constraints represented by feature structures are checked with unification.",

Given a sentence, an HPSG computes a set of phrasal signs, i.e., feature structures, as a result of parsing.",

The model parameters, Au, are estimated using numerical optimization methods (Malouf, 2002) to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data.",
        "However, the above model cannot be easily estimated because the estimation requires the computation of p(TIw) for all parse candidates assigned to sentence w. Because the number of parse candidates is exponentially related to the length of the sentence, the estimation is intractable for long sentences.",
        "To make the model estimation tractable, Geman and Johnson (Geman and Johnson, 2002) and Miyao and Tsujii (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for estimating p(TIw).",
