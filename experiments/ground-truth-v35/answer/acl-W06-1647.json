        "Due to the rising importance of globalization and multilingualism, there is a need to build natural language processing (NLP) systems for an increasingly wider range of languages, including those languages that have traditionally not been the focus of NLP research.",
        "The development of NLP technologies for a new language is a challenging task since one needs to deal not only with language-specific phenomena but also with a potential lack of available resources (e.g. lexicons, text, annotations).",
        "In this study we investigate the problem of learning a part-of-speech (POS) lexicon for a resource-poor language, dialectal Arabic.",
        "Developing a high-quality POS lexicon is the first step towards training a POS tagger, which in turn is typically the front end for other NLP applications such as parsing and language modeling.",
        "In the case of resource-poor languages (and dialectal Arabic in particular), this step is much more critical than is typically assumed: a lexicon with too few constraints on the possible POS tags for a given word can have disastrous effects on tagging accuracy.",
        "Whereas such constraints can be obtained from large hand-labeled corpora or high-quality annotation tools in the case of resource-rich languages, no such resources are available for dialectal Arabic.",
        "Instead, constraints on possible POS tags must be inferred from a small amount of tagged words, or imperfect analysis tools.",
        "This can be seen as the problem of learning complex, structured outputs (multi-class labels, with a different number of classes for different words and dependencies among the individual labels) from partially labeled data.",
        "Our focus is on investigating several machine learning techniques for this problem.",
        "In particular, we argue that lexicon learning in resource-poor languages can be best viewed as transductive learning.",
        "The main contribution of this work are: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of three transductive algorithms (Transductive SVM, Spectral Graph Transducer, and a new technique called Transductive Clustering) as well as an inductive SVM on this task; and (2) a demonstration that lexicon learning is a worthwhile investment and leads to significant improvements in the tagging accuracy for dialectal Arabic.",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the problem in more detail and discusses the situation in dialectal Arabic.",
        "The transductive framework and algorithms for lexicon learning are elaborated in Section 3.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 describe the data and system.",
        "Experimental results are presented in Section 6.",

      "text": [
        "The lack of annotated training data in resource-poor languages necessitates the use of unsupervised taggers.",
        "One commonly-used unsupervised tagger is the Hidden Markov model (HMM), which models the joint distribution of a word sequence w0:M and tag sequence t0:M as:",
        "This is a trigram HMM.",
        "Unsupervised learning is performed by running the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm on raw text.",
        "In this procedure, the tag sequences are unknown, and the probability tables p(wi1ti) and p(ti 1ti-1, ti-2) are iteratively updated to maximize the likelihood of the observed word sequences.",
        "Although previous research in unsupervised tagging have achieved high accuracies rivaling supervised methods (Kupiec, 1992; Brill, 1995), much of the success is due to the use of artificially constrained lexicons.",
        "Specifically, the lexicon is a wordlist where each word is annotated with the set of all its possible tags.",
        "(We will call the set of possible tags of a given word the POS-set of that word; an example: POS-set of the English word bank may be {NN, VB}.)",
        "Banko and Moore (2004) showed that unsupervised tagger accuracies on English degrade from 96% to 77% if the lexicon is not constrained such that only high frequency tags exist in the POS-set for each word.",
        "Why is the lexicon so critical in unsupervised tagging?",
        "The answer is that it provides additional knowledge about word-tag distributions that may otherwise be difficult to glean from raw text alone.",
        "In the case of unsupervised HMM taggers, the lexicon provides constraints on the probability tables p(wi1ti) and p(ti1ti-1,ti-2).",
        "Specifically, the lexical probability table is initialized such that p(wi 1ti) = 0 if and only if tag ti is not included in the POS-set of word wi.",
        "The transition probability table is initialized such that p(ti 1ti-1, ti-2) = 0 if and only if the tag sequence (ti, ti-1, ti-2) never occurs in the tag lattice induced by the lexicon on the raw text.",
        "The effect of these zero-probability initialization is that they will always stay zero throughout the EM procedure (modulo the effects of smoothing).",
        "This therefore acts as hard constraints and biases the EM algorithm to avoid certain solutions when maximizing likelihood.",
        "If the lexicon is accurate, then the EM algorithm can learn very good predictive distributions from raw text only; conversely, if the lexicon is poor, EM will be faced with more confusability during training and may not produce a good tagger.",
        "In general, the addition of rare tags, even if they are correct, creates a harder learning problem for EM.",
        "Thus, a critical aspect of resource-poor POS tagging is the acquisition of a high-quality lexicon.",
        "This task is challenging because the lexicon learning algorithm must not be resource-intensive.",
        "In practice, one may be able to find analysis tools or incomplete annotations such that only a partial lexicon is available.",
        "The focus is therefore on effective machine learning algorithms for inferring a full high-quality lexicon from a partial, possibly noisy initial lexicon.",

        "This classifier can simply take all POS tags hypothesized positive by the individual binary classifiers to form the POS-set, or use a more sophisticated scheme for determining the number of POS tags (Elisseeff and Weston, 2002).",

        "A POS-set such as {“NN”, “VB”} is “compounded” into one label “NN-VB”, which results in a different label than, say, “NN” or “NN-JJ”.",

        "We also compute precision/recall statistics of the final lexicon on the test set words (similar to Section 5) and measure the average size of the POS-sets (llPOSsetll).",
        "As seen in Table 4, POS-set sizes of machine-learned lexicon is a factor of 2 or 3 smaller than that of the baseline lexicons.",
        "On the other hand, recall is better for the baseline lexicons.",
        "These observations, combined with the fact that machine-learned lexicons gave better tagging accuracy, suggests that we have a constrained lexicon effect here: i.e. for EM training, it is better to constrain the lexicon with small POS-sets than to achieve high recall.",
        "Next, we examined the effects of error propagation from the MSA analyzer in Step 1.",
        "We attempted to correct these errors by using POS-sets of words derived from the development data.",
        "In",
        "particular, of the 1562 partial lexicon words that also occur in the development set, we found 1044 words without entirely matching POS-sets.",
        "These POS-sets are replaced with the oracle POS-sets derived from the development data, and the result is treated as the (corrected) partial lexicon of Step 1.",
        "In this procedure, the average POS-set size of the partial lexicon decreased from 2.13 to 1.10, recall increased from 82.44% to 100%, and precision increased from 57.15% to 64.31%.",
        "We apply lexicon learning to this corrected partial lexicon and evaluate tagging results, shown in Table 5.",
        "The fact that all numbers in Table 5 represent significant improvements over Table 3 implies that error propagation is not a trivial problem, and automatic error correction methods may be desired.",
        "the partial lexicon prior to lexicon learning.",
        "Interestingly, we note ISVM outperforms TC here, which differs from Table 3.",
        "Finally, we determine whether error propagation impacts lexicon learning (Step 2) or EM training (Step 3) more.",
        "Table 6 shows the results of TSVM for four scenarios: correcting analyzer errors in the the lexicon: (A) prior to lexicon learning, (B) prior to EM training, (C) both, or (D) none.",
        "As seen in Table 6, correcting the lexicon at Step 3 (EM training) gives the most improvements, indicating that analyzer errors affects EM training more than lexicon learning.",
        "This implies that lexicon learning is relatively robust to training data corruption, and that one can mainly focus on improved estimation techniques for EM training (Wang and Schuurmans, 2005) if the goal is to alleviate the impact of analyzer errors.",
        "The same evaluation on the other machine learning methods (TC, ISVM, SGT) show similar results."
