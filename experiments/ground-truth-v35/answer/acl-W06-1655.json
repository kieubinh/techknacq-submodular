        "The problem of segmenting sequence data into chunks arises in many natural language applications, such as named-entity recognition, shallow parsing, and word segmentation in East Asian languages.",
        "Two popular discriminative models that have been proposed for these tasks are the conditional random field (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and the semi-Markov conditional random field (semi-CRF) (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "A CRF in its basic form is a model for labeling tokens in a sequence; however it can easily be adapted to perform segmentation via labeling each token as BEGIN or CONTINUATION, or according to some similar scheme.",
        "CRFs using this technique have been shown to be very successful at the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS), starting with the model of Peng et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "In the Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005), two of the highest scoring systems in the closed track competition were based on a CRF model.",
        "(Tseng et al., 2005; Asa-hara et al., 2005) While the CRF is quite effective compared with other models designed for CWS, one wonders whether it may be limited by its restrictive independence assumptions on non-adjacent labels: an order-M CRF satisfies the order-M Markov assumption that, globally conditioned on the input sequence, each label is independent of all other labels given the M labels to its left and right.",
        "Consequently, the model only “sees” word boundaries within a moving window of M + 1 characters, which prohibits it from explicitly modeling the tendency of strings longer than that window to form words, or from modeling the lengths of the words.",
        "Although the window can in principle be widened by increasing M, this is not a practical solution as the complexity of training and decoding a linear sequence CRF grows exponentially with the Markov order.",
        "The semi-CRF is a sequence model that is designed to address this difficulty via careful relaxation of the Markov assumption.",
        "Rather than recasting the segmentation problem as a labeling problem, the semi-CRF directly models the distribution of chunk boundaries.1 In terms of inde",
        "pendence, using an order-M semi-CRF entails the assumption that, globally conditioned on the input sequence, the position of each chunk boundary is independent of all other boundaries given the positions of the M boundaries to its left and right regardless of how far away they are.",
        "Even with an order-1 model, this enables several classes of features that one would expect to be of great utility to the word segmentation task, in particular word length and word identity.",
        "Despite this, the only work of which we are aware exploring the use of a semi-Markov CRF for Chinese word segmentation did not find significant gains over the standard CRF (Liang, 2005).",
        "This is surprising, not only because the additional features a semi-CRF enables are intuitively very useful, but because as we will show, an order-M semi-CRF is strictly more powerful than an order-M CRF, in the sense that any feature that can be used in the latter can also be used in the former, or equivalently, the semi-CRF makes strictly weaker independence assumptions.",
        "Given a judicious choice of features (or simply enough training data) the semi-CRF should be superior.",
        "We propose that the reason for this discrepancy may be that despite the greater representational power of the semi-CRF, there are some valuable features that are more naturally expressed in a CRF segmentation model, and so they are not typically included in semi-CRFs (indeed, they have not to date been used in any semi-CRF model for any task, to our knowledge).",
        "In this paper, we show that semi-CRFs are strictly more expressive, and also demonstrate how CRF-type features can be used in a semi-CRF model for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Our experiments show that a model incorporating both types of features can outperform models using only one or the other type.",
        "Orthogonally, we explore in this paper the use of a very powerful feature for the semi-CRF derived from a generative model.",
        "It is common in statistical NLP to use as features in a discriminative model the (logarithm of the) estimated probability of some event according to a generative model.",
        "For example, Collins (2000) uses a discriminative classifier for choosing among the top N parse trees output by a generative baseline model, and uses the log-probability of a parse according to the baseline model as a feature in the reranker.",
        "Similarly, the machine translation system of Och and Ney uses log-probabilities of phrasal translations and other events as features in a log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002; Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "There are many reasons for incorporating these types of features, including the desire to combine the higher accuracy of a discriminative model with the simple parameter estimation and inference of a generative one, and also the fact that generative models are more robust in data sparse scenarios (Ng and Jordan, 2001).",
        "For word segmentation, one might want to use as a local feature the log-probability that a segment is a word, given the character sequence it spans.",
        "A curious property of this feature is that it induces a counterintuitive asymmetry between the is-word and is-not-word cases: the component generative model can effectively dictate that a certain chunk is not a word, by assigning it a very low probability (driving the feature value to negative infinity), but it cannot dictate that a chunk is a word, because the log-probability is bounded above.2 If instead the log conditional odds log P ( I') is used, the asymmetry disappears.",
        "We show that such a log-odds feature provides much greater benefit than the log-probability, and that it is useful to include such a feature even when the model also includes indicator function features for every word in the training corpus."

        "This decomposition is responsible for the characteristic independence assumptions of the semi-CRF.",
        "Hand-in-hand with the feature decomposition and independence assumptions comes the capacity for exact decoding using the Viterbi algorithm, and exact computation of the objective gradient using the forward-backward algorithm, both in time quadratic in the lengths of the sentences.",
        "Furthermore, if the model is constrained to propose only chunkings with maximum word length k, then the time for inference and training becomes linear in the sentence length (and in k).",
        "For Chinese word segmentation, choosing a moderate value of k does not pose any significant risk, since the vast majority of Chinese words are only a few characters long: in our training set, 91 % of word tokens were one or two characters, and 99% were five characters or less.",
        "Using a semi-CRF as opposed to a traditional Markov CRF allows us to model some aspects of word segmentation that one would expect to be very informative.",
        "In particular, it makes possible the use of local indicator function features of the type “the chunk consists of character sequence X1, ... , Xt,” or “the chunk is of length E.” It also enables “pseudo-bigram language model” features, firing when a given word occurs in the context of a given character unigram or bigram.3 And crucially, although it is slightly less natural to do so, any feature used in an order-1 Markov CRF can also be represented in a semi-CRF.",

        "For example, the first feature mentioned above could be valuable to rule out certain word boundaries if X were a character that typically occurs only as a suffix but that combines freely with a variety of root forms to create new words.",
        "This type of feature (specifically, a feature indicating the absence as opposed to the presence of a chunk boundary) is a bit less natural in a semi-CRF, since in that case local features 0S(yj, yj+1, x) are defined on pairs of adjacent boundaries.",

        "Notably, none of those studies experimented with features of chunk non-boundaries, as is achieved by the use of CRF-type features involving the label C, and we take this to be the reason for their not obtaining higher results.",
        "Although it has become fairly common in NLP to use the log conditional probabilities of events as features in a discriminative model, we are not aware of any work using the log conditional odds."

      "text": [
        "We have shown that order-1 semi-Markov conditional random fields are strictly more expressive than order-1 Markov CRFs, and that the added expressivity enables the use of features that lead to improvements on a segmentation task.",
        "On the other hand, Markov CRFs can more naturally incorporate certain features that may be useful for modeling sub-chunk phenomena and generalization to unseen chunks.",
        "To achieve the best performance for segmentation, we propose that both types of features be used, and we show how this can be done efficiently.",
        "Additionally, we have shown that a log conditional odds feature estimated from a generative model can be superior to the more common log conditional probability."
