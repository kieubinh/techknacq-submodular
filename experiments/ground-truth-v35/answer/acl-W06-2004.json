        "We also mix together occurrences of the ambiguous name found in English with the occurrences of the name in the language in which we are trying to discriminate.",
        "We refer to this as a language salad, and find that it often results in even better performance than when only using English or the language itself as the source of information for discrimination."

        "Name ambiguity is a problem that is increasing in complexity and scope as online information sources grow and expand their coverage.",
        "Like words, names are often ambiguous and can refer to multiple underlying entities or concepts.",
        "Web searches for names can often return results associated with multiple people or organizations in a disorganized and unclear fashion.",
        "For example, the top 10 results of a Google search for George Miller includes a mixture of entries for two different entities, one a psychology professor from Princeton University and the other the director of the film Mad Max.'",
        "Name discrimination takes some number of contexts that include an ambiguous name, and divides them into groups or clusters, where the con-'Search conducted January 4, 2006. texts in each cluster should ideally refer to the same underlying entity (and each cluster should refer to a different entity).",
        "Thus, if we are given 10,000 contexts that include the name John Smith, we would want to divide those contexts into clusters corresponding to each of the different underlying entities that share that name.",
        "We have developed an unsupervised method of name discrimination (Pedersen et al., 2005).",
        "We have shown the method to be language independent (Pedersen et al., 2006), which is to say we can apply it to English contexts as easily as we can apply it to Romanian or French.",
        "However, we have observed that there are situations where the number of contexts in which an ambiguous name occurs is relatively small, perhaps because the name itself is unusual, or because the quantity of data available for language is limited in general.",
        "These problems of scarcity can make it difficult to apply these methods and discriminate ambiguous names, especially in languages with fewer online resources.",
        "This paper presents a method of name discrimination is based on using a larger number of contexts in English that include an ambiguous name, and applying information derived from these contexts to the discrimination of that name in another language, where there are many fewer contexts.",
        "We also show that mixing English contexts with the contexts to be discriminated can result in a performance improvement over only using the English or the original contexts alone."

        "Our method of name discrimination is described in more detail in (Pedersen et al., 2005), but in general is based on an unsupervised approach to word sense discrimination introduced by (Purandare and",
        "Pedersen, 2004), which builds upon earlier work in word sense discrimination, including (Sch¨utze, 1998) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).",
        "Our method treats each occurrence of an ambiguous name as a context that is to be clustered with other contexts that also include the same name.",
        "In this paper, each context consists of about 50 words, where the ambiguous name is generally in the middle of the context.",
        "The goal is to cluster similar contexts together, based on the presumption that the occurrences of a name that appear in similar contexts will refer to the same underlying entity.",

        "The contexts to be clustered are represented by lexical features which may be selected from either the contexts being clustered, or from a separate corpus.",
        "In this paper we use both approaches.",
        "We cluster the contexts based on features identified in those very same contexts, and we also cluster the contexts based on features identified in a separate set of data (in this case English).",
        "We explore the use of a mixed feature selection strategy where we identify features both from the data to be clustered and the separate corpus of English text.",
        "Thus, our feature selection data may come from one of three sources: the contexts to be clustered (which we will refer to as the evaluation contexts), English contexts which include the same name but are not to be clustered, and the combination of these two (our so-called Language Salad or Mix).",
        "The lexical features we employ are bigrams, that is consecutive words that occur together in the corpora from which we are identifying features.",
        "In this work we identify bigram features using Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI).",
        "This is defined as the log of the ratio of the observed frequency with which the two words occur together in the feature selection data, to the expected number of times the two words would occur together in a corpus if they were independent.",
        "This expected value is estimated simply by taking the product of the number of times the two words occur individually, and dividing this by the total number of bigrams in the feature selection data.",
        "Thus, larger values of PMI indicate that the observed frequency of the bigram is greater than would be expected if the two words were independent.",
        "In these experiments we take the top 500 ranked bigrams that occur five or more times in the feature selection data.",
        "We also exclude any bigram from consideration that is made up of one or two stop words, which are high frequency function words that have been specified in a manually created list.",
        "Note that with smaller numbers of contexts (usually 200 or fewer), we lower the frequency threshold to two or more.",
        "In general PMI is known to have a bias towards pairs of words (bigrams) that occur a small number of times and only with each other.",

        "For example, garden and fire may not occur together often, but both commonly occur with hose.",
        "Thus, garden hose and fire hose represent first order co–occurrences, and garden and fire represent a second order co– occurrence.",
        "The process of creating the second order representation has several steps.",
        "First, the bigram features identified by PMI (the top ranked 500 bigrams that have occurred 5 or more times in the feature selection data) are used to create a word by word co–occurrence matrix.",
        "The first word in each bigram represents a row in the matrix, and the second word in each bigram represents a column.",
        "The cells in the matrix contain the PMI scores.",
        "Note that this matrix is not symmetric, and that there are many words that only occur in either a row or a column (and not both) because they tend to occur as the first or second word in a bigram.",
        "For example, President might tend to be a first word in a bigram (e.g., President Clinton, President Putin), whereas last names will tend to be the second word.",

        "While we could derive a second order representation of the contexts, the resulting co–occurrence matrix would likely be very small and sparse, and insufficient for making good discrimination decisions.",

        "contexts based on the number of features they have in common with other evaluation contexts.",
        "In fact, results on word sense discrimination (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) suggest that first order representations are more effective with larger number of context than second order methods.",
        "However, we see examples in these results that suggests this may not always be the case.",
        "In the Bulgarian results, the largest number of Bulgarian contexts are for NATO-USA, but the Mix performs quite a bit better than Bulgarian only.",
        "In the case of Romanian, again NATO-USA has the largest number of contexts, but the Mix still does better than Romanian only.",
        "And in Spanish, Mexico-India has the largest number of contexts and English-only does better.",
        "Thus, even in cases where we have an abundant number of evaluation contexts, the indirect nature of the second order representation provides some added benefit.",
        "We believe that the perspective of the news organizations providing the corpora certainly has an impact on the results.",
        "For example, in Romanian, the news about David Beckham and Ronaldo is probably much the same as in the United States.",
        "These are international figures that are both external to countries where the news originates, and there is no reason to suppose there would be a unique local perspective represented by any of the news sources.",
        "The only difference among them might be in the number of contexts available.",
        "In this situation, the addition of the English contexts may provide enough additional information to improve discrimination performance in another language.",
        "For example, in the 162 Romanian contexts for Ronaldo-Beckham, there is one occurrence of Posh, which was the stage name of Beckham’s wife Victoria.",
        "This is below our frequency cutoff threshold for feature selection, so it would be discarded when using Romanian–only contexts.",
        "However, in the English contexts Posh is mentioned 6 times, and is included as a feature.",
        "Thus, the one occurrence of Posh in the Romanian corpus can be well represented by information found in the English contexts, thus allowing that Romanian context to be correctly discriminated."
