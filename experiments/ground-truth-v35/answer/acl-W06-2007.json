      "text": [
        "Results from recent Senseval workshops have shown that supervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems tend to outperform their unsupervised counterparts.",
        "However, supervised systems rely on large amounts of accurately sense-annotated data to yield good results and such resources are very costly to produce.",
        "It is difficult for supervised WSD systems to perform well and reliably on words that do not have enough sense-tagged training data.",
        "This is the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "To overcome this bottleneck, unsupervised WSD approaches have been proposed.",
        "Among them, systems under the multilingual paradigm have shown great promise (Gale et al., 1992; Da-gan and Itai, 1994; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Li and Li, 2004; Chan and Ng, 2005; Wang and Carroll, 2005).",
        "The underlying hypothesis is that mappings between word forms and meanings can be different from language to language.",
        "Much work have been done on extracting sense examples from parallel corpora for WSD.",
        "For example, Ng et al.",
        "(2003) proposed to train a classifier on sense examples acquired from word-aligned English-Chinese parallel corpora.",
        "They grouped senses that share the same Chinese translation, and then the occurrences of the word on the English side of the parallel corpora were considered to have been disambiguated and “sense tagged” by the appropriate Chinese translations.",
        "Their system was evaluated on the nouns in Senseval-2 English lexical sample dataset, with promising results.",
        "Their follow-up work (Chan and Ng, 2005) has successfully scaled up the approach and achieved very good performance on the Senseval-2 English all-word task.",
        "Despite the promising results, there are problems with relying on parallel corpora.",
        "For example, there is a lack of matching occurrences for some Chinese translations to English senses.",
        "Thus gathering training examples for them might be difficult, as reported in (Chan and Ng, 2005).",
        "Also, parallel corpora themselves are rare resources and not available for many language pairs.",
        "Some researchers seek approaches using monolingual resources in a second language and then try to map the two languages using bilingual dictionaries.",
        "For example, Dagan and Itai (1994) carried out WSD experiments using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language.",
        "One problem of this method is that",
        "for many languages, accurate parsers do not exist.",
        "Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed to use monolingual corpora and bilingual dictionaries to automatically acquire sense examples.",
        "Their system was unsupervised and achieved very promising results on the Senseval-2 lexical sample dataset.",
        "Their system also has better portability, i.e., it runs on any language pair as long as a bilingual dictionary is available.",
        "However, sense examples acquired using the dictionary-based word-by-word translation can only provide “bag-of-words” features.",
        "Many other features useful for machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as the ordering of words, part-of-speech (POS), bigrams, etc., have been lost.",
        "It could be more interesting to translate Chinese text snippets using machine translation (MT) software, which would provide richer contextual information that might be useful for WSD learners.",
        "Although MT systems themselves are expensive to build, once they are available, they can be used repeatedly to automatically generate as much data as we want.",
        "This is an advantage over relying on other expensive resources such as manually sense-tagged data and parallel copora, which are limited in size and producing additional data normally involves further costly investments.",
        "We carried out experiments on acquiring sense examples using both MT software and a bilingual dictionary.",
        "When we had the two sets of sense examples ready, we trained a ML classifier on them and then tested them on coarse-grained and fine-grained gold standard WSD datasets, respectively.",
        "We found that on both test datasets the classifier using MT translated sense examples outperformed the one using those translated by a dictionary, given the same amount of training examples used on each word sense.",
        "This confirms our assumption that a richer feature set, although from a noisy data source, such as machine translated text, might help ML algorithms.",
        "In addition, both systems performed very well comparing to other state-of-the-art WSD systems.",
        "As we expected, our system is particularly good on coarse-grained disambiguation.",
        "Being an unsupervised approach, it achieved a performance competitive to state-of-the-art supervised systems.",
        "This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 revisits the process of acquiring sense examples proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005) and then describes our adapted approach.",
        "Section 3 outlines resources, the ML algorithm and evaluation metrics that we used.",
        "Section 4 and Section 5 detail experiments we carried out on gold standard datasets.",
        "We also report our results and error analysis.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and draws future directions.",
        "2 Acquisition of Sense Examples Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed an automatic approach to acquire sense examples from large amount of Chinese text and English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries.",
        "The acquisition process is summarised as follows: 1.",
        "Translate an English ambiguous word to Chinese, using an English-Chinese lexicon.",
        "Given the assumption that mappings between words and senses are different between English and Chinese, each sense of",
        "maps to a distinct Chinese word.",
        "At the end of this step, we have produced a set , which consists of Chinese words , where is the translation corresponding to sense of , and is the number of senses that has.",
        "2.",
        "Query large Chinese corpora or/and a search engine using each element in .",
        "For each in , we collect the text snippets retrieved and construct a Chinese corpus.",
        "3.",
        "Word-segment these Chinese text snippets.",
        "4.",
        "Use an electronic Chinese-English lexicon to translate the Chinese corpora constructed word by word to English.",
        "This process can be completely automatic and unsupervised.",
        "However, in order to compare the performance against other WSD systems, one needs to map senses in the bilingual dictionary to those used by gold standard datasets, which are often from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "This step is inevitable unless we use senses in the bilingual dictionary as gold standard.",
        "Fortunately, the mapping process only takes a very short time1, comparing to the effort that it would take to manually sense annotate training examples.",
        "At the end of the acquisition process, for each sense of an ambiguous word , we have a large set of English contexts.",
        "Note that a context is represented by a bag of words only.",
        "We mimicked this process and built a set of sense examples.",
        "To obtain a richer set of features, we adapted the above process and carried out another acquisition experiment.",
        "When translating Chinese text snippets to English in the 4th step, we used MT software instead of a bilingual dictionary.",
        "The intuition is that although machine translated text contains noise, features like word ordering, POS tags",
        "and bigrams/trigrams may still be of some use for ML classifiers.",
        "In this approach, the 3rd step can be omitted, since MT software should be able to take care of segmentation.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates our adapted acquisition process.",
        "As described above, we prepared two sets of training examples for each English word sense to disambiguate: one set was translated word-byword by looking up a bilingual dictionary, as proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005), and the other translated using MT software.",
        "In detail, we first mapped senses of ambiguous words, as defined in the gold-standard TWA (Mihalcea, 2003) and Senseval-3 lexical sample (Mihalcea et al., 2004) datasets (which we use for evaluation) onto their corresponding Chinese translations.",
        "We did this by looking up an English-Chinese dictionary Pow-erWord 20022.",
        "This mapping process involved human intervention, but it only took an annotator (fluent speaker in both Chinese and English) 4 hours.",
        "Since some Chinese translations are also ambiguous, which may affect WSD performance, the annotator was asked to select the Chinese words that are relatively unambiguous (or ideally monosemous) in Chinese for the target word senses, when it was possible.",
        "Sometimes multiple senses of an English word can map to the same Chinese word, according to the English-Chinese dictionary.",
        "In such cases, the annotator was advised to try to capture the subtle difference between these English word senses and then to 2PowerWord is a commercial electronic dictionary application.",
        "There is a free online version at: http://cb.kingsoft.com.",
        "select different Chinese translations for them, using his knowledge on the languages.",
        "Then, using the translations as queries, we retrieved as many text snippets as possible from the Chinese Giga-word Corpus.",
        "For efficiency purposes, we randomly chose maximumly text snippets for each sense, when acquiring data for nouns and adjectives from Senseval-3 lexical sample dataset.",
        "The length of the snippets was set to Chinese characters.",
        "From here we prepared two sets of sense examples differently.",
        "For the approach of dictionary-based translation, we segmented all text snippets, using the application ICTCLAS3.",
        "After the seg-mentor marked all word boundaries, the system automatically translated the text snippets word by word using the electronic LDC Mandarin-English Translation Lexicon 3.0.",
        "All possible translations of each word were included.",
        "As expected, the lexicon does not cover all Chinese words.",
        "We simply discarded those Chinese words that do not have an entry in this lexicon.",
        "We also discarded those Chinese words with multiword English translations.",
        "Finally we got a set of sense examples for each sense.",
        "Note that a sense example produced here is simply a bag of words without ordering.",
        "We prepared the other set of sense examples by translating text snippets with the MT software Sys-tran Standard, where each example contains much richer features that potentially can be exploited by ML algorithms."

        "In addition, evaluations show our unsupervised WSD system is competitive to the state-of-the-art supervised systems on binary disambiguation, and unsupervised systems on fine-grained disambiguation.",
        "In the future, we would like to combine our approach with other systems based on automatic acquisition of sense examples that can provide local context (Agirre and Martinez, 2004b).",
        "The goal would be to construct a collection of examples automatically obtained from different sources and to apply ML algorithms on them.",
        "Each example would have a different weight depending on the acquisition method used.",
        "Regarding the influence of sense distribution in the training data, we will explore the potential of using a weighting scheme on the “relative threshold” algorithm.",
        "Also, we would like to analyse if automatically obtained information on sense distribution (McCarthy et al., 2004) can improve WSD performance.",
        "We may also try other MT systems and possibly see if our WSD can in turn help MT, which can be viewed as a bootstrapping learning process.",
        "Another interesting direction is automatically selecting the most informative sense examples as training data for ML classifiers."
