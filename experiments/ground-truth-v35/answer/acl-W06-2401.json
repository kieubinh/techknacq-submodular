        "Person, location and organization names, main types of named entities (NEs), are expressions commonly used in all kinds of written texts.",
        "Recently, these expressions have become indispensable units of information for many applications in the area of information extraction as well as for many searching engines.",
        "A lot of tools that deal with the identification and classification of named entities for a specific language have been presented (CoNLLI).",
        "But there are few researches for translation of NEs.",
        "Our main goal is to get a multilingual NE database, which can be very useful for translation systems, multilingual information extraction tools (i.e.",
        "Question Answering) or many multilingual systems in general.",
        "As getting that multilingual source is a complex task, we have started designing a system for translating named entities from Basque to Spanish based on comparable corpora.",
        "Looking at the works published on NE translation, we can distinguish 3 types of systems: the systems more often used are the ones based on parallel corpora; then the ones based on comparable",
        "corpora; and finally the ones that only use the web as an open corpus.",
        "As we have mentioned before, most of the related works use parallel corpora.",
        "However and as it is widely known, obtaining parallel corpus is not an easy task, and it becomes harder when one of the languages in the pair is a minority language, as is the case of Basque.",
        "We can avoid working with parallel corpora using comparable corpora.",
        "Comparable corpora are those data sets which are written in different languages, treat similar subjects and are written in a similar style, but are not necessarily texts’ translations.",
        "Obtaining that kind of corpora is much easier than obtaining parallel one, although sometimes it is not possible to get neither of them.",
        "In this case, we can use the web as a multilingual corpus, in order to search it for any possible entity translation.",
        "We have a comparable data set available for Basque and Spanish.",
        "But besides using that data source, we decided also to resort to the web as a complementary data set too, as in (Moore, 2003).",
        "Apart from these two data sets, we have also used some other information sources to develop the Basque-Spanish bilingual NE translation system.",
        "We have carried out two main different experiments: one using a language-dependent grammar, implementing transliteration transformations (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002b) and rules related to elements’ order; and another one based on the edition distance (Kukich, 1992) grammar, simulating simple cognates and transliteration transformations, but in a language-independent way.",
        "In both experiments, we have used a Basque-Spanish bilingual dictionary for the words in which transliteration transformations were not enough to obtain the correct translated form.",
        "Furthermore, we have always worked using",
        "Basque as source language, and Spanish as target language.",
        "Since Basque and Spanish do not follow the same syntactic pattern, entity elements may occur in different positions in both languages.",
        "That is why the elements need to be arranged when translating Basque entities into Spanish.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the related works.",
        "Section 3 presents the experimental settings.",
        "In section 4 we describe the development of NE translation system explaining both possible systems, the language-dependent system and the language-independent one, and the system that combines both language-dependent and independent sources.",
        "In section 5, we present the results of the experiments, and finally, section 6 presents some conclusions and future works."

        "Despite the difficulty of getting bilingual parallel corpus, most of the NE translation researches carried out work with parallel datasets.",
        "Furthermore, those bilingual corpora are used to be aligned at paragraph or even at phrase level.",
        "For example, Moore’s work (Moore, 2003) uses a bilingual parallel aligned English-French corpora, and applying different statistical techniques, he obtains a French form for each English entity.",
        "Although it has been less experimented with comparable corpora there are some known systems designed to work with them as well.",
        "Most of them deal with language pairs that have different kinds of alphabets.",
        "For instance, the Chinese-English translation tool presented in ACL 2003 (Chen et al., 2003), or the one published in the ACL 2002 edition for translating entity names from Arabic to English (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002a).",
        "The main goal of both systems is to obtain the corresponding form for English, taking Chinese and Arabic respectively as source languages.",
        "Two kinds of translations can be distinguished in both systems: direct/simple translations and transliterations (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002b).",
        "However, the techniques used by each tool for both kinds of translations are different.",
        "Frequency based methods are used in Chinese-English translations, while in the Arabic-English language pair, a more complex process is applied, which involves the combination of different kinds of techniques.",
        "In this paper, we present the research carried out for translating entity names from Basque into Spanish.",
        "For the first step, we have based on the system presented by Y. Al Onaizan and K. Knight in ACL 2002.",
        "With this system, they first obtain a candidate translation list for the entity in the target language, using both monolingual and bilingual resources.",
        "Once they have this list, they build a ranking with candidates applying different methods (such as statistical measures, web-counting, etc.).",
        "Finally, if they consider that the correct translation does not appear in the list, they extract an extended list version using the web and they apply again the ranking step."

        "We have obtained a Basque-Spanish comparable corpora processing news from two newspapers, one for each language: Euskaldunon Egunkaria, the only newspaper written entirely in Basque for Basque texts, and EFE for Spanish texts.",
        "We have collected the articles written in the 2002 year in both newspapers and we have obtained 40,648 articles with 9,655,559 words for Basque and 16,914 with 5,192,567 words for Spanish.",
        "Both newspapers deal with similar topics: international news, sports, politics, economy, culture, local issues and opinion articles, but with different scope.",
        "In order to extract Basque NEs, we have used Eihera (Alegria et al., 2003), a Basque NE recognizer developed in the IXA Group.",
        "Giving a written text in Basque as input, this tool applies a grammar based on linguistic features in order to identify the entities in the text.",
        "For the classification of the identified expressions, we use a heuristic that combines both internal and external evidence.",
        "We labeled this corpus for the HERMES project2(news databases: cross-lingual information retrieval and semantic extraction).",
        "Thus, we obtained automatically 142,464 different person, location and organization names.",
        "Since we have participated at the HERMES project, we have available labeled corpora for the other languages processed by other participants.",
        "It was the TALP3 research group the one that was in charge of labeling EFE 2002 newspaper’s articles for the Spanish version, in which 106,473 different named entities were dealt with.",
        "We have built the comparable corpus using this dataset together with the Basque set mentioned above.",
        "Being Basque an agglutinative language, entity elements may contain more than just lexical information.",
        "So before doing any translation attempt a morphosyntactic analysis is required in order to obtain all the information from each element.",
        "Furthermore, Eihera works on a lemmatized text, so lematizing the input text is a strong requirement.",
        "For that purpose, we apply the lemmatizer/tagger for Basque (Alegria et al., 1998) developed by the IXA group.",
        "The goal of our system is to translate Basque person, location and organization names into Spanish entities.",
        "These two languages share a lot of cognates, that is, words that are similar in both languages and only have small, usually predictable spelling differences.",
        "Two experts have reviewed an extended list of word pairs4 extracted from EDBL (Basque Lexical Data-base) in order to detect these differences.",
        "All the observed variations have been listed in a spelling-rule list.",
        "These rules are in fact the ones that will be applied for the translation of some of the words, but obviously not for all.",
        "When translating Basque words into Spanish, usually the correct form is not obtained by applying the rules mentioned before, and a different strategy is required.",
        "For these words in particular, we have used bilingual dictionaries as in Al-Onaizan and Knight’s work.",
        "We have used the Elhuyar 2000 bilingual dictionary, one of the most popular for that language pair.",
        "This dictionary has 74,331 Basque entries, and it contains the corresponding Spanish synonyms.",
        "For the evaluation, we have used a set of 180 named entity-pairs.",
        "We have borrowed that set from the Euskaldunon Egunkaria 2002 newspaper.",
        "Concretely we applied Eihera, the Basque NE recognizer, to extract all the named entities in the corpus.",
        "Then we estimated the normalized frequency of each entity in the corpus, and we selected the most common ones.",
        "Finally we translated them manually into Spanish.",
        "In order to carry out an evaluation starting from correct Basque NEs, although the NEs were automatically extracted from the corpus, we verified that all the entities were correctly identified.",

        "These rules have been ordered in such a way that rules with possible interactions are firstly applied and then the rest of them.",
        "This way we have avoided interaction problems.",
        "For instance, lets say that we want to translate Kolonbia into Colombia and that our grammar has the following two simple transformation rules: nb – * mb and b – * v. If we apply the first rule and then the second one, the candidate we will obtain is Colomvia, and this is not the correct translation.",
        "However, if we do not allow to apply the second rule after the nb – * mb transformation, the grammar will propose the following candidates: Colon-via and Colombia.",

        "We can conclude from this fact that it is necessary to apply the rules in a given order.",

        "We have simply apply all possible rule combinations on every Basque word in the dictionary, and measured the normalized frequency of each rule and each rule pair.",
        "Thus, translation proposals are attached a probability based on the probability of a rule being applied, and only the most probable ones are proposed for the following steps.",
        "At this point, we have N translation candidates for each input entity element at the most, and they have been obtained applying the grammar or from the dictionary search.",
        "Our next goal is to create entire entity translation proposals combining all these candidates.",

        "The translation proposals from the previous modules for these two words are Naci´on (for Nazio) and Unida (for Batuak).",
        "If we do not consider that the corresponding Basque word of the Unida element is in the plural form, then the whole translation candidate will not be correct.",
        "In this case, we will need to pluralize the corresponding Spanish words.",
        "Unlike Spanish, Basque has no morphological gender.",
        "This means that for some Basque words the generation of both male and female form is required.",

        "This is because the dataset offered by Wikipedia is significantly smaller than the one given by Google.",
        "Moreover, precision remains similar.",
        "So although it is a smaller data-set, Wikipedia seems to be similar to Google as far as the information significance of terms is concerned.",
        "When we use the comparable corpus instead of the web, the linguistic tool performs a considerable enhancement in precision, a 13% improvement, but gets worse coverage.",
        "On the other hand, the language-independent tool achieves similar results with regard to the linguistic tool searching in the web.",
        "So the language-independent tool seems to be a good alternative for dealing with NE translation without no exhaustive linguistic work.",
        "Those results are detailed in Table 3.",
        "Finally, we have tried searching the proposals from the linguistic tool first in the comparable corpus.",
        "When no successful candidate is found in it, the system tries searching the web, in both Google and Wikipedia (See Table 4).",
        "In both experiments, precision is significantly lower than the one obtained when the system proposes candidates found in the comparable corpus, without no further search.",
        "However, the coverage increases in almost 5% in the trials carried out both with Google and Wikipedia.",
        "Therefore, the system’s F-score",
        "remains similar.",
        "Note that this time instead of performing better when Google is used, the searches done in Wikipedia give better results.",
        "Furthermore, the best results are obtained when combining comparable corpus and Wikipedia searches in the Linguistic tool."

        "We have presented an approach for the design and development of an entity translation system from Basque to Spanish and the different techniques and resources we have used for this work.",
        "On the one hand, we have combined bilingual dictionaries with a phonologic/spelling grammar for the entity elements’ translation; on the other hand, we have applied a language-independent grammar based on edition distance.",
        "Both combinations perform well, and although the linguistic tool obtains better results, the language-independent grammar may be very useful for other experiments carried out with language-pairs others than Basque and Spanish.",
        "Because of the differences of the syntactical structures of Basque and Spanish, it is necessary to arrange the entity elements for the correct translation of whole NEs; in particular, for those entities with more than one element.",
        "For that purpose, we have used two different techniques: probabilistic rules and a simple combination method (all candidates combined with all).",
        "Finally, we have applied different resources and techniques for the selection of the best candidates.",
        "On the one hand, we have tried searching the web (Google and Wikipedia); on the other hand, we have used a comparable Basque-Spanish corpus.",
        "We have verified, that although Google is a bigger data-set, the significance of the information for NE translation task is similar to the information given by Wikipedia.",
        "All the experiments carried out with comparable corpus have performed very well, and the best results have been obtained when combining it with Wikipedia.",
        "So developing a NE translation system based on comparable information have proved to be a good way to build a robust system.",
        "However, some modules can be improved.",
        "Firstly, the methods to rank and select candidates are very simple, so if we use more complex ones, the number of candidates for the following modules would decrease considerably, and so, the system’s final selection would be easier and more precise.",
        "Regarding to the use of the web, actually we have only used Google and Wikipedia.",
        "Searches in Wikipedia are more precise than the ones made in Google and so the information they offer can be considered complementary.",
        "Furthermore, we can obtain very valuable information for other entity processes.",
        "For instance, since Wikipedia is a topic-classified encyclopedia, when you do an entity search, you can get information about the kind of documents in which the entity can occur; in other words, which is the most usual topic for it to occur in.",
        "Besides, that classification category can be very useful for entity disambiguation too.",
        "With all the improvements presented so far, we hope to get a stronger entity name translation system in the future."
