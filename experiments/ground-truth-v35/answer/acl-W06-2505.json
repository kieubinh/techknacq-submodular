        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is concerned with the choice of the most appropriate sense of an ambiguous word given its context.",
        "The applications for which WSD has been thought to be helpful include Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, and Machine Translation (MT) (Ide and Verónis, 1998).",
        "The usefulness of WSD for MT, particularly, has been recently subject of debate, with conflicting results.",
        "Vickrey et al.",
        "(2005), e.g., show that the inclusion of a WSD module significantly improves the performance of their statistical MT system.",
        "Conversely, Carpuat and Wu (2005) found that WSD does not yield significantly better translation quality than a statistical MT system alone.",
        "In this latter work, however, the WSD module was not specifically designed for MT: it is based on the use of monolingual methods to identify the source language senses, which are then mapped into the target language translations.",
        "In fact, although it has been agreed that WSD is more useful when it is meant for a specific application (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), little has been done on the development of WSD modules specifically for particular applications.",
        "WSD models in general are application independent, and focus on monolingual contexts, particularly English.",
        "Approaches to WSD as an application-independent task usually apply standardised sense repositories, such as WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "For multilingual applications, a popular approach is to carry out monolingual WSD and then map the source language senses into the corresponding target word translations (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Montoyo et al., 2002).",
        "Although this strategy can yield reasonable results for certain pairs of languages, especially those which have a common sense repository, such as EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), mapping senses between languages is a very complex issue (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "We believe that WSD is an intermediate, application dependent task, and thus WSD modules for particular applications must be developed following the requirements of such applications.",
        "Many key factors of the process are application-dependent.",
        "The main factor is the sense inventory.",
        "As emphasized by Kilgarriff (1997), no sense inventory is suitable for all applications.",
        "Even for the same application there is often little consensus about the most appropriate sense inventory.",
        "For example, the use of WordNet, although very frequent, has been criticized due to characteristics such as the level sense granularity and the abstract criteria used for the sense distinctions in that resource (e.g., Palmer 1998).",
        "In particular, it is generally agreed that the granularity in WordNet is too refined for MT.",
        "In addition to requiring different sense inventories (Hutchins and Somers, 1992), the disambiguation process itself often can be varied according to the application.",
        "For instance, in monolingual WSD, the main information source is the context of the ambiguous word, that is, the surrounding words in a sentence or paragraph.",
        "For MT purposes, the context can be also that of the translation in the target language, i.e., words which have been already translated.",
        "In this paper we focus on the differences in the sense inventory, contrasting the WordNet inventory for English disambiguation, which was created according to psycholinguistics principles, with the Portuguese translations assigned to a set of eight verbs in a corpus, simulating MT as a Computational Linguistics application.",
        "We show that the relation between the number of senses and translations is not a one-to-one, and that it is not only a matter of the level of refinement of WordNet.",
        "The number of translations can be either smaller or larger, i.e., either two or more senses can be translated as the same word, or the same sense can be translated using different words.",
        "With that, we present evidence that employing a monolingual WSD method for the task of MT is not appropriate, since monolingual information offers little help to multilingual disambiguation.",
        "In other words, we argue that multilingual WSD is different from monolingual WSD, and thus requires specific strategies.",
        "We start by presenting approaches that show cognate results for different pairs of languages, and also approaches developed with the reverse goal of using multilingual information to help monolingual WSD (Section 2).",
        "We then present our experiments (Sections 3 and 4) and their results (Section 5)."

        "They argued that differences in both these aspects do not depend only on the sense of the verb.",
        "Out of the 14 senses analyzed, six had 2-5 different translations each.",
        "Bentivogli et al.",
        "(2004) proposed an approach to create an Italian sense tagged corpus (Mul-tiSemCor) based on the transference of the annotations from the English sense tagged corpus SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), by means of word-alignment methods.",
        "A gold standard corpus was created by manually transferring senses in SemCor to the Italian words in a translated version of that corpus.",
        "From a total of 1,054 English words, 155 annotations were considered non-transferable to their corresponding Italian words, mainly due to the lack of synonymy at the lexical level.",
        "Miháltz (2005) manually mapped senses from the English in a sense tagged corpus to Hungarian translations, in order to carry out WSD between these languages.",
        "Out of 43 ambiguous nouns, 38 had all or most of their English senses mapped into the same Hungarian translation.",
        "Some senses of the remaining nouns had to be split into different Hungarian translations.",
        "On average, the sense mapping decreased the ambiguity from 3.97 English senses to 2.49 Hungarian translations.",
        "As we intend to show with this work, differences like those mentioned above in the sense inventories make it inappropriate to use monolingual WSD strategies for multilingual disambiguation.",
        "Nevertheless, some approaches have successfully employed multilingual information, especially parallel corpora, to support monolingual WSD.",
        "They are motivated by the argument that the senses of a word should be determined based on the distinctions that are lexicalized in a second language (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997).",
        "In general, the assumptions behind these approaches are the following: (1) If a source language word is translated differently into a second language, it might be ambiguous and the different translations can indicate the senses in the source language.",
        "(2) If two distinct source language words are translated as the same word into a second language, it often indicates that the two are being used with similar senses.",
        "Ide (1999), for example, analyzes translations of English words into four different languages, in order to check if the different senses of an English word are lexicalized by different words in all the other languages.",
        "A parallel aligned corpus is used and the translated senses are mapped into WordNet senses.",
        "She uses this information to determine a set of monolingual sense distinctions that is potentially useful for NLP applications.",
        "In subsequent work (Ide et al., 2002), seven languages and clustering techniques are employed to create sense groups based on the translations.",
        "Diab and Resnik (2002) use multilingual information to create an English sense tagged corpus to train a monolingual WSD approach.",
        "An English sense inventory and a parallel corpus automatically produced by an MT system are employed.",
        "Sentence and word alignment systems are used to assign the word correspondences between the two languages.",
        "After grouping all the words that correspond to translations of a single word in the target language, all their possible senses are considered as candidates.",
        "The sense that maximizes the semantic similarity of the word with the others in the group is chosen.",
        "Similarly, Ng et al.",
        "(2003) employ English-Chinese parallel word aligned corpora to identify a repository of senses for English.",
        "The English word senses are manually defined, based on the WordNet senses, and then revised in the light of the Chinese translations.",
        "For example, if two occurrences of a word with two different senses in WordNet are translated into the same Chinese word, they will be considered to have the same English sense.",
        "In general, these approaches rely on the two previously mentioned assumptions about the interaction between translations and word senses.",
        "Although these assumptions can be useful when using cross-language information as an approximation to monolingual disambiguation, they are not very helpful in the opposite direction, i.e., using monolingual information for cross-language disambiguation, as we will show in Section 4."

        "In order to avoid biasing the experiment due to possible misunderstandings of the verb uses, and to make the experiment feasible, with a reasonable number of occurrences to be analyzed, we selected a subset of the total number of sentences in Table 1, which were distributed among five professional English-Portuguese translators (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5), according to the following criteria: - The meaning of the verb/phrasal verb in the context of the sentence should be understandable and non-ambiguous (for human translators).",

        "- The translators should not be given any information other than the sentence to select the translation.",
        "To meet these criteria, a professional translator, who was not involved in the translation task, post-processed the selected sentences, filtering them according to the criteria specified above.",
        "Due to both the scarce number of occurrences of each phrasal verb sense and the large number of different phrasal verbs for certain verbs, the post-selection of phrasal verbs was different from the post-selection of verbs.",

        "When there were fewer than 10 occurrences of a given sense, sentences were repeated among translators to guarantee that each translator would be given examples of all the senses of the verb.",
        "For instance, if a sense had only four occurrences, the first two occurrences were given to T1, T3 and T5, while the other two occurrences were given to T2 and T4.",
        "If a sense occurred only once for a verb, it was repeated for all five translators.",

        "This shows that indeed many of the possible translations are synonyms.",
        "On average, the level of ambiguity decreased from 40.3 (possible senses) to 24.4 (possible translations), if the monolingual and multilingual ambiguity are compared in the corpus.",
        "If we consider the five most ambiguous verbs, the level of ambiguity decreased from 58.8 to 35.",
        "For the other three less ambiguous verbs, the level of ambiguity decreased from 9.3 to 6.7.",

        "That would only indicate that using monolingual WSD for multilingual purposes implies unnecessary work.",
        "However, we consider that the most important problem is the one evidenced by item (b) in the sixth column in Table 4.",
        "For all the verbs except “to ask” (the least ambiguous), there were cases in which different occurrences of the same sense were translated into different, non-synonyms words.",
        "Although the proportion of senses with only one translation is greater, as shown by item (a) in the fifth column, the percentage of senses with more than one translation is impressive, especially for the five most ambiguous verbs.",
        "In face of this, the lack of disambiguation of a word during translation based on the fact that the word is not ambiguous in the source language can result in very serious translation errors when monolingual methods are employed for multilingual WSD.",

        "In most of the cases, many different senses were translated into the same Portuguese word.",
        "In many other cases, different, non-synonymous, words were necessary to translate occurrences of the same sense of the source language, showing that differences between monolingual and multilingual WSD are not only a matter of the highly refined sense distinction criterion adopted in WordNet.",
        "Therefore, these results reinforce our argument that applying monolingual methods for multilingual WSD can either imply unnecessary work, or result in disambiguation errors.",
        "As future work we plan to carry out further investigation of the differences between monolingual and multilingual WSD contrasting the English senses and translations into other languages, and analyzing other grammatical categories, particularly nouns."
