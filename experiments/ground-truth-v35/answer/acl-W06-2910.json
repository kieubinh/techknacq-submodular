        "There are a variety of manual semantic verb classifications; major frameworks are the Levin classes (Levin, 1993), WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and FrameNet (Fontenelle, 2003).",
        "The different frameworks depend on different instantiations of semantic similarity, e.g. Levin relies on verb similarity referring to syntax-semantic alternation behaviour, WordNet uses synonymy, and FrameNet relies on situation-based agreement as defined in Fillmore’s frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982).",
        "As an alternative to the resource-intensive manual classifications, automatic methods such as classification and clustering are applied to induce verb classes from corpus data, e.g. (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003; Korhonen et al., 2003; Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003; Fer-rer, 2004).",
        "Depending on the types of verb classes to be induced, the automatic approaches vary their choice of verbs and classification/clustering algorithm.",
        "However, another central parameter for the automatic induction of semantic verb classes is the selection of verb features.",
        "Since the target classification determines the similarity and dissimilarity of the verbs, the verb feature selection should model the similarity of interest.",
        "For example, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) classify 60 English verbs which alternate between an intransitive and a transitive usage, and assign them to three verb classes, according to the semantic role assignment in the frames; their verb features are chosen such that they model the syntactic frame alternation proportions and also heuristics for semantic role assignment.",
        "In larger-scale classifications such as (Korhonen et al., 2003; Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003), which model verb classes with similarity at the syntax-semantics interface, it is not clear which features are the most salient.",
        "The verb features need to relate to a behavioural component (modelling the syntax-semantics interplay), but the set of features which potentially influence the behaviour is large, ranging from structural syntactic descriptions and argument role fillers to adverbial adjuncts.",
        "In addition, it is not clear how fine-grained the features should be; for example, how much information is covered by low-level window co-occurrence vs. higher-order syntactic frame fillers?",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether human associations to verbs can help us to identify salient verb features for semantic verb classes.",
        "We collected associations to German verbs in a web experiment, and hope that these associations represent a useful basis for a theory-independent semantic classification of the German verbs, assuming that the associations model a non-restricted set of salient verb meaning aspects.",
        "In a preparatory step, we perform an unsupervised clustering on the experiment verbs, as based on the verb associations.",
        "We validate the resulting verb classes (henceforth: assoc-classes) by demonstrating that they show considerable overlap with standard approaches to semantic verb classes, i.e. GermaNet and FrameNet.",
        "In the main body of this work, we compare the associations underlying the assoc-classes with standard corpus-based feature types: We check on how many of the associations we find among the corpus-based features, such as adverbs, direct object nouns, etc.",
        "; we hypothesise that the more associations are found as instantiations in a feature set, the better is a clustering as based on that feature type.",
        "We assess our hypothesis by applying various corpus-based feature types to the experiment verbs, and comparing the resulting classes (henceforth: corpus-classes) against the assoc-classes.",
        "On the basis of the comparison we intend to answer the question whether the human associations help identify salient features to induce semantic verb classes, i.e. do the corpus-based feature types which are identified on the basis of the associations outperform previous clustering results?",
        "By applying the feature choices to GermaNet and FrameNet, we address the question whether the same types offeatures are salient for different types of semantic verb classes?",
        "In what follows, the paper presents the association data in Section 2 and the association-based classes in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we compare the associations with corpus-based feature types, and in Section 5 we apply the insights to induce semantic verb classes."

        "As similarity measure in the clustering procedure (i.e. to determine the distance/similarity for two verbs), we used the skew divergence, a smoothed variant of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Lee, 2001).",
        "The goal of these experiments was not to explore the optimal feature combination; thus, we rely on previous experiments and parameter settings, cf. Schulte im Walde (2003).",
        "Our claim is that the hierarchical verb classes and their underlying features (i.e. the verb associations) represent a useful basis for a theory-independent semantic classification of the German verbs.",
        "To support this claim, we validated the assoc-classes against standard approaches to semantic verb classes, i.e. GermaNet as the German WordNet (Kunze, 2000), and the German counterpart of FrameNet in the Salsa project (Erk et al., 2003).",
        "Details of the validation can be found in (Schulte im Walde, 2006); the main issues are as follows.",
        "We did not directly compare the assoc-classes against the GermaNet/FrameNet classes, since not all of our 330 experiments verbs were covered by the two resources.",
        "Instead, we replicated the above cluster experiment for a reduced number of verbs: We extracted those classes from the resources which contain association verbs; light verbs, non-association verbs, other classes as well as singletons were disregarded.",
        "This left us with 33 classes from GermaNet, and 38 classes from FrameNet.",
        "These remaining classifications are polysemous: The 33 GermaNet classes contain 71 verb senses which distribute over 56 verbs, and the 38 FrameNet classes contain 145 verb senses which distribute over 91 verbs.",
        "Based on the 56/91 verbs in the two gold standard resources, we performed two cluster analyses, one for the GermaNet verbs, and one for the FrameNet verbs.",
        "As for the complete set of experiments verbs, we performed a hierarchical clustering on the respective subsets of the experiment verbs, with their associations as verb features.",
        "The actual validation procedure then used the reduced classifications: The resulting analyses were evaluated against the resource classes on each level in the hierarchies, i.e. from 56/91 classes to 1 class.",
        "As evaluation measure, we used a pairwise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic f-score as follows: Each verb pair in the cluster analysis was compared to the verb pairs in the gold standard classes, and evaluated as true or false positive (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993).",
        "The association-based clusters show overlap with the lexical resource classes of an f-score of 62.69% (for 32 verb classes) when comparing to GermaNet, and 34.68% (for 10 verb classes) when comparing to FrameNet.",
        "The corresponding upper bounds are 82.35% for GermaNet and 60.31% for FrameNet.'",
        "The comparison therefore demonstrates considerable overlap between association-based classes and existing semantic classes.",
        "The different results for the two resources are due to their semantic background (i.e. capturing synonymy vs. situation-based agreement), the numbers of verbs, and the degrees of ambiguity (an average of 1.6 senses per verb in FrameNet, as compared to 1.3 senses in GermaNet).",
        "The purpose of the validation against semantic resources was to demonstrate that a clustering as based on the verb associations and a standard clustering setting compares well with existing semantic classes.",
        "We take the positive validation results as justification to use the assoc-classes as source for cluster information: The clustering defines the verbs in a common association-based class, and the features which are relevant for the respective class.",
        "For example, the 100-class analysis contains a class with the verbs bedauern ‘regret’, heulen ‘cry’, jammern ‘moan’, klagen ‘complain, moan, sue’, verzweifeln ‘become desperate’, and weinen ‘cry’, with the most distinctive features Trauer ‘mourning’, weinen ‘cry’, traurig ‘sad’, Tr¨anen ‘tears’, jammern ‘moan’, Angst ‘fear’, Mitleid ‘pity’, Schmerz ‘pain’."

        "There are various possibilities to determine corpus-based features that potentially cover the associations; we decided in favour of feature types which have been suggested in related work: a) Grammar-based relations: Previous work on distributional similarity has focused either on a specific word-word relation (such as Pereira et al.",
        "(1993) and Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) referring to a direct object noun for describing verbs), or used any syntactic relationship detected by a chunker or a parser (such as Lin (1998) and McCarthy et al.",
        "(2003)).",
        "We used a statistical grammar (Schulte im Walde, 2003) to filter all verb-noun pairs where the nouns represent nominal heads in NPs or PPs in syntactic relation to the verb (subject, object, adverbial function, etc.",
        "), and to filter all verb-adverb pairs where the adverbs modify the verbs.",
        "b) Co-occurrence window: In previous work (Schulte im Walde and Melinger, 2005), we showed that only 28% of all noun associates were identified by the above statistical grammar as subcategorised nouns, but 69% were captured by a 20-word co-occurrence window in a 200-million word newspaper corpus.",
        "This finding suggests to use a co-occurrence window as alternative source for verb features, as compared to specific syntactic relations.",
        "We therefore determined the co-occurring words for all experiment verbs in a 20-word window (i.e. 20 words preceding and following the verb), irrespective of the part-of-speech of the co-occurring words.",
        "Relying on the verb information extracted for a) and b), we checked for each verb-association pair whether it occurred among the grammar or window pairs.",

        "For the windows, all checks on co-occurrence of verbs and associations in the whole 200-million word corpus.",

        "Using the cut-offs, we can distinguish the relevance of high and low-frequency features.",
        "Finally, ADJ, ADV, N, V perform co-occurrence checks for the whole corpus, but breaks down the all results with respect to the association part-of-speech.",
        "As one would have expected, most of the associations (66%) were found in the 20-word co-occurrence window, because the window is neither restricted to a certain part-of-speech, nor to a certain grammar relation; in addition, the window is potentially larger than a sentence.",
        "Applying the frequency cut-offs reduces the overlap of association types and co-occurring words to 58%.",
        "Specifying the window results for the part-of-speech types illustrates that the nouns play the most important role in describing verb meaning (39% of the verb association types in the assoc-classes were found among the nouns in the corpus windows, 16% among the verbs, 9% among the adjectives, and 2% among the adverbs).3 The proportions of the nouns with a specific grammar relationship to the verbs show that we find more associations among direct objects than intransitive/transitive subjects.",
