        "As pointed out by several authors (Kato et al., 2004), (Chai and Ron, 2004), the information needs of users interacting with QA systems often go beyond a single standalone question.",
        "Often users want to research about a particular topic or event or solve a specific task.",
        "In such interactions we can expect that the individual user questions will be thematically connected, giving the users the possibility of reusing part of the context when formulating new questions.",
        "That users implicitly refer to and even omit material which can be recovered from the context has already been replicated in several Wizard-of-Oz experiments simulating natural language interfaces to databases, (Carbonell, 1983), (Dahlb¨ack and J¨onsson, 1989), the most frequent contextual phenomena being ellipsis, anaphora and definite descriptions.",
        "A big challenge for interactive QA systems is, thus, the resolution of contextual phenomena.",
        "In order to be able to do so a system has to keep track of the user’s focus of attention as the interaction proceeds.",
        "The attentional state at a given point in the interaction is given by the discourse structure.",
        "An open issue, however, is the nature of the discourse structure model needed in a QA system.",
        "Ahrenberg et al.",
        "(1990) argue that the discourse structure in NL interfaces is, given the limited set of actions to be performed by the system and the user, simpler than the one underlying human-human dialogue.",
        "Upon Ahrenberg et al.",
        "(1990) this is given by the discourse goals, rather than the overall goals of the user, as is the case in task-oriented dialogues, (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986).",
        "Following Ahrenberg et al.",
        "(1990), the QA discourse is structured in segments composed by a pair of initiative-response units, like question-answer, or question-assertion, in the absence of an answer.",
        "A segment can be embedded in another segment if it is composed by a clarification request and its corresponding answer.",
        "The local context of a segment is given by the immediately preceding segment.",
        "Upon Ahrenberg et al.",
        "(1990), the latter reliably limits up the search space for antecedents of anaphoric devices and ellipsis.",
        "However, as we will see, there are few cases where the antecedents of contextual phenomena are to be found beyond the immediately preceding segments.",
        "This suggests that a more complex approach to discourse structure for QA systems is needed.",
        "In more recent studies of interactive QA special attention has been paid to the thematic relatedness of questions, (Chai and Ron, 2004), (Kato et al., 2004).",
        "Chai and Ron (2004) propose a discourse modeling for QA interactions in which they keep track of thematic transitions between questions.",
        "Although",
        "the applications of tracking thematic transitions between questions have not been investigated in depth, Sun and Chai (2006) report on an experiment which shows that the use of a model of topic transitions based on Centering Theory improves query expansion for context questions.",
        "However, these previous studies on the thematic relations between questions are not based on collections of interactive data, but on questions centered around a topic that were collected in non-interactive environments.",
        "This means that they do not consider the answers to the questions, to which following questions can be related.",
        "This paper presents data on different kinds of contextual phenomena found in a corpus of written natural language QA exchanges between human users and a human agent representing an interactive information service.",
        "We address two issues: the kinds and frequencies of thematic relations holding between the user questions and the preceding context, on the one hand, and the location of antecedents for the different contextual phenomena, on the other.",
        "We also discuss the question whether thematic relations can contribute to determine discourse structure and, thus, to the resolution of the contextual phenomena.",
        "In the next section we present our data collection and the aspects of the annotation scheme which are relevant to the current work.",
        "In section 3 we present data regarding the overall thematic cohesion of the QA sessions.",
        "In section 4 we report on data regarding the co-occurrence of discourse phenomena and thematic relations and the distance between the phenomena and their antecedents.",
        "Finally, we discuss our findings with regard to their relevance with respect to the nature of discourse structure."

        "We chose an ontology database instead of a text based closed domain QA system, however, because in order to simulate a real system short time responses were needed.",
        "30 subjects took part in the experiment, which consisted in solving a task by querying LT-WORLD, an ontology containing information about language technology1, in English.",
        "The modality of interaction was typing through a chat-like interface.",
        "Three different tasks were designed: two of them concentrated on information browsing, the other one on information gathering.",
        "In the first task subjects had to find three traineeships at three different projects in three different institutions each on a different topic, and obtain some information about the chosen projects, like a contact address, a description, etc.",
        "In the second task, subjects had to find three conferences in the winter term and three conferences in the summer term, each one on a different topic and they had to obtain some information on the chosen conferences such as deadline, place, date.",
        "etc.",
        "Finally, the third task consisted of finding information for writing a report on European language technology in the last ten years.",
        "To this end, subjects had to obtain quantitative information on patents, organizations, conferences, etc.",
        "The Wizard was limited to very few types of responses.",
        "The main response was answering a question.",
        "In addition, she would provide intermediate information about the state of processing if the retrieval took too long.",
        "She could also make statements about the contents of the database when it did not contain the information asked for or when the user appeared confused about the structure of the domain.",
        "Finally, she could ask for clarification or more specificity when the question could not be understood.",
        "Yet the Wizard was not allowed to take the initiative by offering information that was not explicitely asked for.",
        "Thus all actions of the Wizard were directly dependent on those of the user.",
        "As a result we obtained a corpus of 33 logs (30 plus 3 pilot experiments) containing 125.534 words in 2.534 turns, 1.174 of which are user turns."

        "As we have seen, the immediately preceding segment is in most cases the upper limit of the search space for the last reference to the entity, or the elided material in fragments.",
        "The directions of the search for antecedents, however, can vary depending on the phenomena, since for more implicit referring expressions antecedents are usually to be found in the same segment, while for less implicit referring expressions they are to be found in the preceding one.",
        "These data are in accordance with what Ahrenberg et al.",
        "(1990) predict in their model.",
        "Just to consider the immediately preceding segment as the upper limit of the search space for antecedents is enough and, thus, no tracking of thematic relations is needed to resolve discourse phenomena.",
        "However, there are occurrences of more explicit types of co-reference expressions, where the antecedent is beyond the immediately preceding segment.",
        "As we have observed, in these cases the intervening segment/s shift the focus of attention to an entity (maybe provided in some previous answer) closely related to the one in focus of attention in the preceding segment.",
        "It seems that as long as this relation exists, even if there are many segments in between8, the first entity remains in focus of attention and can be referred to by an implicit deictic or definite NP without any additional retrieval cue.",
        "We can speak of thematic nesting of segments, which seems to be analogous to the intentional structure in task-oriented dialogues as in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), also allowing for reference with implicit devices to entities in the superordinate segments after the subordinated ones have been closed.",
        "It seems, thus, that thematic structure, like the discourse goals, also imposes structure on the discourse.",
        "These cases, although not numerous, suggest that a more complex discourse structure is needed for QA interactions than one simply based on the discourse goals.",
        "The local context is given by the discourse segments, which are determined by the discourse goals, but a less local context may encompass several segments.",
        "As we have seen, reference with implicit devices to entities in the less local context is still possible.",
        "What seems to determine this less local context is a unique theme, about which all the segments encompassed by the context directly or indirectly are.",
        "So, although it does not seem necessary to track all the thematic transitions between the segments, it seems necessary to categorize the segments as being about a particular more global theme.",
        "In a system like the one we simulated, having specific tasks in mind and querying structured data, a possible approach to model this extended context, or focus of attention, would be in terms of frames.",
        "Every time a new entity is addressed a new frame is activated.",
        "The frame encompasses the entity itself and the properties holding of it and other entities, as well as those entities.",
        "This would already allow us to successfully resolve bridging and fragments with a partial source.",
        "If the focus of atten",
        "tion then shifts to one of the related entities, the user demanding particular information about it, then its frame is activated, but the previous frame also remains somehow active, although to a lesser degree.",
        "As long as there is a connection between the entities being talked about and a frame is not explicitly closed, by switching to speak about a different entity of the same class, for example, frames remain somehow active and implicit references will be accommodated within the activation scope.",
        "In principle, the closer the relation to the entity currently in focus, the higher the degree of activation of the related entities.",
        "Yet, there may be cases of ambiguity, where only inferences about the goals of the user may help to resolve the reference, as in (13): (13) US: How is the contact for that project?",
        "LT: daelem@uia.ua.ac.be US: What is the institute?",
        "LT: Centrum voor Nederlandse Taal en Spraak.",
        "US: Homepage?",
        "Here the property ”Homepage” could be asked about the institution or the project, the institution being more active.",
        "However, the Wizard interpreted it as referring to the project without hesitation because she knew that subjects were interested in projects, not in organizations.",
        "In order to resolve the ambiguity, we would need a system customized for tasks or make inferences about the goals of the users based on the kind of information they’ve been asking for.",
        "Determining at which level of nesting some expression has to be interpreted may involve plan recognition.",
        "However, for open domain systems not having a knowledge-base with structured data it may be much more difficult to keep track of the focus of attention beyond the strictly local context.",
        "For other kinds of interactions which don’t have such a structured nature as our tasks, this may also be the case.",
        "For example, in the information browsing tasks in (Kato et al., 2004), there is not a global topic encompassing the whole interaction, but the information needs of the user are given by the information he is encountering as the interaction proceeds, that is, he is browsing the information in a free way, without having particular goals or particular pieces of information he wants to obtain in mind.",
        "In such cases it may be difficult to determine how long frames are active if the nesting goes very far, as well as making any inferences about the user’s plans.",
        "However, it might also be the case, that in that kind of interactions no implicit referring expressions are used beyond the segmental level, because there is no such an extended context.",
        "In order to find out, a study with interactive data should be carried out."
