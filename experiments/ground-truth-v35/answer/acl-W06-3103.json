        "Arabic is a highly inflected language compared to English which has very little morphology.",
        "This morphological richness makes statistical machine translation from Arabic to English a challenging task.",
        "A usual phenomenon in Arabic is the attachment of a group of words which are semantically dependent on each other.",
        "For instance, prepositions like “and” and “then” are usually attached to the next word.",
        "This applies also to the definite article “the”.",
        "In addition, personal pronouns are attached to the end of verbs, whereas possessive pronouns are attached to the end of the previous word, which constitutes the possessed object.",
        "Hence, an Arabic word can be decomposed into “prefixes, stem and suffixes”.",
        "We restrict the set of prefixes and suffixes to those showed in Table 1 and 2, where each of the prefixes and suffixes has at least one meaning which can be represented by a single word in the target language.",
        "Some prefixes can be combined.",
        "For example the word wbAlqlm ( PL9 which means “and with the pen”) has a prefiix) which is a combination of three prefixes, namely w, b and Al.",
        "The suffixes we handle in this paper can not be combined with each other.",
        "Thus, the compound word pattern handled here is “prefixes-stem-suffix“.",
        "All possible prefix combinations that do not contain Al allow the stem to have a suffix.",
        "Note that there are other suffixes that are not handled here, such as At (ul), An (0l) and wn (09) which make the plural form of a word.",
        "The reason why we omit them is that they do not have their own meaning.",
        "The impact of Arabic morphology is that the vocabulary size and the number of singletons can be dramatically high, i.e. the Arabic words are not seen often enough to be learned by statistical machine translation models.",
        "This can lead to an inefficient alignment.",
        "In order to deal with this problem and to improve the performance of statistical machine translation, each word must be decomposed into its parts.",
        "In (Larkey et al., 2002) it was already shown that word segmentation for Arabic improves information retrieval.",
        "In (Lee et al., 2003) a statistical approach for Arabic word segmentation was presented.",
        "It decomposes each word into a sequence of morphemes (prefixes-stem-suffixes), where all possible prefixes and suffixes (not only those we described in Table 1 and 2) are split from the original word.",
        "A comparable work was done by (Diab et al., 2004), where a POS tagging method for Arabic is also discussed.",
        "As we have access to this tool, we test its impact on the performance of our translation system.",
        "In",
        "(Habash and Rambow, 2005) a morphology analyzer was used for the segementation and POS tagging.",
        "In contrast to the methods mentioned above, our segmentation method is unsupervised and rule based.",
        "In this paper we first explain our statistical machine translation (SMT) system used for testing the impact of the different segmentation methods, then we introduce some preprocessing and normalization tools for Arabic and explain the linguistic motivation beyond them.",
        "Afterwards, we present three word segmentation methods, a supervised learning approach, a finite state automaton-based segmentation, and a frequency-based method.",
        "In Section 5, the experimental results are presented.",
        "Finally, the paper is summarized in Section 6."
