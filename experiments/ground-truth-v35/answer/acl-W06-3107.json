        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with alignments.",

        "As there is no efficient exact method to compute the optimal alignment (known as Viterbi alignment) in most of the cases (specifically in the IBM models 3,4 and 5), in this work we propose the use of a recently appeared meta-heuristic family of algorithms, Estimation ofDistribution Algorithms (EDAs).",

        "This approach can be stated as: a source language string f = fJ1 = f1 ... fJ is to be translated into a target language string e = eI1 = e1 ... eI.",
        "Every target string is regarded as a possible translation for the source language string with maximum a-posteriori probability Pr(elf).",
        "According to Bayes’ decision rule, we have to choose the target string that maximizes the product of both the target language model Pr (e) and the string translation model Pr(f le).",
        "Alignment models to structure the translation model are introduced in (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These alignment models are similar to the concept of Hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.",
        "The alignment mapping is j – * i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj .",
        "In statistical alignment models, Pr(f, ale), the alignment a is usually introduced as a hidden variable.",

        "The probability Pr(f, ale) can be estimated by using the word-based IBM statistical alignment models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These models, however, constrain the set of possible alignments so that each word in the source sentence can be aligned at most to one word in the target sentence.",
        "Of course, “real” alignments, in most of the cases, do not follow this limitation.",
        "Hence, the alignments obtained from the IBM models have to be extended in some way to achieve more realistic alignments.",
        "This is usually performed by computing the alignments in both directions (i.e, first from f to e and then from e to f) and then combining them in a suitable way (this process is known as symmetrization)."

        "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) (Larra˜naga and Lozano, 2001) are metaheuristics which has gained interest during the last five years due to their high performance when solving combinatorial optimization problems.",
        "EDAs, as well as genetics algorithms (Michalewicz, 1996), are population-based evolutionary algorithms but, instead of using genetic operators are based on the estimation/learning and posterior sampling of a probability distribution, which relates the variables or genes forming and individual or chromosome.",
        "In this way the dependence/independence relations between these variables can be explicitly modelled in the EDAs framework.",
        "The operation mode of a canonical EDA is shown in Figure 1.",
        "As we can see, the algorithm maintains a population of m individuals during the search.",
        "An individual is a candidate or potential solution to the problem being optimized, e.g., in the problem considered here an individual would be a possible alignment.",
        "Usually, in combinatorial optimization problems an individual is represented as a vector of integers a = (a1,... , aJ), where each position aj can",
        "take a set of finite values Q,,,, = 10, ... , I}.",
        "The first step in an evolutionary algorithm is to generate the initial population D0.",
        "Although D0 is usually generated randomly (to ensure diversity), prior knowledge can be of utility in this step.",
        "Once we have a population our next step is to evaluate it, that is, we have to measure the goodness or fitness of each individual with respect to the problem we are solving.",
        "Thus, we use a fitness function f (a) = Pr(f, ale) (see Eq.",
        "(3)) to score individuals.",
        "Evolutionary algorithms in general and EDAs in particular seek to improve the quality of the individuals in the population during the search.",
        "In genetic algorithms the main idea is to build a new population from the current one by copying some individuals and constructing new ones from those contained in the current population.",
        "Of course, as we aim to improve the quality of the population with respect to fitness, the best/fittest individuals have more chance to be copied or selected for recombination.",
        "In EDAs, the transition between populations is quite different.",
        "The basic idea is to summarize the properties of the individuals in the population by learning a probability distribution that describes them as much as possible.",
        "Since the quality of the population should be improved in each step, only the s fittest individuals are selected to be included in the dataset used to learn the probability distribution Pr (a1, ... , ai), in this way we try to discover the common regularities among good individuals.",
        "The next step is to obtain a set of new individuals by sampling the learnt distribution.",
        "These individuals are scored by using the fitness function and added to the ones forming the current population.",
        "Finally, the new population is formed by selecting n individuals from the 2n contained in the current one.",
        "A common practice is to use some kind of fitness-based elitism during this selection, in order to guarantee that the best(s) individual(s) is/are retained.",
        "The main problem in the previous description is related to the estimation/learning of the probability distribution, since estimating the joint distribution is intractable in most cases.",
        "In the practice, what is learnt is a probabilistic model that consists in a factorization of the joint distribution.",
        "Different levels of complexity can be considered in that factorization, from univariate distributions to n-variate ones or Bayesian networks (see (Larra˜naga and Lozano, 2001, Chapter 3) for a review).",
        "In this paper, as this is the first approximation to the alignment problem with EDAs and, because of some questions that will be discussed later, we use the simplest EDA model: the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm or UMDA (Muhlenbein, 1997).",
        "In UMDA it is assumed that all the variables are marginally independent, thus, the n-dimensional probability distribution, Pr(a1, ... , ai), is factorized as the product of J marginal/unidimensional distributions: 11ij� 1 Pr(aj).",
        "Among the advantages of UMDA we can cite the following: no structural learning is needed; parameter learning is fast; small dataset can be used because only marginal probabilities have to be estimated; and, the sampling process is easy because each variable is independently sampled."
