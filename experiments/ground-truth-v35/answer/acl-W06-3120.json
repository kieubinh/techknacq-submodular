        "Nowadays most Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems use phrases as translation units.",

        "Each feature function models the probability that a sentence e in the target language is a translation of a given sentence f in the source language.",
        "The weights, AZ, of each feature function are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function.",
        "It has the advantage that additional features functions can be easily integrated in the overall system.",
        "This paper describes a Phrase-Based system whose baseline is similar to the system in Costa-juss`a and Fonollosa (2005).",
        "Here we introduce two reordering approaches and add morphological information.",
        "Translation results for all six translation directions proposed in the shared task are presented and discussed.",
        "More specifically, four different languages are considered: English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr) and German (de); and both translation directions are considered for the pairs: EnEs, EnFr, and EnDe.",

        "Given a bilingual corpus, we use GIZA++ (Och, 2003) as word alignment core algorithm.",
        "During word alignment, we use 50 classes per language estimated by ’mkcls’, a freely-available tool along with GIZA++.",
        "Before aligning we work with lowercase text (which leads to an Alignment Error Rate reduction) and we recover truecase after the alignment is done.",
        "In addition, the alignment (in specific pairs of languages) was improved using two strategies: Full verb forms The morphology of the verbs usually differs in each language.",
        "Therefore, it is interesting to classify the verbs in order to address the rich variety of verbal forms.",
        "Each verb is reduced into its base form and reduced POS tag as explained in (de Gispert, 2005).",
        "This transformation is only done for the alignment, and its goal is to simplify the work of the word alignment improving its quality.",
        "Block reordering (br) The difference in word order between two languages is one of the most significant sources of error in SMT.",
        "Related works either deal with reordering in general as (Kanthak et al., 2005) or deal with local reordering as (Till-mann and Ney, 2003).",
        "We report a local reordering technique, which is implemented as a preprocessing stage, with two applications: (1) to improve only alignment quality, and (2) to improve alignment quality and to infer reordering in translation.",
        "Here, we present a short explanation of the algorithm, for further details see Costa -juss`a and Fonollosa (2006).",
        "This reordering strategy is intended to infer the most probable reordering for sequences of words, which are referred to as blocks, in order to mono-tonize current data alignments and generalize reordering for unseen pairs of blocks.",
        "Given a word alignment, we identify those pairs of consecutive source blocks whose translation is swapped, i.e. those blocks which, if swapped, generate a correct monotone translation.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of these pairs (hereinafter called Alignment Blocks).",
        "Then, the list of Alignment Blocks (LAB) is processed in order to decide whether two consecutive blocks have to be reordered or not.",
        "By using the classification algorithm, see the Appendix, we divide the LAB in groups (G, n = 1... N).",
        "Inside the same group, we allow new internal combination in order to generalize the reordering to unseen pairs of blocks (i.e. new Alignment Blocks are created).",
        "Based on this information, the source side of the bilingual corpora are reordered.",
        "In case of applying the reordering technique for purpose (1), we modify only the source training corpora to realign and then we recover the original order of the training corpora.",
