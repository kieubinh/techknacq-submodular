      "text": [
        "The fields of computational phonology and morphology were among the earlier fields in computational linguistics to adopt machine learning algorithms as a means to automatically construct processing systems from data.",
        "For instance, letter-phoneme conversion was already pioneered, with neural networks initially, at the end of the 1980s (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987), and was shortly after also investigated with memory-based learning and analogical approaches (Weijters, 1991; Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Yvon, 1996) and decision trees (Torkkola, 1993; Dietterich et al., 1995).",
        "The development of these data-driven systems was thrusted by the early existence of lexical databases, originally compiled to serve (psycho)linguistic research purposes, such as the CELEX lexical database for Dutch, English, and German (Baayen et al., 1993).",
        "Many researchers have continued and are still continuing this line of work, generally producing successful systems with satisfactory, though still imperfect performance.",
        "A key characteristic of many of these early systems is that they perform decomposed or simplified versions of the full task.",
        "Rather than predicting the full phonemization of a word given its orthography in one go, the task is decomposed in predicting individual phonemes or subsequences of phonemes.",
        "Analogously, rather than generating a full word-form, many morphological generation systems produce transformation codes (e.g., “add er and umlaut”) that need to be applied to the input string by a post-processing automaton.",
        "These task simplifications are deliberately chosen to avoid sparseness problems to the machine learning systems.",
        "Such systems tend to perform badly when there are many low-frequent and too case-specific classes; task decomposition allows them to be robust and generic when they process unseen words.",
        "This task decomposition strategy has a severe drawback in sequence processing tasks.",
        "Decomposed systems do not have any global method to check whether their local decisions form a globally",
        "coherent output.",
        "If a letter-phoneme conversion system predicts schwas on every vowel in a polysyllabic word such as parameter because it is uncertain about the ambiguous mapping of each of the as and es, it produces a bad pronunciation.",
        "Likewise, if a morphological analysis system segments a word such as being as a prefix followed by an inflection, making the locally most likely guesses, it generates an analysis that could never exist, since it lacks a stem.",
        "Global models that coordinate, mediate, or enforce that the output is a valid sequence are typically formulated in the form of linguistic rules, applied during processing or in post-processing, that constrain the space of possible output sequences.",
        "Some present-day research in machine learning of morpho-phonology indeed focuses on satisfying linguistically-motivated constraints as a post-processing or filtering step; e.g., see (Daya et al., 2004) on identifying roots in Hebrew word forms.",
        "Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 2004) can also be seen as a constraint-based approach to language processing based on linguistically motivated constraints.",
        "In contrast to being motivated by linguistic theory, constraints in a global model can be learned automatically from data as well.",
        "In this paper we propose such a data-driven constraint satisfaction inference method, that finds a globally appropriate output sequence on the basis of a space of possible sequences generated by a locally-operating classifier predicting output subsequences.",
        "We show that the method significantly improves on the basic method of predicting single output tokens at a time, on English and Dutch letter-phoneme conversion and morphological analysis.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "The constraint satisfaction inference method is outlined in Section 2.",
        "We describe the four morpho-phonological processing tasks, and the lexical data from which we extracted examples for these tasks, in Section 3.",
        "We subsequently list the outcomes of the experiments in Section 4, and conclude with a discussion of our findings in Section 5."

        "Both the letter-phoneme conversion and the morphological analysis tasks treated in this paper can be seen as sequentially-structured classification tasks, where sequences of letters are mapped to sequences of phonemes or morphemes.",
        "Such sequence-to-sequence mappings are a frequently reoccurring phenomenon in natural language processing, which suggests that it is preferable to take care of the issue of classifying sequential data once at the machine learning level, rather than repeatedly and in different ways at the level of practical applications.",
        "Recently, a machine learning approach for sequential data has been proposed by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) that is suited for discrete machine-learning algorithms such as memory-based learners, which have been shown to perform well on word phonemization and morphological analysis before (Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999).",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we use as our classifier of choice the IB 1 algorithm (Aha et al., 1991) with feature weighting, as implemented in the TiMBL software package1 (Daelemans et al., 2004).",
        "In the approach to sequence processing proposed by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005), the elements of the input sequence (in the remainder of this paper, we will refer to words and letters rather than the more general terms sequences and sequence elements) are assigned overlapping subsequences of output symbols.",
        "This subsequence corresponds to the output symbols for a focus letter, and one letter to its left and one letter to its right.",
        "Predicting such trigram subsequences for each letter of a word eventually results in three output symbol predictions for each letter.",
        "In many cases, those three predictions will not agree, resulting in a number of potential output sequences.",
        "We will refer to the procedure for selecting the final output sequence from the space of alternatives spanned by the predicted trigrams as an inference procedure, analogously to the use of this term in probabilistic sequence classification methods (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001).",
        "The original work on predicting class trigrams implemented a simple inference procedure by voting over the three predicted symbols (Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 2005).",
        "Predicting trigrams of overlapping output symbols has been shown to be an effective approach",
        "to improve sequence-oriented natural language processing tasks such as syntactic chunking and named-entity recognition, where an input sequence of tokens is mapped to an output sequence of symbols encoding a syntactic or semantic segmentation of the sentence.",
        "Letter-phoneme conversion and morphological analysis, though sequentially structured on another linguistic level, may be susceptible to benefiting from this approach as well.",
        "In addition to the practical improvement shown to be obtained with the class trigram method, there is also a more theoretical attractiveness to it.",
        "Since the overlapping trigrams that are predicted are just atomic symbols to the underlying learning algorithm, a classifier will only predict output symbol trigrams that are actually present in the data it was trained on.",
        "Consequently, predicted trigrams are guaranteed to be syntactically valid subsequences in the target task.",
        "There is no such guarantee in approaches to sequence classification where an isolated local classifier predicts single output symbols at a time, without taking into account predictions made elsewhere in the word.",
        "While the original voting-based inference procedure proposed by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) manages to exploit the sequential information stored in the predicted trigrams to improve upon the performance of approaches that do not consider the sequential structure of their output at all, it does so only partly.",
        "Essentially, the voting-based inference procedure just splits the overlapping trigrams into their unigram components, thereby retaining only the overlapping symbols for each individual letter.",
        "As a result, the guaranteed validity of the trigram subsequences is not put to use.",
        "In this section we describe an alternative inference procedure, based on principles of constraint satisfaction, that does manage to use the sequential information provided by the trigram predictions.",
        "At the foundation of this constraint-satisfaction-based inference procedure, more briefly constraint satisfaction inference, is the assumption that the output symbol sequence should preferably be constructed by concatenating the predicted trigrams of output symbols, rather than by chaining individual symbols.",
        "However, as the underlying base classifier is by no means perfect, predicted trigrams should not be copied blindly to the output sequence; they may be incorrect.",
        "If a trigram prediction is considered to be of insufficient quality, the procedure backs off to symbol bigrams or even symbol unigrams.",
        "The intuitive description of the inference procedure is formalized by expressing it as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem (W-CSP).",
        "Constraint satisfaction is a well-studied research area with many diverse areas of application.",
        "Weighted constraint satisfaction extends the traditional constraint satisfaction framework with soft constraints; such constraints are not required to be satisfied for a solution to be valid, but constraints a given solution does satisfy are rewarded according to weights assigned to them.",
        "Soft constraints are perfect for expressing our preference for symbol trigrams, with the possibility of a back off to lower-degree n-grams if there is reason to doubt the quality of the trigram predictions.",
        "Formally, a W-CSP is a tuple (X, D, C, W).",
        "Here, X = {x1, x2, ... , xnI is a finite set of variables.",
        "D(x) is a function that maps each variable to its domain, that is, the set of values that variable can take on.",
        "C is the set of constraints.",
        "While a variable’s domain dictates the values a single variable is allowed to take on, a constraint specifies which simultaneous value combinations over a number of variables are allowed.",
        "For a traditional (non-weighted) constraint satisfaction problem, a valid solution would be an assignment of values to the variables that (1) are a member of the corresponding variable’s domain, and (2) satisfy all constraints in the set C. Weighted constraint satisfaction, however, relaxes this requirement to satisfy all constraints.",
        "Instead, constraints are assigned weights that may be interpreted as reflecting the importance of satisfying that constraint.",
        "Let a constraint c E C be defined as a function that maps each variable assignment to 1 if the constraint is satisfied, or to 0 if it is not.",
        "In addition, let W: C – * IR+ denote a function that maps each constraint to a positive real value, reflecting the weight of that constraint.",
        "Then, the optimal solution to a W-CSP is given by the following equation.",
        "That is, the assignment of values to its variables that maximizes the sum of weights of the constraints that have been satisfied.",
        "Translating the terminology used in morpho-phonological tasks to the constraint satisfaction domain, each letter maps to a variable, the domain of which corresponds to the three overlapping candidate symbols for this letter suggested by the trigrams covering the letter.",
        "This provides us with a definition of the function D, mapping variables to their domain.",
        "In the following, yij denotes the candidate symbol for letter xj predicted by the trigram assigned to letter xi.",
        "Constraints are extracted from the predicted trigrams.",
        "Given the goal of retaining predicted trigrams in the output symbol sequence as much as possible, the most important constraints are simply the trigrams themselves.",
        "A predicted trigram describes a subsequence of length three of the entire output sequence; by turning such a trigram into a constraint, we express the wish to have this trigram end up in the final output sequence.",
        "No base classifier is flawless though, and therefore not all predicted trigrams can be expected to be correct.",
        "Yet, even an incorrect trigram may carry some useful information regarding the output sequence: one trigram also covers two bigrams, and three unigrams.",
        "An incorrect trigram may still contain smaller subsequences of length one or two that are correct.",
        "Therefore, all of these are also mapped to constraints.",
        "To illustrate the above procedure, Figure 1 shows the constraints yielded by a given output sequence of class trigrams for the word “hand”.",
        "With such an amount of overlapping constraints, the satisfaction problem obtained easily becomes over-constrained, that is, no variable assignment exists that can satisfy all constraints without breaking another.",
        "Even only one incorrectly predicted class trigram already leads to two conflicting candidate symbols for one of the letters at least.",
        "In Figure 1, this is the case for the letter “d”, for which both the symbol “d” and “t” are predicted.",
        "On the other hand, without conflicting candidate symbols, no inference would be needed to start with.",
        "The choice for the weighted constraint satisfaction method always allows a solution to be found, even in the presence of conflicting constraints.",
        "Rather than requiring all constraints to be satisfied, each constraint is assigned a certain weight; the optimal solution to the problem is an assignment of values to the variables that optimizes the",
        "sum of weights of the constraints that are satisfied.",
        "As weighted constraints are defined over overlapping subsequences of the output sequence, the best symbol assignment for each letter with respect to the weights of satisfied constraints is decided upon on a global sequence level.",
        "This may imply taking into account symbol assignments for surrounding letters to select the best output symbol for a certain letter.",
        "In contrast, in non-global approaches, ignorant of any sequential context, only the local classifier prediction with highest confidence is considered for selecting a letter’s output symbol.",
        "By formulating our inference procedure as a constraint satisfaction problem, global output optimization comes for free: in constraint satisfaction, the aim is also to find a globally optimal assignment of variables taking into account all constraints defined over them.",
        "Yet, for such a constraint satisfaction formulation to be effective, good constraint weights should be chosen, that is, weights that favor good output sequences over bad ones.",
        "Constraints can directly be traced back to a prediction made by the base classifier.",
        "If two constraints are in conflict, the one which the classifier was most certain of should preferably be satisfied.",
        "In the W-CSP framework, this preference can be expressed by weighting constraints according to the classifier confidence for the originating trigram.",
        "For the memory-based learner, we define the classifier confidence for a predicted class as the weight assigned to that class in the neighborhood of the test instance, divided by the total weight of all classes.",
        "Let x denote a test instance, and c* its predicted class.",
        "Constraints derived from this class are weighted according to the following rules:",
        "• for a trigram constraint, the weight is simply the base classifier’s confidence value for the class c*; • for a bigram constraint, the weight is the sum of the confidences for all trigram classes in the nearest-neighbor set of x that assign the same symbol bigram to the letters spanned by the constraint; • for a unigram constraint, the weight is the sum",
        "of the confidences for all trigram classes in the nearest-neighbor set of x that assign the same symbol to the letter spanned by the constraint.",
        "This weighting scheme results in an inference procedure that behaves exactly as we already described intuitively in the beginning of this section.",
        "The preference for retaining the predicted trigrams in the output sequence is translated into high rewards for output sequences that do so, since such output sequences not only receive credit for the satisfied trigram constraints, but also for all the bigram and unigram constraints derived from that trigram; they are necessarily satisfied as well.",
        "Nonetheless, this preference for trigrams may be abandoned if composing a certain part of the output sequence from several symbol bigrams or even unigrams results in higher rewards than when trigrams are used.",
        "The latter may happen in cases where the base classifier is not confident about its trigram predictions."

        "We have presented constraint satisfaction inference as a global method to repair errors made by a local classifier.",
        "This classifier is a memory-based learner predicting overlapping trigrams, creating a space of possible output sequences in which the inference procedure finds the globally optimal one.",
        "This globally optimal sequence is the one that adheres best to the trigram, bigram, and unigram subsequence constraints present in the predictions of the local classifier, weighted by the confidences of the classifier, in a back-off order from trigrams to unigrams.",
        "The method is shown to significantly outperform a memory-based classifier predicting atomic classes and lacking any global post-processing, which has previously been shown to exhibit successful performance (Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999).",
        "(While this was the reason for using memory-based learning, we note that the constraint satisfaction inference and its underlying trigram-based classification method can be applied to any machine-learning classifier.)",
        "The large improvements (27% and 26% error reductions on the two English tasks, 18% and 22% on the two Dutch tasks) can arguably be taken as an indication that this method may be quite effective in general in morpho-phonological sequence processing tasks.",
        "Apparently, the constraint-satisfaction method is able to avoid more errors than to add them.",
        "At closer inspection, comparing cases in which the atomic classifier generates errors and constraint satisfaction inference does not, we find that the type of avoided error, when compared to the unigram classifier, differs per task.",
        "On the morphological analysis task, we identify repairs where (1) a correct segmentation is inserted, (2) a false segmentation is not placed, and (3) a tag is switched.",
        "As Table 6 shows in its upper four lines, in the case of English most repairs involve correctly inserted segmentations, but the other two categories are also quite frequent.",
        "In the case of Dutch the most common repair is a switch from an incorrect tag, placed at the right segmentation position, to the correct tag at that point.",
        "Given that there are over three thousand possible tags in our complicated Dutch morphological analysis task, this is indeed a likely area where there is room for improvement.",
        "cations (top) and letter-phoneme conversions (bottom) of the constraint satisfaction inference method as compared to the unigram classifier.",
        "The bottom four lines of Table 6 lists the counts of repaired errors in word phonemization in both languages, where we distinguish between (1) alignment repairs between phonemes and alignment symbols (where phonemes are corrected to phonemic nulls, or vice versa), (2) switches from incorrect non-null phonemes to correct vowels, and (3) switches from incorrect non-null phonemes to correct consonants.",
        "Contrary to expectation, it is not the second vowel category in which most repairs are made (many of the vowel errors in fact remain in the output), but the alignment category, in both languages.",
        "At points where the local unigram classifier sometimes incorrectly predicts a phoneme twice, where it should have predicted it along with a phonemic null, the constraint satisfaction inference method never generates a double phoneme.",
        "Hence, the method succeeds in generating sequences that are possible, and avoiding impossible sub-sequences.",
        "At the same time, a possible sequence is not necessarily the correct sequence, so this method can be expected to still make errors on the identity of labels in the output sequence.",
        "In future work we plan to test a range of n-gram widths exceeding the current trigrams.",
        "Preliminary results suggest that the method retains a positive effect over the baseline with n > 3, but it does not outperform the n = 3 case.",
        "We also intend to test the method with a range of different machine learning methods, since as we noted before the constraint-satisfaction inference method and its underlying n-gram output subsequence classification method can",
        "be applied to any machine learning classification algorithm in principle, as is already supported by preliminary work in this direction.",
        "Also, we plan comparisons to the work of Stroppa and Yvon (2005) and Damper and East-mond (1997) on sequence-global analogy-based models for morpho-phonological processing, since the main difference between this related work and ours is that both alternatives are based on working units of variable width, rather than our fixed-width n-grams, and also their analogical reasoning is based on interestingly different principles than our k-nearest neighbor classification rule, such as the use of analogical proportions by Stroppa and Yvon (2005)."
