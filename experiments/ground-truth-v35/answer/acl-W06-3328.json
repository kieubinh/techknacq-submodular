        "The existence of such resources in combination with the need to perform information extraction efficiently in order to promote research in this domain, make it a very interesting field to develop and evaluate information extraction approaches.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the most important tasks in information extraction.",
        "It has been studied extensively in various domains, including the newswire (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) domain and more recently the biomedical domain (Blaschke et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004).",
        "These shared tasks aimed at evaluating fully supervised trainable systems.",
        "However, the limited availability of annotated material in most domains, including the biomedical, restricts the application of such methods.",
        "In order to circumvent this obstacle several approaches have been presented, among them active learning (Shen et al., 2004) and rule-based systems encoding domain specific knowledge (Gaizauskas et al., 2003).",
        "In this work we build on the idea of bootstrapping, which has been applied by Collins & Singer (1999) in the newsire domain and by Morgan et al.",
        "(2004) in the biomedical domain.",
        "This approach is based on creating training material automatically using existing domain resources, which in turn is used to train a supervised named entity recognizer.",

        "The inter-annotator agreement achieved was 87% F-score between the two annotators, which according to the authors reflects the difficulty of the task.",
        "Vlachos et al. (2006) evaluated their system on both versions of this test set and obtained significantly different results.",
        "The disagreements between the two versions were attributed to difficulties in applying the guidelines used for the annotation.",
        "Therefore, they produced a version of this dataset resolving the differences between these two versions using revised guidelines, partially based on those developed for ACE (2004).",
        "In this work, we applied these guidelines to construct a new test set, which resulted in their refinement and clarification.",
        "The basic idea is that gene names (<gn>) are annotated in any position they are encountered in the text, including cases where they are not referring to the actual gene but they are used to refer to a different entity.",
        "Names of gene families, reporter genes and genes not belonging to Drosophila are tagged as gene names too:",

        "In addition, following the ACE guidelines, for each gene name we annotate the shortest surrounding noun phrase.",
        "These noun phrases are classified further into gene mentions (<gm>) and other mentions (<om>), depending on whether the mentions refer to an actual gene or not respectively.",
        "Most of the times, this distinction can be performed by looking at the head noun of the noun phrase:",
        "• <gm>the <gn>faf</gn> gene</gm> • <om>the <gn>Reaper</gn> protein</om>",
        "However, in many cases the noun phrase itself is not sufficient to classify the mention, especially when the mention consists of just the gene name, because it is quite common in the biomedical literature to use a gene name to refer to a protein or to other gene products.",
        "In order to classify such cases, the annotators need to take into account the context in which the mention appears.",
        "In the following examples, the word of the context that enables us to make",
        "the distinction between gene mentions (<gm>) and other mentions is underlined:",

        "(2004) had been stripped from all punctuation characters, e.g. periods and commas.",
        "Keeping the text intact renders this new dataset more realistic and most importantly it allows the use of tools that rely on this information, such as syntactic parsers.",
        "The annotation of gene names was performed by a computational linguist and a FlyBase curator.",
        "We estimated the inter-annotator agreement in two ways.",
        "First, we calculated the F-score achieved between them, which was 91%.",
        "Secondly, we used the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996), which has become the standard evaluation metric and the score obtained was 0.905.",
        "This high agreement score can be attributed to the clarification of what gene name should capture through the introduction of gene mention and other mention.",
        "It must be mentioned that in the experiments that follow in the rest of the paper, only the gene names were used to evaluate the performance of bootstrapping.",
        "The identification and the classification of mentions is the subject of ongoing research.",
        "The annotation of mentions presented greater difficulty, because computational linguists do not have sufficient knowledge of biology in order to use the context of the mentions whilst biologists are not trained to identify noun phrases in text.",

        "Apart from the domain shift, the deterioration of the performance could also be attributed to the different guidelines used.",
        "However, given that the tasks are roughly the same, it is a very important result that manually annotated training material leads to so poor performance, compared to the performance achieved using automatically created training data.",
        "This evidence suggests that manually created resources, which are expensive, might not be useful even in slightly different tasks than those they were initially designed for.",

        "The standard evaluation metric used for NER is the F-score (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), which is the harmonic average of Recall and Precision.",
        "It is very successful and popular, because it penalizes systems that underperform in any of these two aspects.",
        "Also, it takes into consideration the existence multi-token entities by rewarding systems able to identify the entity boundaries correctly and penalizing them for partial matches.",
        "In this section we suggest an extension to this evaluation, which we believe is meaningful and informative for trainable NER systems.",
        "Two are the main expectations from trainable systems.",
        "The first one is that they will be able to identify entities that they have encountered during their training.",
        "This is not as easy as it might seem, because in many domains token(s) representing entity names of a certain type can appear as common words or representing an entity name of a different type.",
        "Using examples from the biomedical domain, “to” can be a gene name but it is also used as a preposition.",
        "Also gene names are commonly used as protein names, rendering the task of distinguishing between the two types non-trivial, even if examples of those names exist in the training data.",
        "The second expectation is that trainable systems should be able to learn from the training data patterns that will allow it to generalize to unseen named entities.",
        "Important role in this aspect of the performance play the features that are dependent on the context and on observations on the tokens.",
        "The ability to generalize to unseen named entities is very significant because it is unlikely that training material can cover all possible names and moreover, in most domains, new names appear regularly.",
        "A common way to assess these two aspects is to measure the performance on seen and unseen data separately.",
        "It is straightforward to apply this in tasks with token-based evaluation, such as part-of-speech tagging (Curran and Clark, 2003).",
        "However, in the case of NER, this is not entirely appropriate due to the existence of multi-token entities.",
        "For example, consider the case of the gene-name “head inhibition defective”, which consists of three common words that are very likely to occur independently of each other in a training set.",
        "If this gene name appears in the test set but not in the training set, with a token-based evaluation its identification (or not) would count towards the performance on seen tokens if the tokens appeared independently.",
        "Moreover, a system would be rewarded or penalized for each of the tokens.",
        "One approach to circumvent these problems and evaluate the performance of a system on unseen named entities, is to replace all the named entities of the test set with strings that do not appear in the training data, as in Morgan et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "There are two problems with this evaluation.",
        "Firstly, it alters the morphology of the unseen named entities, which is usually a source of good features to recognize them.",
        "Secondly, it affects the contexts in which the unseen named entities occur, which don’t have to be the same as that of seen named entities.",
        "In order to overcome these problems, we used the following method.",
        "We partitioned the correct answers and the recall errors according to whether the named entity at question have been encountered in the training data as a named entity at least once.",
        "The precision errors are partitioned in seen and unseen depending on whether the string that was incorrectly annotated as a named entity by the system has been encountered in the training data as a named entity at least once.",
        "Following the standard F-score definition, partially recognized named entities count as both precision and recall errors.",
        "In examples from the biomedical domain, if “to” has been encountered at least once as a gene name in the data but an occurrence of in the test dataset is erroneously tagged as a gene name, this will count as a precision error on seen named entities.",
        "Similarly, if “to” has never been encountered in the training data as a gene name but an occurrence of it in the test dataset is erroneously tagged as a common word, this will count as a recall error on unseen named entities.",
        "In a multi-token example, if “head inhibition defective” is a gene name in the test dataset and it has been seen as such in the training data but the NER system tagged (erroneously) “head inhibition” as a gene name (which is not the training data), then this would result in a recall error on seen named entities and a precision error on unseen named entities."
