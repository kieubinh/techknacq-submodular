        "Using this tool, one can also isolate more complex networks of information: individuals who may have discussed the same topics but never talked to each other.",

        "However, these tools do not transfer well to data sources that are more conversational in nature, such as multi-party meetings, telephone conversations, email, chat rooms, etc.",
        "Given the plethora of these data sources, there is a need to be able to quickly and accurately extract and process pertinent information from these sources without having to cull them manually.",
        "Much of the work on computational analysis of dialogue has focused on automatic topic segmentation of conversational data, and in particular, using features of the discourse to aid in segmentation (Galley et al., 2003; Stolcke et al., 1999; Hirschberg & Hakatani, 1996.).",
        "Detailed discourse and conversational analytics have been the focus of much linguistic research and have been used by the computational community for creating models of dialogue to aid in natural language understanding and generation (Allen & Core, 1997; Carletta et al., 1997; van Deemter et al., 2005; Walker et al., 1996).",
        "However, there has been much less focus on computational tools that can aid in either the analysis of conversations themselves, or in rendering conversational data in ways such that it can be used with traditional data mining techniques that have been successful for document understanding.",
        "This current work is most similar to the NITE XML Toolkit (Carletta & Kilgour, 2005) which was designed for annotating conversational data.",
        "NITE XML is system in which transcripts of conversations are viewable and time aligned with their audio transcripts.",
        "It is especially useful for adding annotations to multi-modal data formats.",
        "NITE XML is not analysis tool, however.",
        "Annotations are generally manually added.",
        "In this paper, we present a Conversational Analysis Tool (ChAT) which integrates several language processing tools (topic segmentation, affect scoring, named entity extraction) that can be used to automatically annotate conversational data.",
        "The processing components have been specially adapted to deal with conversational data.",

        "Topic segmentation is then performed on the utterances to chunk them into topically cohesive units.",
        "Traditionally, algorithms for segmentation have relied on textual cues (Hearst, 1997; Miller et al.",
        "1998; Beeferman et al., 1999; Choi, 2000).",
        "These techniques have proved useful in segmenting single authored documents that are rich in content and where there is a great deal of topic continuity.",
        "Topic segmentation of conversational data is much more difficult due to often sparse content, intertwined topics, and lack of topic continuity.",
        "Topic segmentation algorithms generally rely on a lexical cohesion signal that requires smoothing in order to eliminate noise from changes of word choices in adjoining statements that do not indicate topic shifts (Hearst, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "Many state of the art techniques use a sliding window for smoothing (Hearst, 1997; Miller et al.",
        "1998; Galley et al., 2003).",
        "We employ a windowless method (WLM) for calculating a suitable cohesion signal which does not rely on a sliding window to achieve the requisite smoothing for an effective segmentation.",
        "Instead, WLM employs a constrained minimal-spanning tree (MST) algorithm to find and join pairs of elements in a sequence.",
        "In most applications, the nearest-neighbor search used by an MST involves an exhaustive, O(N2), search throughout all pairs of elements.",
        "However since WLM only requires information on the distance between adjoining elements in the sequence the search space for finding the two closest adjoining elements is linear, O(N), where N is the number of elements in the sequence.",
        "We can therefore take advantage of the hierarchical summary structure that an MST algorithm affords while not incurring the performance penalty.",
        "Of particular interest for our research was the success of WLM on threaded dialogue.",
        "We evaluated WLM’s performance on the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) by comparing our segmentation results to the results obtained by implementing LCSeg (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "Using the 25 hand segmented meetings, our algorithm achieved a significantly better segmentation for 20 out of 25 documents.",
        "Figure 2 shows the hypothesized segments from the two algorithms on the ICSI Meeting Corpus.",
        "Topic segmentation of conversational data can be aided by employing features of the discourse or speech environment, such as acoustic cues, etc.",
        "(Stolcke et al., 1999; Galley et al., 2003).",
        "In this work, we have avoided using data dependent (the",
        "integration of acoustic cues for speech transcripts, for example) features to aid in segmentation because we wanted our system to be as versatile as possible.",
