        "He was a grammarian who analysed Sanskrit (Misra, 1966).",
        "The idea resurfaced forcefully at several points in the more recent history of linguistic research (Tesni�ere, 1959; Gruber, 1965; Fillmore, 1968).",

        "Graph-like structures are a natural way of organising one’s impressions of a text seen from the perspective of connections between its simpler constituents of varying granularity, from sections through paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, words to morphemes.",
        "In this work we pursue a well-known and often tacitly assumed line of thinking: connections at the syntactic level reflect connections at the semantic level (in other words, syntax carries meaning).",
        "Anecdotal support for this stance comes from the fact that the grammatical notion of case is the basis for semantic relations (Misra, 1966; Gruber, 1965; Fillmore, 1968).",
        "Tesni�ere (1959), who proposes a grouping of verb arguments into actants and circumstances, gives a set of rules to connect specific types of actants – for example, agent or instrument – to such grammatical elements as subject, direct object, indirect object.",
        "This idea was expanded to include nouns and their modifiers through verb nominaliza-tions (Chomsky, 1970; Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "We work with sentences, clauses, phrases and words, using syntactic structures generated by a parser.",
        "Our system incrementally processes a text, and extracts pairs of text units: two clauses, a verb and each of its arguments, a noun and each of its modifiers.",
        "For each pair of units, the system builds a syntactic graph surrounding the main element (main clause, head verb, head noun).",
