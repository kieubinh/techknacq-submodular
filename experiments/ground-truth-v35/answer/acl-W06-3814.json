        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling technology.",
        "Supervised WSD techniques are the best performing in public evaluations, but need large amounts of hand-tagging data.",
        "Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).",
        "In theory, larger amounts of training data (SemCor has approx.",
        "500M words) would improve the performance of supervised WSD, but no current project exists to provide such an expensive resource.",
        "Supervised WSD is based on the “fixed-list of senses” paradigm, where the senses for a target word are a closed list coming from a dictionary or lexicon.",
        "Lexicographers and semanticists have long warned about the problems of such an approach, where senses are listed separately as discrete entities, and have argued in favor of more complex representations, where, for instance, senses are dense regions in a continuum (Cruse, 2000).",
        "Unsupervised WSD has followed this line of thinking, and tries to induce word senses directly from the corpus.",
        "Typical unsupervised WSD systems involve clustering techniques, which group together similar examples.",
        "Given a set of induced clusters (which represent word uses or senses1), each new occurrence of the target word will be compared to the clusters and the most similar cluster will be selected as its sense.",
        "Most of the unsupervised WSD work has been based on the vector space model (Sch¨utze, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), where each example is represented by a vector of features (e.g. the words occurring in the context).",
        "Recently, V´eronis (V´eronis, 2004) has",
        "proposed HyperLex, an application of graph models to WSD based on the small-world properties of cooccurrence graphs.",
        "Hand inspection of the clusters (called hubs in this setting) by the author was very positive, with hubs capturing the main senses of the words.",
        "Besides, hand inspection of the disambiguated occurrences yielded precisions over 95% (compared to a most frequent baseline of 73%) which is an outstanding figure for WSD systems.",
        "We noticed that HyperLex had some free parameters and had not been evaluated against a public gold standard.",
        "Besides, we were struck by the few works where supervised and unsupervised systems were evaluated on the same test data.",
        "In this paper we use an automatic method to map the induced senses to WordNet using hand-tagged corpora, enabling the automatic evaluation against available gold standards (Senseval 3 English Lexical Sample S3LS (Mihalcea et al., 2004)) and the automatic optimization of the free parameters of the method.",
        "The use of hand-tagged corpora for tagging makes this algorithm a mixture of unsupervised and supervised: the method to induce senses in completely unsupervised, but the mapping is supervised (albeit very straightforward).",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first present the graph-based algorithm as proposed by V´eronis, reviewing briefly the features of small-world graphs.",

        "Section 5 shows the experiment setting and results.",

        "The centers or prototypes of these components, called hubs, eventually identify the main word uses (senses) of the target word.",
        "We will briefly introduce the algorithm here, check (V´eronis, 2004) for further details.",
        "For each word to be disambiguated, a text corpus is collected, consisting of the paragraphs where the word occurs.",
        "From this corpus, a cooccurrence graph for the target word is built.",

        "Words which always occur together receive a weight of 0.",
        "Words rarely cooccurring receive weights close to 1.",
        "Once the cooccurrence graph is built, a simple iterative algorithm is executed to obtain its hubs.",
        "At each step, the algorithm finds the vertex with highest relative frequency5 in the graph, and, if it meets some criteria, it is selected as a hub.",

        "After a vertex is selected to be a hub, its neighbors are no longer eligible as hub candidates.",
        "At any time, if the next vertex candidate has a relative frequency below a certain threshold, the algorithm stops.",
        "Once the hubs are selected, each of them is linked to the target word with edges weighting 0, and the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the whole graph is calculated and stored.",
        "The MST is then used to perform word sense disambiguation, in the following way.",
        "For every instance of the target word, the words surrounding it are examined and confronted with the MST.",

        "If the scores are organized in a score vector, all values are 0, except, say, the i-th component, which receives a score d(hi7 v), which is the distance between the hub hi and the node representing the word v. Thus, d(hi7 v) assigns a score of 1 to hubs and the score decreases as the nodes move away from the hub in the tree.",

        "One alternative, as in (V´eronis, 2004), is to manually decide the correctness of the hubs assigned to each occurrence of the words.",
        "This approach has two main disadvantages.",
        "First, it is expensive to manually verify each occurrence of the word, and different runs of the algorithm need to be evaluated in turn.",
        "Second, it is not an easy task to manually decide if an occurrence of a word effectively corresponds with the use of the word the assigned hub refers to, especially considering that the person is given a short list of words linked to the hub.",
        "We also think that instead of judging whether the hub returned by the algorithm is correct, the person should have independently tagged the occurrence with hubs, which should have been then compared to the hub returned by the system.",
        "A second alternative is to evaluate the system according to some performance in an application, e.g. information retrieval (Sch¨utze, 1998).",
        "This is a very attractive idea, but requires expensive system development and it is sometimes difficult to separate the reasons for the good (or bad) performance.",
        "A third alternative would be to devise a method to map the hubs (clusters) returned by the system to the senses in a lexicon.",
        "Pantel and Lin (2002) automatically map the senses to WordNet, and then measure the quality of the mapping.",
        "More recently, the mapping has been used to test the system on publicly available benchmarks (Purandare and Ped",
        "ersen, 2004; Niu et al., 2005).",
        "See Section 6 for more details on these systems.",
        "Yet another possibility is to evaluate the induced senses against a gold standard as a clustering task.",
        "Induced senses are clusters, gold standard senses are classes, and measures from the clustering literature like entropy or purity can be used.",
        "As we wanted to focus on the comparison against a standard data-set, we decided to leave aside this otherwise interesting option.",
        "In this section we present a framework for automatically evaluating unsupervised WSD systems against publicly available hand-tagged corpora.",
        "The framework uses three data sets, called Base corpus, Mapping corpus and Test corpus:",
        "• The Base Corpus: a collection of examples of the target word.",
        "The corpus is not annotated.",
        "• The Mapping Corpus: a collection of examples of the target word, where each corpus has been manually annotated with its sense.",
        "• The Test Corpus: a separate collection, also annotated with senses.",
        "The evaluation framework is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "The first step is to execute the HyperLex algorithm over the Base corpus in order to obtain the hubs of a target word, and the generated MST is stored.",
        "As stated before, the Base Corpus is not tagged, so the building of the MST is completely unsupervised.",
        "In a second step (left part in Figure 1), we assign a hub score vector to each of the occurrences of target word in the Mapping corpus, using the MST calculated in the previous step (following the WSD algorithm in Section 2.2).",
        "Using the hand-annotated sense information, we can compute a mapping matrix M that relates hubs and senses in the following way.",
        "Suppose there are m hubs and n senses for the target word.",
        "Then, M= {mid } 1 G i G m,1 G j G n, and each mid = P(sd Ihi), that is, mid is the probability of a word having sense j given that it has been assigned hub i.",
        "This probability can be computed counting the times an occurrence with sense sd has been assigned hub hi.",
        "This mapping matrix will be used to transform any hub score vector h¯ = (h1,...,hm) returned by the WSD algorithm into a sense score vector s¯ = (s1, ... , sn).",
        "It suffices to multiply the score vector by M, i.e., s¯ = ¯hM.",
        "In the last step (right part in Figure 1), we apply the WSD algorithm over the Test corpus, using again the MST generated in the first step, and returning a hub score vector for each occurrence of the target word in the test corpus.",
        "We then run the Evaluator, which uses the M mapping matrix in order to convert the hub score vector into a sense score vector.",
        "The Evaluator then compares the sense with highest weight in the sense score vector to the sense that was manually assigned, and outputs the precision figures.",
        "Preliminary experiments showed that, similar to other unsupervised systems, HyperLex performs better if it sees the test examples when building the graph.",
        "We therefore decided to include a copy of the training and test corpora in the base corpus (discarding all hand-tagged sense information, of course).",

        "For the future, we would like to look more closely the micro-senses induced by HyperLex, and see if we can group them into coarser clusters.",
        "We also plan to apply the parameters to the Senseval 3 all-words task, which seems well fit for HyperLex: the best supervised system only outperforms MFS by a few points in this setting, and the training corpora used (Semcor) is not related to the test corpora (mainly Wall Street Journal texts).",
        "Graph models have been very successful in some settings (e.g. the PageRank algorithm of Google), and have been rediscovered recently for natural language tasks like knowledge-based WSD, textual entailment, summarization and dependency parsing.",
        "We would like to test other such algorithms in the same conditions, and explore their potential to integrate different kinds of information, especially the local or syntactic features so successfully used by supervised systems, but also more heterogeneous information from knowledge bases."
