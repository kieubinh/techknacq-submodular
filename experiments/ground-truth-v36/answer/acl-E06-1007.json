        "This paper describes an implemented system for the detection of nonreferential it in spoken multi-party dialog.",
        "The system has been developed on the basis of meeting transcriptions from the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003), and it is intended as a preprocessing component for a coreference resolution system in the DIANA-Summ dialog summarization project.",
        "Consider the following utterance: MN059: Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I’m sure I could learn a lot about um, yeah, just how to - how to come up with these structures, cuz it’s -it’s very easy to whip up something quickly, but it maybe then makes sense to - to me, but not to anybody else, and - and if we want to share and integrate things, they must - well, they must be well designed really.",
        "(Bed017) In this example, only one of the three instances of it is a referential pronoun: The first it appears in the reparandum part of a speech repair (Heeman & Allen, 1999).",
        "It is replaced by a subsequent alteration and is thus not part of the final utterance.",
        "The second it is the subject of an extraposition construction and serves as the placeholder for the postposed infinitive phrase to whip up something quickly.",
        "Only the third it is a referential pronoun which anaphorically refers to something.",
        "The task of the system described in the following is to identify and filter out nonreferential instances of it, like the first and second one in the example.",
        "By preventing these instances from triggering the search for an antecedent, the precision of a coreference resolution system is improved.",
        "Up to the present, coreference resolution has mostly been done on written text.",
        "In this domain, the detection of nonreferential it has by now become a standard preprocessing step (e.g. Ng & Cardie (2002)).",
        "In the few works that exist on coreference resolution in spoken language, on the other hand, the problem could be ignored, because almost none of these aimed at developing a system that could handle unrestricted input.",
        "Eckert & Strube (2000) focus on an unimplemented algorithm for determining the type of antecedent (mostly NP vs. non-NP), given an anaphorical pronoun or demonstrative.",
        "The system of Byron (2002) is implemented, but deals mainly with how referents for already identified discourse-deictic anaphors can be created.",
        "Finally, Strube & M¨uller (2003) describe an implemented system for resolving 3rd person pronouns in spoken dialog, but they also exclude nonreferential it from consideration.",
        "In contrast, the present work is part of a project to develop a coreference resolution system that, in its final implementation, can handle unrestricted multi-party dialog.",
        "In such a system, no a priori knowledge is available about whether an instance of it is referential or not.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the current state of the art for the detection of nonreferential it in written text.",
        "Section 3 describes our corpus of transcribed spoken dialog.",
        "It also reports on the annotation that we performed in order to collect training and test data for our machine learning experiments.",
        "The annotation also offered interesting insights into how reliably humans can identify nonreferential it in spoken language, a question that,",
        "to our knowledge, has not been adressed before.",
        "Section 4 describes the setup and results of our machine learning experiments, Section 5 contains conclusion and future work."

        "Nonreferential it is a rather frequent phenomenon in written text, though it still only constitutes a minority of all instances of it.",
        "Evans (2001) reports that his corpus of approx.",
        "370.000 words from the SUSANNE corpus and the BNC contains 3.171 examples of it, approx.",
        "29% of which are nonreferential.",

        "(2002) work on the ACE corpus and give the following figures: the newspaper part of the corpus (ca.",
        "61.000 words) contains 381 instances of it, with 20.7% being nonreferential, and the news wire part (ca.",
        "66.000 words) contains 425 instances of it, 16.5% of which are nonreferential.",
        "Boyd et al.",
        "(2005) use a 350.000 word corpus from a variety of genres.",
        "They count 2.337 instances of it, 646 of which (28%) are nonreferential.",
        "Finally, Clemente et al.",
        "(2004) report that in the GENIA corpus of medical abstracts the percentage of nonreferential it is as high as 44% of all instances of it.",
        "This may be due to the fact that abstracts tend to contain more stereotypical formulations.",
        "It is worth noting here that in all of the above studies the referential-nonreferential decision implicitly seems to have been made by the author(s).",
        "To our knowledge, no study provides figures regarding the reliability of this classification.",
        "Paice & Husk (1987) is the first corpus-based study on the detection of nonreferential it in written text.",
        "From examples drawn from a part of the LOB corpus (technical section), Paice & Husk (1987) create rather complex pattern-based rules (like SUBJECT VERB it STATUS to TASK), and apply them to an unseen part of the corpus.",
        "They report a final success rate of 92.2% on the test corpus.",
        "Nowadays, most current coreference resolution systems for written text include some means for the detection of nonreferential it.",
        "However, evaluation figures for this task are not always given.",
        "As the detection of nonreferential it is supposed to be a filtering condition (as opposed to a selection condition), high precision is normally considered to be more important than high recall.",
        "A false negative, i.e. a nonreferential it that is not detected, can still be filtered out later when resolution fails, while a false positive, i.e. a referential it that is wrongly removed, is simply lost and will necessarily harm overall recall.",
        "Another point worth mentioning is that mere classification accuracy (percent correct) is not an appropriate evaluation measure for the detection of nonreferential it.",
        "Accuracy will always be biased in favor of predicting the majority class referential which, as the above figures show, can amount to over 80%.",
        "The majority of works on detecting nonreferential it in written text uses some variant of the partly syntactic and partly lexical tests described by Lap-pin & Leass (1994), the first work about computational pronoun resolution to address the potential benefit of detecting nonreferential it.",
        "Lappin & Leass (1994) mainly supply a short list of modal adjectives and cognitive verbs, as well as seven syntactic patterns like It is Cogv-ed that S. Like many works that treat the detection of nonreferential it only as one of several steps of the coreference resolution process, Lappin & Leass (1994) do not give any figures about the performance of this filtering method.",
        "Dimitrov et al.",
        "(2002) modify and extend the approach of Lappin & Leass (1994) in several respects.",
        "They extend the list of modal adjectives to 86 (original: 15), and that of cognitive verbs to 22 (original: seven).",
        "They also increase the coverage of the syntactic patterns, mainly by allowing for optional adverbs at certain positions.",
        "Dimitrov et al.",
        "(2002) report performance figures for each of their syntactic patterns individually.",
        "The first thing to note is that 41.3% of the instances of nonreferential it in their corpus do not comply with any of the patterns they use, so even if each pattern worked perfectly, the maximum recall to be reached with this method would be 58.7%.",
        "The actual recall is 37.7%.",
        "Dimitrov et al.",
        "(2002) do not give any precision figures.",
        "One interesting detail is that the pattern involving the passive cognitive verb construction accounts for only three instances in the entire corpus, of which only one is found.",
        "Evans (2001) employs memory-based machine learning.",
        "He represents instances of it as vectors of 35 features.",
        "These features encode, among other things, information about the parts of speech and lemmata of words in the context of it (obtained automatically).",
        "Other features encode the presence or absence of, resp.",
        "the distance to, certain element sequences indicative of pleonastic it, such as complementizers or present participles.",

        "the text, like position of the it in its sentence, and position of the sentence in its paragraph.",
        "Sentence boundaries are also used to limit the search space for certain distance features.",
        "Evans (2001) reports a precision of 73.38% and a recall of 69.25%.",
        "Clemente et al.",
        "(2004) work on the GENIA corpus of medical abstracts.",
        "They assume perfect preprocessing by using the manually assigned POS tags from the corpus.",

        "Using an SVM machine learning approach, Clemente et al.",
        "(2004) obtain an accuracy of 95.5% (majority base line: approx.",
        "56%).",
        "They do not report any precision or recall figures.",
        "Clemente et al.",
        "(2004) also perform an analysis of the relative importance of features in various settings.",
        "It turns out that features pertaining to the distance or number of complementizers following the it are consistently among the most important.",
        "Finally, Boyd et al.",
        "(2005) also use a machine learning approach.",
        "They use 25 features, most of which represent syntactic patterns like it VERB ADJ that.",
        "These features are numeric, having as their value the distance from a given instance of it to the end of the match, if any.",
        "Pattern matching is limited to sentences, sentence breaks being identified by punctuation.",
        "Other features encode the (simplified) POS tags that surround a given instance of it.",
        "Like in the system of Clemente et al.",
        "(2004), all POS tag information is obtained from the corpus, so no (error-prone) automatic tagging is performed.",
        "Boyd et al.",
        "(2005) obtain a precision of 82% and a recall of 71% using a memory-based machine learning approach, and a similar precision but much lower recall (42%) using a decision tree classifier.",
        "In summary, the best approaches for detecting nonreferential it in written text already work reasonably well, yielding an F-measure of over 70% (Evans, 2001; Boyd et al., 2005).",
        "This can at least partly be explained by the fact that many instances are drawn from texts coming from rather stereotypical domains, like e.g. news wire text or scientific abstracts.",
        "Also, some make the rather unrealistic assumption of perfect POS information, and even those who do not make this assumption take advantage of the fact that automatic POS tagging is generally very good for these types of text.",
        "This is especially true in the case of complementizers (like that) which have been shown to be highly indicative of extraposition constructions.",
        "Structural properties of the context of it, including sentence boundaries and position within sentence or paragraph, are also used frequently, either as numerical features in their own right, or as means to limit the search space for pattern matching."

        "The following rule makes use of the feature encoding the distance to the next complementizer (14 true positives, five false positives): obj_verb = null and dist_to_next_comp <= 5 ==> nonref (19.0/5.0) The fact that these rules with these conditions were learned show that the features found to be most important for the detection of nonreferential it in written text (cf.",
        "Section 2) are also highly relevant for performing that task for spoken language.",
        "We then ran a second experiment in which we used sentence boundary information to restrict the scope of both the pattern matching features and the distance-related features.",
        "We expected this to improve the performance of the model, as patterns should apply less generously (and thus more accurately), which could be expected to result in an increase in precision.",
        "However, the second experiment yielded a recall of 57.7%, a precision of only 70.1% and an F-measure of 63.3% for the detection of this class.",
        "The overall accuracy was 74.9%.",
        "The system produced a mere five rules (compared to seven before).",
        "The model produced the identical rule using the discarded-feature.",
        "The same applies to the seemlist feature, with the difference that both precision and recall of this rule were altered: The rule now produced 23 true positives and six false positives.",
        "The slightly higher recall of the model using the sentence boundary information is mainly due to a better coverage of the rule using the features encoding the distance to the next to-infinitive and the next adjective: it now produced",
        "57 true positives and only 30 false positives.",
        "We then wanted to compare the contribution of the sentence breaks to that of the interruption points.",
        "We ran another experiment, using only the latter and leaving everything else unaltered.",
        "This time, the overall performance of the classifier improved considerably: recall was 60.9%, precision 80.0%, F-measure 69.2%, and the overall accuracy was 79.6%.",
        "The resulting model was rather complicated, including seven complex rules.",
        "The increase in recall is mainly due to the following rule, which is not easily interpreted:5 it_s = match and dist_to_next_nominal >=21 and dist_to_next_adj >=500 and subj_verb = null ==> nonref (116.0/31.0) The considerable improvement (in particular in precision) brought about by the interruption points, and the comparatively small impact of sentence boundary information, might be explainable in several ways.",
        "For instance, although sentence boundary information allows to limit both the search space for distance features and the scope of pattern matching, due to the shallow nature of preprocessing, what is between two sentence breaks is by no means a well-formed sentence.",
        "In that respect, it seems plausible to assume that smaller",
        "units (as delimited by interruption points) may be beneficial for precision as they give rise to fewer spurious matches.",
        "It must also be noted that interruption points do not mark arbitrary breaks in the flow of speech, but that they can signal important information (cf. Heeman & Allen (1999))."

        "This paper presented a machine learning system for the automatic detection of nonreferential it in spoken dialog.",
        "Given the fact that our feature extraction methods are only very shallow, the results we obtained are satisfying.",
        "On the one hand, the good results that we obtained when utilizing information about interruption points (P:80.0% / R:60.9% / F:69.2%) show the feasibility of detecting nonreferential it in spoken multi-party dialog.",
        "To our knowledge, this task has not been tackled before.",
        "On the other hand, the still fairly good results obtained by only using automatically determined features (P:71.9% / R:55.1%/ F:62.4%) show that a practically usable filtering component for nonreferential it can be created even with rather simple means.",
        "All experiments yielded classifiers that are conservative in the sense that their precision is considerably higher than their recall.",
        "This makes them particularly well-suited as filter components.",
        "For the coreference resolution system that this",
        "work is part of, only the fully automatic variant is an option.",
        "Therefore, future work must try to improve its recall without harming its precision (too much).",
        "One way to do that could be to improve the recognition (i.e. correct POS tagging) of grammatical function words (in particular complementizers like that) which have been shown to be important indicators for constructions with nonreferential it.",
        "Other points of future work include the refinement of the syntactic pattern features and the lexical features.",
        "E.g., the values (i.e. mostly nouns, verbs, and adjectives) of the lexical features, which have been almost entirely ignored by both classifiers, could be generalized by mapping them to common WordNet superclasses."
