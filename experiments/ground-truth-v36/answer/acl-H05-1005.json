        "Typically, information that makes it to a summary appears in many different lexical-syntactic forms in the input documents.",
        "Further, the use of multiple machine translation systems provides yet more redundancy, yielding different ways to realize that information in English.",

        "Multilingual summarization is a relatively nascent research area which has, to date, been addressed through adaptation of existing extractive English document summarizers.",
        "Some systems (e.g. SUM-MARIST (Hovy and Lin, 1999)) extract sentences from documents in a variety of languages, and translate the resulting summary.",
        "Other systems (e.g. Newsblaster (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004)) perform translation before sentence extraction.",
        "Readability is a major issue for these extractive systems.",
        "The output of machine translation software is usually errorful, especially so for language pairs such as Chinese or Arabic and English.",
        "The ungrammaticality and inappropriate word choices resulting from the use of MT systems leads to machine summaries that are difficult to read.",
        "Multi-document summarization, however, has information available that was not available during the translation process and which can be used to improve summary quality.",
        "A multi-document summarizer is given a set of documents on the same event or topic.",
        "This set provides redundancy; for example, each document may refer to the same entity, sometimes in different ways.",
        "It is possible that by examining many translations of references to the same entity, a system can gather enough accurate information to improve the translated reference in the summary.",
        "Further, as a summary is short and serves as a surrogate for a large set of documents, it is worth investing more resources in its translation; readable summaries can help end users decide which documents they want to spend time deciphering.",
        "Current extractive approaches to summarization are limited in the extent to which they address quality issues when the input is noisy.",
        "Some new systems attempt substituting sentences or clauses in the summary with similar text from extraneous but topic related English documents (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004).",
        "This improves readability, but can only be used in limited circumstances, in order to avoid substituting an English sentence that is not faithful to the original.",
        "Evans and McKeown (2005) consider the task of summarizing a mixed data set that contains both English and Arabic news reports.",
        "Their approach is to separately summarize information that is contained in only English reports, only Arabic reports, and in both.",
        "While the only-English and in-both information can be summarized by selecting text from English reports, the summaries of only-Arabic suffer from the same readability issues.",
        "In this paper, we use principles from information",
        "theory (Shannon, 1948) to address the issue of readability in multilingual summarization.",
        "We take as input, multiple machine translations into English of a cluster of news reports in Arabic.",
        "This input is characterized by high levels of linguistic noise and by high levels of information redundancy (multiple documents on the same or related topics and multiple translations into English).",
        "Our aim is to use automatically acquired knowledge about the English language in conjunction with the information redundancy to perform error correction on the MT.",
        "The main benefit of our approach is to make machine summaries of errorful input easier to read and comprehend for end-users.",
        "We focus on noun phrases in this paper.",
        "The amount of error correction possible depends on the amount of redundancy in the input and the depth of knowledge about English that we can utilize.",
        "We begin by tackling the problem of generating references to people in English summaries of Arabic texts (§2).",
        "This special case involves large amounts of redundancy and allows for relatively deep English language modeling, resulting in good error correction.",
        "We extend our approach to arbitrary NPs in §3.",
        "The evaluation emphasis in multi-document summarization has been on evaluating content (not readability), using manual (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) as well as automatic (Lin and Hovy, 2003) methods.",
        "We evaluate readability of the generated noun phrases by computing precision, recall and f-measure of the generated version compared to multiple human models of the same reference, computing these metrics on n-grams.",
        "Our results show that our system performs significantly better on precision over two baselines (most frequent initial reference and randomly chosen initial reference).",
        "Precision is the most important of these measures as it is important to have a correct reference, even if we don’t retain all of the words used in the human models."

        "To evaluate how much impact the rewrites have on summaries, we ran our summarizer on the 18 test sets, and manually evaluated the selected sentences",
        "and their rewritten versions for accuracy and fluency.",
        "There were 118 sentences, out of which 94 had at least one modification after the rewrite process.",
        "We selected 50 of these 94 sentences at random and asked 2 human judges to rate each sentence and its rewritten form on a scale of 1–5 for accuracy and fluency3.",
        "We used 4 human judges, each judging 25 sentence pairs.",
        "The original and rewritten sentences were presented in random order, so judges did not know which sentences were rewritten.",
        "Fluency judgments were made before seeing the human translated sentence, and accuracy judgments were made by comparing with the human translation.",
        "The average scores before and after rewrite were 2.08 and 2.26 respectively for fluency and 3.00 and 3.19 respectively for accuracy.",
        "Thus the rewrite operations increases both scores by around 0.2."
