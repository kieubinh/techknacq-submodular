        "The problem can be viewed as a decision of attaching a prepositional phrase (PP) to one of the preceding head nouns or verbs.",
        "The ambiguity expressed by the number of potential parse trees generated by Context-Free Grammars increases exponentially with the number of PPs.",
        "For a PP that follows the object of a verb there are 2 parse trees, for a chain of 2, 3, 4 and 5 PPs there are respectively 5, 14, 42 and 132 parse trees.",
        "Usually the average number of consecutive PPs in a sentence increases linearly with the length of the sentence.",
        "Lexical and syntactic information alone is not sufficient to resolve the PP-attachment problem; often semantic and/or contextual information is necessary.",
        "For example, in “I ate a pizza with anchovies”, “with anchovies” attaches to the noun “pizza”, where as in “I ate a pizza with friends.”, “with friends” attaches to the verb “eat” – example found in (McLauchlan, 2001).",
        "There are instances of PP-attachment, like the one in “I saw the car in the picture” that can be disambiguated only by using contextual discourse information.",
        "Usually, people don’t have much trouble in finding the right way to attach PPs.",
        "But if one limits the information used for disambiguation of the PP-attachment to include only the verb, the noun representing its object, the preposition and the main noun in the PP, the accuracy for human decision degrades from 93.2% to 88.2% (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) on a dataset extracted from Penn Treebank (Marcus et"

        "google .",
        "com).",
        "In describing the features, we will use the Penn Treebank-II parse tree associated with the sentence “The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in “very modest amounts” in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type offilter in 1956”.",
        "Table 2 describes the features and the origin of each feature.",
        "The preposition is the feature with the most discriminative power, because of preferences of particular prepositions to attach to verbs or nouns.",
        "Table 3 shows the distribution of top 10 most frequently used prepositions in the FN and TB2 datasets.",
        "The features were carefully designed so that, when they are extracted from gold parse trees, they don’t provide more information useful for disambiguation than when they are automatically generated using a parser.",
        "This claim is validated by the experimental results that show a strong correlation between the results on the two datasets – one based on automatically generated parse trees (FN) and one based on gold parse trees (TB2).",
        "Next, we describe in further detail the features presented in Table 2. v-frame represents the frame of the verb – the frame to which the verb belongs, as it is present in FrameNet (manually annotated).",
        "We used this feature because the frame of the verb describes very well the semantic behavior of the verb including the predicate-argument structure of the verb, which entails the affinity of the verb for certain prepositions.",
        "n1-sr represents the semantic role of the object phrase np1 – the label attached to the Frame Element (manual semantic annotation that can be found in FrameNet).",
        "This feature was introduced because of the relation between the underlying meaning of np1 and its semantic role.",
        "n1-tr represents the thematic role of the object phrase np1 – a coarse-grained role based on the label attached to the Frame Element (manual semantic annotation that can be found in FrameNet).",
        "It was introduced to reduce data sparseness for the n1-sr feature.",
        "The conversion from fine-grained semantic role to coarse-grained semantic role is done automatically using a table that maps a pair of a frame-level semantic role (FE label) and a frame to a thematic role.",
        "subcategorization contains a semi-lexicalized description of the structure of the verb phrase.",
        "A subcategorization frame is closely related to the",
        "predicate argument structure and to the underlying meaning of the verb.",
        "It contains an ordered set of all the phrase labels that are siblings of the verb, plus a marker for the verb.",
        "If the child phrase of the verb is a PP, then the label will also contain the preposition (the headword of the PP).",
        "This feature is a modified form of the sub-categorization feature described in (Pradhan et al., 2003): the differences in various part-of-speeches for the verb were ignored and the preposition that heads a prepositional phrase is also attached to the label.",
        "Therefore, for the sentence “The stock declined in June by 4%”, the value for this feature is *-PPin-PPby.",
        "In the TB2 dataset the parse trees are gold standard (contain the expected output value for PP-ambiguity resolution).",
        "In the case of a verb attachment, if the selected PP is a child of the selected VP, then by applying the algorithm, the value of the feature will contain the PP label plus the preposition.",

        "position indicates the position of the ni-p-n2 construction relative to the verb, i.e. whether the prepositional phrase in question lies before the verb or after the verb in the sentence.",
        "Position is very important in deciding the type of attachment, considering the totally different distribution of PPs constructions preceding the verb and PPs constructions following the verb.",
        "Morphological processing applied to ni and n2 was inspired by the algorithm described in (Collins and Brooks, 1995).",
        "We analyzed the impact of different levels of morphological processing by using two types: partial morphological processing (only numbers and years are converted) – identified by adding -mp as a suffix to the name of this feature – and full morphological processing (numbers, years and capitalized names) – identified by adding -mpf as a suffix to the name of this feature.",
