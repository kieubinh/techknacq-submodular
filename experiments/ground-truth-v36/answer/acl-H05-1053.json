        "From analysis of manually sense tagged corpora, Kilgarriff (2004) has demonstrated that distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.",
        "Most researchers working on word sense disambiguation (WSD) use manually sense tagged data such as Sem-Cor (Miller et al., 1993) to train statistical classifiers, but also use the information in SemCor on the overall sense distribution for each word as a back-off model.",
        "In WSD, the heuristic ofjust choosing the most frequent sense of a word is very powerful, especially for words with highly skewed sense distributions (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).",
        "Indeed, only 5 out of the 26 systems in the recent SENSEVAL-3 English all words task (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) outperformed the heuristic of choosing the most frequent sense as derived from SemCor (which would give 61.5% precision and recall).",
        "Furthermore, systems that did outperform the first sense heuristic did so only by a small margin (the top score being 65% precision and recall).",
        "Over a decade ago, Gale et al. (1992) observed the tendency for one sense of a word to prevail in a given discourse.",
        "To take advantage of this, a method for automatically determining the “one sense” given a discourse or document is required.",
        "Magnini et al. (2002) have shown that information about the domain of a document is very useful for WSD.",
        "This is because many concepts are specific to particular domains, and for many words their most likely meaning in context is strongly correlated to the domain of the document they appear in.",
        "Thus, since word sense distributions are skewed and depend on the domain at hand we would like to know for each domain of application the most likely sense of a word.",
        "However, there are no extant domain-specific sense tagged corpora to derive such sense distribution information from.",
        "Producing them would be extremely costly, since a substantial corpus would have to be annotated by hand for every domain of interest.",
        "In response to this problem, McCarthy et al. (2004) proposed a method for automatically inducing the predominant sense of a word from raw text.",
        "They carried out a limited test of their method on text in two domains using subject field codes (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000) to assess whether the acquired predominant sense information was broadly consistent with the domain of the text it was acquired from.",
        "But they did not evaluate their method on hand-tagged domain-specific corpora since there was no such data publicly available.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate the method on domain specific text by creating a sense-annotated gold standard2 for a sample of words.",
        "We used a lexical sample because the cost of hand tagging several corpora for an all-words task would be prohibitive.",
        "We show that the sense distributions of words in this lexical sample differ depending on domain.",
        "We also show that sense distributions are more skewed in domain-specific text.",
        "Using McCarthy et al.’s method, we automatically acquire predominant sense information for the lexical sample from the (raw) corpora, and evaluate the accuracy of this and predominant sense information derived from SemCor.",
        "We show that in our domains and for these words, first sense information automatically acquired from a general corpus is more accurate than first senses derived from SemCor.",
        "We also show that deriving first sense information from text in the same domain as the target data performs best, particularly when focusing on words which are salient to that domain.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we summarise McCarthy et al.’s predominant sense method.",
        "We then (section 3) describe the new gold standard corpora, and evaluate predominant sense accuracy (section 4).",
        "We discuss the results with a proposal for applying the method to an all-words task, and an analysis of our results in terms of this proposal before concluding with future directions."

        "Like McCarthy et al. (2004) we use k = 50 and obtain our thesaurus using the distributional similarity metric described by Lin (1998).",
        "We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory.",
        "The senses of a word zc are each assigned a ranking score which sums over the distributional similarity scores of the neighbours and weights each neighbour’s score by a WN Similarity score (Pat-wardhan and Pedersen, 2003) between the sense of zc and the sense of the neighbour that maximises the WN Similarity score.",
        "This weight is normalised by the sum of such WN similarity scores between all senses of zc and and the senses of the neighbour that maximises this score.",
        "We use the WN Similarity jcn score (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) since this gave reasonable results for McCarthy et al. and it is efficient at run time given precompilation of frequency information.",

        "The return example in section 3.3 illustrates this.",
        "Our results are for a lexical sample because we did not have the resources to produce manually tagged domain-specific corpora for an all words task.",
        "Although sense distribution data derived from SemCor can be more accurate than such information derived automatically (McCarthy et al., 2004), in a given domain there will be words for which the SemCor frequency distributions are inappropriate or unavailable.",
        "The work presented here demonstrates that the automatic method for finding predominant senses outperforms SemCor on a sample of words, particularly on ones that are salient to a domain.",
        "As well as domain-salient words, there will be words which are not particularly salient but still have different distributions than in SemCor.",
        "We therefore propose that automatic methods for determining the first sense should be used when either there is no manually tagged data, or the manually tagged data seems to be inappropriate for the word and domain under consideration.",
        "While it is trivial to find the words which are absent or infrequent in training data, such as SemCor, it is less obvious how to find words where the training data is not appropriate.",
        "One way of finding these words would be to look for differences in the automatic sense rankings of words in domain specific corpora compared to those of the same words in balanced corpora, such as the BNC.",
        "We assume that the sense rankings from a balanced text will more or less correlate with a balanced resource such as SemCor.",
        "Of course there will be differences in the corpus data, but these will be less radical than those between SemCor and a domain specific corpus.",
        "Then the automatic ranking method should be applied in cases where there is a clear deviation in the ranking induced from the domain specific corpus compared to that from the balanced corpus.",
        "Otherwise, SemCor is probably more reliable if data for the given word is available.",

        "One could also use the rankings to estimate probability distributions and compare the distributions with measures such as alpha-skew divergence (Lee, 1999).",
        "A simple definition would be where the rankings assign different predominant senses to a word.",
        "Taking this simple definition of deviation, we demonstrate how this might be done for our corpora.",

        "Although the majority are assigned the same first sense in the BNC as in the domain specific corpora, a significant proportion (31 % SPORTS and 34% FINANCE) are not.",
        "For all words WSD in either of these domains, it would be these words for which automatic ranking should be used.",
        "Table 4 shows the WSD accuracy using this approach for the words in our lexical sample with a different automatically computed first sense in the BNC compared to the target domain (SPORTS or FINANCE).",
        "We trained on the appropriate domain for each test corpus, and compared this with using SemCor first sense data.",
