        "It has been suggested that annotated data for these languages might be automatically created by leveraging parallel corpora and high-accuracy English systems (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Diab and Resnik, 2002).",
        "The studies are centered around the assumption that linguistic analyses for English (e.g., Part-of-Speech tags, Word sense disambiguation, grammatical dependency relationships) are also valid analyses in the translation of the English.",
        "For example, in the English noun phrase the red apples, red modifies apples; the same modifier relationship also exists in its French translations les pommes rouges, even though the word orders differ.",
        "To the extent that the assumption is true, annotated data in the non-English language can be created by projecting English analyses across a word aligned parallel corpus.",
        "The resulting projected data can then serve as (albeit noisy) training examples to develop applications in the non-English language.",
        "The projection approach faces both a theoretical and a practical challenge.",
        "Theoretically, it is well-known that two languages often do not express the same meaning in the same way (Dorr, 1994).",
        "Practically, the projection framework is sensitive to component errors.",
        "In particular, poor word alignments significantly degrade the accuracy of the projected annotations.",
        "Previous research on resource projection attempts to address these problems by redistributing the parameter values (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) or by applying transformation rules (Hwa et al.,",
        "2002).",
        "Their experimental results suggest that while these techniques can overcome some errors, they are not sufficient for projected data that are very noisy.",
        "In this work, we tackle the same problems by relaxing the zero manual annotation constraint.",
        "The main question we address is: how can we make the most out of a small set of manually labeled data (on the non-English side).",
        "Following the work of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) we focus on the task of training a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger, but we conduct our experiments with the more dissimilar language pair of English-Chinese instead of English-French.",
        "Through empirical studies, we show that when the word alignment quality is sufficiently poor, the error correction techniques proposed by Yarowsky and Ngai are unable to remove enough mistakes in the projected data.",
        "We propose an alternative approach that is inspired by backoff language modeling techniques in which the parameters of two tagging models (one trained on manually labeled data; the other trained on projected data) are combined to achieve a more accurate final model."

      "text": [
        "The idea of trying to squeeze more out of annotated training examples has been explored in a number of ways in the past.",
        "Most popular is the family of bootstrapping algorithms, in which a model is seeded with a small amount of labeled data and iteratively improved as more unlabeled data are folded into the training set, typically, through unsupervised learning.",
        "Another approach is active learning (Cohn et al., 1996), in which the model is also iteratively improved but the training examples are chosen by the learning model, and the learning process is supervised.",
        "Finally, the work that is the closest to ours in spirit is the idea of joint estimation (Smith and Smith, 2004).",
        "Of the bootstrapping methods, perhaps the most well-known is the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "This approach has been explored in the context of many NLP applications; one example is text classification (Nigam et al., 1999).",
        "Another bootstrapping approach reminiscent of EM is self-training.",
        "Yarowsky (1995) used this method for word sense disambiguation.",
        "In self-training, annotated examples are used as seeds to train an initial classifier with any supervised learning method.",
        "This initial classifier is then used to automatically annotate data from a large pool of unlabeled examples.",
        "Of these newly labeled data, the ones labeled with the highest confidence are used as examples to train a new classifier.",
        "Yarowsky showed that repeated application of this process resulted in a series of word sense classifiers with improved accuracy and coverage.",
        "Also related is the co-training algorithm (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) in which the bootstrapping process requires multiple learners that have different views of the problem.",
        "The key to co-training is that the views should be conditionally independent given the label.",
        "The strong independence requirement on the views is difficult to satisfy.",
        "For practical applications, different features sets or models (that are not conditionally independent) have been used as an approximation for different views.",
        "Co-training has been applied to a number of NLP applications, including POS-tagging (Clark et al., 2003), parsing (Sarkar, 2001), word sense disambiguation (Mi-halcea, 2004), and base noun phrase detection (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).",
        "Due to the relaxation of the view independence assumption, most empirical studies suggest a marginal improvement.",
        "The common thread between EM, self-training, and co-training is that they all bootstrap off of unannotated data.",
        "In this work, we explore an alternative to \"pure\" unannotated data; our data have been automatically annotated with projected labels from English.",
        "Although the projected labels are error-prone, they provide us with more information than automatically predicted labels used in bootstrapping methods.",
        "With a somewhat different goal in mind, active learning addresses the problem of choosing the most informative data for annotators to label so that the model would achieve the greatest improvement.",
        "Active learning also has been applied to many NLP applications, including POS tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1996) and pars",
        "ing (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003).",
        "The drawback of an active learning approach is that it assumes that a staff of annotators is waiting on call, ready to label the examples chosen by the system at every iteration.",
        "In practice, it is more likely that one could only afford to staff annotators for a limited period of time.",
        "Although active learning is not a focus in this paper, we owe some ideas to active learning in choosing a small initial set of training examples; we discuss these ideas in section 3.2.",
        "More recently, Smith and Smith (2004) proposed to merge an English parser, a word alignment model, and a Korean PCFG parser trained from a small number of Korean parse trees under a unified log linear model.",
        "Their results suggest that a joint model produces somewhat more accurate Korean parses than a PCFG Korean parser trained on a small amount of annotated Korean parse trees alone.",
        "Their motivation is similar to the starting point of our work: that a word aligned parallel corpus and a small amount of annotated data in the foreign language side offer information that might be exploited.",
        "Our approach differs from theirs in that we do not optimize the three models jointly.",
        "One concern is that joint optimization might not result in optimal parameter settings for the individual components.",
        "Because our focus is primarily on acquiring non-English language resources, we only use the parallel corpus as a means of projecting resources from English."

        "This approach requires a sentence-aligned English-Chinese corpus, a high-quality English tagger, and a method of aligning English and Chinese words that share the same meaning.",
        "Given the parallel corpus, we tagged the English words with a publicly available maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and we used an implementation of the IBM translation model (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) to align the words.",
        "The Chinese words in the parallel corpus would then receive the same POS tags as the English words to which they are aligned.",
        "Next, the basic projection algorithm is modified to accommodate two complicating factors.",
