        "This paper deals with word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem, which is to assign an appropriate sense to an occurrence of a word in a given context.",
        "Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al., 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mi-halcea, 2004; Niu et al., 2005; Park et al., 2000;",
        "Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schütze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al., 2004).",
        "In general, the most common approaches start by evaluating the co-occurrence matrix of features versus contexts of instances of ambiguous word, given sense-tagged training data for this target word.",
        "As a result, contexts are usually represented in a high-dimensional sparse feature space, which is far from optimal for many classification algorithms.",
        "Furthermore, processing data lying in high-dimensional feature space requires large amount of memory and CPU time, which limits the scalability of WSD model to very large datasets or incorporation of WSD model into natural language processing systems.",
        "Standard dimentionality reduction techniques include (1) supervised feature selection and supervised feature clustering when given labeled data, (2) unsupervised feature selection, latent semantic indexing, and unsupervised feature clustering when only unlabeled data is available.",
        "Supervised feature selection improves the performance of an ex-amplar based learning algorithm over SENSEVAL2 data (Mihalcea, 2002), Naive Bayes and decision tree over SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 data (Lee and Ng, 2002), but feature selection does not improve SVM and Adaboost over SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 data (Lee and Ng, 2002) for word sense disambiguation.",
        "Latent semantic indexing (LSI) studied in (Schütze, 1998) improves the performance of sense discrimination, while unsupervised feature selection also improves the performance of word sense discrimination (Niu et al., 2004).",
        "But little work is done on using feature clustering to conduct dimensionality reduction for WSD.",
        "This paper will describe an application of feature",
        "clustering technique to WSD task.",
        "Feature clustering has been extensively studied for the benefit of text categorization and document clustering.",
        "In the context of text categorization, supervised feature clustering algorithms (Baker and McCallum, 1998; Bekkerman et al., 2003; Slonim and Tishby, 2001) usually cluster words into groups based on the distribution of class labels over features, which can compress the feature space much more aggressively while still maintaining state of the art classification accuracy.",
        "In the context of document clustering, unsupervised feature clustering algorithms (Dhillon, 2001; Dhillon et al., 2002; Dhillon et al., 2003; El-Yaniv and Souroujon, 2001; Slonim and Tishby, 2000) perform word clustering by the use of word-document co-occurrence matrix, which can improve the performance of document clustering by clustering documents over word clusters.",
        "Supervised feature clustering algorithm groups features into clusters based on the distribution of class labels over features.",
        "But it can not group unseen features (features that do not occur in labeled data) into meaningful clusters since there are no class labels associated with these unseen features.",
        "On the other hand, while given labeled data, unsupervised feature clustering method can not utilize class label information to guide feature clustering procedure.",
        "While, as a promising classification strategy, semi-supervised learning methods (Zhou et al., 2003; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003) usually utilize all the features occurring in labeled data and unlabeled data.",
        "So in this paper we propose a semi-supervised feature clustering algorithm to overcome this problem.",
        "Firstly, we try to induce class labels for unseen features based on the similarity among seen features and unseen features.",
        "Then all the features (including seen features and unseen features) are clustered based on the distribution of class labels over them.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we will formulate a feature clustering based WSD problem in section 2.",
        "Then in section 3 we will describe a semi-supervised feature clustering algorithm.",
        "Section 4 will provide experimental results of various dimensionality reduction techniques with combination of state of the art WSD algorithms on SENSEVAL-3 data.",
        "Section 5 will provide a review of related work on feature clustering.",

        "We propose a semi-supervised feature clustering algorithm to satisfy the requirement of semi-supervised classification algorithms for dimensionality reduction in feature space.",
        "Our experimental results on SENSEVAL-3 data show that feature clustering can aggressively reduce the dimensionality of feature space while still maintaining state of the art sense disambiguation accuracy.",
        "Furthermore, when combined with a semi-supervised WSD algorithm, semi-supervised feature clustering outperforms supervised feature clustering and other dimensionality reduction techniques.",
        "Our additional experiments on sampled SENSEVAL-3 data indicate that our semi-supervised feature clustering method is robust to the noise in small labeled data, which achieves better performance than supervised feature clustering.",
        "In the future, we may extend our work by using more datasets to empirically evaluate this feature clustering algorithm.",
