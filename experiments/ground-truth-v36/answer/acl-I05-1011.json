        "This paper presents a lightweight method for unsupervised extraction of paraphrases from arbitrary textual Web documents.",
        "The method differs from previous approaches to paraphrase acquisition in that 1) it removes the assumptions on the quality of the input data, by using inherently noisy, unreliable Web documents rather than clean, trustworthy, properly formatted documents; and 2) it does not require any explicit clue indicating which documents are likely to encode parallel paraphrases, as they report on the same events or describe the same stories.",
        "Large sets of paraphrases are collected through exhaustive pairwise alignment of small needles, i.e., sentence fragments, across a haystack of Web document sentences.",
        "The paper describes experiments on a set of about one billion Web documents, and evaluates the extracted paraphrases in a natural-language Web search application."

        "The information captured in textual documents frequently encodes semantically equivalent ideas through different lexicalizations.",
        "Indeed, given the generative power of natural language, different people employ different words or phrases to convey the same meaning, depending on factors such as background knowledge, levelofexpertise,style,verbosity andpersonal preferences.",
        "Two equivalent fragments of text may differ only slightly, as a word or a phrase in one of them is paraphrased in the other, e.g., through a synonym.",
        "Yet even small lexical variations represent challenges to any automatic decision on whether two text fragments have the same meaning, or are relevant to each other, since they are no longer lexically identical.",
        "Many natural-language intensive applications make such decisions internally.",
        "In document summarization, the generated summaries have a higher quality if redundant information has been discarded by detecting text fragments with the same meaning [1].",
        "In information extraction, extraction templates will not be filled consistently whenever there is a mismatch in the trigger word or the applicable extraction pattern [2].",
        "Similarly, a question answering system could incorrectly discard a relevant document passage based on the absence of a question phrase deemed as very important [3], even if the passage actually contains a legitimate paraphrase.",
        "In information retrieval, deciding whether a text fragment (e.g., a document) is relevant to another text fragment (i.e., the query) is crucial to the overall output, rather than merely useful within some internal system module.",
        "Indeed, relevant documents or passages may be missed, due to the apparent mismatch between their terms and the paraphrases occurring in the users' queries.",
        "The previously proposed solutions to the mismatch problem vary with respect to the source of the data used for enriching the query with alternative terms.",
        "In automatic query expansion, the top documents provide additional query terms [4].",
        "An alternative is to attempt to identify the concepts captured in the queries and find semantically similar concepts in external resources, e.g., lexical databases [5, 6].",
        "This paper explores a different direction, namely the unsupervised acquisition of large sets of paraphrases from unstructured text within Web documents, and their exploitation in natural-language Web search.",
        "We present a lightweight method for unsupervised extraction of paraphrases from arbitrary, textual Web documents.",
        "The method taps the textual contents provided by millions of anonymous Web document contributors.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "After a condensed overview of the paraphrase acquisition method and a contrast to previous literature in Section 2, Section 3 presents the method in more detail.",
        "Section 4 describes evaluation results when applying the method to textual documents from a Web repository snapshot of the Google search engine.",
        "2Method at a Glance",
        "The proposed acquisition method collects large sets of word and phrase-level paraphrases via exhaustive pairwise alignment of small needles, i.e., sentence fragments, across a haystack of Web document sentences.",
        "The acquisition of paraphrases is a side-effect of the alignment.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, if two sentence fragments have common word sequences at both extremities, then the variable word sequences in the middle are potential paraphrases of each other.",
        "A significant advantage of this extraction mechanism is that it can acquire paraphrases from sentences whose information content overlaps only partially, as long as the fragments align.",
        "Indeed, the source sentences of the paraphrase (withdrew from,, pulled out of), as well as of (took effect, came into force), are arguably quite different overall in Figure1.",
        "Moreover, the sentences are part of documents whose content intersection is very small.",
        "In addition to its relative simplicity when compared to more complex, sentence-level paraphrase acquisition [7], the method introduced in this paper is a departure from previous approaches in several respects.",
        "First, the paraphrases are not limited to variations of specialized, domain-specific terms as in [8], nor are they restricted to a narrow class such as verb paraphrases [9].",
        "Second, as opposed to virtually all previous approaches, the method does not require high-quality, clean, trustworthy, properly-formatted input data.",
        "Instead, it uses inherently noisy, unreliable Web documents.",

        "The use of the Web as input data source strongly impacts the design of the method, since the average Web document is much noisier and less reliable than documents in standard textual collections.",
        "Furthermore, the separation of useful textual information from other items within the document is trivial in standard collections.",
        "In contrast, Web documents contain extraneous HTML information, formatting errors, intra-and inter-document inconsistencies, spam and other adversarial information, and in general they lack any assumptions regarding a common document structure.",
        "Consequently, the acquisition of paraphrases must be robust, handle Web documents with only minimal linguistic processing, avoid expensive operations, and scale to billions of sentences.",
        "As a prerequisite to the actual acquisition of paraphrases, the Web documents are converted from raw string representations into more meaningful linguistic units.",
        "After filtering out HTML tags, the documents are tokenized, split into sentences and part-of-speech tagged with the TnT tagger [14].",
        "Many of the candidate sentences are in fact random noise caused by the inconsistent structure (or complete lack thereof) of Web documents, among other factors.",
        "To improve the quality of the data, sentences are retained for further processing only if they satisfy the following lightweight sanity checks: 1) they are reasonably sized: sentences containing less than 5 words or more than 30 words are discarded; 2) they contain at least one verb that is neither a gerund nor a modal verb; 3) they contain at least one non-verbal word starting in lower-case; 4) none of the words is longer than 30 characters; and 5) less than half of the words are numbers.",
        "Since the experiments use a collection of English documents, these checks are geared towards English.",
        "At Web scale, the number of sentences that pass the fairly aggressive sanity checks during document preprocessing is still extremely large, easily exceeding one billion.",
        "Any brute-force alignment of all pairs of document sentences is therefore unfeasible.",
        "Instead, the acquisition of paraphrases operates at the level of text fragments (ngrams) as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The extraction algorithm roughly consists of the following three phases:",
        " – Generate candidate ngrams from all sentences (steps 1 through 5 in Figure2);",
        " – Convert each ngram into a ready-to-align pair of a variable fragment (a candidate paraphrase) and a constant textual anchor (steps 6 through 13);",
        " – Group the pairs with the same anchors; collect the variable fragments within each group of pairs as potential paraphrases of one another (steps 14 to 20).",

        "To avoid such alignments, Steps 4 and 12 of the algorithm enrich the anchoring text around each paraphrase candidate, namely by extending the anchors to include additional information from the source sentence.",
        "By doing so, the anchors become longer and more specific, and thus closer to expressing the same information content.",

        "The Web has gradually grown into a noisy, unreliable, yet powerful resource of human knowledge.",
        "This knowledge ranges from basic word usage statistics to intricate facts, background knowledge and associated inferences made by humans reading Web documents.",
        "This paper describes a method for unsupervised acquisition of lexical knowledge across the Web, by exploiting the numerous textual forms that people use to share similar ideas, or refer to common events.",
        "Large sets of paraphrases are collected through pairwise alignment of ngrams occurring within the unstructured text of Web documents.",
        "Several mechanisms are explored to cope with the inherent lack of quality of Web content.",
        "The quality of the extracted paraphrases improves significantly when the textual anchors used for aligning potential paraphrases attempt to approximate, even at a very coarse level, the presence of additional information within the sentences.",
        "In addition to the known role of the extracted paraphrases in natural-language intensive applications, the experiments in this paper illustrate their impact in returning direct results to natural-language queries.",
        "The final output of the extraction algorithm lacks any distinction among paraphrases that apply to only one of the several senses or part of speech tags that a word or phrase may have.",
        "For instance, hearts, center and middle mix the medical and positioning senses of the word heart.",
        "Conversely, the extracted paraphrases may capture only one sense of the word, which may not match the sense of the same word in the queries.",
        "As an example, in the expansion of one of the test queries, \"Where is the massive North Korean (nuclear\\atomic) (complex\\real) (located\\situated\\found)?",
        "\", a less-than-optimal paraphrase of complex not only provides a sibling rather than a near synonym, but may incorrectly shift the focus of the search towards the mathematical sense of the word ( complex versus real numbers).",
        "Aggregated contextual information from the source ngrams could provide a means for selecting only some of the paraphrases, based on the query.",
        "As another direction for future work, we plan to revise the need for language-dependent resources (namely, the part of speech tagger) in the current approach, and explore possibilities of minimizing or removing their use for seamless transfer of the approach to other languages."
