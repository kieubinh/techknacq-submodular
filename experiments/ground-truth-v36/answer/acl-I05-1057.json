        "Due to dynamic progress in biomedical literature, a vast amount of new information and research results have been published and many of them are available in the electronic form - for example, like the PubMed MedLine database.",
        "Thus, automatic knowledge discovery and efficient information access are strongly demanded to curate domain databases, to find out relevant information, and to integrate/update new information across an increasingly large body of scientific articles.",
        "In particular, since most biomedical texts introduce specific notations, acronyms, and innovative names to represent new concepts, relations, processes, functions, locations, and events, automatic extraction of biomedical terminologies and mining of their diverse usage are major challenges in biomedical information processing system.",
        "In these processes, biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is the core step to access the higher level of information.",
        "In fact, there has been a wide range of research on NER like the NER task on the standard newswire domain in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6).",
        "In this task, the best system reported 95% accuracy in identifying seven types of named entities (person, organization, location, time, date, money, and percent).",
        "While the performance in the standard domain turned out to be quite good as shown in the papers, that in the biomedical domain is not still satisfactory, which is mainly due to the following characteristics of biomedical terminologies: First, NEs have various naming conventions.",
        "For instance, some entities have descriptive and expanded forms such as \"activated B cell lines, 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor\", whereas some entities appear in shortened or abbreviated forms like \"EGFR\"and \"EGF receptor\" representing epidermal growth factor receptor.",
        "Second, biomedical NEs have the widespread ambiguity out of context.",
        "For instance, \"IL-2\" can be doubly classified as \"protein\" and \"DNA\" according to its context.",
        "Third, biomedical NEs often comprise a nested structure, for example \"{DNA){protein)TNF alpha{/protein)gene(/DNA)\".",
        "According to [13], 16.57% of biomedical terms in GENIA have cascaded constructions.",
        "In the case, recognition of the longest terms is the main target in general.",
        "However, in our evaluation task, when the embedded part of a term is regarded as the meaningful or important class in the context, the term is labeled only with the class of embedded one.",
        "Thus, identification of internal structures of NEs is helpful to recognize correct NEs.",
        "In addition, more than one NE often share the same head noun with a conjunction/disjunction or enumeration structure, for instance, \"IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNA\", \"CD33+, CD56+, CD16- acute leukemia \"or \"antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cell \".",
        "Last, there is a lot of inter-annotator disagreement.",
        "[7] reported that the inter-annotator agreement rate of human experts was just 77.6% when performing gene/protein/mRNA classification task manually.",
        "Thus, a lot of term occurrences in real text would not be identified with simple dictionary look-up, despite the availability of many terminological databases, as claimed in [12].",
        "That is one of the reasons why machine learning approaches are more dominant in biomedical NER than rule-based or dictionary-based approaches [5], even though existence of reliable training resources is very critical.",
        "Accordingly, much work has been done on biomedical NER, based on machine learning techniques.",
        "[3] and [13] have used hidden Markov Model (HMM) for biomedical NER where state transitions are made by semantic trigger features.",
        "[4] and [11] have applied maximum entropy plus Markovian sequence based models such as maximum entropy markov model (MEMM) and conditional random fields (CRFs), which present a way for integrating different features such as internal word spellings and morphological clues within an NE string and contextual clues surrounding the string in the sentence.",
        "These works took an one-phase based approach where boundary detection of named entities and semantic labeling come together.",
        "On the other hand, [9]proposed a two-phase model in which the biomedical named entity recognition process is divided into two processes of distinguishing biomedical named entities from general terms and labeling the named entities with semantic classes that they belong to.",
        "They use support vector machines (SVM) for each phase.",
        "However, the SVM does not provide an easy way for labeling Markov sequence data like B following O and I following B in named entities.",
        "Furthermore, since this system is tested on the GENIA corpus rather than JNLPBA 2004 shared task, we cannot confirm the effectiveness of this approach on the ground of experiments for common resources.",
        "In this paper, we present a two-phase named entity recognition model: (1) boundary detection for NEs and (2) term classification by semantic labeling.",
        "The advantage of dividing the recognition process into two phase is that we can select separately a discriminative feature set for each subtask, and moreover can measure effectiveness of models at each phase.",
        "We use two exponential models for this work, namely conditional random fields for boundary detection having Markov sequence, and the maximum entropy model for semantic labeling.",
        "In addition, results from the machine learning based model are refined by a rule-based postprocessing, which is implemented using a finite state transducer (FST).",
        "The FST is constructed with the GENIA 3.02 corpus.",
        "We here focus on identification of five classes of NEs, i.e. \"protein\", \"RNA\", \"DNA\", \"cell line\", and \"cell type\" and experiments are conducted on the training and evaluation set provided by the shared task in COLING 2004 JNLPBA."
