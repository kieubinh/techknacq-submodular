        "Correct identification of antecedents for an anaphor is essential in message understanding systems as well as knowledge acquisition systems.",
        "For example, efficient anaphora resolution is needed to enhance protein interaction extraction from biomedical literature by mining more protein entity instances which are represented with pronouns or general concepts.",
        "In biomedical literature, pronominal and nominal anaphora are the two common types of anaphora.",
        "In past literature, different strategies to identify antecedents of an anaphor have been presented by using syntactic, semantic and pragmatic clues.",
        "For example, grammatical roles of noun phrases were used in [9] [10].",
        "In addition to the syntactic information, statistical information like co-occurring patterns obtained from a corpus is employed during antecedent finding in [3].",
        "However, a large corpus is needed for acquiring sufficient co-occurring patterns and for dealing with data sparseness.",
        "On the other hand, outer resources, like WordNet, are applied in [4][12][15] and proved to be helpful to improve the system like the one described in [12] where ani-macy information is exploited by analyzing the hierarchical relation of nouns and verbs in the surrounding context learned from WordNet.",
        "Nevertheless, using WordNet alone for acquiring semantic information is not sufficient for solving unknown words.",
        "To tackle this problem, a richer resource, the Web, was exploited in [16]",
        "Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 743 where anaphoric information is mined from Google search results at the expense of less precision.",
        "The domain-specific ontologies like UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) has been employed in [2] in such a way that frequent semantic types associated to agent (subject) and patient (object) role of subject-action or action-object patterns can be extracted.",
        "The result showed such kind of patterns could gain increase in both precision (76% to 80%) and recall (67% to 71%).",
        "On the other hand, Kim and Park [11] built their BioAR to relate protein names to SWISS-Prot entries by using the centering theory presented by [7] and salience measures by [2].",
        "In this paper, a resolution system is presented for tackling both nominal anaphora and pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using various kinds of syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, our verification of the semantic association between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated with the help of both general domain and domain-specific resources.",
        "For example, the semantic type checking for resolving nominal anaphora can be done by the domain ontology UMLS and PubMed, the search engine for MEDLINE databases.",
        "Here, UMLS is used not only for tagging the semantic type for the noun phrase chunks if they are in UMLS, but also for generating the key lexicons for each type so that we can use them to tag those chunks if they are not in UMLS.",
        "If no type information can be obtained from an chunk, then its type finding will be implemented through the web mining of PubMed.",
        "On the other hand, the domain corpus, GENIA 3.02p corpus [20] is exploited while we solve the semantic type checking for pronominal anaphora.",
        "With simple weight calculation, the key SA/AO (subject-action or action-object) patterns for each type can be mined from the corpus and they turn out to be helpful in resolution.",
        "Beside the semantic type agreement, the implicit resemblance between an anaphor and its antecedents is another evidence useful for verifying the semantic association.",
        "Hence, the general domain thesaurus, WordNet, which supporting more relationship between concepts and subconcepts, is also employed to enhance the resemblance extraction.",
        "The presented resolution system is constructed on a basis of a salience grading.",
        "In order to boost the system, we implemented a simple genetic algorithm on its selection of the rich feature set.",
        "The system was developed on the small evaluation corpus MedStract.",
        "Nevertheless, we constructed a larger test corpus (denoted as '100-MEDLINE') so that more instances of anaphors can be resolved.",
        "Experimental results show that our resolution on MedStract can yield 92% and 78% F-Scores on resolving pronominal and nominal anaphora respectively.",
        "Promising results were also obtained on the larger corpus in terms of 87.43% and 80.61% F-scores on resloving pronominal and nominal anaphora respectively."
