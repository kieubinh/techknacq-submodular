        "We hypothesize that systematic transfer errors from differing source languages will cancel out, improving the quality of bootstrapped resources in the target language.",

        "Each experiment compares three cases: (a) source data comes from a single language A, (b) source data comes from a single language B, and (c) source data comes from both A and B, but half as much from each.",
        "Apart from the source language, other conditions are held constant in all three cases - including the total amount of source data used.",
        "The null hypothesis is that performance in the mixed case would be an average of performance in the single-language cases, but in fact, mixed-case performance always exceeds the maximum of the single-language cases.",

        "Statistical NLP techniques typically require large amounts of annotated data.",

        "While automatically induced text analysis tools use fewer resources, their accuracy lags behind that of more resource-intensive tools.",
        "One solution to the problem of error reduction on NLP tasks is to train multiple classifiers, then compute a consensus classifier.",
        "Combining multiple classifiers is an effective way to reduce error if the errors made by each classifier are independently distributed.",
        "Such approaches have been successfully applied to a range of NLP tasks.",
        "Brill and Wu [4], van Halteren et al.",

        "Gollins and Sanderson [10] apply projection via multiple source languages to reduce error in cross-linguistic information retrieval.",
        "We hypothesize that a large component of the error rate in the automatically induced text analysis tools generated by [22] is due to morphosyntactic differences between the source and target languages that are specific to each source-target language pair.",
        "Therefore, training POS taggers on additional source languages should result in multiple classifiers which produce independently distributed errors on the target language.",
        "Previous research in classifier combination for POS tagging has focused primarily on combining various statistical classifiers trained on data in the same language.",
        "Thus, our approach is novel in its exploitation of differences across languages, rather than differences across statistical methods, to improve performance on POS tagging.",
        "Our method is general in that it does not rely on language-specific information, and requires no annotated resources in the target language.",
        "Our method is easily extensible to new languages.",
        "While it requires a parallel corpus between each source language and the target language, the corpora used to train each single-source tagger need not be translations of the same text.",
        "Furthermore, our algorithm is applicable even to target languages belonging to distinct language families from those of the source languages.",

        "For several reasons, we expect single-source tagger performance to be poorer on Czech (Table 6) than on French (Tables 5 and 4).",
        "First, Czech is a \"highly inflected\" language: the role of function words in the Germanic and Romance languages is typically filled by suffixes in Czech.",
        "Second, Czech exhibits a \"relatively free word order\" [7].",
        "Since a great deal of the POS information exploited by an HMM tagger is contained in sequences of function words12, these features of Czech hinder the performance of an HMM POS tagger.13 Finally, Czech belongs to the Slavic language family, and is therefore further removed than French from the Germanic and Romance families of the source languages used to train the single-source taggers.",
        "Although our single-source taggers do not replicate the performance results reported by [21] (91% and 94% accuracy on generic and core tagsets, respectively), our primary concern is not their absolute performance but rather their performance relative to the multiple-source taggers.",
        "We think it plausible that the improvements we observe would also be observed with Yarowsky's single-source taggers, but it remains an open question.",

        "Complementarity.",
        "Pairwise complementarity among single-source taggers is relatively high on French at both tagset granularities (Table3).",
        "The low pairwise complementarity of taggers on Czech may indicate the existence of a ceiling on the performance of the single-source tagger induction algorithm, imposed by the limited degree of similarity between any of the source languages with the target language.",
        "Even under such circumstances, we still see improvement (though diminished) by combining single-source taggers for Czech.",
        "One factor whose influence upon tagger complementarity must be acknowledged is the diversity of the statistical models underlying each of the POS taggers used to tag the source portion of the training text.",
        "Since we use a different type of tagger to tag each source language, we cannot separate the component of complementarity that is caused by the difference in statistical models among sources from the component caused by the difference in languages.",
        "Pairwise Combination.",
        "All pairwise combined taggers outperform the corresponding single-source taggers, though the total amount of training data is unchanged.",
        "We observe this improvement on both French and Czech.",
        "This suggests that our approach is likely to improve performance over single-source taggers on a wide range of target languages, and does not depend upon a close correspondence between any of the source and target languages.",
        "n-Way Combination.",
        "As expected (given the n-fold increase in training data), all n-way combined taggers outperform the corresponding single-source taggers, suggesting that when parallel training data between a particular source-language pair is limited, the performance of a POS tagger projected across that language pair can be improved by the use of a parallel corpus between the target language and a different source language.",
        "5Conclusion",
        "Projection from multiple source languages significantly improves the performance of automatically induced POS taggers on a target language.",
        "We observe performance gains from incorporating multiple source taggers even when the total amount of training data is held constant, indicating that multiple languages provide sources of information whose errors are independent and randomly distributed to a large extent.",
        "The approach presented here is general in that it does not depend on any language-specific resources in the target language beyond parallel corpora.",
        "Our results suggest that the performance of text analysis tools induced using parallel corpora can benefit from the incorporation of resources in other languages, even in the case of source languages belonging to distinct linguistic families from the target language."
