        "Written language is different from spoken language.",
        "That difference has various aspects.",
        "For example, spoken language is often ungrammatical, or uses simplified words rather than difficult ones etc.",
        "Among these aspects this paper examines difficulty.",
        "Difficult words are characteristic of written language and are not appropriate for spoken language.",
        "Our research aims at developing a system that paraphrases written language text into spoken language style.",
        "It helps text-to-speech generating natural voice when the input is in written language.",
        "In order to create such a system, the following procedure is required: (1) the system has to detect inappropriate words in the input text for spoken language, (2) generate paraphrases of inappropriate words, and (3) confirm that the generated paraphrases are appropriate.",
        "This paper examines step (1) and (3), which we call lexical choice for paraphrasing written language to spoken language.",
        "Broadly speaking, lexical choice can be defined as binary classification task: the input is a word and a system outputs whether it is appropriate for spoken language or not.",
        "This definition is valid if we can assume that the word difficulty is independent of such factors as context or listeners.",
        "However, we think such assumption is not always true.",
        "One example is business jargon (or technical term).",
        "Generally speaking, business jargon is difficult and inappropriate for spoken language.",
        "Notwithstanding, it is often used in business talk.",
        "This example implies that the word difficulty is dependent on the topic of text/talk.",
        "In this paper, we define the input of lexical choice as a word and text where it occurs (= the topic).",
        "Such definition makes it possible for a system to consider the topic.",
        "We think the topic plays an important role in lexical choice, when dealing with such words that are specific to a certain topic, e.g., business jargon.",
        "Hereafter, those words are called topical words, and others are called non-topical words.",
        "Of course, in addition to the topic, we have to consider other factors such as listeners and so on.",
        "But, the study of such factors lies outside the scope of this paper.",
        "Based on the above discussion, we describe a method of lexical choice that considers the topic.",
        "Basically, our method is based on the word probabilities in written and spoken language corpora.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that these two probabilities reflect whether the word is appropriate or not.",
        "The novelty of the method is topic adaptation.",
        "In order to adapt to the topic of the input text, the corpora are classified into topic categories, and the probability is estimated using such corpora that have the same topic category as the input text.",
        "This process enables us to estimate topic-adapted probability.",
        "Our method was evaluated by human judges.",

        "On the other hand, the result of Proposed was not good when applied to non-topical words.",
        "We think this result is caused by two reasons: (1) the difficulty of non-topical words is independent of the topic, and (2) Baseline uses larger corpora than Proposed (see Table 1 and Table 4).",
        "Therefore, we think this result does not deny the effectiveness of topic adaptation.",
        "These results mean that Proposed and Baseline are complementary to each other, and it is effective to combine the two methods: Proposed/Baseline is applied to topical/non-topical words.",

        "They are located above the line, which corresponds to discrimination rules, and are successfully classified as appropriate by Proposed.",
        "However, if the probability is estimated using the whole corpora, the features shift to the black triangle and diamond, and Baseline wrongly classified the two as inappropriate.",
        "In Health category, we could observe similar examples such as 'lung cancer' or 'metastasis'.",
        "These examples can be explained in the following way.",
        "Consider topical words in Business.",
        "When the probability is estimated using the whole corpora, it is influenced by the topic but Business, where topical words in Business are often inappropriate for spoken language.",
