        "However, the performance is worse than the baseline (the fundamental analyzer “Nivre+SVMs”).",
        "Therefore, we use our method to improve the analyzer by using root information (dividing the sentence according to root node).",

        "Therefore using combined method cannot supply higher improvement."

        "In Chinese articles, the normal ending mark of a sentence is the punctuation mark “ ”.",
        "However, the mark “‚” is often used at the end of a sentence.",
        "To distinguish the meaning of the punctuation mark “‚” is difficult.",
        "Therefore, we should adopt semantic analysis in our analyzer."
