        "It does not use any lexicon and the base segmentation is simply done by character bigram and HMM-model is applied for the remaining character sequences.",

        "AS uses two-byte space characters instead of a blank(0x20), and more 0x0A is used in AS that is regarded as EOF in Windows environment.",
        "The result of our system is not a top-level system when compared to other systems.",
        "However, our approach is quite acceptable because the data-driven methods can contribute to improving the accuracy of other word segmentation systems because we did not performed a tuning the system to fix the frequently repeating error patterns.",
