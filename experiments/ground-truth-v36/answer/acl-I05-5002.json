        "The corpus was created using heuristic extraction techniques in conjunction with an SVM-based classifier to select likely sentence-level paraphrases from a large corpus of topic-clustered news data.",
        "These pairs were then submitted to human judges, who confirmed that 67% were in fact semantically equivalent.",

        "This data has been published for the purpose of encouraging research in areas relating to paraphrase and sentential synonymy and inference, and to help establish a discourse on the proper construction of paraphrase corpora for training and evaluation.",

        "The success of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has sparked a successful line of investigation that treats paraphrase acquisition and generation essentially as a monolingual machine translation problem (e.g., Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Finch et al., 2004).",
        "However, a lack of standardly-accepted corpora on which to train and evaluate models is a major stumbling block to the successful application of SMT models or other machine learning algorithms to paraphrase tasks.",
        "Since paraphrase is not apparently a common “natural” task – under normal circumstances people do not attempt to create extended paraphrase texts – the field lacks a large readily identifiable dataset comparable to, for example, the Canadian Han-sard corpus in SMT that can serve as a standard against which algorithms can be trained and evaluated.",
        "What paraphrase data is currently available is usually too small to be viable for either training or testing, or exhibits narrow topic coverage, limiting its broad-domain applicability.",
        "One class of paraphrase data that is relatively widely available is multiple translations of sentences in a second language.",
        "These, however, tend to be rather restricted in their domain (e.g. the ATR English-Chinese paraphrase corpus, which con",
        "sists of translations of travel phrases (Zhang & Yamamoto, 2002)), are limited to short hand-crafted predicates (e.g. the ATR Japanese-English corpus (Shirai, et al., 2002)), or exhibit quality problems stemming from insufficient command of the target language by the translators of the documents in question, e.g. the Linguistic Data Consortium’s Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus (Huang et al., 2002).",
        "Multiple translations of novels, such as those used in (Barzilay & McKeown, 2001) provide a relatively limited dataset to work with, and – since these usually involve works that are out of copyright – usually exhibit older styles of language that have little in common with modern language resources or application requirements.",
        "Likewise, the data made available by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ Info/Projects/NLP/statpar.html), while invaluable in understanding and evaluating their results, is too limited in size and domain coverage to serve as either training or test data.",
        "Attempting to evaluate models of paraphrase acquisition and generation under limitations can thus be an exercise in frustration.",
        "Accordingly, we have tried to create a reasonably large corpus of naturally-occurring, non-handcrafted sentence pairs, along with accompanying human judg-ments, that can be used as a resource for training or testing purposes.",
        "Since the search space for identifying any two sentence pairs occurring “in the wild” is huge, and provides far too many negative examples for humans to wade through, clustered news articles were used to constrain the initial search space to data that was likely to yield paraphrase pairs."

        "Within this initial dataset we were able to automatically identify the names of both authors and copyright holders of 61,618 articles.1 Limiting ourselves only to sentences found in those articles, we further narrowed the range of candidate pairs using the following criteria: The number of words in both sentences in words is 5 >_ n <_ 40; The two sentences shared at least three words in common; The length of the shorter of the two sentences, in words, is at least 66.6% that of the longer; and The two sentences had a bag-of-words lexical distance of e >_ 8 edits.",
        "This enabled us extract a set of 49,375 initial candidate sentence pairs whose author was known, The purpose of these heuristics was two-fold: 1) to narrow the search space for subsequent application of the classifier algorithm and human evaluation, and 2) to ensure at least some diversity among the sentences.",
        "In particular, we sought to exclude the large number of sentence pairs whose differences might be attributable only to typographical errors, variance between British and American spellings, and minor editorial variations.",
        "Lexical distance was computed by constructing an alphabetized list of unique vocabulary items from each of the sentences and measuring the number of insertions and deletions.",
