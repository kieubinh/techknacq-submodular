        "Word forms, as atoms, cannot arbitrarily combine with each other.",
        "They form new composites by both imposing and satisfying certain requirements.",
        "A word uses a linguistic requirement (constraint or preference) in order to restrict the type of words with which it can combine in a particular position.",
        "The requirement of a given word is characterized by at least two different objects: the position occupied by the words that can be combined with the given word and the condition that those words must satisfy in order to be in that position.",
        "For a word w and a specific description of a location loc, the pair bloc, wÀ represents a position with regard to w. In addition,",
        "condition cond represents the set of linguistic properties that words must satisfy in order to be in position bloc,wÀ.",
        "So a linguistic requirement of w can be represented as the pair: bbloc, wÀ, condÀ ð1Þ Consider, for instance, position bof_right, ratificationÀ, where of_right is a location described as being to the right of preposition of.",
        "This position represents the argument slot ratification of [_].",
        "Considering also that cond stands for the specific property being a nominal phrase (np) whose head denotes a legal document (abbreviated by doc), then the pair bbof_right, ratificationÀ, docÀ means that the particular position ratification of [_] selects for nouns denoting legal documents.",
        "In other words, ratification requires nominal arguments denoting legal documents to appear after preposition of.",
        "Suppose that there exist some words such as law, treaty, and constitution that are nouns denoting legal documents.",
        "Then it follows that they fill the condition imposed by ratification in the of_right location.",
        "An expression like the ratification of the treaty is then well-formed, because treaty satisfies the required condition.",
        "Let us look now more carefully at several linguistic issues we consider to be important to characterize the notion of linguistic requirement: extensionality/ intensionality, soft/hard requirements, the scope of a condition, syntactic/semantic requirements, and corequirements.",
        "A condition can be defined either intentionally or extensionally.",
        "For example, the two specific properties being the head of an np and being a legal document are used to define intensionally the condition imposed by position bof_right, ratificationÀ.",
        "However, it is also possible to define it extensionally by enumerating all those words that actually possess such properties: for example, law, treaty, and constitution.",
        "Moreover, the process of satisfying a condition can be defined as a binary action producing a Boolean (yes/no) value.",
        "From this point of view, a word either satisfies or does not satisfy the condition imposed by another word in a specific location.",
        "This is a hard requirement.",
        "By contrast, the satisfaction process can also be viewed as a soft requirement, in which some words are ‘‘preferred’’ without completely excluding other possibilities.",
        "In Beale, Niremburg, and Viegas (1998), hard requirements are named constraints, whereas the term preferences is employed for soft requirements.",
        "In the following, we use one of these two terms only if it is necessary to distinguish between hard and soft requirements.",
        "Otherwise, requirement is taken as the default term.",
        "Let’s describe now what we call the scope of a condition.",
        "A position imposes a specific condition on the words that can appear in that position.",
        "Yet a specific condition is generally imposed not by only one position, but by a large set of them.",
        "If a condition were bound only to a particular position, every combination of words would be a noncompositional idiomatic expression.",
        "So speakers could not combine words easily, and new composite expressions would be difficult to learn.",
        "The scope of a condition embraces the positions that use it to restrict word combination.",
        "For instance, the condition imposed by ratification of [_] seems to be the same as the one imposed by the verb ratify on the words appearing at its right: bright, ratifyÀ (to ratify [_]).",
        "In addition, these positions also share the same conditions as to approve [_ ], to sign [_ ], or signatories to [_].",
        "Each of these similar positions is within the scope of a specific condition, namely, being an np whose head denotes a legal document.",
        "In this article, we assume that every linguistic condition is associated with a set of similar positions.",
        "This",
        "set represents the scope of the condition.",
        "The larger the set of similar positions, the larger the condition scope, and the more general the property used to characterize the condition.",
        "We distinguish syntactic and semantic requirements.",
        "A syntactic requirement is characterized by both a position and a morpho-syntactic condition.",
        "For instance, requirement bbof_right, ratificationÀ, npÀ consists of a position, bof_right, ratificationÀ, which selects for a nominal phrase.",
        "Note that the different syntactic requirements of a word can serve to identify the set of subcategorization frames of that word.",
        "Note also that, in some cases, a particular position presupposes a particular morpho-syntactic condition.",
        "In our example, position bof_right, ratificationÀ requires only a np.",
        "So we can use this position as a shorter form of the syntactic requirement bbof_right, ratificationÀ, npÀ.",
        "We call a syntactic position a position that presupposes a specific morpho-syntactic condition.",
        "On the other hand, a semantic requirement (also known as selection restriction) is characterized by both a position and a semantic condition, which presupposes a syntactic one.",
        "So bbof_right, ratificationÀ,docÀ means that position bof_right, ratificationÀ selects for the head of a np denoting a legal document.",
        "Condition doc presupposes then a np.",
        "Identifying a particular semantic requirement entails the identification of the underlying syntactic one.",
        "The final linguistic issue to be introduced is the phenomenon referred to as corequirements.",
        "It is assumed that each syntactic dependency between two words (which are the heads of two phrases) is composed of two complementary requirements.",
        "For instance, it seems that two different requirements underlie the expression ratification of the treaty: bof_right, ratificationÀ (ratification of [_]) needs to be filled by words like treaty, while bof_left, treatyÀ ([_] of the treaty) needs to appear with words such as ratification.",
        "The main objective of this article is to describe an unsupervised method for learning syntactic and semantic requirements from large text corpora.",
        "For instance, our method discovers that the word secretary is associated with several syntactic positions (i.e., positions with morpho-syntactic conditions), such as secretary of [_], [_] of the secretary, [_] to the secretary, and [_] with the secretary.",
        "The set of syntactic positions defined by a word can be used to characterize a set of subcategorization frames.",
        "The precise characterization of these frames remains, however, beyond the scope of this article.",
        "In addition, for each syntactic position, we assess the specific semantic condition a word needs to fill in order to appear in that position.",
        "Another important objective of the article is to use the semantic requirements to capture contextually relevant semantic similarities between words.",
        "In particular, we assume that two words filling the same semantic requirement share the same contextual word sense.",
        "Consequently, learning semantic requirements also leads us to induce word senses.",
        "Suppose that the word organization fills the condition imposed by secretary of [_ ].",
        "In this syntactic context, the word denotes a social institution and not a temporal process or an abstract setup.",
        "To achieve our objectives, we follow a particular clustering strategy.",
        "Syntactic positions (and not words) are compared according to their word distribution.",
        "Similar syntactic positions are put in more clusters following some constraints that are defined later.",
        "Each cluster of positions represents a semantic condition.",
        "The features of each cluster are the words that can fill the common condition imposed by those positions: They are the fillers.",
        "They are used to extensionally define the particular condition they can fill.",
        "That is, a condition is defined by identifying those words likely to appear in positions considered similar.",
        "Given that a condition is extensionally defined by the words that are able to fill it, our method describes the process of",
        "satisfying a condition as a Boolean constraint (yes/no) and not as a probabilistic preference.",
        "The similar positions defining a cluster are within the scope of a particular semantic condition.",
        "The association between each position of the cluster and that condition characterizes the semantic requirement of a word.",
        "This learning strategy does not require hand-crafted external resources such as a WordNet-like thesaurus or a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "The information captured by this strategy is useful for two different NLP disambiguation tasks: selecting contextual senses of words (word sense disambiguation) and solving structural ambiguity (attachment resolution).",
        "This article is focused on the latter application.",
        "In sum, the main contribution of our work is the large amount of linguistic information we learn for each lexical word.",
        "Given a word, we acquire, at least, three types of information: (1) an unordered set of syntactic positions, which is a first approximation to define the set of subcategorization frames of the given word, (2) the semantic requirements the word imposes on its arguments, and (3) the different contextual senses of the word.",
        "By contrast, related work focuses only on one or two aspects of this linguistic information.",
        "Another contribution is the use of corequirements to characterize the arguments of a word.",
        "To conclude the introduction, let’s outline the organization of the article.",
        "In the next section, we situate our approach with regard to related work on acquisition of linguistic requirements.",
        "Later, in sections 3 and 4, we describe in detail the main linguistic assumptions underlying our approach.",
        "Special attention will be paid to both the relativized view on word sense (i.e., contextual sense) and corequirements.",
        "Then, section 5 depicts a general overview of our strategy.",
        "Two particular aspects of this strategy are analyzed next.",
        "More precisely, section 6 describes both how syntactic positions are extracted and how they are clustered in larger classes (section 7).",
        "Finally, in section 8, we evaluate the results by measuring their performance in a particular NLP task: syntactic-attachment resolution.",
        "2.",
        "Statistics-Based Methods for Learning Linguistic Requirements During the last years, various stochastic approaches to linguistic requirements acquisition have been proposed (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993; Sekine et al.",
        "1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Framis 1995; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Resnik 1997; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000).",
        "In general, they follow comparable learning strategies, despite significant differences observed.",
        "In this section, we present first the common strategy followed by these approaches, and then we focus on their differences.",
        "Special attention is paid to lexical methods.",
        "At the end, we situate our strategy with regard to the related work.",
        "2.1 A Common Strategy The main design of the strategy for automatically learning requirements is to compute the association degree between argument positions and their respective linguistic conditions.",
        "For this purpose, the first task is to count the frequency with which bbloc, wÀ, condÀ occurs in a large corpus: Fðbbloc, wÀ, condÀÞ ð2Þ",
        "where F counts the frequency of co-occurring bloc, wÀ with cond.",
        "Then this frequency is used to compute the conditional probability of cond given position bloc, wÀ : Pðcond j bloc, wÀÞ ð3Þ This probability is then used to measure the strength of statistical association between bloc, wÀ and cond.",
        "Association measures such as mutual information or log-likelihood are used for measuring the degree of (in)dependence between these two linguistic objects.",
        "Intuitively, a high value of the association measure is evidence of the existence of a true requirement (i.e., a type of linguistic dependence).",
        "The stochastic association values obtained by such a strategy turn out to be useful for NLP disambiguation tasks such as attachment resolution in probabilistic parsing and sense disambiguation.",
        "2.2 Specific Aspects of the Common Strategy Despite the apparent methodological unanimity, approaches to learning requirements propose different definitions for the following objects: association measure, position bloc, wÀ, and linguistic condition cond.",
        "Many approaches differ only in the way in which the association measure is defined.",
        "Yet such differences are not discussed in this article.",
        "As regards position bloc, wÀ, we distinguish, at least, among three different definitions.",
        "First, it can be considered as a mere word sequence (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995): For instance, bright, wÀ, where right means being to the right of.",
        "Second, a position can also be defined in terms of co-occurrence within a fixed window (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000).",
        "Finally, it can be identified as the head or the dependent role within a binary grammatical relationship such as subject, direct object, or modifier (Sekine et al.",
        "1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Framis 1995).",
        "In section 4, we pay special attention to the grammatical characterization of syntactic positions.",
        "As far as cond is concerned, various types of information are used to define a linguistic condition: syntactic, semantic, and lexical information.",
        "The approaches to learning requirements are easily distinguished by how they define cond.",
        "Table 1 displays three different ways of encoding the condition imposed by verb approve to the nominal the law in the expression to approve the law.",
        "Requirement conditions of the pairs in Table 1 represent three descriptive levels for the linguistic information underlying the nominal expression the law when it appears to the right of the verb approve.",
        "The properties np, doc, and law are situated at different levels of abstraction.",
        "The morpho-syntactic tag np conveys more abstract information than the semantic tag doc (document), which, in turn, is more general than the lemma law.",
        "Some conditions can be inferred from other conditions.",
        "For instance, doc is used only to tag nouns, which are the heads of nominal phrases.",
        "So the semantic tag doc entails the syntactic requirement np.",
        "Likewise, the lemma law is associated only with nouns.",
        "It entails, then, an np.",
        "Some approaches describe linguistic conditions only at the syntactic level (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000).",
        "They count the frequency of pairs",
        "like bbright, approveÀ, npÀ in order to calculate the probability of an np occurring given bright, approveÀ.",
        "This probability is then used to compute the degree of association between approve and an np located to the right.",
        "This association value may be useful in different linguistic tasks.",
        "For instance, it may serve to solve structural ambiguities (Hindle and Rooth 1993) or to build a subcategorization lexicon (Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000).",
        "Most approaches to learning syntactic requirements assume that syntactic properties can be identified by means of some specific morphological ‘‘cues’’ appearing in the corpus.",
        "For instance, the article a following a verb is a clear evidence for an np appearing at the right of the verb; the preposition of following a verb is evidence for an of_right complement; and the conjunction that after a verb introduces a that_clause.",
        "Morphological cues are used to easily identify syntactic requirements.",
        "This technique allows raw text to be worked on directly.",
        "Let us note that these techniques do not allow the acquisition of complete subcategorization frames (Brent 1991; Manning 1993).",
        "They are able to acquire that, for instance, approve subcategorizes an np on two locations: both right and of_right locations (e.g., to approve the laws, to approve of the decision).",
        "So they associate that verb with two syntactic arguments.",
        "However, they are not able to learn that the two arguments are incompatible and must belong to two different subcategorization frames of the verb.",
        "We return to this issue in section 8.1.",
        "In other approaches to requirement learning, linguistic conditions are defined in semantic terms by means of specific tags (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Resnik 1997; Framis 1995).",
        "In order to calculate the degree of association between tag doc and position bright, approveÀ, these approaches count the frequency of pairs like bbright, approveÀ, docÀ throughout the corpus.",
        "If the association value is higher than that for other related cases, then one might learn that the verb approve requires nominal phrases denoting doc entities to appear at the right.",
        "According to other learning approaches, the linguistic conditions used to characterize requirements may be situated at the lexical level (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Sekine et al.",
        "1992).",
        "A pair like bbright, approveÀ, lawÀ matches those expressions containing a form of lemma law (e.g., law, laws, Law, Laws) appearing to the right of the verb approve (to be more precise, to the right of any form of lemma approve).",
        "The frequency of this pair in the corpus serves to compute the degree of association between law and the verb approve at the right.",
        "In these approaches, then, conditions are learned from lexical co-occurrences.",
        "From now on, when it is not necessary to distinguish between lemmas and word forms, we use the term ‘‘word’’ for both objects.",
        "To compare the three types of approaches more accurately, let’s analyze their behavior regarding different quantitative aspects: (1) the continuum between supervised and unsupervised learning, (2) the continuum between knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich methodology, and (3) the continuum between general and specific-information acquisition.",
        "Gamallo, Agustini, and Lopes Clustering Syntactic Positions",
        "of human supervision that is needed to annotate the training corpus.",
        "Among the works cited above, Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi (1992) has the highest degree of supervision.",
        "This semantic approach requires hand-tagging text nouns using a fixed set of semantic labels.",
        "The other approaches involve close to total nonsupervision, since they do not require a training corpus to be annotated by hand.",
        "However, some degree of human supervision could be involved in building automatic tools (e.g., a neural tagger in Marques, Lopes, and Coelho [2000]) or linguistic external sources (e.g., WordNet in Resnik [1997]; Framis [1995]; Ciaramita and Johnson [2000]), which are used to annotate the corpus.",
        "notions introduced by Grefenstette (1994).",
        "He distinguishes the learning methods according to the quantity of linguistic knowledge they require.",
        "The most knowledge-rich approaches need a handcrafted thesaurus (WordNet) to semantically annotate nouns of the training corpus (Resnik 1997; Framis 1995; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000).",
        "At the opposite end of the continuum, the most knowledge-poor methods are introduced in Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1995) and Dagan, Lee, and Pereira (1998); these merely need to identify lemmas in the corpus.",
        "2.2.3 General/Specific Conditions.",
        "As regards the general/specific continuum, syntactic methods, that is, approaches to learning syntactic requirements, are the learning methods that use the most general linguistic information.",
        "At the opposite end of the continuum, we find the lexical methods, that is, those strategies situated at the lexical level.",
        "Methods using tags like doc, human, and institution are situated at an intermediate level and are known as semantic methods.",
        "One of the most difficult theoretical problems is to choose the appropriate generalization level for learning requirement information.",
        "The syntactic level seems not to be appropriate for solving structural ambiguity.",
        "Concerning the parsing task, syntactic information is not always enough to produce a single parse.",
        "Consider the following analyses: [vpcut [n pthe potato] [ppwith a knife]] (4) [vpcut [npthe potato [ppwith a hole]]] (5) In order to decide which analysis, either (4) or (5), is correct, we must enlist the aid of our world knowledge concerning cutting actions, use of knives, and the properties of potatoes.",
        "In general, we know that knives are used for cutting and that potatoes are objects likely to have holes.",
        "So the parser is able to propose a correct analysis only if the lexicon is provided not only with syntactic requirements, but also with information on semantico-pragmatic requirements (i.e., with selection restrictions).",
        "Selection restrictions are typically used to capture facts about the world that are generally, but not necessarily, true (Androutsopoulos and Dale 2000).",
        "So the main goal of semantic and lexical methods is precisely the acquisition of selection restrictions.",
        "As has been mentioned previously, semantic methods use handcrafted sources of linguistic knowledge such as WordNet.",
        "There are several disadvantages associated",
        " with these knowledge-rich approaches: Manually created thesauri contain many words either having rare senses or missing domain-specific meanings.",
        "In sum, the level of semantic information provided by handcrafted thesauri is either too specific or too general, and it is usually incomplete.",
        "It seems not to be appropriate for most NLP tasks (Grefenstette 1994).",
        "By contrast, lexical methods are able to acquire information at the level of detail required by the corpus domain.",
        "They are domain-dependent approaches.",
        "However, they are very sensitive to the problem of data sparseness."

        "So, given a position, we create N aggregations of that position with one similar position.",
        "Filtering: Finally, for each aggregation of two similar positions, we select the intersection of their features; that is, the features of a basic cluster are those words that appear in both positions.",

        "It consists in defining a first clustering step in which positions are aggregated in basic clusters, which are called substitutability islands.",
        "As in Clustering 1(section 7.1), each basic cluster selects only those words occurring in all positions of the cluster.",

        "8.3.1 Test Data.",
        "The test data consisted of sequences of basic phrases (i.e., chunks).",
        "The phrase sequences selected belong to three types: vp–np–pp, vp–pp–pp, and np–pp– pp.",
        "They were randomly selected from two different (and already chunked) test corpora: a group of 633 sequences was selected from the EC corpus and another group of 633 was selected from PGR.",

        "Some specific instructions were given to the annotators for the most controversial cases.",
        "The following excerpts from these instructions are illustrative: (1) if a pp seems to be a modifier of the verb, then it is attached to the vp; (2) if a pp is a modifier of the sentence, no attachment is proposed; (3) if an np following a vp is either the direct object or the subject of the verb, then the np is attached to the vp; (4) if a pp seems to be attached to two phrases, two attachments are proposed (we retain the ambiguity); (5) if a phrase contains a word that was not correctly tagged, no attachment is proposed.",
        "Note that verbal modifiers and verbal complements are treated in the same way (see subsection 4.2.2).",

        "By contrast, in most related approaches, test expressions are ambiguous in only two senses: phrase3 is attached to either phrase2 or phrase1.",
        "Such approaches do not consider",
        " the attachment between phrase2 and phrase1.",
        "So in these approaches, Decision A is not taken into account.",

        "This type of evaluation, however, is not appropriate to measure the capability of the system to identify the nonstandard structural ambiguities described above (section 8.3.1).",
        "For instance, we expect the system not to propose that the pp ao diploma (to the [referred] diploma) is attached to the previous np, headed by est atut o s, in the second example of Table 8.",
        "The correct decision is to propose no attachment between the pp (phrase3) and either of the two previous phrases taking part in the sequence vp–pp–pp.",
        "The attachment is actually to a word, namely, the adjective anexo, which is not a direct constituent of the abstract sequence vp–pp–pp.",
        "Another important aspect of the evaluation protocol is that CR overgenerates attachments.",
        "There are several cases in which the three phrases of a sequence are semantically related.",
        "In those cases, CR often proposes three attachments even if only two of them are syntactically allowed.",
        "For instance, take the following np–pp–pp sequence: [npa remunerac$a˜o] [ppde o cargo] [ppde secreta´rio] (the salary concerning the post of secretary) (26) which would be correctly analyzed by using the same configuration as in parse (24), that is, [npa remuneracga˜o [ppde o cargo [ppde secreta´rio]]] (27) Note that there exists a strong semantic relationship between phrase3 (de s e c r e-ta¤rio) and phrase1 (a remunerac$a‹o), even if they are not syntactically attached in (27).",
        "Taking into account the semantic requirements stocked in the lexicon (see Table 7), CR is induced to propose, in addition to the two correct attachments, a long-distance dependency, which seems not to be syntactically correct in this particular case.",
        "We call this phenomenon attachment overgeneration.",
        "When a sequence contains two semantically related phrases that are not actually syntactically dependent, CR overgenerates an additional attachment.",
        "Attachment overgeneration was found in ,15% of expressions selected from the test corpus.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, we use a default rule based on right association.",
        "The default rule removes the long-distance attachment and proposes only the two contiguous ones.",

        "From a semantic viewpoint, attachment overgeneration seems not to be a real problem.",
        "The semantic interpretation of sequence (26) needs to account for all conceptual relations underlying the sequence.",
        "So the semantic requirements that linked secreta¤rio to remunerac$a‹o (even if they are not syntactically dependent) are useful for building a semantic representation of the sequence.",

        "8.3.4 Similarity-Based Lexical Association.",
        "We also compared CR to a very different learning strategy: the similarity-based lexical method (Sekine et al.1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998), described in section 2.3.",
        "We simulated here a particular version of this strategy.",
        "First, we used the log-likelihood ratio as a score of the association between pairs of syntactic positions and words.",
        "We restricted the lexical association procedure to suggest attachments only in cases in which the absolute value of the ratio was greater than an empirically set threshold (-3.00).",
        "Then, in order to generalize from unobserved pairs, a list of similar words was used to compute nonzero association scores.",
        "For this purpose, the thesaurus described in section 7.5 turned out to be useful.",
        "According to Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1995), the similarity-based lexical association LAsim between position p and word w is obtained by computing the average of the likelihood ratios between p and the k most similar words to w:",
        "where LA(p,wi) is the likelihood ratio between p and one of the k most similar words to w. NZ represents the number of nonzero values among LA(p, w1), LA(p, w2),..., LA(p, wk).",
        "Corequirements are also considered.",
        "Given dependency (robj; r at if ic ar 1, lei) (ratify the law), we compute the two following lexical associations: LAsim (brobj_ down, ratificarÀ, l e i) (29) LAsim (brobjup, leiÀ r at if ic ar ) The scores of these two associations are taken into account in the evaluation procedure.",
        "In particular, the sum of the two scores (if each of them is greater than the empirically set threshold) will be used to make a decision on the attachment between an np headed by lei and a vp headed by ratificar.",
        "8.3.5 Precision and Recall.",
        "The evaluation of each attachment decision made by the system can be • True positive (tp): The system proposes a correct attachment; • True negative (tn): The system proposes correctly that there is no attachment; • False positive (fp): The system proposes an incorrect attachment; • False negative (fn): The system proposes incorrectly that there is no attachment.",
        "We refer to both tp and tn as true decisions (td).",
        "The evaluation test measures the ability of the system to make true decisions.",
        "As far as our strategy and the similarity",
        " based approach are concerned, a false negative (fn) is interpreted as the situation in which the system lacks sufficient subcategorization information to make a decision.",
        "By contrast, the baseline always proposes an attachment.",
        "Taking into account these variables, precision is defined as the number of true decisions suggested by the system divided by the number of total suggestions.",
        "That is:",
        "Recall is computed as the number of true decisions suggested by the system divided by all the decisions that have been made (i.e., the total number of ambiguities):",
        "To clarify the evaluation procedure, Table 9 displays the different attachment decisions made on the following test sequence: [vp assistir [pp por o representante [pp de o Estado – Membro]]] (assisted by the delegate of the Member-State) (32) The two correct attachments in (32), proposed by the human annotator, are compared against the attachment decisions proposed by the three methods at stake: heuristic with Boolean corequirements, similarity-based lexical association, and right association, which is the baseline.",
        "Table 9 assesses the two different decisions (A and B) made by each method.",
        "Note that both CR and LAsim take advantage of corequirements.",
        "Indeed, each decision is made after two types of subcategorization information have been considered: the requirements the dependent word must satisfy and the requirements that the headword must satisfy.",
        "Decision A concerns the first candidate attachment, that is, the dependency between [vp assistir] and [pp por o representante].",
        "Let us analyze the behavior of the three methods.",
        "LAsim incorrectly suggests that there is no attachment.",
        "The score of two internal requirements is zero, so the final decision is a false negative: fn.",
        "The system has no information on requirements because on the one hand, the two phrases at stake do not co-occur in the training corpus, and on the other, co-occurrences of phrases with similar words were not attested (and then no generalization was allowed).",
        "CR, by contrast, is endowed with the appropriate requirements to correctly suggest an attachment (tp) between the two phrases, even though they are not attested in the training corpus.",
        "The clustering strategy allowed the system to learn both that biobj_ por_D, assistirÀ requires representante and that biobj_ por_H, representanteÀ requires assistir.",
        "Note that in order to suggest the attachment, it is not necessary that the two complementary requirements be learned.",
        "As has been noted in section 8.2, the learning of only one of them is enough to make the suggestion.",
        "Finally, RA also suggests the correct attachment.",
        "Indeed, the two phrases in (32) are related by right association.",
        "As regards Decision B, all three methods correctly suggest that there is an attachment (tp) between [np o representate] and [pp de o Estado-Membro].",
        "8.3.6 Results.",
        "Table 10 reports the test scores in regard to the precision and recall from the experiments performed.",
        "These scores concern three methods, namely RA, LAsim, and CR, two text corpora (EC and PGR), and three types of phrase sequences.",
        "There are no significant differences between the scores obtained from corpus EC and those from PGR, CR, for instance, obtains very similar F-scores over the two corpora.",
        "However, there are important differences among the precision values associated with the three phrase sequences.",
        "In particular, the scores on sequence vp–np–pp are significatively higher than those on the other sequences, regardless of the method employed.",
        "This is motivated by the fact that in most vp–np– pp sequences (,95%), there is a true attachment between np and vp.",
        "So the precision score achieved by the three methods with regard to this particular attachment decision is very high.",
        "Prepositional-phrase attachments, by contrast, are more ambiguous, which causes sequences vp–pp–pp and np–pp–pp to be less predictable.",
        "Indeed, such sequences have two prepositional phrases involved in the attachment decisions.",
        "Concerning the differences among the three methods, Table 11 averages the results of the three methods over the two corpora and the three phrase sequences.",
        "The total precision of our method (CR) reaches 0.89, that is, four percentage points higher than LAsim.",
        "Note that the precision value of LAsim is not far from the values reached by other approaches to attachment resolution based on the similarity-based lexical association strategy.",
        "For instance, the method described in Grishman and Sterling (1994) scores a precision of ,0.84.",
        "Concerning recall, CR also reaches a level of precision that is four points higher than that achieved by LAsi m. This entails that on the one hand, the ability of CR to learn accurate subcategorization information is higher than that of LAsi m, and on the other hand, the ability of CR to learn from sparse data and to generalize is at least no lower than that of LAsim.",
        "The baseline score informs us that about 76% of attachments are links by proximity.",
        "The remainder (24%) are either long-distance attachments between phrase3 and phrase1, other types of attachments such as adjective complements, and sentence modifiers, or finally, tagger errors.",
        "Note that there is no difference between the baseline method’s precision and recall scores.",
        "Since RA always makes a (true or false) positive decision, there cannot be (true or false) negative decisions.",
        "Variation of recall and precision as a function of corpus size.",
        "Some tagger errors, especially those that appear systematically and regularly in the training corpus, have a negative influence on the precision of both LAsim and CR.",
        "These methods are sensitive to noisy data.",
        "In order to measure recall and precision stability, we ran the clustering process over six partitions (25%, 40%, 55%, 70%, 85%, and 100%) of the EC corpus.",
        "Figure 7 shows that recall improves with corpus size.",
        "However, recall growth is more significant in smaller partitions.",
        "In this particular corpus, recall stability seems to be achieved when the corpus contains three million words.",
        "It follows that in order to improve recall, we would have to use not only a bigger training corpus, but also a more efficient clustering strategy, that is, a strategy that would be able to make additional correct generalizations.",
        "Finally, note that precision neither increases nor decreases with corpus size.",
        "9.",
        "Conclusion and Future Work This article has presented a particular unsupervised strategy to automatically acquire syntactic and semantic requirements.",
        "Our aim was to learn two types of information about a given word: the syntactic positions in which the word appears and the semantic requirements associated with each syntactic position.",
        "Besides that, this strategy also allowed us to discriminate word senses.",
        "The strategy is based on several linguistic assumptions.",
        "First, it was assumed that not only does the syntactic head impose restrictions on its dependent word, but also that the dependent word may select for a specific type of head, a phenomenon referred to as corequirement.",
        "Second, we claimed that similar syntactic positions share the same semantic requirements.",
        "So we measured not similarity between words on the basis of their syntactic distribution, but similarity between syntactic positions on the basis of their word distribution.",
        "It was assumed that the latter kind of similarity conveys more pertinent information on linguistic requirements than the former one.",
        "The learning process allowed us to provide a lexicon with, among other information, both syntactic subcategorization and selection restrictions.",
        "This information was used to constrain attachment heuristics.",
        "In current work, we are using the learned clusters in other NLP applications than attachment resolution.",
        "They are being used to automatically select word senses in context (word sense disambiguation task).",
        "For this purpose, we are performing new",
        " experiments on less domain-specific text corpora, since such corpora increase the number of senses per word.",
        "On the other hand, these clusters turn out to be very useful for checking whether two or more different morphological forms of a word are semantically related.",
        "For instance, if ratification of [_] is similar to ratify [_], we may infer that the verb ratify and the noun ratification are semantically related.",
        "In future work, we aim at extending the lexicon in order to increase the coverage of the parser.",
        "To do this, parsing and learning can be involved in a bootstrapping process.",
        "The dependencies proposed by heuristic CR will be used as input to discover new linguistic requirements.",
        "This new information will enable us to update the lexicon, and then to propose new dependencies.",
        "At each cycle, the lexicon will be provided with new requirements, and thereby the parser coverage will be higher.",
        "The successive ‘‘learning + parsing’’ cycles will stop as no more new information is acquired and no more new dependencies are proposed."
