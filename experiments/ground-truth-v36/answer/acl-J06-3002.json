        "It is important to determine if the PP with the telescope is to be attached as a sister to the noun the man, restricting its interpretation, or if it is to be attached to the verb, thereby indicating the instrument of the main action described by the sentence.",
        "Based on examples of this sort, recent approaches have formalized the problem of disambiguating PP attachments as a binary choice, distinguishing between attachment of a PP to a given verb or to the verb's direct object (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994; Collins and Brooks 1995; Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz 1997; Stetina and Nagao 1997; Ratnaparkhi 1997; Zhao and Lin 2004).",

        "The first PP is a locative PP required by the subcategorization frame of the verb put, whereas in the morning is an optional descriptor of the time at which the action was performed.",
        "Although both are attached to the verb, the two PPs entertain different relationships with the verb â€“ the first is an argument whereas the latter is an adjunct.",
        "Analogous examples could be built for attachments to the noun.",

        "In practice, it is difficult and moderately unnatural to construct examples of four-way ambiguous sentences, sentences that only a good amount of linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge can disambiguate among the noun-attached and verb-attached option, with an argument or adjunct interpretation.",

        "In Section 5, we show how this distinction supports a more refined formulation of the problem of PP attachment.",
        "We compare two methods to reach a four-way classification.",
        "One method is a two-step process that first classifies PPs as attached to the noun or to the verb, and then refines the classification by assigning argument or adjunct status to the disambiguated PPs.",
        "The other method is a one-step process that performs the four-way classification directly.",
        "We find that the latter has better overall performance, confirming our expectation (Hypothesis 2).",

        "Solving the four-way classification task described in the introduction crucially relies on the ability to distinguish arguments from adjuncts, using corpus counts.",
        "The ability to automatically make this distinction is necessary for the correct automatic acquisition of important lexical knowledge, such as subcategorization frames and argument structures, which is used in parsing, generation, machine translation, and information extraction (Srinivas and Joshi 1999; Stede 1998; Dorr 1997; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998).",
        "Yet, few attempts have been made to make this distinction automatically.",
        "The core difficulty in this enterprise is to define the notion of argument precisely enough that it can be used automatically.",
        "There is a consensus in linguistics that arguments and adjuncts are different both with respect to their function in the sentence and in the way they themselves are interpreted (Jackendoff 1977; Marantz 1984; Pollard and Sag 1987; Grimshaw 1990).",
        "With respect to their function, an argument fills a role in the relation described by its associated head, whereas an adjunct predicates a separate property of its associate head or phrase.",
        "With respect to their interpretation, a complement is an argument if its interpretation depends exclusively on the head with which it is associated, whereas it is an adjunct if its interpretation remains relatively constant when associating with different heads (Grimshaw 1990, page 108).",
        "These semantic differences give rise to some observable distributional consequences: for a given interpretation, an adjunct can co-occur with a relatively broad range of heads, whereas arguments are limited to co-occurrence with a (semantically restricted) class of heads (Pollard and Sag 1987, page 136).",
        "Restricting the discussion to PPs, these differences are illustrated in the following examples (PP-argument in bold); see also SchÃ¼tze (1995, page 100).",

        "The sentence tells us only one property of Maria: that she is a student of physics.",

        "(9a) Kim camps/jogs/meditates on Sunday.",
        "(9b) Kim depended/blamed the arson on Sandy.",
        "In example (9a) the PP on Sunday can be construed without any reference to the preceding part of the sentence, and it preserves its meaning even when combining with different heads.",
        "This is, however, not the case for (9b).",
        "Here, the PP can only be properly understood in connection with the rest of the sentence: Sandy is the person on whom someone depends or the person on which the arson is blamed.",
        "These semantic distinctions between arguments and adjuncts surface in observable syntactic differences and can be detected automatically both by using general formal features and by specific lexical semantic features, which group together the arguments of a lexical head.",
        "Unfortunately, the linguistic diagnostics that are used to determine whether a PP is an adjunct or an argument are not accurate in all circumstances, they often partition the set of the examples differently, and they give rise to relative, and not absolute, acceptability judgments.",
        "We propose a methodology that retains both the linguistic insight of the grammatical tests and the ability to effectively combine several gradient, partial diagnostics, typical of automatic induction methods.",

        "We choose six formal diagnostics that can be captured by simple corpus counts: head dependence, optionality, iterativity, ordering, copular paraphrase, and deverbal nominalization.",
        "These diagnostics tap into the deeper semantic properties that distinguish arguments from adjuncts, without requiring that the distinctions be made explicit.",
        "Head Dependence.",
        "Arguments depend on their lexical heads because they form an integral part of the phrase.",
        "Adjuncts do not.",
        "Consequently, PP-arguments can only appear with the specific verbal head by which they are lexically selected, whereas PP-adjuncts can co-occur with a far greater range of different heads than arguments because they are necessary for the correct interpretation of the semantics of the verb, as illustrated in the following example sentences.",

        "We expect adjunct PPs to have higher dispersion than argument PPs.",
        "We use entropy as a measure of the dispersion of the distribution, as indicated in equation (1) (h indicates the noun or verb head to which the PP is attached, X is the random variable whose outcomes are the values of h).",
        "Optionality.",
        "In most cases, PP-arguments are obligatory elements of a given sentence whose absence leads to ungrammaticality, while adjuncts do not contribute to the semantics of any particular verb, hence they are optional, as illustrated in the following examples (PP-argument in bold):",

        "(12b) *John put the book.",
        "(12c) John saw/read the book in the room.",
        "(12d) John saw/read the book.",
        "Sinceargumentsareobligatorycomplementsofaverb,whereasadjunctsarenot,we expect knowledge of a given verb to be more informative with respect to the probability of existence of an argument than of an adjunct.",
        "Thus we expect that the predictive power of a verb with regard to its complements will be greater for arguments than for adjuncts.",
        "The notion of optionality can be captured by the conditional probability of a PP given a particular verbal head, as indicated in equation (2).",
        "Iterativity and Ordering.",
        "Because they receive a semantic role from the selecting verb, arguments of the same type cannot be iterated because verbs can only assign any given type of role once.",
        "Moreover, in English, arguments must be adjacent to the selecting lexical head.",
        "Neither of these two restrictions apply to adjuncts, which can be iterated, and follow arguments in a sequence of PPs.",
        "Consequently, in a sequence of several PPs",
        "1 Notice that this diagnostic can only be interpreted as a statistical tendency, and not as a strict test, because not all arguments are obligatory (but all adjuncts are indeed optional).",
        "The best known descriptive exception to the criterion of optionality is the class of so-called object-drop verbs (Levin 1993).",
        "Here a given verb may tolerate the omission of its argument.",
        "In other words, a transitive verb, such as kiss, can also act like an intransitive.",
        "With respect to optional PPs, it has been argued that instrumentals are arguments (SchÃ¼tze 1995).",
        "While keeping these exceptions in mind, we maintain optionality as a valid diagnostic here.",

        "Copular Paraphrase.",
        "The diagnostic of copular paraphrase is specific to the distinction of NPs arguments and adjuncts, following SchÃ¼tze (1995, page 103).",

        "Arguments cannot be paraphrased by a copular relative clause, as the examples in (15) show, whereas adjuncts can, as is shown in (14):",
        "b. the albums on the shelf c. the people on the payroll (15) a. the destruction of the city b. the weight of the cow c. a member of Parliament a man who was from Paris the albums that were on the shelf the people who were on the payroll *the destruction that was of the city *the weight that was of the cow *a member who was of Parliament",
        "This is because a PP attached to a noun as an argument does not predicate a secondary property of the noun, but it specifies the same property that is indicated by the head.",
        "To be able to use the relative clause construction, there must be two properties that are being predicated of the same entity.",
        "Thus, the probability that a PP is able to be paraphrased, and therefore that it is an adjunct, can be approximated by the probability of its occurrence following a construction headed by a copular verb, be, become, appear, seem, remain (Quirk et al.",

        "More specifically, it is assumed that similar underlying components of meaning give rise to similar subcategorization frames and projections of arguments at the syntactic level.",

        "This method increases the number of available examples, and it is therefore hoped that it will be beneficial to the learning accuracy.",
        "However, as shown in Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz (1997), it rests on the incorrect assumption that the probability of an attachment is independent of the position of the PP to be disambiguated in a sequence of multiple PPs.",

        "â€¢ The testing data STe is the set of tuples in CTe, augmented with the features calculated using CSt.",
        "Note that for the testing data STe to be an independent test set, the testing corpus CTe must be disjoint both from CTr, the training corpus, but also it must be disjoint from CSt, the corpus on which the statistics are calculated.",
        "One possible solution, for example, is to equate the statistics and the training corpus, CSt = CTr, and to assign them Sections 1-22, while CTe = Section 23, thus making the testing corpus CTe be disjoint from both the statistics and the training corpus.",
        "The problem with this solution is that the training data STr is no longer extracted using the same process as the testing data STe, and is therefore not good data from which to generalize.",
        "In particular, all tuples in the training data STr necessarily also occur in the statistics corpus CSt, and therefore no vectors in the training data STr involve data unseen in the statistics corpus.",
        "In contrast, the testing data STe can be expected to include tuples that did not also occur in the statistics corpus, and so the classifier might not generalize to these tuples using the features we calculate.",
        "The solution we adopt is to split Sections 1 to 22 into two disjoint subcorpora.",
        "Because the Penn Treebank is not uniformly annotated across sections, we do not assign whole sections to either the statistical or the training corpus, but instead randomly assign individual sentences to either corpus.",
        "Since data sparseness is a more important issue when calculating the features than it is for training the decision tree, we assigned a larger proportion of the corpus to the statistical subcorpus.",
        "We assigned 25% of Sections 1-22 to CTr and the rest to CSt.",
        "Section 24 is used as a development corpus and Section 23 is the testing corpus CTe.",
        "In this setting, since the statistics, training, and testing corpora are all mutually disjoint, all issues of dependence are resolved, and the training data are representative of the real data we are interested in, so we can expect our classifier to be able to generalize to new data.",

        "For example, the output of a parser might be used to determine the kernel of a sentence â€“ the predicate with its arguments â€“ for further text processing, for translation, or for constructing a lexicon.",

        "We investigate here what features are best predictors of this classification.",

        "As usual, the best combination of features reported below was established using Section 24; all the tests reported here are in Section 23.",
        "To classify PPs into four classes, we have two options: We can construct a single four-class classifier or we can build a sequence of binary classifiers.",
        "The discrimination between noun and verb attachment can be performed first, and then further refined into attachment as argument or adjunct, performing the four-way classification in two steps.",
        "The two-step approach would be the natural way of extending current PP attachment disambiguation methods to the more specific four-way attachment we propose here.",
        "However, based on the previous experiments, which showed a limited amount of dependence between the two tasks, previous work on a similar data set (Merlo 2003), and general wisdom in machine learning, there is reason to believe that it is better to solve the four-way classification problem directly rather than first solving a more general problem and then specializing the classification.",
        "To test these expectations, we performed both kinds of experiments â€“ a direct four-way classification experiment and a two-step classification experiment â€“ to investigate which of the two methods is better.",
        "The direct four-way classification uses the attributes described above to build a single classifier.",
        "For comparability, we created a two-step experimental setup as follows.",

        "Table 12 reports the confusion matrix of the classification that reaches the best performance without the preposition of, which corresponds to the lower right panel of Table 11.",
        "It can be observed that performances are reasonably good for verb adjuncts, and noun arguments and adjuncts, but they are quite poor for the classification of prepositional phrases that are arguments of the verb.",

        "We tested the hypothesis that this result is a side effect of the mapping we have defined from the Penn Treebank label to the label we use in this classifier, arguments or adjuncts.",
        "Recall that untagged PPs have been mapped onto the argument label, but these are highly inconsistent labels, as we have seen in the manual validation of the target attribute in Section 3.",

        "Another observation related to verb arguments can be drawn by comparing the experiments reported in Section 4 to the experiments reported in the current section.",
        "This comparison shows that the low performance in classifying verb arguments does not arise because of an inability to distinguish verb arguments from verb adjuncts.",
        "Rather, it is the interaction of making this distinction and disambiguating the attachment site as a single classification task that creates the problem.",

        "We have also argued that the notion of argument does not help much in disambiguating the attachment site of PPs, indicating that the two notions are not closely correlated and must be established independently.",
        "We have performed a series of four-way classification experiments, where we classify PPs as arguments or adjuncts of a noun, and as arguments or adjuncts of a verb.",
        "We show that the classification performances are reasonably good for verb adjuncts, noun arguments, and noun adjuncts, independent of the learning algorithm.",
        "Classification performances of prepositional phrases that are arguments of the verb are poor if decision trees are used, but are greatly improved by the use of a large margin classifier.",
        "The features that appear to be most effective are lexical classes, thus confirming current linguistic theories that postulate that a verb's argument structure depends on a verb's lexical semantics (Levin 1993).",
        "Future work lies in further investigating the difference between arguments and adjuncts to achieve even finer-grained classifications and to model more precisely the semantic core of a sentence."
