        "Automatic reading comprehension (RC) systems can analyze a given passage and generate/extract answers in response to questions about the passage.",
        "The RC passages are often constrained in their lengths and the target answer sentence usually occurs only once (or very few times).",
        "This differentiates the RC task from other tasks such as open-domain question answering (QA) in the Text Retrieval Conference (Light et al., 2001).",
        "In order to generate/extract a specific precise answer to a given question from a short passage, “deep” linguistic analysis of sentences in a passage is needed.",
        "Previous efforts in RC often use the bag-of-words (BOW) approach as the baseline, which is further augmented with techniques such as shallow syntactic analysis, the use of named entities (NE) and pronoun references.",
        "For example, Hirschman et al.",
        "(1999) have augmented the BOW approach with stemming, NE recognition, NE filtering, semantic class identification and pronoun resolution to achieve 36% HumSent' accuracy in the Reme-dia test set.",
        "Based on these technologies, Riloff and Thelen (2000) improved the HumSent accuracy to 40% by applying a set of heuristic rules that assign handcrafted weights to matching words and NE.",
        "Charniak et al.",
        "(2000) used additional strategies for different question types to achieve 41%.",
        "An example strategy for why questions is that if the first word of the matching sentence is “this,” “that,” “these” or “those,” the system should select the previous sentence as an answer.",
        "Light et al.",
        "(2001) also introduced an approach to estimate the performance upper bound of the BOW approach.",
        "When we apply the same approach to the Remedia test set, we obtained the upper bound of 48.3% HumSent accuracy.",
        "The state-of-art performance reached 42% with answer patterns derived from web (Du et al., 2005).",
        "This paper investigates the possibility of enhancing RC performance by applying “deep” linguistic analysis for every sentence in the passage.",
        "We refer to the use of two types of features, namely word dependencies and grammatical relations, that 1H the system’s answer sentence is identical to the corresponding human marked answer sentence, the question scores one point.",
        "Otherwise, the question scores no point.",
        "HumSent accuracy is the average score across all questions.",
        "are integrated in a maximum entropy framework.",
        "Word dependencies refer to the headword dependencies in lexicalized syntactic parse trees, together with part-of-speech (POS) information.",
        "Grammatical relations (GR) refer to linkages such as subject, object, modifier, etc.",
        "The ME framework has shown its effectiveness in solving QA tasks (It-tycheriah et al., 1994).",
        "In comparison with previous approaches mentioned earlier, the current approach involves richer syntactic information that cover longer-distance relationships."
