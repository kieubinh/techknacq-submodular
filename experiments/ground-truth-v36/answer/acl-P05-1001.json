        "In supervised learning applications, one can often find a large amount of unlabeled data without difficulty, while labeled data are costly to obtain.",
        "Therefore, a natural question is whether we can use unlabeled data to build a more accurate classifier, given the same amount of labeled data.",
        "This problem is often referred to as semi-supervised learning.",
        "Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear.",
        "For example, co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) automatically bootstraps labels, and such labels are not necessarily reliable (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).",
        "A related idea is to use Expectation Maximization (EM) to impute labels.",
        "Although useful under some circumstances, when a relatively large amount of labeled data is available, the procedure often degrades performance (e.g. Merialdo (1994)).",
        "A number of bootstrapping methods have been proposed for NLP tasks (e.g. Yarowsky (1995), Collins and Singer (1999), Riloff and Jones (1999)).",
        "But these typically assume a very small amount of labeled data and have not been shown to improve state-of-the-art performance when a large amount of labeled data is available.",
        "Our goal has been to develop a general learning framework for reliably using unlabeled data to improve performance irrespective of the amount of labeled data available.",
        "It is exactly this important and difficult problem that we tackle here.",
        "This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning framework called structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2004), which seeks to discover shared predictive structures (i.e. what good classifiers for the task are like) through jointly learning multiple classification problems on unlabeled data.",
        "That is, we systematically create thousands of problems (called auxiliary problems) relevant to the target task using unlabeled data, and train classifiers from the automatically generated ‘training data’.",
        "We learn the commonality (or structure) of such many classifiers relevant to the task, and use it to improve performance on the target task.",
        "One example of such auxiliary problems for chunking tasks is to ‘mask’ a word and predict whether it is “people” or not from the context, like language modeling.",
        "Another example is to predict the pre",
        "diction of some classifier trained for the target task.",
        "These auxiliary classifiers can be adequately learned since we have very large amounts of ‘training data’ for them, which we automatically generate from a very large amount of unlabeled data.",
        "The contributions of this paper are twofold.",
        "First, we present a novel robust semi-supervised method based on a new learning model and its application to chunking tasks.",
        "Second, we report higher performance than the previous best results on syntactic chunking (the CoNLL’00 corpus) and named entity chunking (the CoNLL’03 English and German corpora).",
        "In particular, our results are obtained by using unlabeled data as the only additional resource while many of the top systems rely on hand-crafted resources such as large name gazetteers or even rule-based post-processing."
