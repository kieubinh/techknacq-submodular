        "Such utterances pose an obvious problem for natural language processing applications, namely that the intended information (in (1-a)-B a proposition) has to be recovered from the uttered information (here, an NP meaning) with the help of information from the context.",
        "While some systems that automatically resolve such fragments have recently been developed (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002; Fern´andez et al., 2004a), they have the drawback that they require “deep” linguistic processing (full parses, and also information about discourse structure) and hence are not very robust.",
        "We have defined a well-defined subtask of this problem, namely identifying fragments (certain kinds of NSUs, see below) and their antecedents (in multi-party dialogue, in our case), and present a novel machine learning approach to it, which we hypothesise will be useful for tasks such as automatic meeting summarisation.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",

        "As we said in the introduction, the main task we want to tackle is to align (certain kinds of) NSUs and their antecedents.",
        "Now, what characterises this kind of NSU, and what are their antecedents?",
        "In the examples from the introduction, the NSUs can be resolved simply by looking at the previous utterance, which provides the material that is elided in them.",
        "In reality, however, the situation is not that simple, for three reasons: First, it is of course not always the previous utterance that provides this material (as illustrated by (2), where utterance 7 is resolved by utterance 1); in our data the average distance in fact is 2.5 utterances (see below).",

        "3 D: More good intelligence.",
        "4 B: Right.",
        "5 C: Intelligent intelligence.",

        "More [ ... ] intermingling of the agencies, you know.",
        "[ from NSI 20011115 ]",
        "Second, it’s not even necessarily a single utterance that does this–it might very well be a span of utterances, or something that has to be inferred from such spans (parallel to the situation with pronouns, as discussed empirically e.g. in (Strube and M¨uller, 2003)).",
        "(3) shows an example where a new topic is broached by using an NSU.",
        "It is possible to analyse this as an answer to the question under discussion “what shall we organise for the party?”, as (Fern´andez et al., 2004a) would do; a question, however, which is only implicitly posed by the previous discourse, and hence this is an example of an NSU that does not have an overt antecedent.",

        "2 I can bring [...] [ from NSI 20011211]",
        "Lastly, not all NSUs should be analysed as being the result of ellipsis: backchannels for example (like the “Right” in utterance 4 in (2) above) seem to directly fulfil their discourse function without any need for reconstruction.2 To keep matters simple, we concentrate in this paper on NSUs of a certain kind, namely those that a) do not predominantly have a discourse-management function (like for example backchannels), but rather convey messages (i.e., propositions, questions or requests) – this is what distinguishes fragments from other NSUs – and b) have individual utterances as antecedents.",
        "In the terminology of (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2003), fragments of the latter type are resolution-via-identity-fragments, where the elided information can be identified in the context and need not be inferred (as opposed to resolution-via-inference-fragments).",
        "Choosing only this special kind of NSUs poses the question whether this subgroup is distinguished from the general group of fragments by criteria that can be learnt; we will return to this below when we analyse the errors made by the classifier.",
        "We have defined two approaches to this task.",
        "One is to split the task into two sub-tasks: identifying fragments in a corpus, and identifying antecedents for fragments.",
        "These steps are naturally performed sequentially to handle our main task, but they also allow the fragment classification decision to come from another source – a language-model used in an automatic speech recognition system, for example – and to use only the antecedent-classifier.",
        "The other approach is to do both at the same time, i.e. to classify pairs of utterances into those that combine a fragment and its antecedent and those that don’t.",
        "We report the results of our experiments with these tasks below, after describing the data we used."

        "To determine the contribution of all features, we used an iterative process similar to the one described in (Kohavi and John, 1997; Strube and M¨uller, 2003): we start with training a model using a baseline set of features, and then add each remaining feature individually, recording the gain (w.r.t.",
