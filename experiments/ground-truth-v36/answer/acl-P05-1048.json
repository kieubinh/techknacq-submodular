        "translation or information retrieval.",
        "However, WSD is usually performed and evaluated as a standalone task, and to date there have been very few efforts to integrate the learned WSD models into full statistical MT systems.",
        "An energetically debated question at conferences over the past year is whether even the new state-of-the-art word sense disambiguation models actually have anything to offer to full statistical machine translation systems.",
        "Among WSD circles, this can sometimes elicit responses that border on implying that even asking the question is heretical.",
        "In efforts such as Senseval we tend to regard the construction of WSD models as an obviously correct, if necessarily simplified, approach that will eventually lead to essential disambiguation components within larger applications like machine translation.",
        "There is no question that the word sense disambiguation perspective has led to numerous insights in machine translation, even of the statistical variety.",
        "It is often simply an unstated assumption that any full translation system, to achieve full performance, will sooner or later have to incorporate individual WSD components.",
        "However, in some translation architectures and particularly in statistical machine translation (SMT), the translation engine already implicitly factors in many contextual features into lexical choice.",
        "From this standpoint, SMT models can be seen as WSD models in their own right, albeit with several major caveats.",
        "But typical statistical machine translation models only rely on a local context to choose among lexical translation candidates, as discussed in greater detail later.",
        "It is therefore often assumed that dedicated WSD-based lexical choice models, which can incor",
        "porate a wider variety of context features, can make better predictions than the “weaker” models implicit in statistical MT, and that these predictions will help the translation quality.",
        "Nevertheless, this assumption has not been empirically verified, and we should not simply assume that WSD models can contribute more than what the SMT models perform.",
        "It may behoove us to take note of the sobering fact that, perhaps analogously, WSD has yet to be conclusively shown to help information retrieval systems after many years of attempts.",
        "In this work, we propose to directly investigate whether word sense disambiguation – at least as it is typically currently formulated – is useful for statistical machine translation.",

        "To improve accuracy, dedicated WSD models typically employ features that are not limited to the local context, and that include more linguistic information than the surface form of words.",
        "This often requires several stages of preprocessing, such as part-of-speech tagging and/or parsing.",

        "The empirical study presented here argues that we can expect that it will be quite difficult, at the least, to use standard WSD models to obtain significant improvements to statistical MT systems, even when supervised WSD models are used.",
        "This casts significant doubt on a commonly-held, but unproven, assumption to the contrary.",
        "We have presented empirically based analysis of the reasons for this surprising finding.",
        "We have seen that one major factor is that the statistical MT model is sufficiently accurate so that within the training domain, even the state-of-the-art dedicated WSD model is only able to improve on its lexical choice predictions in a relatively small proportion of cases.",
        "A second major factor is that even when the dedicated WSD model makes better predictions, current statistical MT models are unable to exploit this.",
        "Under this interpretation of our results, the dependence on the language model in current SMT architectures is excessive.",
        "One could of course argue that drastically increasing the amount of training data for the language model might overcome the problems from the language model effect.",
        "Given combinatorial problems, however, there is no way at present of telling whether the amount of data needed to achieve this is realistic, particularly for translation across many different domains.",
        "On the other hand, if the SMT architecture cannot make use of WSD predictions, even when they are in fact better than the SMT’s lexical choices, then perhaps some alternative model striking a different balance of adequacy and fluency is called for.",
        "Ultimately, after all, WSD is a method of compensating for sparse data.",
        "Thus it may be that the present inability of WSD models to help improve accuracy of SMT systems stems not from an inherent weakness of dedicated WSD models, but rather from limitations of present-day SMT architectures.",
        "To further test this, our experiments could be tried on other statistical MT models.",
        "For example, the WSD model’s predictions could be employed in a Bracketing ITG translation model such as Wu (1996) or Zens et al.",
        "(2004), or alternatively they could be incorporated as features for rerank-ing in a maximum-entropy SMT model (Och and Ney, 2002), instead of using them to constrain the sentence translation hypotheses as done here.",
        "However, the preceding discussion argues that it is doubtful that this would produce significantly different results, since the inherent problem from the “language model effect” would largely remain, causing sentence translations that include the WSD’s preferred lexical choices to be discounted.",
        "For similar reasons, we suspect our findings may also hold even for more sophisticated statistical MT models that rely heavily on n-gram language models.",
        "A more grammatically structured statistical MT model that less n-gram oriented, such as the ITG based “grammatical channel” translation model (Wu and Wong, 1998), might make more effective use of the WSD model’s predictions."
