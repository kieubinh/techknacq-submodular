        "Recent research on statistical machine translation (SMT) has lead to the development of phrase-based systems (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models (Brown et al., 1993), by allowing multi-word units (“phrases”) in one language to be translated directly into phrases in another language.",
        "A number of empirical evaluations have suggested that phrase-based systems currently represent the state–of–the–art in statistical machine translation.",
        "In spite of their success, a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information.",
        "It appears likely that syntactic information will be crucial in accurately modeling many phenomena during translation, for example systematic differences between the word order of different languages.",
        "For this reason there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Al-shawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)).",
        "In this paper we describe an approach for the use of syntactic information within phrase-based SMT systems.",
        "The approach constitutes a simple, direct method for the incorporation of syntactic information in a phrase–based system, which we will show leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy.",
        "The first step of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated.",
        "The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the resulting parse tree, effectively reordering the surface string on the source language side of the translation system.",
        "The goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is closer to the target language word-order than the original string.",
        "Finally, we apply a phrase-based system to the reordered string to give a translation into the target language.",
        "We describe experiments involving machine translation from German to English.",
        "As an illustrative example of our method, consider the following German sentence, together with a “translation” into English that follows the original word order: Original sentence: Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden An-merkungen aushaendigen, damit Sie das eventuell bei der Abstimmung uebernehmen koennen.",
        "The German word order in this case is substantially different from the word order that would be seen in English.",
        "As we will show later in this paper, translations of sentences of this type pose difficulties for phrase-based systems.",
        "In our approach we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German sentence to give the following word order, which is much closer to the target English word order (words which have been “moved” are underlined):",
        "We applied our approach to translation from German to English in the Europarl corpus.",
        "Source language sentences are reordered in test data, and also in training data that is used by the underlying phrase-based system.",
        "Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system."

        "Phrase-based models generalize the original IBM models by allowing multiple words in one language to correspond to multiple words in another language.",
        "For example, we might have a translation entry specifying that I will in English is a likely translation for Ich werde in German.",
        "In this paper we use the phrase-based system of (Koehn et al., 2003) as our underlying model.",
        "This approach first uses the original IBM models to derive word-to-word alignments in the corpus of example translations.",
        "Heuristics are then used to grow these alignments to encompass phrase-to-phrase pairs.",
        "The end result of the training process is a lexicon of phrase-to-phrase pairs, with associated costs or probabilities.",
        "In translation with the system, a beam search method with left-to-right search is used to find a high scoring translation for an input sentence.",
        "At each stage of the search, one or more English words are added to the hypothesized string, and one or more consecutive German words are “absorbed” (i.e., marked as having already been translated – note that each word is absorbed at most once).",
        "Each step of this kind has a number of costs: for example, the log probability of the phrase-to-phrase correspondance involved, the log probability from a language model, and some “distortion” score indicating how likely it is for the proposed words in the English string to be aligned to the corresponding position in the German string."

        "we have reached a state where “Ich” and “werde” have been translated into “I will” in English.",
        "A potential decoding decision at this point is to add the phrase “pass on” to the English hypothesis, at the same time absorbing “aushaendigen” from the German string.",
        "The cost of this decoding step will involve a number of factors, including a cost of skipping over a phrase of length 4 (i.e., Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen) in the German string.",
        "The ability to penalise “skips” of this type, and the potential to model multi-word phrases, are essentially the main strategies that the phrase-based system is able to employ when modeling differing word-order across different languages.",
        "In practice, when training the parameters of an SMT system, for example using the discriminative methods of (Och, 2003), the cost for skips of this kind is typically set to a very high value.",
        "In experiments with the system of (Koehn et al., 2003) we have found that in practice a large number of complete translations are completely monotonic (i.e., have 0 skips), suggesting that the system has difficulty learning exactly what points in the translation should allow reordering.",
        "In summary, phrase-based systems have relatively limited potential to model word-order differences between different languages.",
        "The reordering stage described in this paper attempts to modify the source language (e.g., German) in such a way that its word order is very similar to that seen in the target language (e.g., English).",
        "In an ideal approach, the resulting translation problem that is passed on to the phrase-based system will be solvable using a completely monotonic translation, without any skips, and without requiring extremely long phrases to be translated (for example a phrasal translation corresponding to Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen).",
        "Note than an additional benefit of the reordering phase is that it may bring together groups of words in German which have a natural correspondance to phrases in English, but were unseen or rare in the original German text.",
        "For example, in the previous example, we might derive a correspondance between werde aushaendigen and will pass on that was not possible before reordering.",

        "We have demonstrated that adding knowledge about syntactic structure can significantly improve the performance of an existing state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.",

        "We pose clause restructuring as a problem for machine translation.",
        "Our current approach is based on hand-crafted rules, which are based on our linguistic knowledge of how German and English syntax differs.",
        "In the future we may investigate data-driven approaches, in an effort to learn reordering models automatically.",
        "While our experiments are on German, other languages have word orders that are very different from English, so we believe our methods will be generally applicable."
