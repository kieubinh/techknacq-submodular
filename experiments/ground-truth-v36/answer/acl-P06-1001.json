        "The ultimate goal of preprocessing is to improve the quality of the SMT output by addressing issues such as sparsity in training data.",
        "We refer to a specific kind of preprocessing as a “scheme” and differentiate it from the “technique” used to obtain it.",
        "In a previous publication, we presented results describing six preprocessing schemes for Arabic (Habash and Sadat, 2006).",
        "These schemes were evaluated against three different techniques that vary in linguistic complexity; and across a learning curve of training sizes.",

        "The anecdotal intuition in the field is that reduction of word sparsity often improves translation quality.",
        "This reduction can be achieved by increasing training data or via morphologically driven preprocessing (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).",
        "Recent publications on the effect of morphology on SMT quality focused on morphologically rich languages such as German (Nießen and Ney, 2004); Spanish, Catalan, and Serbian (Popovi´c",
        "and Ney, 2004); and Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).",
        "They all studied the effects of various kinds of tokenization, lemmatization and POS tagging and show a positive effect on SMT quality.",
        "Specifically considering Arabic, Lee (2004) investigated the use of automatic alignment of POS tagged English and affix-stem segmented Arabic to determine appropriate tokenizations.",
        "Her results show that morphological preprocessing helps, but only for the smaller corpora.",
        "As size increases, the benefits diminish.",
        "Our results are comparable to hers in terms of BLEU score and consistent in terms of conclusions.",
        "Other research on preprocessing Arabic suggests that minimal preprocessing, such as splitting off the conjunction +j w+ ’and’, produces best results with very large training data (Och, 2005).",
        "System combination for MT has also been investigated by different researchers.",
        "Approaches to combination generally either select one of the hypotheses produced by the different systems combined (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al., 2005; Lee, 2005) or combine lattices/n-best lists from the different systems with different degrees of synthesis or mixing (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006).",
        "These different approaches use various translation and language models in addition to other models such as word matching, sentence and document alignment, system translation confidence, phrase translation lexicons, etc.",
        "We extend on previous work by experimenting with a wider range of preprocessing schemes for Arabic and exploring their combination to produce better results."

      "heading": "3 Arabic Linguistic Issues",
      "text": [
        "Arabic is a morphologically complex language with a large set of morphological features1.",
        "These features are realized using both concatenative morphology (affixes and stems) and templatic morphology (root and patterns).",
        "There is a variety of morphological and phonological adjustments that appear in word orthography and interact with orthographic variations.",
        "Next we discuss a subset of these issues that are necessary background for the later sections.",
        "We do not address",
        "derivational morphology (such as using roots as tokens) in this paper.",
        "✁ Orthographic Ambiguity: The form of certain letters in Arabic script allows suboptimal orthographic variants of the same word to coexist in the same text.",
        "For example, variants of Hamzated Alif, ✂ ✄ or ✆ ✝ are often written without their Hamza (✟): ✠A.",
        "These variant spellings increase the ambiguity of words.",
        "The Arabic script employs diacritics for representing short vowels and doubled consonants.",
        "These diacritics are almost always absent in running text, which increases word ambiguity.",
        "We assume all of the text we are using is undiacritized.",
        "✁ Clitics: Arabic has a set of attachable clitics to be distinguished from inflectional features such as gender, number, person, voice, aspect, etc.",
        "These clitics are written attached to the word and thus increase the ambiguity of alternative readings.",
        "We can classify three degrees of cliticization that are applicable to a word base in a strict order:",
        "At the deepest level, the BASE can have a definite article (+✡✠ Al+ ‘the’) or a member of the class of pronominal enclitics, +PRON, (e.g. ☞✌+ +hm ‘their/them’).",
        "Pronominal enclitics can attach to nouns (as possessives) or verbs and prepositions (as objects).",
        "The definite article doesn’t apply to verbs or prepositions.",
        "+PRON and Al+ cannot coexist on nouns.",
        "Next comes the class of particle proclitics (PART+): +✡ l+ ‘to/for’, +✎b+ ‘by/with’, +✏ k+ ‘as/such’ and +✑ s+ ‘will/future’.",
        "b+ and k+ are only nominal; s+ is only verbal and l+ applies to both nouns and verbs.",
        "At the shallowest level of attachment we find the conjunctions (CONJ+) +j w+ ‘and’ and +✒ f+ ‘so’.",
        "They can attach to everything.",
        "✁ Adjustment Rules: Morphological features that are realized concatenatively (as opposed to templatically) are not always simply concatenated to a word base.",
        "Additional morphological, phonological and orthographic rules are applied to the word.",
        "An example of a morphological rule is the feminine morpheme, ✓ +p (ta marbuta), which can only be word final.",
        "In medial position, it is turned into ✔ t. For example,☞✌+✕✖✘✚✜ mktbp+hm appears as☞✢✘✖✘✚✜ mktbthm ‘their library’.",
        "An example of an orthographic rule is the deletion of the Alif (✠) of the definite article +✡✠ Al+ in nouns when preceded by the preposition +✡ l+ ‘to/for’ but not with any other prepositional proclitic.",
        "✁ Templatic Inflections: Some of the inflectional features in Arabic words are realized templatically by applying a different pattern to the Arabic root.",
        "As a result, extracting the lexeme (or lemma) of an Arabic word is not always an easy task and often requires the use of a morphological analyzer.",
        "One common example in Arabic nouns is Broken Plurals.",
        "For example, one of the plural forms of the Arabic word kAtb ‘writer’ is �� ktbp ‘writers’.",
        "An alternative non-broken plural (concatenatively derived) is uy kAtbwn ‘writers’.",
        "These phenomena highlight two issues related to the task at hand (preprocessing): First, ambiguity in Arabic words is an important issue to address.",
        "To determine whether a clitic or feature should be split off or abstracted off requires that we determine that said feature is indeed present in the word we are considering in context – not just that it is possible given an analyzer.",
        "Secondly, once a specific analysis is determined, the process of splitting off or abstracting off a feature must be clear on what the form of the resulting word should be.",
        "In principle, we would like to have whatever adjustments now made irrelevant (because of the missing feature) to be removed.",
        "This ensures reduced sparsity and reduced unnec-� essary ambiguity.",
        "For example, the word ☞ ✢ ✘ ✖ ✘ ktbthm has two possible readings (among others) as ‘their writers’ or ‘I wrote them’.",
        "Splitting off the pronominal enclitic ☞✌+ +hm without normalizing the ✔ t to ✓ p in the nominal reading leads the coexistence of two forms of the noun �� ktbp and .",
        "::,5 ktbt.",
        "This increased sparsity is only ✖ ✘ worsened by the fact that the second form is also the verbal form (thus increased ambiguity)."

        "Thus, we are forced to designate a particular scheme as privileged when the system is carrying out decoding.",
        "The privileged preprocessing scheme will be the one applied to the source sentence.",
        "Obviously, words and phrases in the preprocessed source sentence will more frequently match the phrases in the privileged phrase table than in the non-privileged ones.",

        "The best-performing system in this column has as its privileged preprocessing scheme TB.",
        "The decoder for this system uses TB to preprocess the source sentence, but has access to a log-linear combination of information from all 11 preprocessing schemes.",
        "The final column of Table 5 shows the results of rescoring the concatenation of the 1-best outputs from each of the combined systems.",
        "The rescoring features used are the same as those used for the ROC experiments.",
        "For rescoring, a privileged preprocessing scheme is chosen and applied to the development corpus.",
        "We chose TB for this (since it yielded the best result when chosen to be privileged at the decoding stage).",
        "Applied to 11 schemes, this yields the best result so far: 38.67 BLEU.",
        "Combining the 4 best preprocessing schemes (D2, TB, D1, WA) yielded a lower BLEU score (37.73).",
        "These results show that combining phrase tables from different schemes have a positive effect on MT performance."
