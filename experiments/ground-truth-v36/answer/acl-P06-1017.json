        "Relation extraction is the task of detecting and classifying relationships between two entities from text.",
        "Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004).",
        "Supervised methods for relation extraction perform well on the ACE Data, but they require a large amount of manually labeled relation instances.",
        "Unsupervised methods do not need the definition of relation types and manually labeled data, but they cannot detect relations between entity pairs and its result cannot be directly used in many NLP tasks since there is no relation type label attached to each instance in clustering result.",
        "Considering both the availability of a large amount of untagged corpora and direct usage of extracted relations, semi-supervised learning methods has received great attention.",
        "DIPRE (Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Expansion) (Brin, 1998) is a bootstrapping-based system that used a pattern matching system as classifier to exploit the duality between sets of patterns and relations.",
        "Snowball (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) is another system that used bootstrapping techniques for extracting relations from unstructured text.",
        "Snowball shares much in common with DIPRE, including the employment of the bootstrapping framework as well as the use of pattern matching to extract new candidate relations.",
        "The third system approaches relation classification problem with bootstrapping on top of SVM, proposed by Zhang (2004).",
        "This system focuses on the ACE subproblem, RDC, and extracts various lexical and syntactic features for the classification task.",
        "However, Zhang (2004)’s method doesn’t actually “detect” re-laitons but only performs relation classification between two entities given that they are known to be related.",
        "Bootstrapping works by iteratively classifying unlabeled examples and adding confidently classified examples into labeled data using a model learned from augmented labeled data in previous iteration.",
        "It",
        "can be found that the affinity information among unlabeled examples is not fully explored in this bootstrapping process.",
        "Recently a promising family of semi-supervised learning algorithm is introduced, which can effectively combine unlabeled data with labeled data in learning process by exploiting manifold structure (cluster structure) in data (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Blum et al., 2004; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003).",
        "These graph-based semi-supervised methods usually define a graph where the nodes represent labeled and unlabeled examples in a dataset, and edges (may be weighted) reflect the similarity of examples.",
        "Then one wants a labeling function to satisfy two constraints at the same time: 1) it should be close to the given labels on the labeled nodes, and 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph.",
        "This can be expressed in a regularization framework where the first term is a loss function, and the second term is a regu-larizer.",
        "These methods differ from traditional semi-supervised learning methods in that they use graph structure to smooth the labeling function.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done on using graph based semi-supervised learning algorithms for relation extraction.",
        "Here we investigate a label propagation algorithm (LP) (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) for relation extraction task.",
        "This algorithm works by representing labeled and unlabeled examples as vertices in a connected graph, then propagating the label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges iteratively, finally inferring the labels of unlabeled examples after the propagation process converges.",
        "In this paper we focus on the ACE RDC task1.",

        "Section 3 formulates relation extraction problem in the context of semi-supervised learning and describes our proposed approach.",
        "Then we provide experimental results of our proposed method and compare with a popular supervised learning algorithm (SVM) and bootstrapping algorithm in Section 4.",

        "The problem of relation extraction is to assign an appropriate relation type to an occurrence of two entity pairs in a given context.",

        "where eland e2 denote the entity mentions, and Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before, between and after the entity mention pairs.",
        "In this paper, we set the mid-context window as the words between the two entity mentions and the pre and post-context as up to two words before and after the corresponding entity mention.",
        "Let X = {xi}z 1 be a set of contexts of occurrences of all the entity mention pairs, where xi represents the contexts of the i-th occurrence, and n is the total number of occurrences.",
        "The first l examples (or contexts) are labeled as yg ( yg E {rj }R1, rj denotes relation type and R is the total number of relation types).",
        "The remaining u(u = n – l) examples are unlabeled.",
        "Intuitively, if two occurrences of entity mention pairs have the similarity context, they tend to hold the same relation type.",
        "Based on the assumption, we define a graph where the vertices represent the contexts of labeled and unlabeled occurrences of entity mention pairs, and the edge between any two vertices xi and xj is weighted so that the closer the vertices in some distance measure, the larger the weight associated with this edge.",
        "Hence, the weights are defined as follows:",
        "where sib is the similarity between xi and xj calculated by some similarity measures, e.g., cosine similarity, and a is used to scale the weights.",

        "We define soft label as a vector that is a probabilistic distribution over all the classes.",
        "In the label propagation process, the soft label of each initial labeled example is clamped in each iteration to replenish label sources from these labeled data.",
        "Thus the labeled data act like sources to push out labels through unlabeled data.",
        "With this push from labeled examples, the class boundaries will be pushed through edges with large weights and settle in gaps along edges with small weights.",
        "Hopefully, the values of Wij across different classes would be as small as possible and the values of Wij within the same class would be as large as possible.",
        "This will make label propagation to stay within the same class.",

        "where Tij is the probability to jump from vertex xj to vertex xi.",
        "We define a n x R label matrix Y, where Y j representing the probabilities of vertex yi to have the label rj.",

        "• Set the iteration index t = 0; • Let Y° be the initial soft labels attached to each vertex, where Y° – 1 if yi is label rj and 0 otherwise.",
        "• Let YL be the top l rows of Yo and YU be the remaining u rows.",
        "YL is consistent with the labeling in labeled data and the initialization of Yu can be arbitrary.",

        "Step 3 : Clamp the labeled data, that is, replace the top l row of Yt+1 with YL .",
        "Step 4 : Repeat from step 2 until Y converges.",
        "Step 5 : Assign xh (l + 1 < h < n) with a label: yh = argmaxjYhj.",
        " – – The above algorithm can ensure that the labeled data YL never changes since it is clamped in Step 3.",
