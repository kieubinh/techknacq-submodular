        "Future research will include making a thorough investigation into the relation between dependency type and the type of clause boundary unit.",
        "After that, we plan to investigate techniques for identifying the dependency relations over clause boundaries.",
        "Furthermore, as the experiment described in this paper has shown the effectiveness of our technique for dependency parsing of long sentences in spoken monologues, so our technique can be expected to be effective in written language also.",
        "Therefore, we want to examine the effectiveness by conducting the parsing experiment of long sentences in written language such as newspaper articles."
