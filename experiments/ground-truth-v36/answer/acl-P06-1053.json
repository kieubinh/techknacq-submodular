        "Over the last two decades, the psycholinguistic literature has provided a wealth of experimental evidence for syntactic priming, i.e., the tendency to repeat syntactic structures (e.g., Bock, 1986).",
        "Most work on syntactic priming has been concerned with sentence production; however, recent studies also demonstrate a preference for structural repetition in human parsing.",
        "This includes the so-called parallelism effect demonstrated by Frazier et al.",
        "(2000): speakers processes coordinated structures more quickly when the second conjunct repeats the syntactic structure of the first conjunct.",
        "Two alternative accounts of the parallelism effect have been proposed.",
        "Dubey et al.",
        "(2005) argue that the effect is simply an instance of a pervasive syntactic priming mechanism in human parsing.",
        "They provide evidence from a series of corpus studies which show that parallelism is not limited to co-ordination, but occurs in a wide range of syntactic structures, both within and between sentences, as predicted if a general priming mechanism is assumed.",
        "(They also show this effect is stronger in coordinate structures, which could explain Frazier et al.’s (2000) results.)",
        "Frazier and Clifton (2001) propose an alternative account of the parallelism effect in terms of a copying mechanism.",
        "Unlike priming, this mechanism is highly specialized and only applies to coordinate structures: if the second conjunct is encountered, then instead of building new structure, the language processor simply copies the structure of the first conjunct; this explains why a speedup is observed if the two conjuncts are parallel.",
        "If the copying account is correct, then we would expect parallelism effects to be restricted to coordinate structures and not to apply in other contexts.",
        "This paper presents a parsing model which implements both the priming mechanism and the copying mechanism, making it possible to compare their predictions on human reading time data.",
        "Our model also simulates other important aspects of human parsing: (i) it is broad-coverage, i.e., it yields accurate parses for unrestricted input, and (ii) it processes sentences incrementally, i.e., on a word-by-word basis.",
        "This general modeling framework builds on probabilistic accounts of human parsing as proposed by Jurafsky (1996) and Crocker and Brants (2000).",
        "A priming-based parser is also interesting from an engineering point of view.",
        "To avoid sparse data problems, probabilistic parsing models make strong independence assumptions; in particular, they generally assume that sentences are independent of each other, in spite of corpus evidence for structural repetition between sentences.",
        "We therefore expect a parsing model that includes structural repetition to provide a better fit with real corpus data, resulting in better parsing performance.",
        "A simple and principled approach to handling structure reuse would be to use adaptation probabilities for probabilistic grammar rules (Church, 2000), analogous to cache probabilities used in caching language models (Kuhn and de Mori, 1990).",
        "This is the approach we will pursue in this paper.",
        "Dubey et al.",
        "(2005) present a corpus study that demonstrates the existence of parallelism in corpus data.",
        "This is an important precondition for understanding the parallelism effect; however, they",
        "do not develop a parsing model that accounts for the effect, which means they are unable to evaluate their claims against experimental data.",
        "The present paper overcomes this limitation.",
        "In Section 2, we present a formalization of the priming and copying models of parallelism and integrate them into an incremental probabilistic parser.",
        "In Section 3, we evaluate this parser against reading time data taken from Frazier et al.’s (2000) parallelism experiments.",
        "In Section 4, we test the engineering aspects of our model by demonstrating that a small increase in parsing accuracy can be obtained with a parallelism-based model.",
        "Section 5 provides an analysis of the performance of our model, focusing on the role of the distance between prime and target."

        "One way to proceed would be to assign a probability of pident when structures match, and (1 – pident) PPCFG(t2) when structures do not match.",

        "The main contribution of this paper has been to show that an incremental parser can simulate syntactic priming effects in human parsing by incorporating probability models that take account of previous rule use.",
        "Frazier et al.",
        "(2000) argued that the best account of their observed parallelism advantage was a model in which structure is copied from one coordinate sister to another.",
        "Here, we explored a probabilistic variant of the copy mechanism, along with two more general models based on within and between-sentence priming.",
        "Although the copy mechanism provided the strongest parallelism effect in simulating the human reading time data, the effect was also successfully simulated by a general within-sentence priming model.",
        "On the basis of simplicity, we therefore argue that it is preferable to assume a simpler and more general mechanism, and that the copy mechanism is not needed.",
        "This conclusion is strengthened when we turn to consider the performance of the parser on the standard Penn Treebank test set: the Within model showed a small increase in F-score over the PCFG baseline, while the copy model showed no such advantage.5 All the models we proposed offer a broad-coverage account of human parsing, not just a limited model on a hand-selected set of examples, such as the models proposed by Jurafsky (1996) and Hale (2001) (but see Crocker and Brants 2000).",
        "A further contribution of the present paper has been to develop a methodology for analyzing the (re-)use of syntactic rules over time in a corpus.",
        "In particular, we have defined an algorithm for randomizing the constituents of a treebank, yielding a baseline estimate of chance repetition.",
        "In the research reported in this paper, we have adopted a very simple model based on an unlexicalized PCFG.",
        "In the future, we intend to explore the consequences of introducing lexicalization into the parser.",
        "This is particularly interesting from the point of view of psycholinguistic modeling, because there are well known interactions between lexical repetition and syntactic priming, which require lexicalization for a proper treatment.",
        "Future work will also involve the use of smoothing to increase the benefit of priming for parsing accuracy.",
        "The investigations reported",
        "in Section 5 provide a basis for estimating the smoothing parameters."
