        "The rapid increase of information in the biomedical domain has emphasized the need for automated information extraction techniques.",
        "In this paper we focus on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, which is the first step in tackling more complex tasks such as relation extraction and knowledge mining.",
        "Biomedical NER (Bio-NER) tasks are, in general, more difficult than ones in the news domain.",
        "For example, the best F-score in the shared task of Bio-NER in COLING 2004 JNLPBA (Kim et al., 2004) was 72.55% (Zhou and Su, 2004)1, whereas the best performance at MUC-6, in which systems tried to identify general named entities such as person or organization names, was an accuracy of 95% (Sundheim, 1995).",
        "Many of the previous studies of Bio-NER tasks have been based on machine learning techniques including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1997), the dictionary HMM model (Kou et al., 2005) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) (Finkel et al., 2004).",
        "Among these methods, conditional random fields (CRFs) (Laf-ferty et al., 2001) have achieved good results (Kim et al., 2005; Settles, 2004), presumably because they are free from the so-called label bias problem by using a global normalization.",
        "Sarawagi and Cohen (2004) have recently introduced semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs).",
        "They are defined on semi-Markov chains and attach labels to the subsequences of a sentence, rather than to the tokens2.",
        "The semi-Markov formulation allows one to easily construct entity-level features.",
        "Since the features can capture all the characteristics of a subsequence, we can use, for example, a dictionary feature which measures the similarity between a candidate segment and the closest element in the dictionary.",
        "Kou et al.",
        "(2005) have recently showed that semi-CRFs perform better than CRFs in the task of recognition of protein entities.",
        "The main difficulty of applying semi-CRFs to Bio-NER lies in the computational cost at training",
        "Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 465–472, Sydney, July 2006. c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "because the number of named entity classes tends to be large, and the training data typically contain many long entities, which makes it difficult to enumerate all the entity candidates in training.",
        "Table 1 shows the length distribution of entities in the training set of the shared task in 2004 JNLPBA.",
        "Formally, the computational cost of training semi-CRFs is O(KLN), where L is the upper bound length of entities, N is the length of sentence and K is the size of label set.",
        "And that of training in first order semi-CRFs is O(K2LN).",
        "The increase of the cost is used to transfer non-adjacent entity information.",
        "To improve the scalability of semi-CRFs, we propose two techniques: the first is to introduce a filtering process that significantly reduces the number of candidate entities by using a “lightweight” classifier, and the second is to use feature forest (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002), with which we pack the feature equivalent states.",
        "These enable us to construct semi-CRF models for the tasks where entity names may be long and many class-labels exist at the same time.",
        "We also present an extended version of semi-CRFs in which we can make use of information about a preceding named entity in defining features within the framework of first order semi-CRFs.",
        "Since the preceding entity is not necessarily adjacent to the current entity, we achieve this by embedding the information on preceding labels for named entities into the labels for non-named entities."

        "information about the previous state (Finkel et al., 2005).",

        "It would be useful if the model could utilize the (non-adjacent) information about “Sp1” being “protein” to classify “CP1” as “protein”.",
        "On the other hand, information about adjacent labels does not necessarily provide useful information because, in many cases, the previous label of a named entity is “O”, which indicates a non-named entity.",
        "For 98.0% of the named entities in the training data of the shared task in the 2004 JNLPBA, the label of the preceding entity was “O”.",
        "In order to incorporate such non-local information into semi-CRFs, we take a simple approach.",
        "We divide the label of “O” into “O-protein” and “O” so that they convey the information on the preceding named entity.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of this conversion, in which the two labels for the third and fourth states are converted from “O” to “O-protein”.",
        "When we define the features for the fifth state, we can use the information on the preceding entity “protein” by looking at the fourth state.",

        "This idea is originally proposed in (Peshkin and Pfeffer, 2003).",

        "In previous work, such non-local information has usually been employed at a post-processing stage.",
        "This is because the use of long distance dependency violates the locality of the model and prevents us from using dynamic programming techniques in training and inference.",
        "Skip-CRFs (Sutton and McCallum, 2004) are a direct implementation of long distance effects to the model.",
