        "The potential impact of structured fact repositories containing billions of relations among named entities on Web search is enormous.",

        "The preparation of exhaustive lists of handwritten extraction rules is impractical given the need for domain-independent extraction of many types of facts from unstructured text.",
        "In contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as Question Answering (Lita and Carbonell, 2004; Fleischman et al., 2003).",
        "In the context of fact extraction, the resulting iterative acquisition *Work done during internships at Google Inc. framework starts from a small set of seed facts, finds contextual patterns that extract the seed facts from the underlying text collection, identifies a larger set of candidate facts that are extracted by the patterns, and adds the best candidate facts to the previous seed set."

        "Figure 1 describes an architecture geared towards large-scale fact extraction.",
        "The architecture is similar to other instances of bootstrapping for information extraction.",
        "The main processing stages are the acquisition of contextual extraction patterns given the seed facts, acquisition of candidate facts given the extraction patterns, scoring and ranking of the patterns, and scoring and ranking of the candidate facts, a subset of which is added to the seed set of the next round.",
        "Within the existing iterative acquisition framework, our first contribution is a method for automatically generating generalized contextual extraction patterns, based on dynamically-computed classes of similar words.",
        "Traditionally, the acquisition of contextual extraction patterns requires hundreds or thousands of consecutive iterations over the entire text collection (Lita and Carbonell, 2004), often using relatively expensive or restrictive tools such as shallow syntactic parsers (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002) or named entity recognizers (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000).",
        "Comparatively, generalized extraction patterns achieve exponentially higher coverage in early iterations.",
        "The extraction of large sets of candidate facts opens the possibility of fast-growth iterative extraction, as opposed to the de-facto strategy of conservatively growing the seed set by as few as five items (Thelen and Riloff, 2002) after each iteration.",
        "The second contribution of the paper is a method for domain-independent validation and ranking of candidate facts, based on a similarity measure of each candidate fact relative to the set of seed facts.",
        "Whereas previous studies assume clean text collections such as news corpora (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Hasegawa et al., 2004), the validation is essential for low-quality sets of candidate facts collected from noisy Web documents.",
        "Without it, the addition of spurious candidate facts to the seed set would result in a quick divergence of the iterative acquisition towards irrelevant information (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000).",
        "Furthermore, the finer-grained ranking induced by similarities is necessary in fast-growth iterative acquisition, whereas previously proposed ranking criteria (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Lita and Carbonell, 2004) are implicitly designed for slow growth of the seed set."

        "The recall scores over nGold take into consideration only the set of person names from the gold standard with some extracted year(s).",
        "More precisely, given that some years were extracted for a person name, it verifies whether they include the year specified in the gold standard for that person name.",
        "Comparatively, the recall score denoted AllGold is com",
        "puted over the entire set of names from the gold standard.",
        "For the GoldA set, the size of the nGold set of person names changes little when the facts are extracted from chunk W1 vs. W2 vs. W3.",
        "The recall scores over nGold exhibit little variation from one Web chunk to another, whereas the AllGold score is slightly higher on the W3 chunk, probably due to a higher number of documents that are relevant to the extraction task.",
        "When the facts are extracted from a combination of two or three of the available Web chunks, the recall scores computed over AllGold are significantly higher as the size of the nGold set increases.",
        "In comparison, the recall scores over the growing nGold set increases slightly with larger evaluation sets.",
        "The highest value of the recall score for GoldA is 89.9% over the nGold set, and 70.7% over AllGold.",
        "The smaller size of the second gold standard set, GoldT, explains the higher variation of the values shown in the lower portion of Table 6."

        "The combination of generalized extraction patterns and similarity-driven ranking criteria results in a fast-growth iterative approach for large-scale fact extraction.",
        "From 10 Person-BornIn-Year facts and no additional knowledge, a set of one million facts of the same type is extracted from a collection of 100 million Web documents of arbitrary quality, with a precision around 90%.",
        "This corresponds to a growth ratio of 100,000:1 between the size of the extracted set of facts and the size of the initial set of seed facts.",
        "To our knowledge, the growth ratio and the number of extracted facts are several orders of magnitude higher than in any of the previous studies on fact extraction based on either handwritten extraction rules (Cafarella et al., 2005), or bootstrapping for relation and information extraction (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Lita and Carbonell, 2004).",
        "The next research steps converge towards the automatic construction of a searchable repository containing billions of facts regarding people."
