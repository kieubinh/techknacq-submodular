        "Conflicts arise when two groups of people take very different perspectives on political, socio-economical, or cultural issues.",
        "For example, here are the answers that two presidential candidates, John Kerry and George Bush, gave during the third presidential debate in 2004 in response to a question on abortion:",
        "(1) Kerry: What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn’t share that article of faith.",
        "I believe that choice is a woman’s choice.",
        "It’s between a woman, God and her doctor.",
        "And that’s why I support that.",
        "(2) Bush: I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.",
        "I understand there’s great dif",
        "ferences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.",
        "After reading the above transcripts some readers may conclude that one takes a “pro-choice” perspective while the other takes a “pro-life” perspective, the two dominant perspectives in the abortion controversy.",
        "Perspectives, however, are not always manifested when two pieces of text together are put together.",
        "For example, the following two sentences are from Reuters newswire:",
        "(3) Gold output in the northeast China province of Heilongjiang rose 22.7 pct in 1986 from 1985’s level, the New China News Agency said.",
        "(4) Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.",
        "A reader would not from this pair of examples perceive as strongly contrasting perspectives as the Kerry-Bush answers.",
        "Instead, as the Reuters annotators did, one would label Example 3 as “gold” and Example 4 as “acquisition”, that is, as two topics instead of two perspectives.",
        "Why does the contrast between Example 1 and Example 2 convey different perspectives, but the contrast between Example 3 and Example 4 result in different topics?",
        "How can we define the impalpable “different perspectives” anyway?",
        "The definition of “perspective” in the dictionary is “subjective evaluation of relative significance,”1 but can we have a computable definition to test the existence of different perspectives?",

        "Such a computational definition can be used to detect the emergence of contrasting perspectives.",
        "Media and political analysts regularly monitor broadcast news, magazines, newspapers, and blogs to see if there are public opinion splitting.",
        "The huge number of documents, however, make the task extremely daunting.",
        "Therefore an automated test of different perspectives will be very valuable to information analysts.",

        "We take a model-based approach to develop a computational definition of different perspectives.",
        "We first develop statistical models for the two document collections, A and B, and then measure the degree of contrast by calculating the “distance” between A and B.",
        "How document collections are statistically modeled and how distribution difference is estimated are described in Section 3.",
        "The document corpora are described in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate how effective the proposed test of difference perspectives based on statistical distribution.",
        "The experimental results show that the distribution divergence can successfully separate document collections of different perspectives from other kinds of collection pairs.",
        "We also investigate if the pattern of distribution difference is due to personal writing or speaking styles."

        "We aim to capture the characteristics, specifically the statistical regularities of any pairs of document collections with opposing perspectives.",
        "Given a pair of document collections A and B, our goal is not to construct classifiers that can predict if a document was written from the perspective of A or B (Lin et al., 2006), but to determine if the document collection pair (A, B) convey opposing perspectives.",
        "There has been growing interest in subjectivity and sentiment analysis.",
        "There are studies on learning subjective language (Wiebe et al., 2004), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Morinaga et al., 2002).",

        "Although we expect by its very nature much of the language used when expressing a perspective to be subjective and opinionated, the task of labeling a document or a sentence as subjective is orthogonal to the test of different perspectives.",
        "A subjectivity classifier may successfully identify all subjective sentences in the document collection pair A and B, but knowing the number of subjective sentences in A and B does not necessarily tell us if they convey opposing perspectives.",
        "We utilize the subjectivity patterns automatically extracted from foreign news documents (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that the percentages of the subjective sentences in the bitterlemons corpus (see Section 4) are similar (65.6% in the Palestinian documents and 66.2% in the Israeli documents).",
        "The high but almost equivalent number of subjective sentences in two perspectives suggests that perspective is largely expressed in subjective language but subjectivity ratio is not enough to tell if two document collections are written from the same (Palestinian v.s.",
