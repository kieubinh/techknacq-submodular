        "Current approaches to Automatic Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation are mostly based on metrics which determine the quality of a given translation according to its similarity to a given set of reference translations.",
        "The commonly accepted criterion that defines the quality of an evaluation metric is its level of correlation with human evaluators.",
        "High levels of correlation (Pearson over 0.9) have been attained at the system level (Eck and Hori, 2005).",
        "But this is an average effect: the degree of correlation achieved at the sentence level, crucial for an accurate error analysis, is much lower.",
        "We argue that there is two main reasons that explain this fact: Firstly, current MT evaluation metrics are based on shallow features.",
        "Most metrics work only at the lexical level.",
        "However, natural languages are rich and ambiguous, allowing for many possible different ways of expressing the same idea.",
        "In order to capture this flexibility, these metrics would require a combinatorial number of reference translations, when indeed in most cases only a single reference is available.",
        "Therefore, metrics with higher descriptive power are required.",
        "Secondly, there exists, indeed, two different evaluation criteria: (i) Human Acceptability, i.e., to what extent an automatic translation could be considered acceptable by humans; and (ii) Human Likeness, i.e., to what extent an automatic translation could have been generated by a human translator.",
        "Most approaches to automatic MT evaluation implicitly assume that both criteria should lead to the same results; but this assumption has not been proved empirically or even discussed.",
        "In this work, we analyze this issue through empirical evidence.",
        "First, in Section 2, we investigate to what extent current evaluation metrics are able to distinguish between human and automatic translations (Human Likeness).",
        "As individual metrics do not capture such distinction well, in Section 3 we study how to improve the descriptive power of current metrics by means of metric combinations inside the QARLA Framework (Amig´o et al., 2005), including a new family of metrics based on syntactic criteria.",
        "Second, we claim that the two evaluation criteria (Human Acceptability and Human Likeness) are indeed of a different nature, and may lead to different results (Section 4).",
