        "The experimental results showed that the SVMs model was superior to the other three models.",
        "We also found that part-of-speech tags played an important role in Chinese chunking because the gap of the performance between WORD+POS and POS was very small.",
        "We found that the proposed voting approaches can provide higher accuracy than any single system can.",
        "In particular, the Phrase-based Voting approach is more suitable for chunking task than the other two voting approaches.",
        "Our experimental results also indicated that the Tag-Extension approach can improve the performance significantly."
