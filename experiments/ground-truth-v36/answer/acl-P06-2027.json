        "We show that this methodology can be used for automatic domain template creation.",
        "As the problem of automatic domain template creation is rather new, there is no well-defined procedure for the evaluation of the domain template quality.",
        "Thus, we propose a methodology for identifying what information should be present in the template.",

        "top 50 verbs.",
        "After we identify the 50 most important verbs for the domain under analysis, we parse all the sentences in the domain document collection containing these verbs with the Stanford syntactic parser (Klein and Manning, 2002).",

        "A domain template should contain not only the most important actions for the domain, but also the entities that are linked to these actions or to each other through these actions.",
        "The lexemes referring to such entities can potentially be used within the domain template slots.",
        "Thus, we analyze those portions of the syntactic trees which contain the verbs themselves plus other lexemes used in the same subtrees as the verbs.",
        "To do this we use FREQuent Tree miner.5 This software is an implementation of the algorithm presented by (Abe et al., 2002; Zaki, 2002), which extracts frequent ordered subtrees from a set of ordered trees.",
        "Following (Sudo et al., 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs.",
        "Thus, we look only for those subtrees which contain the verbs themselves and from four to ten tree nodes, where a node is either a syntactic tag or a lexeme with its tag.",

        "Slot structures are similar to verb frames, which are manually created for the PropBank annotation (Palmer et al., 2005).6 An example of the PropBank frame for the verb to kill is:",
        "The difference between the slot structure extracted by our algorithm and the PropBank frame slots is that the frame slots assign a semantic role to each slot, while our algorithm gives either the type of the named entity that should fill in this slot or puts a particular noun into the slot (e.g., ORGANIZATION, earthquake, people).",

        "In this section we describe the evaluation of the four automatically created templates.",
        "Automatically created templates consist of slot structures and are not easily readable by human annotators.",
        "Thus, instead of direct evaluation of the template quality, we evaluate the clauses extracted according to the created templates and",
        "check whether these clauses contain the answers to the questions created by the subjects during the first stage of the evaluation.",
        "We extract the clauses corresponding to the test instances according to the following procedure: 1.",
        "Identify all the simple clauses in the documents corresponding to a particular test instance (respective TDT topic).",
        "For example, for the sentence Her husband, Robert, survived Thursday’s explosion in a Yemeni harbor that killed at least six crew members and injured 35. only one part is output:",
        "2.",
        "For every domain template slot check all the simple clauses in the instance (TDT topic) under analysis.",
        "Find the shortest clause (or sequence of clauses) which includes both the verb and other words extracted for this slot in their respective order.",
        "Add this clause to the list of extracted clauses unless this clause has been already added to this list.",
        "3.",
        "Keep adding clauses to the list of extracted clauses till all the template slots are analyzed or the size of the list exceeds 20 clauses.",
        "The key step in the above algorithm is Step 2.",
        "By choosing the shortest simple clause or sequence of simple clauses corresponding to a particular template slot, we reduce the possibility of adding more information to the output than is necessary to cover each particular slot.",
        "In Step 3 we keep only the first twenty clauses so that the length of the output which potentially contains an answer to the question of interest is not larger than the number of questions provided by each subject.",
        "The templates are created from the slot structures extracted for the top 50 verbs.",
        "The higher the estimated score of the verb (Eq.",
        "1) for the domain the closer to the top of the template the slot structure corresponding to this verb will be.",
        "We assume that the important information is more likely to be covered by the slot structures that are placed near the top of the template.",
        "The evaluation results for the automatically created templates are presented in Figure 1.",
        "We calculate what average percentage of the questions is covered by the outputs created according to the domain templates.",
        "For every domain, we present the percentage of the covered questions separately for each annotator and for the intersection of questions (Section 6.1).",
        "For the questions common for all the annotators we capture about 70% of the answers for three out of four domains.",
        "After studying the results we noticed that for the earthquake domain some questions did not result in a template slot and thus, could not be covered by the extracted clauses.",
        "Here are two of such questions: Is it near a fault line?",
        "Is it near volcanoes?",
        "According to the template creation procedure, which is centered around verbs, the chances that extracted clauses would contain answers to these questions are low.",
        "Indeed, only one of the three sentence sets extracted for the three TDT earthquake topics contain an answer to one of these questions.",
        "Poor results for the presidential election domain could be predicted from the Jaccard metric value for interannotator agreement (Table 2).",
        "There is considerable discrepancy in the questions created by human annotators which can be attributed to the great variation in the presidential election domain itself.",
        "It must be also noted that most of the questions created for the presidential election domain were clearly referring to the democratic election procedure, while some of the TDT topics categorized as Elections were about either election fraud or about opposition taking over power without the formal resignation of the previous president.",
        "Overall, this evaluation shows that using automatically created domain templates we extract sentences which contain a substantial part of the important information expressed in questions for that domain.",
        "For those domains which have small diversity our coverage can be significantly higher."
