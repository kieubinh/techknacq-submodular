        "Subcategorization is the process that further classifies a syntactic category into its subsets.",
        "Chomsky (1965) defines the function of strict subcategorization features as appointing a set of constraints that dominate the selection of verbs and other arguments in deep structure.",
        "Large sub-categorized verbal lexicons have proved to be crucially important for many tasks of natural language processing, such as probabilistic parsers (Korhonen, 2001, 2002) and verb classifications (Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen, 2003).",
        "Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of research focusing on large-scaled automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met with some success not only in English but also in many other languages, including German (Schulte im Walde, 2002), Spanish (Chrupala, 2003), Czech (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000), Portuguese (Gamallo et.",
        "al, 2002), and Chinese (Han et al., 2004).",
        "The general objective of this research is to acquire from a given corpus the SCF types and numbers for predicate verbs.",
        "Two typical steps during the process of automatic acquisition are hypothesis generation and selection.",
        "Usually based on heuristic rules, the first step generates SCF hypotheses for involved verbs; and the second selects reliable ones via statistical methods, such as BHT (binomial hypothesis testing), LLR (log likelihood ratio) and MLE (maximum likelihood estimation).",
        "This second step is also called statistical filtering and has been widely regarded as problematic.",
        "English researchers have proposed some methods adjusting the corpus hypothesis frequencies before or while filtering.",
        "These methods are often called backoff techniques for SCF acquisition.",
        "Some of them represent a remarkable improvement in the acquisition performance, for example diathesis alternation and semantic motivation (Korhonen, 1998, 2001, 2002).",
        "For the convenience of comparison between performances of different SCF acquisition methods, we define absolute and relative recall in this paper.",
        "By absolute recall, we mean the figure computed against the background of input corpus, while relative recall is against the set of generated hypotheses.",
        "At present, automatically acquired verb lexicons with SCF information have already proved accurate and useful enough for some NLP purposes (Korhonen, 2001; Han et al., 2004).",
        "As for English, Korhonen (2002) reported that semantically motivated SCF acquisition achieved a precision of 87.1%, an absolute recall of 71.2% and a relative recall of 85.27%, thus making the acquired lexicon much more accurate and useful.",
        "However, the accuracy still shows room for improvement, especially for those SCF hypotheses with low frequencies.",
        "Detailed analysis on the acquisition system and some resulting data shows that three main causes should account for the comparatively unsatisfactory performance: a. the imperfect hypothesis generator, b. the Zipfian",
        "Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 331–336, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics distribution of syntactic patterns, c. the incomplete partition over SCF types of a given verb.",
        "The first problem mainly comes from the inadequate parsing performance and noises existing in the corpus, while the other two problems are inherent to natural languages and should be solved in terms of acquisition techniques particularly during the process of hypothesis selection."

        "The present SCF acquisition system for English verbs employs a MLE filter to test the automatically generated SCF hypotheses.",
        "Due to noises accumulated while tagging, lemmatizing and parsing the corpus, even though correction is implemented for some typical errors when classifying the extracted patterns, the hypothesis generator does not perform as efficiently as hoped.",
        "Sampling analysis on the unfiltered hypotheses in Korhonen’s evaluation corpus indicates that about 74% incorrectly proposed and rejected SCF types come from the defects of the MLE filtering method.",
        "Performance of the MLE filter is closely related to the actual distributions p(scfi|v) over predicates and SCF types in the input corpus.",
        "First, from the overall corpus a training set is drawn randomly; it must be large enough to ensure a similar distribution.",
        "Then, the frequency of a subcategorization frame scfi occurring with a verb v is recorded and used to estimate the probability p(scfi|v).",
        "Thirdly, an empirical threshold 0 is determined, which ensures that a maximum",
        "value of the F-measure will result for the training set.",
        "Finally, the threshold is used to filter out from the total set those SCF hypotheses with frequencies lower than 0.",
        "Therefore, the statistical foundation of this filtering method is the assumption of independence among the SCFs that a verb enters, which can be probabilistically expressed in two formulas as follows:",
        "Here, i and j are natural numbers, scfi and scfj are two SCF types that verb v enters, and variables in formulas henceforth will hold the same meanings.",
        "In actual application, the probability p(scfi|v) is estimated from the observed frequency f(scfi, v), and the conditional probability p(scfi|scfj, v) is assumed to be zero.",
        "This means any two SCF types entered by a given verb are taken for granted to be probabilistically independent from each other.",
        "However, this assumption can sometimes be far from appropriate."

      "text": [
        "Much linguistic research focusing on child language acquisition has revealed that many children are able to produce new grammatical sentences from what they have learned (Peters, 1983; Ellis, 1985).",
        "This implies that the widely-used independence assumption in the field of NLP may not be very appropriate, at least for syntactic patterns.",
        "If this assumption should be removed, a possible heuristic could be the information of diathesis alternations, which is also another convincing counterargument.",
        "Diathesis alternations are generally regarded as alternative ways in which verbs express their arguments.",
        "Examples are as follows:",
        "a.",
        "He broke the glass.",
        "b.",
        "The glass broke.",
        "In the above examples, the English verb break takes the causative-inchoative alternation as shown in sentences a and b, while sentences c and d indicate that the Chinese verb chi1 ( , eat) 1 The numbers in sentences c and d, which are pinyin notations, show tones of the Chinese syllables, and the two sentences, in English, generally mean He ate an apple.",
        "may enter the ba-object-raising alternation where the object is shifted forward by the preposition ba3 ( ) to the location between the subject and the predicate, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Subcategorization of verbs has much to do with diathesis alternations, and most SCF researchers regard information of diathesis alternation as an indispensable part of subcategorization (Korhonen, 2001; McCarthy, 2001).",
        "Therefore, one may conclude that, for subcategorization acquisition, the independence assumption supporting the MLE filter is not as appropriate as previously thought.",
        "For a given verb, the assumption will be appropriate and sufficient if and only if there is no diathesis alternation between all the SCFs it enters, and formula (1) and (2) in Section 3 are efficient enough to serve as a foundation for the MLE filtering method.",
        "Otherwise, if there are diathesis alternations between some of the SCFs that a verb enters, then formula (1) and (2) must be modified as illustrated in formula (3) and (4).",
        "In either case, for the sake of convenience, it would be better to combine the formulas as shown in (5) and (6).",
        "For English verbs, previous research has achieved great progress in diathesis alternation and relative applications, such as the work of Levin (1993) and McCarthy (2001).",
        "Besides, Korhonen (1998) has proved that diathesis alternation could be used as heuristic information for backoff estimates to improve the general performance of subcategorization acquisition.",
        "However, determining where and how to seed the heuristic remains difficult.",
        "Korhonen (1998) employed diathesis alternations in Briscoe and Carroll’s system to improve the performance of their BHT filter.",
        "Although the precision rate increased from 61.22% to",
        "69.42% and the recall rate from 44.70% to 50.81%, the results were still not accurate enough for possible practical NLP uses.",
        "Korhonen obtained her one-way diathesis alternations from the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987), calculated the alternating probability p(scfj |scfi) according to the number of common verbs that took the alternation (scfi--).scfj), and used formula (7) and (8), where w is an empirical weight, to adjust the previously estimated p(scfi |v): If p(scfi|scfj, v)>0,",
        "Following the adjustment, a BHT filter with a confidence rate of 95% was used to check the SCF hypotheses.",
        "This method removes the assumption of independence among SCF types but establishes another assumption of independence between p(scfj|scfi) and certain verbs, which assumes that all verbs take each diathesis alternation with the same probability.",
        "Nevertheless, linguistic knowledge tells us that verbs often enter different diathesis alternations and can be classified accordingly.",
        "Consider the following examples: e. He broke the glass.",
        "/ The glass broke.",
        "f. The police dispersed the crowd.",
        "/ The crowd dispersed.",
        "g. Mum cut the bread.",
        "/ *The bread cut.",
        "Both of the English verbs “break” and “disperse” can take the causative-inchoative alternation and, hence, may be classified together, while the verb “cut” does not take this alternation.",
        "Therefore, the newly established assumption doesn’t fit the actual situation either, and the probability sums O ip(scfi|v) and ijp(scfi|scfj, v) neither need or can be normalized.",
        "Based on the above methodology, we formed a new filtering method with diathesis alternations as heuristic information, which is, in fact, derived from the simple MLE filter and based on formula (5) and (6).",
        "The algorithm can be briefly expressed as shown in Table 2.",
        "2 For the sake of consistency in this paper and for the convenience of understanding, formulae formats here are modified.",

        "Go to step 1 until S doesn’t increase.",
        "In our method, two filters are employed.",
        "For each verb involved, first a common MLE filter is used, but it employs a threshold 01 that is much higher than usual, and those SCF hypotheses that satisfy the requirement are accepted.",
        "Then, all of the remainder of the hypotheses are checked by another MLE filter seeded with diathesis alternations as heuristic information and equipped with a much lower threshold 02.",
        "Any hypothesis scfi left out by the first filter will be accepted if its probability exceeds 02 and it is an alternative of an SCF type scfj that has been accepted by the first filter, which means that p(scfi|scfj, v)>0 and scfjS .",

        "In the experiment we empirically set 01= 0.2, which is ten times of Korhonen’s threshold for her MLE filter; 02= 0.002, which is one tenth of Korhonen’s.",
        "Thus, in a token set of hypotheses no more than 1000, an SCF type scfi will be accepted if it occurs two times or more and has a diathesis alternative type scfj already accepted for the verb.",
        "The gold standard was the manually analysed results by Korhonen.",

        "Here, Ab_R is the absolute recall ratio, Re _R the relative recall ratio, Ab_F the absolute F-measure that is calculated from Precision and Ab_R, and Re_F the relative F-measure that is from Precision and Re_R.",
        "The evaluation shows that our new filtering method improved the acquisition performance remarkably: a.",
        "Compared with MLE, precision increased by 23.29%, recall ratio remained unchanged, absolute F-measure increased by 3.96, and relative F-measure increased by 13.72; b.",
        "Compared with Korhonen’s best results, precision, Re_R and Re_F also increased respectively 3.",
        "Thus, the general performance of our filtering method makes the acquired lexicon much more practical for further manual proofreading and other NLP uses.",
        "What’s more, the data shown in Table 3 implies that there is little room left for improvement of the statistical filter, since the absolute recall ratio is only 2.1% lower than that of the non-filtering method.",
        "Whereas, detailed analysis of the evaluation corpus shows that the hypothesis generator accounts for about 95% of those unre-called and wrongly recalled SCF types, which indicates, for the present time, more improvement efforts need to be made on the first step of subcategorization acquisition, i.e. hypothesis generation."

        "Our new filtering method removed the inappropriate assumptions and takes much more advan3 Korhonen (2002) reported the non-filtering absolute recall ratio of her experiment was about 83.5%.",
        "She didn’t give any explanation with her evaluation resources why here non-filtering Ab_R was so much lower.",
        "Therefore, the Ab_R and Ab_F figures are not comparable here.",
        "tage of what can be observed in the corpus by drawing on the alternative relationship between SCF hypotheses with higher and lower frequencies.",
        "Unlike the semantically motivated method (Korhonen, 2001, 2002), which is dependent on verb classifications that linguistic resources are able to provide, our filter needs no prior knowledge other than reasonable diathesis alternation information and may work well for most verbs in other languages with sufficient predicative tokens.",
        "Our experimental results suggest that the proposed technique improves the general performance of the English subcategorization acquisition system, and leaves only a little room for further improvement in statistical filtering methods.",
        "However, approaches that are more complicated still exist theoretically, for instance, some SCF types unseen by the hypothesis generator may be recalled by integrating semantic verb-classification information into the system.",
        "More essential aspects of our future work, however, will focus on improving the performance of the hypothesis generator, and testing and applying the acquired subcategorization lexicons in some concrete NLP tasks.",
