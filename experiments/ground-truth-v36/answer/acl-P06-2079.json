        "Sentiment analysis involves the identification of positive and negative opinions from a text segment.",
        "The task has recently received a lot of attention, with applications ranging from multi-perspective question-answering (e.g., Cardie et al.",
        "(2004)) to opinion-oriented information extraction (e.g., Riloff et al.",
        "(2005)) and summarization (e.g., Hu and Liu (2004)).",
        "Research in sentiment analysis has generally proceeded at three levels, aiming to identify and classify opinions from documents, sentences, and phrases.",
        "This paper examines two problems in document-level sentiment analysis, focusing on analyzing a particular type of opinionated documents: reviews.",
        "The first problem, polarity classification, has the goal of determining a review’s polarity – positive (“thumbs up”) or negative (“thumbs down”).",
        "Recent work has expanded the polarity classification task to additionally handle documents expressing a neutral sentiment.",
        "Although studied fairly extensively, polarity classification remains a challenge to natural language processing systems.",
        "We will focus on an important linguistic aspect of polarity classification: examining the role of a variety of simple, yet under-investigated, linguistic knowledge sources in a learning-based polarity classification system.",
        "Specifically, we will show how to build a high-performing polarity classifier by exploiting information provided by (1) high order n-grams, (2) a lexicon composed of adjectives manually annotated with their polarity information (e.g., happy is annotated as positive and terrible as negative), (3) dependency relations derived from dependency parses, and (4) objective terms and phrases extracted from neutral documents.",
        "As mentioned above, the majority of work on document-level sentiment analysis to date has focused on polarity classification, assuming as input a set of reviews to be classified.",
        "A relevant question is: what if we don’t know that an input document is a review in the first place?",
        "The second task we will examine in this paper – review identification – attempts to address this question.",
        "Specifically, review identification seeks to determine whether a given document is a review or not.",
        "We view both review identification and polarity classification as a classification task.",
        "For review identification, we train a classifier to distinguish movie reviews and movie-related non-reviews (e.g., movie ads, plot summaries) using only unigrams as features, obtaining an accuracy of over 99% via 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "Similar experiments using documents from the book domain also yield an accuracy as high as 97%.",
        "An analysis of the results reveals that the high accuracy can be attributed to the difference in the vocabulary employed in reviews and non-reviews: while reviews can be composed of a mixture of subjective and objective language, our non-review documents rarely contain subjective expressions.",
        "Next, we learn our polarity classifier using positive and negative reviews taken from two movie",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics review datasets, one assembled by Pang and Lee (2004) and the other by ourselves.",
        "The resulting classifier, when trained on a feature set derived from the four types of linguistic knowledge sources mentioned above, achieves a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 90.5% and 86.1% on Pang et al.’s dataset and ours, respectively.",
        "To our knowledge, our result on Pang et al.’s dataset is one of the best reported to date.",
        "Perhaps more importantly, an analysis of these results show that the various types of features interact in an interesting manner, allowing us to draw conclusions that provide new insights into polarity classification."

        "Objective information.",
        "The objective portions of a review do not contain the author’s opinion; hence features extracted from objective sentences and phrases are irrelevant with respect to the polarity classification task and their presence may complicate the learning task.",
        "Indeed, recent work has shown that benefits can be made by first separating facts from opinions in a document (e.g, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document (e.g., Pang and Lee (2004)).",
        "Motivated by the work of Koppel and Schler (2005), we identify and extract objective material from non-reviews and show how to exploit such information in polarity classification.",

        "Somewhat surprisingly, in comparison to row 4, we see that our method for filtering objective features does not help improve performance on the two datasets.",

        "Using the four types of knowledge sources previously described, our polarity classifier significantly outperforms a unigram-based baseline classifier.",
        "In this subsection, we analyze some of these results and conduct additional experiments in an attempt to gain further insight into the polarity classification task.",
        "Due to space limitations, we will simply present results on Dataset A below, and show results on Dataset B only in cases where a different trend is observed.",
        "The role of feature selection.",
        "In all of our experiments we used the best k features obtained via WLLR.",
        "An interesting question is: how will these results change if we do not perform feature selection?",
        "To investigate this question, we conduct two",
        "experiments.",
        "First, we train a polarity classifier using all unigrams from the training set.",
        "Second, we train another polarity classifier using all unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.",
        "We obtain an accuracy of 87.2% and 79.5% for the first and second experiments, respectively.",
        "In comparison to our baseline classifier, which achieves an accuracy of 87.1%, we can see that using all unigrams does not hurt performance, but performance drops abruptly with the addition of all bigrams and trigrams.",
        "These results suggest that feature selection is critical when bigrams and trigrams are used in conjunction with unigrams for training a polarity classifier.",
        "The role of bigrams and trigrams.",
        "So far we have seen that training a polarity classifier using only unigrams gives us reasonably good, though not outstanding, results.",
        "Our question, then, is: would bigrams alone do a better job at capturing the sentiment of a document than unigrams?",
        "To answer this question, we train a classifier using all bigrams (without feature selection) and obtain an accuracy of 83.6%, which is significantly worse than that of a unigram-only classifier.",
        "Similar results were also obtained by Pang et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "It is possible that the worse result is due to the presence of a large number of irrelevant bigrams.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we repeat the above experiment except that we only use the best 10000 bigrams selected according to WLLR.",
        "Interestingly, the resulting classifier gives us a lower accuracy of 82.3%, suggesting that the poor accuracy is not due to the presence of irrelevant bigrams.",
        "To understand why using bigrams alone does not yield a good classification model, we examine a number of test documents and find that the feature vectors corresponding to some of these documents (particularly the short ones) have all zeroes in them.",
        "In other words, none of the bigrams from the training set appears in these reviews.",
        "This suggests that the main problem with the bigram model is likely to be data sparseness.",
        "Additional experiments show that the trigram-only classifier yields even worse results than the bigram-only classifier, probably because of the same reason.",
        "Nevertheless, these higher-order n-grams play a non-trivial role in polarity classification: we have shown that the addition of bigrams and trigrams selected via WLLR to a unigram-based classifier significantly improves its performance.",
        "The role of dependency relations.",
        "In the previous subsection we see that dependency relations do not contribute to overall performance on top of bigrams and trigrams.",
        "There are two plausible reasons.",
        "First, dependency relations are simply not useful for polarity classification.",
        "Second, the higher-order n-grams and the dependency-based features capture essentially the same information and so using either of them would be sufficient.",
        "To test the first hypothesis, we train a classifier using only 10000 unigrams and 10000 dependency-based features (both selected according to WLLR).",
        "For Dataset A, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 87.1%, which is statistically indistinguishable from our baseline result.",
        "On the other hand, the accuracy for Dataset B is 83.5%, which is significantly better than the corresponding baseline (82.7%) at the p = .1 level.",
        "These results indicate that dependency information is somewhat useful for the task when bigrams and trigrams are not used.",
        "So the first hypothesis is not entirely true.",
        "So, it seems to be the case that the dependency relations do not provide useful knowledge for polarity classification only in the presence of bigrams and trigrams.",
        "This is somewhat surprising, since these n-grams do not capture the non-local dependencies (such as those that may be present in certain SV or VO relations) that should intuitively be useful for polarity classification.",
        "To better understand this issue, we again examine a number of test documents.",
        "Our initial investigation suggests that the problem might have stemmed from the fact that MINIPAR returns dependency relations in which all the verb inflections are removed.",
        "For instance, given the sentence My cousin Paul really likes this long movie, MINIPAR will return the VO relation (like, movie).",
        "To see why this can be a problem, consider another sentence I like this long movie.",
        "From this sentence, MINIPAR will also extract the VO relation (like, movie).",
        "Hence, this same VO relation is capturing two different situations, one in which the author himself likes the movie, and in the other, the author’s cousin likes the movie.",
        "The over-generalization resulting from these “stemmed” relations renders dependency information not useful for polarity classification.",
        "Additional experiments are needed to determine the role of dependency relations when stemming in MINIPAR is disabled.",
        "The role of objective information.",
        "Results from the previous subsection suggest that our method for extracting objective materials and removing them from the reviews is not effective in terms of improving performance.",
        "To determine the reason, we examine the n-grams and the dependency relations that are extracted from the non-reviews.",
        "We find that only in a few cases do these extracted objective materials appear in our set of 25000 features obtained in Section 4.2.",
        "This explains why our method is not as effective as we originally thought.",
        "We conjecture that more sophisticated methods would be needed in order to take advantage of objective information in polarity classification (e.g., Koppel and Schler (2005))."

        "We have examined two problems in document-level sentiment analysis, namely, review identification and polarity classification.",

        "Our results suggested that bigrams and trigrams selected according to the weighted log-likelihood ratio as well as manually tagged term polarity information are very useful features for the task.",
