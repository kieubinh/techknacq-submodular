        "Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging is a complex task fraught with challenges like ambiguity of parts of speech and handling of “lexical absence” (proper nouns, foreign words, derivationally morphed words, spelling variations and other unknown words) (Manning and Schütze, 2002).",
        "For English there are many POS tag-gers, employing machine learning techniques like transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), markov model (Cutting et al.",
        "1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc.",
        "There are also taggers which are hybrid using both stochastic and rule-based approaches, such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997).",
        "The accuracy of these taggers ranges from 93-98% approximately.",
        "English has annotated corpora in abundance, enabling usage of powerful data driven machine learning methods.",
        "But, very few languages in the world have the resource advantage that English enjoys.",
        "In this scenario, POS tagging of highly inflectional languages presents an interesting case study.",
        "Morphologically rich languages are characterized by a large number of morphemes in a single word, where morpheme boundaries are difficult to detect because they are fused together.",
        "They are typically free-word ordered, which causes fixed-context systems to be hardly adequate for statistical approaches (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997).",
        "Morphology-based POS tagging of some languages like Turkish (Oflazer and Kuruoz, 1994), Arabic (Guiassa, 2006), Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), Modern Greek (Or-phanos et al., 1999) and Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) has been tried out using a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical learning.",
        "These systems use large amount of corpora along with morphological analysis to POS tag the texts.",
        "It may be noted that a purely rule-based or a purely stochastic approach will not be effective for such",
