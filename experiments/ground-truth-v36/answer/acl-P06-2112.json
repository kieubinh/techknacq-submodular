        "The unlimited resource consists of a translation dictionary extracted from the alignment of Romanian and English WordNet.",
        "Lopez and Resnik (2005) extended the HMM model by integrating a tree distortion model based on a dependency parser built on the English side of the parallel corpus.",
        "The latter two methods produced comparable results with those methods using limited resources.",
        "All the above three methods use some language dependent resources such as dictionary, thesaurus, and dependency parser.",
        "And some methods, such as transliteration similarity, can only be used for very similar language pairs.",
        "In this paper, besides the limited resources for the given language pair, we make use of large amounts of resources available for other language pairs to address the alignment problem for languages with scarce resources.",
        "Our method does not need language-dependent resources or deep linguistic processing.",

        "This paper presented a word alignment approach for languages with scarce resources using bilingual corpora of other language pairs.",
        "To perform word alignment between languages L1 and L2, we introduce a pivot language L3 and bilingual corpora in L1-L3 and L2-L3.",
        "Based on these two corpora and with the L3 as a pivot language, we proposed an approach to estimate the parameters of the statistical word alignment model.",
        "This approach can build a word alignment model for the desired language pair even if no bilingual corpus is available in this language pair.",
        "Experimental results indicate a relative error reduction of 10.41% as compared with the method using the small bilingual corpus.",
        "In addition, we interpolated the above model with the model trained on the small L1-L2 bilingual corpus to further improve word alignment between L1 and L2.",
        "This interpolated model further improved the word alignment results by achieving a relative error rate reduction of 12.51% as compared with the method using the two corpora in L1-L3 and L3-L2, and a relative error rate reduction of 21.30% as compared with the method using the small bilingual corpus in L1 and L2.",
        "In future work, we will perform more evaluations.",
        "First, we will further investigate the effect of the size of corpora on the alignment results.",
        "Second, we will investigate different parameter combination of the induced model and the original model.",
        "Third, we will also investigate how simpler IBM models 1 and 2 perform, in comparison with IBM models 3 and 4.",
        "Last, we will evaluate the word alignment results in a real machine translation system, to examine whether lower word alignment error rate will result in higher translation accuracy."
