      "text": [
        "Parallel data has been treated as sets of unrelated sentence-pairs in state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) models.",
        "Most current approaches emphasize within-sentence dependencies such as the distortion in (Brown et al., 1993), the dependency of alignment in HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), and syntax mappings in (Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "Beyond the sentence-level, corpus-level word-correlation and contextual-level topical information may help to disambiguate translation candidates and word-alignment choices.",
        "For example, the most frequent source words (e.g., functional words) are likely to be translated into words which are also frequent on the target side; words of the same topic generally bear correlations and similar translations.",
        "Extended contextual information is especially useful when translation models are vague due to their reliance solely on word-pair co-occurrence statistics.",
        "For example, the word shot in “It was a nice shot.” should be translated differently depending on the context of the sentence: a goal in the context of sports, or a photo within the context of sightseeing.",
        "Nida (1964) stated that sentence-pairs are tied by the logic-flow in a document-pair; in other words, the document-pair should be word-aligned as one entity instead of being uncorrelated instances.",
        "In this paper, we propose a probabilistic admixture model to capture latent topics underlying the context of document-pairs.",
        "With such topical information, the translation models are expected to be sharper and the word-alignment process less ambiguous.",
        "Previous works on topical translation models concern mainly explicit logical representations of semantics for machine translation.",
        "This include knowledge-based (Nyberg and Mitamura, 1992) and interlingua-based (Dorr and Habash, 2002) approaches.",
        "These approaches can be expensive, and they do not emphasize stochastic translation aspects.",
        "Recent investigations along this line includes using word-disambiguation schemes (Carpua and Wu, 2005) and non-overlapping bilingual word-clusters (Wang et al., 1996; Och, 1999; Zhao et al., 2005) with particular translation models, which showed various degrees of success.",
        "We propose a new statistical formalism: Bilingual Topic AdMixture model, or BiTAM, to facilitate topic-based word alignment in SMT.",
        "Variants of admixture models have appeared in population genetics (Pritchard et al., 2000) and text modeling (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Statistically, an object is said to be derived from an admixture if it consists of a bag of elements, each sampled independently or coupled in some way, from a mixture model.",
        "In a typical SMT setting, each document-pair corresponds to an object; depending on a chosen modeling granularity, all sentence-pairs or word-pairs in the document-pair correspond to the elements constituting the object.",
        "Correspondingly, a latent topic is sampled for each pair from a prior topic distribution to induce topic-specific translations; and the resulting sentence-pairs and word-pairs are marginally dependent.",
        "Generatively, this admixture formalism enables word translations to be instantiated by topic-specific bilingual models",
        "and/or monolingual models, depending on their contexts.",
        "In this paper we investigate three instances of the BiTAM model, They are data-driven and do not need hand-crafted knowledge engineering.",
        "The remainder of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we introduce notations and baselines; in section 3, we propose the topic admixture models; in section 4, we present the learning and inference algorithms; and in section 5 we show experiments of our models.",
        "We conclude with a brief discussion in section 6."
