        "The Wall-Street-Journal part (WSJ) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) plays a central role in research on statistical treebank-based parsing.",
        "It has not only become a standard for parser evaluation, but also the foundation for the development of new parsing models.",
        "For the English WSJ, high accuracy parsing models have been created, some of them using extensions to classical PCFG parsing such as lexicalization and markovization (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "However, since most research has been limited to a single language (English) and to a single treebank (WSJ), the question of how portable the parsers and their extensions are across languages and across treebanks often remained open.",
        "Only recently, there have been attempts to evaluate parsing results with respect to the properties and the language of the treebank that is used.",
        "Gildea (2001) investigates the effects that certain treebank characteristics have on parsing results, such as the distribution of verb subcategorization frames.",
        "He conducts experiments on the WSJ and the Brown Corpus, parsing one of the treebanks while having trained on the other one.",
        "He draws the conclusion that a small amount of matched training data is better than a large amount of unmatched training data.",
        "Dubey and Keller (2003) analyze the difficulties that German imposes on parsing.",
        "They use the NeGra treebank for their experiments and show that lexicalization, while highly effective for English, has no benefit for German.",
        "This result motivates them to create a parsing model for German based on sister-head-dependencies.",
        "Corazza et al.",
        "(2004) conduct experiments with model 2 of Collins’ parser (Collins, 1999) and the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) on two Italian treebanks.",
        "They report disappointing results which they trace back to the different difficulties of different parsing tasks in Italian and English and to differences in annotation styles across treebanks.",
        "In the present paper, our goal is to determine the effects of different annotation decisions on the results of plain PCFG parsing without extensions.",
        "Our motivation is two-fold: first, we want to present research on a language different from English, second, we want to investigate the influences of annotation schemes via a realistic comparison, i.e. use two different annotation schemes.",
        "Therefore, we take advantage of the availability of two similar treebanks of German, T¨uBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2003) and NeGra (Skut et al., 1997).",
        "The strategy we adopt extends K¨ubler",
        "(2005).",
        "Treebanks and their annotation schemes respectively are compared using a stepwise approximation.",
        "Annotation components corresponding to certain annotation decisions are taken out or inserted, submitting each time the resulting modified treebank to the parser.",
        "This method allows us to investigate the role of single annotation decisions in two different environments.",

        "With respect to treebanks, German is in a privileged position.",
        "Various treebanks are available, among them are two similar ones: NeGra (Skut et al., 1997), from Saarland University at Saarbr¨ucken and T¨uBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2003), from the University of T¨ubingen.",
        "NeGra contains about 20,000 sentences, T¨uBa-D/Z about 15,000, both consist of newspaper text.",
        "In both treebanks, predicate argument structure is annotated, the core principle of the annotation being its theory independence.",
        "Terminal nodes are labeled with part-of-speech tags and morphological labels, non-terminal nodes with phrase labels.",
        "All edges are labeled with grammatical functions.",
        "Annotation was accomplished semi-automatically with the same software tools.",
        "The main difference between the treebanks is rooted in the partial free word order of German sentences: the positions of complements and adjuncts are of great variability.",
        "This leads to a high number of discontinuous constituents, even in short sentences.",
        "An annotation scheme for German must account for that.",
        "NeGra allows for crossing branches, thereby giving up the context-free backbone of the annotation.",
        "With crossing branches, discontinuous constituents are not a problem anymore: all children of every constituent, discontinuous or not, can always be grouped under the same node.",
        "The inconvenience of this method is that the crossing branches must be resolved before the treebank can be used with a (PCFG) parser.",
        "However, this can be accomplished easily by reattaching children of discontinuous constituents to higher nodes.",
        "T¨uBa-D/Z uses another mechanism to account for the free word order.",
        "Above the phrase level, an additional layer of annotation is introduced.",
        "It consists of topological fields (Drach, 1937; H¨ohle, 1986).",
        "The concept of topological fields is widely accepted among German grammarians.",
        "It reflects the empirical observation that German has three possible sentence configurations with respect to the position of the finite verb.",
        "In its five fields (initial field, left sentence bracket, middle field, right sentence bracket, final field), verbal material generally resides in the two sentence brackets, while the initial field and the middle field contain all other elements.",
        "The final field contains mostly extraposed material.",
        "Since word order variations generally do not cross field boundaries, with the model of topological fields, the free word order of German can be accounted for in a natural way.",
        "On the phrase level, the treebanks show great differences, too.",
        "NeGra does not allow for any intermediate (“bar”) phrasal projections.",
        "Additionally, no unary productions are allowed.",
        "This results in very flat phrases: pre and postmodifiers are attached directly to the phrase, nominal subjects are attached directly to the sentence, nominal material within PPs doesn’t project to NPs, complex (non-coordinated) NPs remain flat.",
        "T¨uBaD/Z, on the contrary, allows for “deep” annotation.",
        "Intermediate productions and unary productions are allowed and extensively used.",

        "The precision value benefits the most from this modification.",
        "When parsing without grammatical functions, it increases about 6,5%.",
        "When parsing with grammatical functions, it increases about 14%.",
        "Thus, the additional rules provided by a topological field level that groups phrases below the clausal level are favorable for parsing.",
        "The average number of crossing brackets per sentence increases, which is due to the fact that there are simply more brackets to create.",
        "A detailed evaluation of the results for node categories shows that the new field categories are easy to recognize (e.g. LF gets 97.79 F-Measure).",
        "Nearly all categories have a better precision value.",
        "However, the F-Measure for VPs is low (only 26.70 while 59.41 in the unmodified treebank), while verb phrases in the unmodified T¨uBa-D/Z (see below) are recognized with nearly 100 points F-Measure.",
        "The problem here is the following.",
        "In the original NeGra annotation, a verb and its complements are grouped under the same VP.",
        "To pre",
        "serve as much of the annotation as possible, the topological fields are inserted below the VP (complements are grouped by a middle field node, the verb complex by the right sentence bracket).",
        "Since this way, the phrase node VP resides above the field level, it becomes difficult to recognize.",
        "In the second modification, NE NP, we approximate NeGra’s PPs to T¨uBa-D/Z’s by grouping all nominal material below the PPs to separate NPs.",
        "This modification gives us a small benefit in terms of precision and recall (about 2-3%).",
        "Although there are more brackets to place, the number of crossing parents increases only slightly, which can be attributed to the fact that below PPs, there is no room to get brackets wrong.",
        "We finally parse a version of NeGra where for each node movement during the resolution of crossing edges, a trace label was created in the corresponding edge (NE tr).",
        "Although this brings the treebank closer to the format of T¨uBa-D/Z, the results get even worse than in the version without traces.",

        "In the second modification of T¨uBa-D/Z, T¨u NU, unary nodes are collapsed with the goal to get structures comparable to NeGra’s.",
        "As the figures show, the unary nodes are very helpful, the F-Measure drops about 6 points without them.",
        "The number of crossing brackets also drops, along with the total number of nodes.",
        "When parsing with grammatical functions, taking out unary productions has a detrimental effect, F-Measure drops about 13 points.",
        "A plausible explanation could be data sparseness.",
        "32.78% of the rules that the parser needs to produce a correct parse don’t occur in the training set.",
        "An evaluation of the results for the different categories shows that all major phrase categories loose both in precision and recall.",
        "Since field nodes are mostly unary, many of them disappear, but most of the middle field nodes stay because they generally contain more than one element.",
        "However, their recall drops about 10%.",

        "In the T¨uBa-D/Z version with flattened phrases, many of the nominal nodes below EN-ADD are taken out, bringing EN-ADD closer to the lexical level.",
        "This way, the category has more meaningful context and therefore produces better results.",
        "Furthermore, we test combinations of the modifications.",
        "Apart from the average tree height, the dimensions of T¨uBa-D/Z with flattened phrases and without unary productions (T¨u f NU) resemble those of the unmodified NeGra treebank, which indicates their similarity.",
        "Nevertheless, parser results are worse on NeGra.",
        "This indicates that T¨uBa-D/Z still benefits from the remaining field nodes.",
        "The number of crossing branches is the lowest in this treebank version.",
        "In the last modification that combines all modifications made before (TU¨ f NU NF), as expected, all values drop dramatically.",

        "POS tagging.",
        "In a second round, we investigate the benefits that gold POS tags have when making them available in the parser input.",
        "We repeat all experiments without giving the parser the perfect tagging.",
        "This leads to higher time and space requirements during parsing, caused by the additional tagging step.",
        "With T¨uBa-D/Z, NeGra, and all their modifications, the F-Measure results are about 3 5 points worse when parsing with grammatical functions.",
        "When parsing without them, they drop 3-6 points.",
        "We can determine two exceptions: T¨uBa-D/Z with flattened phrases, where the F-Score drops more than 9 points when parsing with grammatical functions, and the T¨uBa-D/Z version with all modifications combined, where F-Score drops only a little less than 2 points.",
        "The behavior",
        "of the flattened T¨uBa-D/Z relates directly to the fact that the categories that loose the most without gold POS tags are phrase categories (particularly infinite VPs and APs).",
        "They are directly conditioned on the POS tagging and thus behave accordingly to its quality.",
        "For the T¨uBa-D/Z version with all modifications combined, one could argue that the results are not reliable because of data sparseness, which is confirmed by the high number of unparsed sentences in this treebank version.",
        "However, in all cases, less crossing brackets are produced.",
        "To sum up, obviously, it is more difficult for the parser to build a parse tree onto an already existing layer of POS-tagging.",
        "This explains the bigger number of unparsed sentences.",

        "When annotation structure is deleted in T¨uBa-D/Z, the number of crossing brackets drops, but F-Measure drops, too.",
        "When annotation structure is added in NeGra, the contrary happens.",
        "We can conclude that, being interested in good F-Measure results, the deep T¨uBa-D/Z structures are more appropriate for parsing than NeGra’s flat structures.",
        "Moreover, we have observed that it is beneficial to provide the parser with the gold POS tags at parsing time.",
        "However, we see that especially when parsing with grammatical functions, data sparseness becomes a serious problem, making the results less reliable.",
        "Seen in the context of a parse tree, the expansion probability of a PCFG rule just covers a subtree of height 1.",
        "This is a clear deficiency of PCFGs since this way, e.g., the expansion probability of a VP is independent of the choice of the verb.",

        "We will conduct further experiments with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) which considers broader contexts in its probability.",
        "It uses markovization to reduce horizontal context (right hand sides of rules are broken up) and add vertical context (rule probabilities are conditioned on (grand-)parent-node information).",
        "This way, we expect further insights in NeGra’s an T¨uBa-D/Z’s annotation schemes."
