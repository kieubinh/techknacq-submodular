        "In this domain there is little repetition of words and the segmentation cues are weaker than in broadcast news stories, resulting in poor performance from previous methods.",

        "The benefit of generalization using outside resources can be seen by comparing the boundary words found using word groups versus those found only in the training set as in Section 3.",
        "Using word groups triples the number of significant words found in the training set that occur in the test set.",

        "Based on properties of narrative text, we proposed and investigated a set of features for segmenting narrative text.",
        "We posed the problem of segmentation as a feature-based classification problem, which presented a number of challenges: many different feature sources, generalization from outside resources for sparse data, and feature extraction from non-traditional information sources.",
        "Feature selection and analyzing feature interaction is crucial for this type of application.",
        "The paragraph feature has perfect recall in that all boundaries occur at paragraph boundaries.",
        "Surprisingly, for certain train/test splits of the data, the performance of the algorithm was actually better without the paragraph feature than with it.",
        "We hypothesize that the noisiness of the data is causing the classifier to learn incorrect correlations.",
        "In addition to feature selection issues, posing the problem as a classification problem loses the sequential nature of the data.",
        "This can produce very unlikely segment lengths, such as a single sentence.",
        "We alleviated this by selecting features that capture properties of the sequence.",
        "For example, the entity chains features represent some of this type of information.",
        "However, models for complex sequential data should be examined as possible better methods.",
        "We evaluated our algorithm on two books and encyclopedia articles, observing significantly better performance than randomly selecting the correct number of segmentation points, as well as two popular, previous approaches, PLSA and TextTiling."
