        "In this paper, we address the more ambitious task of learning to map sentences to a complete formal meaning-representation language (MRL).",
        "We consider two MRL’s that can be directly used to perform useful, complex tasks.",
        "The first is a Prolog-based language used in a previously-developed corpus of queries to a database on U.S. geography (Zelle and Mooney, 1996).",
        "The second MRL is a coaching language for",
        "robotic soccer developed for the RoboCup Coach Competition, in which AI researchers compete to provide effective instructions to a coachable team of agents in a simulated soccer domain (et al., 2003).",
        "We present an approach based on a statistical parser that generates a semantically augmented parse tree (SAPT), in which each internal node includes both a syntactic and semantic label.",
        "We augment Collins’ head-driven model 2 (Collins, 1997) to incorporate a semantic label on each internal node.",
        "By integrating syntactic and semantic interpretation into a single statistical model and finding the globally most likely parse, an accurate combined syntactic/semantic analysis can be obtained.",
        "Once a SAPT is generated, an additional step is required to translate it into a final formal meaning representation (MR).",
        "Our approach is implemented in a system called SCISSOR (Semantic Composition that Integrates Syntax and Semantics to get Optimal Representations).",
        "Training the system requires sentences annotated with both gold-standard SAPT’s and MR’s.",
        "We present experimental results on corpora for both geography-database querying and Robocup coaching demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches based on symbolic learning (Tang and Mooney, 2001; Kate et al., 2005)."

        "By integrating syntax and semantics in a single statistical parser that produces an SAPT, we can use both semantic information to resolve syntactic ambiguities and syntactic information to resolve semantic ambiguities.",
        "In a SAPT, each internal node in the parse tree is annotated with a semantic label.",
        "Figure 1 shows the SAPT for a simple sentence in the CLANG domain.",
        "The semantic labels which are shown after dashes are concepts in the domain.",
        "Some type concepts do not take arguments, like team and unum (uniform number).",
        "Some concepts, which we refer to as predicates, take an ordered list of arguments, like player and bowner (ball owner).",
        "The predicate-argument knowledge, K, specifies, for each predicate, the semantic constraints on its arguments.",
        "Constraints are specified in terms of the concepts that can fill each argument, such as player(team, unum) and bowner(player).",
        "A special semantic label null is used for nodes that do not correspond to any concept in the domain.",
        "Figure 2 shows the basic algorithm for building an MR from an SAPT.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the",
        "construction of the MR for the SAPT in Figure 1.",
        "Nodes are numbered in the order in which the construction of their MR’s are completed.",
        "The first step, GETSEMANTICHEAD, determines which of a node’s children is its semantic head based on having a matching semantic label.",
        "In the example, node N3 is determined to be the semantic head of the sentence, since its semantic label, bowner, matches N8’s semantic label.",
        "Next, the MR of the semantic head is constructed recursively.",
        "The semantic head of N3 is clearly N1.",
        "Since N1 is a part-of-speech (POS) node, its semantic label directly determines its MR, which becomes bowner( ).",
        "Once the MR for the head is constructed, the MR of all other (non-head) children are computed recursively, and COMPOSEMR assigns their MR’s to fill the arguments in the head’s MR to construct the complete MR for the node.",
        "Argument constraints are used to determine the appropriate filler for each argument.",
        "Since, N2 has a null label, the MR of N3 also becomes bowner( ).",
        "When computing the MR for N7, N4 is determined to be the head with the MR: player( , ).",
        "COMPOSEMR then assigns N5’s MR to fill the team argument and N6’s MR to fill the unum argument to construct N7’s complete MR: player(our, 2).",
        "This MR in turn is composed with the MR for N3 to yield the final MR for the sentence: bowner(player(our,2)).",
        "For MRL’s, such as CLANG, whose syntax does not strictly follow a nested set of predicates and arguments, some final minor syntactic adjustment of the final MR may be needed.",
        "In the example, the final MR is (bowner (player our {2})).",
        "In the following discussion, we ignore the difference between these two.",
        "There are a few complications left which require special handling when generating MR’s, like coordination, anaphora resolution and non-compositionality exceptions.",

        "First, semantic labels for individual words, called semantic tags, are added to the POS nodes in the tree.",

        "Some concepts are conveyed by phrases, like “has the ball” for bowner in the previous example.",
        "Only one word is labeled with the concept; the syntactic head word (Collins, 1997) is preferred.",
        "During parsing, the other words in the phrase will provide context for determining the semantic label of the head word.",
        "Labels are added to the remaining nodes in a bottom-up manner.",
        "For each node, one of its children is chosen as the semantic head, from which it will inherit its label.",
        "The semantic head is chosen as the child whose semantic label can take the MR’s of the other children as arguments.",
        "This step was done mostly automatically, but required some manual corrections to account for unusual cases.",
        "In order for COMPOSEMR to be able to construct the MR for a node, the argument constraints for its semantic head must identify a unique concept to fill each argument.",
        "However, some predicates take multiple arguments of the same type, such as point.num(num,num), which is a kind of point that represents a field coordinate in CLANG.",
        "In this case, extra nodes are inserted in the tree with new type concepts that are unique for each argument.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 4 in which the additional type concepts num1 and num2 are introduced.",
        "Again, during parsing, context will be used to determine the correct type for a given word.",
        "The point label of the root node of Figure 4 is the concept that includes all kinds of points in CLANG.",
        "Once a predicate has all of its arguments filled, we",
        "use the most general CLANG label for its concept (e.g. point instead of point.num).",

        "SCISSOR learns statistical parsers that integrate syntax and semantics in order to produce a semantically augmented parse tree that is then used to compositionally generate a formal meaning representation.",
        "Experimental results in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer, have demonstrated that SCISSOR generally produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches.",
        "By augmenting a state-of-the-art statistical parsing model to include semantic information, it is able to integrate syntactic and semantic clues to produce a robust interpretation that supports the generation of complete formal meaning representations."
