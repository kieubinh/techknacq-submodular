        "Clustering approaches have been widely applied to natural language processing (NLP) problems.",
        "Typically, natural language elements (words, phrases, sentences, etc.)",
        "are partitioned into non-overlapping classes, based on some distance (or similarity) metric defined between them, in order to provide some level of syntactic or semantic abstraction.",
        "A key example is that of class-based language models (Brown et al., 1992; Dagan et al., 1999) where clustering approaches are used in order to partition words, determined to be similar, into sets.",
        "This enables estimating more robust statistics since these are computed over collections of “similar” words.",
        "A large number of different metrics and algorithms have been experimented with these problems (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004).",
        "Similarity between words was also used as a metric in a distributional clustering algorithm in (Pantel and Lin, 2002), and it shows that functionally similar words can be grouped together and even separated to smaller groups based on their senses.",
        "At a",
        "higher level, (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) disambiguated personal names by clustering people’s home pages using a TFIDF similarity, and several other researchers have applied clustering at the same level in the context of the entity identification problem (Bilenko et al., 2003; Mc-Callum and Wellner, 2003; Li et al., 2004).",
        "Similarly, approaches to coreference resolution (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999) use clustering to identify groups of references to the same entity.",
        "Clustering is an optimization procedure that takes as input (1) a collection of domain elements along with (2) a distance metric between them and (3) an algorithm selected to partition the data elements, with the goal of optimizing some form of clustering quality with respect to the given distance metric.",
        "For example, the K-Means clustering approach (Hartigan and Wong, 1979) seeks to maximize a measure of tightness of the resulting clusters based on the Euclidean distance.",
        "Clustering is typically called an unsupervised method, since data elements are used without labels during the clustering process and labels are not used to provide feedback to the optimization process.",
        "E.g., labels are not taken into account when measuring the quality of the partition.",
        "However, in many cases, supervision is used at the application level when determining an appropriate distance metric (e.g., (Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004; Bilenko et al., 2003) and more).",
        "This scenario, however, has several setbacks.",
        "First, the process of clustering, simply a function that partitions a set of elements into different classes, involves no learning and thus lacks flexibility.",
        "Second, clustering quality is typically defined with respect to a fixed distance metric, without utilizing any direct supervision, so the practical clustering outcome could be disparate from one’s intention.",
        "Third, when clustering with a given algorithm and a fixed metric, one in fact makes some implicit assumptions on the data and the task (e.g., (Kamvar et al., 2002); more on that below).",
        "For example, the optimal conditions under which for K-means works are that the data is generated from a uniform mixture of Gaussian models; this may not hold in reality.",
        "This paper proposes a new clustering framework that addresses all the problems discussed above.",
        "Specifically,",
        "we define clustering as a learning task: in the training stage, a partition function, parameterized by a distance metric, is trained with respect to a specific clustering algorithm, with supervision.",
        "Some of the distinct properties of this framework are that: (1) The training stage is formalized as an optimization problem in which a partition function is learned in a way that minimizes a clustering error.",
        "(2) The clustering error is well-defined and driven by feedback from labeled data.",
        "(3) Training a distance metric with respect to any given clustering algorithm seeks to minimize the clustering error on training data that, under standard learning theory assumptions, can be shown to imply small error also in the application stage.",
        "(4) We develop a general learning algorithm that can be used to learn an expressive distance metric over the feature space (e.g., it can make use of kernels).",
        "While our approach makes explicit use of labeled data, we argue that, in fact, many clustering applications in natural language also exploit this information off-line, when exploring which metrics are appropriate for the task.",
        "Our framework makes better use of this resource by incorporating it directly into the metric training process; training is driven by true clustering error, computed via the specific algorithm chosen to partition the data.",
        "We study this new framework empirically on the entity identification problem – identifying whether different mentions of real world entities, such as “JFK” and “John Kennedy”, within and across text documents, actually represent the same concept (McCallum and Well-ner, 2003; Li et al., 2004).",
        "Our experimental results exhibit a significant performance improvement over existing approaches (20% – 30% F1 error reduction) on all three types of entities we study, and indicate its promising prospective in other natural language tasks.",
        "The rest of this paper discusses existing clustering approaches (Sec.",
        "2) and then introduces our Supervised Discriminative Clustering framework (SDC) (Sec.",

A distance (equivalently, a similarity) function d that measures the proximity between two elements is a pairwise function X x X – > R+, which can be parameterized to represent a family of functions – metric properties are not discussed in this paper.",

        "A good metric is one in which close proximity correlates well with the likelihood of being in the same class.",
        "When applying clustering to some task, people typically decide on the clustering quality measure qS (h) they want to optimize, and then chose a specific clustering algorithm A and a distance metric d to generate a ‘good’ partition function h. However, it is clear that without any supervision, the resulting function is not guaranteed to agree with the target function p (or one’s original intention).",
        "Given this realization, there has been some work on selecting a good distance metric for a family of related problems and on learning a metric for specific tasks.",
        "For the former, the focus is on developing and selecting good distance (similarity) metrics that reflect well pairwise proximity between domain elements.",
        "The “goodness” of a metric is empirically measured when combined with different clustering algorithms on different problems.",
        "For example (Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004) compare similarity metrics such as the Cosine, Manhattan and Euclidean distances, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Jaccard’s Coefficient, that could be applied in general clustering tasks, on the task of measuring distributional similarity.",

        "overall, the best-performing method is a hybrid scheme (SoftTFIDF) combining a TFIDF weighting scheme of tokens with the Jaro-Winkler string-distance scheme that is widely used for record linkage in databases.",
        "Moreover, it is not clear whether there exists any universal metric that is good for many different problems (or even different data sets for similar problems) and is appropriate for any clustering algorithm.",
        "For the word-based distributional similarity mentioned above, this point was discussed in (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) when it is shown that proximity metrics that are appropriate for class-based language models may not be appropriate for other tasks.",

        "The reason that SDC can outperform existing clustering approaches can be explained by the advantages of SDC – training the distance function with respect to the chosen clustering algorithm, guided by supervision, but they do not explain why it can also outperform the pairwise classifiers.",
        "One intuitive explanation is that supervision in the entity identification task or similar tasks is typically given on whether two names correspond to the same entity – entity-level annotation.",

        "However, with features that only capture the appearance similarity between names, such apparently different names become training noise.",
        "This is what exactly happened when we train the LMR classifier with such name pairs.",
        "SDC, however, can employ this entity-level annotation and avoid the problem through transitivity in clustering.",
