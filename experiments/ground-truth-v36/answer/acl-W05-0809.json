        "The task of word alignment consists of finding correspondences between words and phrases in parallel texts.",
        "Assuming a sentence aligned bilingual corpus in languages L1 and L2, the task of a word alignment system is to indicate which word token in the corpus of language L1 corresponds to which word token in the corpus of language L2.",

        "However, the current edition is distinct in that it has a focus on languages with scarce resources.",
        "Participating teams were provided with training and test data for three language pairs, accounting for different levels of data scarceness: (1) English –Inuktitut (2 million words training data), (2) Romanian –English (1 million words), and (3) English –Hindi (60,000 words).",
        "Similar to the previous word alignment evaluation and with the Machine Translation evaluation exercises organized by NIST, two different subtasks were defined: (1) Limited resources, where systems were allowed to use only the resources provided.",
        "(2) Unlimited resources, where systems were allowed to use any resources in addition to those provided.",
        "Such resources had to be explicitly mentioned in the system description.",

        "Participating teams were asked to produce word alignments, following a common format as specified below, and submit their output by a certain deadline.",

        "In the graphs, systems are ordered based on their AER scores.",
        "System names are preceded by a marker to indicate the system type: L stands for Limited Resources, and U stands for Unlimited Resources.",
        "While each participating system was unique, there were a few unifying themes.",
        "Several teams had approaches that relied (to varying degrees) on an IBM model of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), with different improvements brought by different teams, consisting of new submodels, improvements in the HMM model, model combination for optimal alignment, etc.",
        "Several teams used symmetrization metrics, as introduced in (Och and Ney, 2003) (union, intersection, refined), most of the times applied on the alignments produced for the two directions source–target and target–source, but also as a way to combine different word alignment systems.",
        "Significant improvements with respect to baseline word alignment systems were observed when the vocabulary was reduced using simple stemming techniques, which seems to be a particularly effective technique given the data sparseness problems associated with the relatively small amounts of training data.",
        "In the unlimited resources subtask, systems made use of bilingual dictionaries, human–contributed word alignments, or syntactic constraints derived from a dependency parse tree applied on the English side of the corpus.",
        "When only small amounts of parallel corpora were available (i.e. the English–Hindi subtask), the use of additional resources resulted in absolute improvements of up to 20% as compared to the case when the word alignment systems were based exclusively on the parallel texts.",
        "Interestingly, this was not the case for the language pairs that had larger training corpora (i.e. Romanian –English, English–Inuktitut), where the limited resources systems seemed to lead to comparable or sometime even better results than those that relied on unlimited resources.",
        "This suggests",
        "that the use of additional resources does not seem to contribute to improvements in word alignment quality when enough parallel corpora are available, but they can make a big difference when only small amounts of parallel texts are available.",
        "Finally, in a comparison across language pairs, the best results are obtained in the English–Inuktitut task, followed by Romanian–English, and by English– Hindi, which corresponds to the ordering of the sizes of the training data sets.",
        "This is not surprising since, like many other NLP tasks, word alignment seems to highly benefit from large amounts of training data, and thus better results are obtained when larger training data sets are available."
