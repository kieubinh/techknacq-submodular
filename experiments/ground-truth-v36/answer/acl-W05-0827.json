        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is based on the assumption that every sentence e in the target language is a possible translation of a given sentence f in the source language.",
        "The main difference between two possible translations of a given sentence is a probability assigned to each, which has to be learned from a bilingual text corpus.",
        "Thus, the translation of a source sentence f can be formulated as the search of the target sentence e that maximizes the translation probability P(elf),",
        "OThis work has been supported by the European Union under grant FP6-506738 (TC-STAR project).",
        "If we use Bayes rule to reformulate the translation probability, we obtain,",
        "This translation model is known as the source-channel approach [1] and it consists on a language model P(e) and a separate translation model P(fIe) [5].",
        "In the last few years, new systems tend to use sequences of words, commonly called phrases [8], aiming at introducing word context in the translation model.",
        "As alternative to the source-channel approach the decision rule can be modeled through a log-linear maximum entropy framework.",
        "The features functions, h,., are the system models (translation model, language model and others) and weigths, Ai, are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function.",
        "It is derived from the Maximum Entropy approach suggested by [13] [14] for a natural language understanding task.",
        "It has the advantatge that additional features functions can be easily integrated in the overall system.",
        "This paper addresses a modification of the phrase-extraction algorythm in [11].",
        "It also combines several interesting features and it reports an important improvement from the baseline.",
        "It is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the baseline; the following section explains the modification in the phrase extraction; section 4 shows the different features which have been taken into account; section 5 presents the evaluation framework; and",

        "It is based on bilingual phrases, where a bilingual phrase (BP) is simply two monolingual phrases (MP) in which each one is supposed to be the translation of each other.",
        "A monolingual phrase is a sequence of words.",
        "Therefore, the basic idea of phrase-based translation is to segment the given source sentence into phrases, then translate each phrase and finally compose the target sentence from these phrase translations [17].",
        "During training, the system has to learn a dictionary of phrases.",
        "We begin by aligning the training corpus using GIZA++ [6], which is done in both translation directions.",
        "We take the union of both alignments to obtain a symmetrized word alignment matrix.",
        "This alignment matrix is the starting point for the phrase based extraction.",
        "Next, we define the criterion to extract the set of BP of the sentence pair (fjji ; eii) and the alignment matrix A C_ J*I, which is identical to the alignment criterion described in [11].",

        "At least one word in the foreign language phrase has to be aligned with at least one word of the English language.",
