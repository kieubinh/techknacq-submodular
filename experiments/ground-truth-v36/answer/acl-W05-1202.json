        "This work explores computing distributional similarity between sub-parses, i.e., fragments of a parse tree, as an extension to general lexical distributional similarity techniques.",
        "In the same way that lexical distributional similarity is used to estimate lexical semantic similarity, we propose using distributional similarity between sub-parses to estimate the semantic similarity of phrases.",
        "Such a technique will allow us to identify paraphrases where the component words are not semantically similar.",
        "We demonstrate the potential of the method by applying it to a small number of examples and showing that the paraphrases are more similar than the non-paraphrases."

        "An expression is said to textually entail another expression if the meaning of the second expression can be inferred from the meaning of the first.",
        "For example, the sentence “London is an English city,” textually entails the sentence “London is in England.” As discussed by Dagan et al.",
        "(2005) in their introduction to the first Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge, identifying textual entailment can be seen as a subtask of a variety of other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "For example, Question Answering (QA) can be cast as finding an answer which is entailed by the proposition in the question.",
        "Other identified tasks include summarization, paraphrasing, Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Translation (MT).",
        "The Natural Habitats (NatHab) project' (Weeds et al., 2004; Owen et al., 2005) provides an interesting setting in which to study paraphrase and tex",
        "tual entailment recognition as a tool for natural language understanding.",
        "The aim of the project is to enable non-technical users to configure their pervasive computing environments.",
        "They do this by stating policies in natural language which describe how they wish their environment to behave.",
        "For example, a user, who wishes to restrict the use of their colour printer to the printing of colour documents, might have as a policy, “Never print black-and-white documents on my colour printer.” Similarly, a user, who wishes to be alerted by email when their mobile phone battery is low, might have as a policy, “If my mobile phone battery is low then send me an email.” The natural language understanding task is to interpret the user’s utterance with reference to a set of policy templates and an ontology of services (e.g. print) and concepts (e.g. document).",
        "The use of policy templates and an ontology restricts the number of possible meanings that a user can express.",
        "However, there is still considerable variability in the way these policies can be expressed.",
        "Simple variations on the theme of the second policy above include, “Send me an email whenever my mobile phone battery is low,” and “If the charge on my mobile phone is low then email me.” Our approach is to tackle the interpretation problem by identifying parts of expressions that are paraphrases of those expressions whose interpretation with respect to the ontology is more directly encoded.",
        "Here, we investigate extending distributional similarity methods from words to sub-parses.",
        "The rest of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss the background to our work.",
        "We consider the limitations of an approach based on lexical similarity and syntactic templates, which motivates us to look directly at the similarity of larger units.",

      "text": [
        "One well-studied approach to the identification of paraphrases is to employ a lexical similarity function.",
        "As noted by Barzilay and Elhadad (2003), even a lexical function that simply computes word overlap can accurately select paraphrases.",
        "The problem with such a function is not in the accuracy of the paraphrases selected, but in its low recall.",
        "One popular way of improving recall is to relax the requirement for words in each sentence to be identical in form, to being identical or similar in meaning.",
        "Methods to find the semantic similarity of two words can be broadly split into those which use lexical resources, e.g., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and those which use a distributional similarity measure (see Weeds (2003) for a review of distributional similarity measures).",
        "Both Jijkoun and deRijke (2005) and Herrara et al.",
        "(2005) show how such a measure of lexical semantic similarity might be incorporated into a system for recognising textual entailment between sentences.",
        "Previous work on the NatHab project (Weeds et al., 2004) used such an approach to extend lexical coverage.",
        "Each of the user’s uttered words was mapped to a set of candidate words in a core lexicon3, identified using a measure of distributional similarity.",
        "For example, the word send is used when talking about printing or about emailing, and a good measure of lexical similarity would identify both of these conceptual services as candidates.",
        "The best choice of candidate was then chosen by optimising the match between grammatical dependency relations and paths in the ontology over the entire sentence.",
        "For example, an indirect-object relation between the verb send and a printer can be mapped to the path in the ontology relating a print request to its target printer.",
        "As well as lexical variation, our previous work (Weeds et al., 2004) allowed a certain amount of syntactic variation via its use of grammatical dependencies and policy templates.",
        "For example, the passive “paraphrase” of a sentence can be identified by comparing the sets of grammatical dependency relations produced by a shallow parser such as the RASP",
        "parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 1995).",
        "In other words, by looking at grammatical dependency relations, we can identify that “John is liked by Mary,” is a paraphrase of “Mary likes John,” and not of “John likes Mary.” Further, where there is a limited number of styles of sentence, we can manually identify and list other templates for matches over the trees or sets of dependency relations.",
        "For example, “If C1 then C2” is the same as “C2 if C1”.",
        "However, the limitations of this approach, which combines lexical variation, grammatical dependency relations and template matching, become increasingly obvious as one tries to scale up.",
        "As noted by Herrera (2005), similarity at the word level is not required for similarity at the phrasal level.",
        "For example, in the context of our project, the phrases “if my mobile phone needs charging” and “if my mobile phone battery is low” have the same intended meaning but it is not possible to obtain the second by making substitutions for similar words in the first.",
        "It appears that “X needs charging” and “battery (of X) is low” have roughly similar meanings without their component words having similar meanings.",
        "Further, this does not appear to be due to either phrase being non-compositional.",
        "As noted by Pearce (2001), it is not possible to substitute similar words within non-compositional collocations.",
        "In this case, however, both phrases appear to be compositional.",
        "Words cannot be substituted between the two phrases because they are composed in different ways."

      "heading": "3 Proposal",
      "text": [
        "Recently, there has been much interest in finding words which are distributionally similar e.g., Lin (1998), Lee (1999), Curran and Moens (2002), Weeds (2003) and Geffet and Dagan (2004).",
        "Two words are said to be distributionally similar if they appear in similar contexts.",
        "For example, the two words apple and pear are likely to be seen as the objects of the verbs eat and peel, and this adds to their distributional similarity.",
        "The Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1968) proposes a connection between distributional similarity and semantic similarity, which is the basis for a large body of work on automatic thesaurus construction using distributional similarity methods (Curran and Moens, 2002; Weeds, 2003; Geffet and Dagan, 2004).",
        "Our proposal is that just as words have distributional similarity which can be used, with at least some success, to estimate semantic similarity, so do larger units of expression.",
        "We propose that the unit of interest is a sub-parse, i.e., a fragment (connected subgraph) of a parse tree, which can range in size from a single word to the parse for the entire sentence.",
        "Figure 1 shows the parses for the clauses, “my mobile phone needs charging,” and “my mobile phone battery is low” and highlights the fragments (“needs charging” and “battery is low”) for which we might be interested in finding similarity.",
        "In our model, we define the features or contexts of a sub-parse to be the grammatical relations between any component of the sub-parse and any word outside of the sub-parse.",
        "In the example above, both sub-parses would have features based on their grammatical relation with the word phone.",
        "The level of granularity at which to consider grammatical relations remains a matter for investigation.",
        "For example, it might turn out to be better to distinguish between all types of dependent or, alternatively, it might be better to have a single class which covers all dependents.",
        "We also consider the parents of the sub-parse as features.",
        "In the example, “Send me an email if my mobile phone battery is low,” this would be that the sub-parse modifies the verb send i.e., it has the feature, <mod-of, send>.",
        "Having defined these models for the unit of interest, the sub-parse, and for the context of a sub-parse, we can build up co-occurrence vectors for sub-parses in the same way as for words.",
        "A co-occurrence vector is a conglomeration (with frequency counts) of all of the co-occurrences of the target unit found in a corpus.",
        "The similarity between two such vectors or descriptions can then be found using a standard distributional similarity measure (see Weeds (2003)).",
        "The use of distributional evidence for larger units than words is not new.",
        "Szpektor et al.",
        "(2004) automatically identify anchors in web corpus data.",
        "Anchors are lexical elements that describe the context of a sentence and if words are found to occur with the same set of anchors, they are assumed to be paraphrases.",
        "For example, the anchor set {Mozart, 1756} is a known anchor set for verbs with the meaning “born in”.",
        "However, this use of distributional evidence requires both anchors, or contexts, to occur simultaneously with the target word.",
        "This differs from the standard notion of distributional similarity which involves finding similarity between co-occurrence vectors, where there is no requirement for two features or contexts to occur simulultaneously.",
        "Our work with distributional similarity is a generalisation of the approach taken by Lin and Pantel (2001).",
        "These authors apply the distributional similarity principle to paths in a parse tree.",
        "A path exists between two words if there are grammatical relations connecting them in a sentence.",
        "For example, in the sentence “John found a solution to the problem,” there is a path between “found” and “solution” because solution is the direct object of found.",
        "Contexts of this path, in this sentence, are then the grammatical relations <ncsubj, John> and <iobj, problem> because these are grammatical relations associated with either end of the path.",
        "In their work on QA, Lin and Pantel restrict the grammatical relations considered to two “slots” at either end of the path where the word occupying the slot is a noun.",
        "Co-occurrence vectors for paths are then built up using evidence from multiple occurrences of the paths in corpus data, for which similarity can then be calculated using a standard metric (e.g., Lin (1998)).",
        "In our work, we extend the notion of distributional similarity from linear paths to trees.",
        "This allows us to compute distributional similarity for any part of an expression, of arbitrary length and complexity (although, in practice, we are still limited by data sparseness).",
        "Further, we do not make any restrictions as to the number or types of the grammatical relation contexts associated with a tree."

        "Practically demonstrating our proposal requires a source of paraphrases.",
        "We first looked at the MSR paraphrase corpus (Dolan et al., 2004) since it contains a large number of sentences close enough in meaning to be considered paraphrases.",
        "However, inspection of the data revealed that the lexical overlap between the pairs of paraphrasing sentences in this corpus is very high.",
        "The average word overlap (i.e., the proportion of exactly identical word forms) calculated over the sentences paired by humans in the training set is 0.70, and the lowest overlap' for such sentences is 0.3.",
        "This high word overlap makes this a poor source of examples for us, since we wish to study similarity between phrases which do not share semantically similar words.",
        "Consequently, for our purposes, the Pascal Textual Entailment Recognition Challenge dataset is a more suitable source of paraphrase data.",
        "Here the average word overlap between textually entailing sentences is 0.39 and the lowest overlap is 0.",
        "This allows us to easily find pairs of sub-parses which do not share similar words.",
        "For example, in paraphrase pair id.",
        "19, we can see that “reduce the risk of diseases” entails “has health benefits”.",
        "Similarly in pair id.20, “may keep your blood glucose from rising too fast” entails “improves blood sugar control,” and in id.570, “charged in the death of” entails “accused of having killed.” In this last example there is semantic similarity between the words used.",
        "The word charged is semantically similar to accused.",
        "However, it is not possible to swap the two words in these contexts since we do not say “charged of having killed.” Further, there is an obvious semantic connection between the words death and killed, but being different parts of speech this would be easily missed by traditional distributional methods.",
        "Consequently, in order to demonstrate the potential of our method, we have taken the phrases “reduce the risk of diseases”, “has health benefits”, “charged in the death of” and “accused of having killed”, constructed corpora for the phrases and their components and then computed distributional similarity between pairs of phrases and their respective components.",
        "Under our hypotheses, paraphrases will be more similar than non-paraphrases and there will be no clear relation between the similarity of phrases as a whole and the similarity of their components.",

        "First, a feature extractor is run over each parsed corpus file to extract occurrences of the sub-parse and their features.",
        "The feature extractor reads in a template for each phrase in the form of dependency relations over lemmas.",
        "It checks each sentence parse against the template (taking care that the same word form is indeed the same occurrence of the word in the sentence).",
        "When a match is found, the other grammatical relations5 for each word in the sub-parse are output as features.",
        "When the sub-parse is only a word, the process is simplified to finding grammatical relations containing that word.",

        "Table 1 shows the number of feature types and tokens extracted for each phrase.",

        "In conclusion, it is clear that components of phrases do not need to be semantically similar for the encompassing phrases to be semantically similar.",
        "Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques which estimate the semantic similarity of two phrases directly rather than combining similarity scores calculated for pairs of words.",
        "Our approach is to find the distributional similarity of the sub-parses associated with phrases by extending general techniques for finding lexical distributional similarity.",
        "We have illustrated this method for examples, showing how data sparseness can be overcome using the web.",
        "We have shown that finding the distributional similarity between phrases, as outlined here, may have potential in identifying paraphrases.",
        "In our examples, the distributional similarities of paraphrases was higher than non-paraphrases.",
        "However, obviously, more extensive evaluation of the technique is required before drawing more definite conclusions.",
        "In this respect, we are currently in the process of developing a gold standard set of similar phrases from the Pascal Textual Entailment Chal-charged in the death of has health benefits 6.04 charged in has 5.54 the death of health benefits 4.70 reduce the risk of diseases accused of having killed 6.09 reduce accused of 5.77 the risk of diseases having killed 6.31 lenge dataset.",
        "This task is not trivial since, even though pairs of sentences are already identified as potential paraphrases, it is still necessary to extract pairs of phrases which convey roughly the same meaning.",
        "This is because 1) some pairs of sentences are almost identical in word content and 2) some pairs of sentences are quite distant in meaning similarity.",
        "Further, it is also desirable to classify extracted pairs of paraphrases as to whether they are lexical, syntactic, semantic or inferential in nature.",
        "Whilst lexical (e.g. “to gather” is similar to “to collect”) and syntactic (e.g. “Cambodian sweatshop” is equivalent to “sweatshop in Cambodia”) are of interest, our aim is to extend lexical techniques to the semantic level (e.g. “X won presidential election” is similar to “X became president”).",
        "Once our analysis is complete, the data will be used to evaluate variations on the technique proposed herein and also to compare it empirically to other techniques such as that of Lin and Pantel (2001)."
