        "Recently, many researchers have focused their interest on statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, with particular attention given to models and",

        "The quantity of the training corpus has received less attention, although of course the earlier reports do address the quantity issue.",
        "In most cases, the larger the training corpus becomes, the higher accuracy is achieved.",
        "Usually, the quantity problem of the training corpus is discussed in relation to the size of the training corpus and system performance; therefore, researchers study line graphs that indicate the relationship between accuracy and training corpus size.",
        "On the other hand, needless to say, a single sentence in the source language can be used to translate several sentences in the target language.",
        "Such various possibilities for translation make MT system development and evaluation very difficult.",
        "Consequently, here we employ multiple references to evaluate MT systems like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002).",
        "Moreover, such variations in translation have a negative effect on training in SMT because when several sentences of input-side language are translated into the exactly equivalent output-side sentences, the probability of correct translation decreases due to the large number of possible pairs of expressions.",
        "Therefore, if we can restrain or modify the training corpus, the SMT system might achieve high accuracy.",
        "As an example of modification, different output-side sentences paired with the exactly equivalent input-side sentences are replaced with one target sentence.",
        "These sentence replacements are required for synonymous sentence sets.",

        "Initially, BTEC data were created from pairs of Japanese and English sentences in the travel domain.",
        "Japanese-English translation pairs have variation as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "However, when Chinese data was translated, BTEC was controlled so that the same Japanese sentence has only one Chinese sentence.",
        "Accordingly, there is no variation in Chinese sentences for the pair with the same Japanese sentence.",
        "Therefore, the original training data would be similar to the situation of replacing Chinese.",
        "Moreover, replacing the Japanese data was almost to the same as replacing both sets of data.",
        "Considering this feature of the training corpus, i.e. the results for the CJ/JC system based on the group with JC language pairs, there are few differences between keeping the original data and replacing the Chinese data, or between replacing both side’s data and replacing only the Japanese data.",
        "These results demonstrate the correctness of the hypothesis that reducing the input side’s language variation makes learning models more effective.",
        "Currently, our modifications only roughly process sentence pairs, though the process of making groups is very simple.",
        "Sometimes a group may include sentences or words that have slightly different meanings, such as.",

        "In this case if we select tesagebukuro from the Japanese side and “paper bag” from the English side, we have an incorrect word pair in the translation model.",
        "To handle such a problem, we would have to arrange a method to select the sentences from a group.",

        "(2003).",
        "As one solution to this problem, we borrowed the measures of literalness, context freedom, and word translation stability in the sentence-selection process.",
        "In some cases, the group includes sentences with different meanings, and this problem was mentioned in Kashioka (2004).",
