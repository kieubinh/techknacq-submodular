        "Unification parsers have problems with efficiency and selecting the best parse.",
        "Lexically-conditioned statistics as used by Collins (1999) may provide a solution.",
        "They have been used in three ways: as a postprocess for parse selection (Toutanova et al., 2005; Riezler et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2002), a preprocess to find more probable bracketing structures (Swift et al., 2004), and online to rank each constituent produced, as in Tsuruoka et al.",
        "(2004) and this experiment.",
        "The TRIPS parser (Allen et al., 1996) is a unification parser using an HPSG-inspired grammar and hand-tuned weights for each rule.",
        "In our augmented system (Aug-TRIPS), we replaced these weights with a lexically-conditioned model based on the adaptation of Collins used by Bikel (2002), allowing more efficiency and (in some cases) better selection.",
        "Aug-TRIPS retains the same grammar and lexicon as TRIPS, but uses its statistical model to determine the order in which unifications are attempted."

        "We tested bracketing accuracy on the Monroe corpus (Stent, 2001), which contains collaborative emergency-management dialogues.",
        "Aug-TRIPS is comparable to TRIPS in accuracy, but produces fewer constituents (Table 1).",
        "The Bikel parser has slightly higher precision/recall than either TRIPS or Aug-TRIPS, since it can choose any bracketing structure regardless of semantic coherence, while the TRIPS systems must find a legal pattern of feature unifications.",
        "Aug-TRIPS also has better precision/recall when parsing the longer sentences (Table 2).",
        "Since our motivation for unification parsing is to reveal semantics as well as syntax, we next evaluated Aug-TRIPS’s production of correct interpretations at the sentence level, which require complete correctness not only of the bracketing structure but of the sense chosen for each word and the thematic",

        "For this task, we modified the probability model to condition on the senses in our lexicon rather than words.",
        "For instance, the words “two thousand dollars” are replaced with the senses “number number-unit money-unit”.",
        "This allows us to model lexical disambiguation explicitly.",
        "The model generates one or more senses from each word with probability P(senselword, tag), and then uses sense statistics rather than word statistics in all other calculations.",
        "Similar but more complex models were used in the PCFG-sem model of Toutanova et al.",
        "(2005) and using WordNet senses in Bikel (2000).",
        "We used the Projector dialogues (835 sentences), which concern purchasing video projectors.",
        "In this domain, Aug-TRIPS makes about 10% more interpretation errors than TRIPS (Table 3), but when parsing sentences on which TRIPS itself makes errors, it can correct about 10% (Table 4)."
