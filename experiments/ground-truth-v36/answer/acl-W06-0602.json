        "The volume of biomedical literature available on the Web has grown enormously in recent years, a trend that will probably continue indefinitely.",
        "Thus, the ability to process literature automatically would be invaluable for both the design and interpretation of large-scale experiments.",
        "To this end, several information extraction (IE) systems using natural language processing techniques have been developed for use in the biomedical field.",
        "Currently, the focus of IE is shifting from the extraction of nominal information, such as named entities (NEs) to verbal information that represents the relations between NEs, e.g., events and function (Tateisi et al., 2004; Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004).",
        "In the IE of relations, the roles of NEs participating in a relation must be identified along with a verb of interest.",
        "This task involves identifying main roles, such as agents and objects, and adjunct roles (ArgM), such as location, manner, timing, condition, and extent.",
        "This identification task is called semantic role labeling (SRL).",
        "The corresponding roles of the verb (predicate) are called predicate arguments, and the whole proposition is known as a predicate argument structure (PAS).",
        "To develop an automatic SRL system for the biomedical domain, it is necessary to train the system with an annotated corpus, called proposition bank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "This corpus contains annotations of semantic PAS’s superimposed on the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "However, the process of manually annotating the PAS’s to construct a proposition bank is quite time-consuming.",
        "In addition, due to the complexity of proposition bank annotation, inconsistent annotation may occur frequently and further complicate"

        "In this paper, we present a semi-automatic approach for annotating semantic information in biomedical texts.",

        "Like PropBank in the newswire domain, BioProp contains annotations of predicate argument structures and semantic roles in a treebank schema.",
        "To construct BioProp, a semantic role labeling (SRL) system trained on PropBank is used to annotate BioProp.",
        "Incorrect tagging results are then corrected by human annotators.",
        "To suit the needs in the biomedical domain, we modify the PropBank annotation guidelines and characterize semantic roles as components of biological events.",
        "The method can substantially reduce annotation efforts, and we introduce a measure of an upper bound for the saving of annotation efforts.",
        "Thus far, the method has been applied experimentally to a 4,389-sentence treebank corpus for the construction of BioProp.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement measured by kappa statistic reaches .95 for combined decision of role identification and classification when all argument labels are considered.",
        "In addition, we show that, when trained on BioProp, our biomedical SRL system called BIOSMILE achieves an F-score of 87%.",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics the annotation task.",
        "In spite of the above difficulties, there are proposition banks in the newswire domain that are adequate for training SRL systems (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, according to the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005), the performance of SRL systems in general does not decline significantly when tagging out-of-domain corpora.",
        "For example, when SRL systems trained on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus were used to tag the Brown corpus, the performance only dropped by 15%, on average.",
        "In comparison to annotating from scratch, annotation efforts based on the results of an available SRL system are much reduced.",
        "Thus, we plan to use a newswire SRL system to tag a biomedical corpus and then manually revise the tagging results.",
        "This semi-automatic procedure could expedite the construction of a biomedical proposition bank for use in training a biomedical SRL system in the future."
