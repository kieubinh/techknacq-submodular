        "Collocations are understood in this paper as “idiosyncratic syntagmatic combination of lexical items” (Fontenelle, 1992, 222): heavy rain, light breeze, great dif�culty, grow steadily, meet requirement, reach consensus, pay attention, ask a question.",
        "Unlike idioms (kick the bucket, lend a hand, pull someone’s leg), their meaning is fairly transparent and easy to decode.",
        "Yet, differently from the regular productions, (big house, cultural activity, read a book), collocational expressions are highly idiosyncratic, since the lexical items a headword combines with in order to express a given meaning is contingent upon that word (Mel’�cuk, 2003).",
        "This is apparent when comparing a collocation’s equivalents across different languages.",
        "The English collocation ask a question translates as poser une question in French (lit., ?put a question), and as fare una domanda, hacer una pregunta in Italian and Spanish (lit., to make a question).",
        "As it has been pointed out by many researchers (Cruse, 1986; Benson, 1990; McKeown and Radev, 2000), collocations cannot be described by means of general syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "They are arbitrary and unpredictable, and therefore need to be memorized and used as such.",
        "They constitute the so-called “semi-finished products” of language (Hausmann, 1985) or the “islands of reliability” (Lewis, 2000) on which the speakers build their utterances."

      "heading": "2 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "The key importance of collocations in text production tasks such as machine translation and natural language generation has been stressed many times.",
        "It has been equally shown that collocations are useful in a range of other applications, such as word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991) and parsing (Alshawi and Carter, 1994).",
        "The NLP community fully acknowledged the need for an appropriate treatment of multi-word expressions in general (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Collocations are particularly important because of their prevalence in language, regardless of the domain or genre.",
        "According to Jackendoff (1997, 156) and Mel’�cuk (1998, 24), collocations constitute the bulk of a language’s lexicon.",
        "The last decades have witnessed a considerable development of collocation extraction techniques, that concern both monolingual and (parallel) multilingual corpora.",
        "We can mention here only part of this work: (Berry-Rogghe, 1973; Church et al., 1989; Smadja, 1993; Lin, 1998; Krenn and Evert, 2001) for monolingual extraction, and (Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1994; Smadja et al., 1996; Kitamura and Mat",
        "sumoto, 1996; Melamed, 1997) for bilingual extraction via alignment.",
        "Traditionally, collocation extraction was considered a language-independent task.",
        "Since collocations are recurrent, typical lexical combinations, a wide range of statistical methods based on word co-occurrence frequency have been heavily used for detecting them in text corpora.",
        "Among the most often used types of lexical association measures (henceforth AMs) we mention: statistical hypothesis tests (e.g., binomial, Poisson, Fisher, z-score, chi-squared, t-score, and log-likelihood ratio tests), that measure the significance of the association between two words based on a contingency table listing their joint and marginal frequency, and Information-theoretic measures (Mutual Information – henceforth MI – and its variants), that quantity of ‘information’ shared by two random variables.",
        "A detailed review of the statistical methods employed in collocation extraction can be found, for instance, in (Evert, 2004).",
        "A comprehensive list of AMs is given (Pecina, 2005).",
        "Very often, in addition to the information on co-occurrence frequency, language-specific information is also integrated in a collocation extraction system (as it will be seen in section 3): - morphological information, in order to count inflected word forms as instances of the same base form.",
        "For instance, ask questions, asks question, asked question are all instances of the same word pair, ask - question; - syntactic information, in order to recognize a word pair even if subject to (complex) syntactic transformations: ask multiple questions, question asked, questions that one might ask.",
        "The language-specific modules thus aim at coping with the problem of morphosyntactic variation, in order to improve the accuracy of frequency information.",
        "This becomes truly important especially for free-word order and for high-inflection languages, for which the token(form)-based frequency figures become too skewed due to the high lexical dispersion.",
        "Not only the data scattering modify the frequency numbers used by AMs, but it also alters the performance of AMs, if the the probabilities in the contingency table become very low.",
        "Morphosyntactic information has in fact been shown to significantly improve the extraction results (Breidt, 1993; Smadja, 1993; Zajac et al., 2003).",
        "Morphological tools such as lemmatizers and POS taggers are being commonly used in extraction systems; they are employed both for dealing with text variation and for validating the candidate pairs: combinations of function words are typically ruled out (Justeson and Katz, 1995), as are the ungrammatical combinations in the systems that make use of parsers (Church and Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Basili et al., 1994; Lin, 1998; Goldman et al., 2001; Seretan et al., 2004).",
        "Given the motivations for performing a linguistically-informed extraction – which were also put forth, among others, by Church and Hanks (1990, 25), Smadja (1993, 151) and Heid (1994) – and given the recent development of linguistic analysis tools, it seems plausible that the linguistic structure will be more and more taken into account by collocation extraction systems.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 3 we provide a language-oriented review of the existing collocation extraction work.",
        "Then we highlight, in section 4, a series of problems that arise in the transfer of methodology to a new language, and we propose a strategy for dealing with them.",
        "Section 5 describes an extraction system, and, finally, section 6 presents a case-study on the collocations extracted for four languages, illustrating the cross-lingual variation in the performance of a particular AM."

        "As the previous section showed, many systems of collocation extraction rely on the linguistic preprocessing of source corpora in order to support the candidate identification process.",
        "Language-specific information, such as the one derived from morphological and syntactic analysis, was shown to be highly beneficial for extraction.",
        "Moreover, the possibility to apply the association measures on syntactically homogenous material is argued to benefit extraction, as the performance of association measures might vary with the syntactic configurations because of the differences in distribution (Krenn and Evert, 2001).",
        "The lexical distribution is therefore a relevant issue from the perspective of multilingual collocation extraction.",
        "Different languages show different proportions of lexical categories (N, V, A, Adv, P, etc.)",
        "which are evenly distributed across syntactic types 3.",
        "Depending on the frequency numbers, a given AM could be more suited for a specific syntactic configuration in one language, and less suited for the same configuration in another.",
        "Ideally, each language should be assigned a suitable set of AMs to be applied on syntactically-homogenous data.",
        "Another issue that is relevant in the multilingualism perspective is that of the syntactic configurations characterizing collocations.",
        "Several such relations (e.g., noun-adjectival modifier, predicate-argument) are likely to remain constant through languages, i.e., to be judged as colloca-tionally interesting in many languages.",
        "However,",
        "other configurations could be language-specific (like P-N-V in German, whose English equivalent is V-P-N).",
        "Yet other configurations might have no counterpart at all in another language (e.g., the French PA pair a` neuf is translated into English as a Conj-A pair, as new).",
        "Finding all the collocationally-relevant syntactic types for a language is therefore another problem that has to be solved in multilingual extraction.",
        "Since a priori defining these types based on intuition does not ensure the necessary coverage, an alternative proposal is to induce them from POS data and dependency relations, as in (Seretan, 2005).",
        "The morphoyntactic differences between languages also have to be taken into account.",
        "With English as the most investigated language, several hypotheses were put forth in extraction and became common place.",
        "For instance, using a 5-words window as search space for collocation pairs is a usual practice, since this span length was shown sufficient to cover a high percentage of syntactic co-occurrences in English.",
        "But – as suggested by other researchers, e.g., (Goldman et al., 2001) – , this assumption does not necessary hold for other languages.",
        "Similarly, the higher inflection and the higher transformation potential shown by some languages pose additional problems in extraction, which were rather ignored for English.",
        "As Kim et al.",
        "(1999) notice, collocation extraction is particularly difficult in free-order languages like Korean, where arguments scramble freely.",
        "Breidt (1993) also pointed out a couple of problems that makes extraction for German more difficult than for English: the strong inflection for verbs, the variable word-order, and the positional ambiguity of the arguments.",

        "In fact, according to a well-known definition, “a collocation is an arbitrary and recurrent word combination” (Benson, 1990).",
        "This approach was at the basis of the computational work on collocation, although there exist an alternative approach – the linguistic, or lexicographic one – that imposes a restricted view on collocation, which is seen first of all as an expression of language.",
        "The existing extraction work (section 3) shows that there is a growing interest in adopting the more restricted (linguistic) view.",

        "Our system (Goldman et al., 2001; Seretan and Wehrli, 2006) is – to our knowledge – the first to perform the full syntactic analysis as support for collocation extraction; similar approaches rely on dependency parsers or on chunking.",

        "A pair of lexical items is selected as a candidate only if there exist a syntactic relation holding between the two items.",

        "If we consider the LL rank as the success measure for collocate detection, we can infer that the collocates of the word under investigation are easier to found in French, as compared to English, Italian or Spanish, because the value in the first row of the last column is smaller.",

        "If we measure the success of retrieving all the collocates (by considering, for instance, the speed to access them in the results list – the higher the rank, the better), then French can be again considered the easiest because overall, the positions in the V-O list are higher (i.e., the mean of the rank column is smaller) with respect to Spanish, Italian and, respectively, English.",
        "This latter result corresponds, approximately, to the order given by relative proportion of V-O",
        "pairs in each language (Spanish 15.12%, French 15.14%, Italian 17.06%, and English 20.82%).",
        "Given that in English V-O pairs are more numerous and the verbs also participate in VP constructions, it might seem reasonable to expect lower LL scores for V-O collocations in English vs. the other 3 languages.",
        "In general, we expect a correlation between extraction difficulty and the distributional properties of co-occurrence types."

      "text": [
        "The paper pointed out several issues that occur in transfering a hybrid collocation extraction methodology (that combines linguistic with statistic information) to a new language.",
        "Besides the questionable availability of language-specific text analysis tools for the new language, a number of issues that are relevant to extraction proper were addressed: the changes in the distribution of (syntactic) word pairs, and the need to find, for each language, the most",
        "appropriate association measure to apply for each syntactic type (given that AMs are sensitive to distributions and syntactic types); the lack of a priori defined syntactic types for a language; and, finally, the portability of some widely used techniques (such as the window method) from English to other languages exhibiting a higher word order freedom.",
        "It is again in the multilingualism perspective that the inescapable need for preprocessing the text emerged (cf. different researchers cited in section 3): highly inflected languages need lemmatizers, free-word order languages need structural information in order to guarantee acceptable results.",
        "As language tools become nowadays more and more available, we expect the collocation extraction (and terminology acquisition in general) to be exclusively performed in the future by relying on linguistic analysis.",
        "We therefore believe that multilingualism is a true concern for collocation extraction.",
        "The paper reviewed the extraction work in a language-oriented fashion, while mentioning the type of linguistic preprocessing performed whenever it was the case, as well as the language-specific issues identified by the authors.",
        "It then proposed a strategy for implementing a multilingual extraction procedure that takes into account the language-specific issues identified.",
        "An extraction system for four different languages, based on full parsing, was then described.",
        "Finally, an experiment was carried out as a case study, which pointed out several factors that might determine a particular AM to perform differently across languages.",
        "The experiment suggested that log-likelihood ratios test might highlight certain verb-object collocations easier in French than in Spanish, Italian and English (in terms of salience in the significance list).",
        "Future work needs to extend the type of cross-linguistic analysis initiated here, in order to provide more insights on the differences expected at extraction between one language and another and on the responsible factors, and, accordingly, to defines strategies to deal with them."
