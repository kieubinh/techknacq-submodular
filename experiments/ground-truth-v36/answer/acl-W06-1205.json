        "A \"pain in the neck\" (Sag et al., 2002) for NLP in languages of the Indo-Aryan family (e.g. Hindi-Urdu, Bangla and Kashmiri) is the fact that most verbs (nearly half of all instances in Hindi) occur as complex predicates - multi-word complexes which function as a single verbal unit in terms of argument and event structure (Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003; Raina and Mukerjee, 2005).",
        "Moreover, most of these languages being resource-poor, even a proper corpus-based characterization of such CPs has remained an elusive goal.",
        "In this paper we construct the first corpus-based lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on projecting POS tags across parallel English-Hindi corpora.",
        "While such approaches sometimes leave out some CPs, the ones that are identified are seen to be quite robust.",
        "As a result, this appears to be a good first approach for identifying the majority of CPs along with usage data.",
        "Moreover, since the language specific input in the procedure is minimal, it can be easily extended to other languages with similar multi word expressions."

        "CPs are characterized by a predicate or host - typically a noun (N), adjective (A), verb (V), or adverb (Adv) - followed by a light verb (LV), a grammaticalized version of a main verb, which contributes little telic significance to the composite predicate.",
        "As an example, the English verb \"describe\" may be rendered in Hindi as the Noun-Verb complex ‘वण�न + कर’, varNan kar, \"description + do\".",
        "Analysis based on a non-CP lexicon might assign the verbal head as kar (do), whereas functional aspects such as the argument structure are determined by the noun host varNan \"description\".",

        "verb de “give” imposes a completive aspect on the action kar “do”.",
        "Identifying such constructs is a significant hurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasal parsing (Ray et al., 2003, Shrivastava et al., 2005), translation (where each complex may be treated as a lexical unit in the target language), predicate-argument analysis, to semantic delineation.",
        "In addition to the computational aspects, a mere listing of all CPs occurring in the corpus would provide an important resource for tasks such as constructing WordNets (Narayan et al.,2002) and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt and Geuder, 2003).",
        "Rule-based approaches to identifying CPs are not very effective since there do not seem to be any clear set of rules that can be used to distinguish CPs from non-CP constructs (contrast, for example, the composite CP ‘अनुमित दे’ anumati de \"permission+give\" with the non-composite N-V structure ‘िकताब दे’ kitaab de \"give the book\").",
        "Even where such rules do exist, they depend on semantic properties such as the fact that book is a physical object which can be given in the physical sense (Raina and Mukerjee, 2005).",
        "However, in the translated form, the former may show up as a verb, whereas the latter invariably will be a N+V, so the tag projection would rule out the latter as a CP.",
        "Here we adopt a parallel corpus-based approach to creating a database of complex predicates in Hindi.",
        "The procedure can potentially be duplicated to most Indo-Aryan languages.",
        "The motivation is that a CP may be translated as a direct verb in other languages, and POS Projection across Parallel Corpora then project a tag of Verb for this expression in the source language.",
        "Additional linguistic constraints are used to determine if the multi-word cluster qualifies as a CP.",
        "These include a check list of LVs that can occur with A, N, V and Adv constituents of a multi word predicate.",

        "Identifying CPs in text is crucial to processing since it serves as a clausal head, and other elements in the phrase are licensed by the complex as a whole and not by the verbal head.",
        "The semantic import of the host-verb complex varies along a composability continuum, at one end of which we have purely idiomatic CPs, while at the other end, the CPs may be recoverable from its constituents.",
        "For example, ‘eft+fit’, vyavhaar kar, \"behave+do\" has a sense of \"use,treat\" in English, reflecting clearly an idiomatic usage.",
        "Detecting CPs is made difficult by the differing degrees of productivity for different classes of open-class host, which reflects the applicability of unrestricted rules.",
        "Also, verbs participating in CPs are very selective; e.g. in NV and AV CPs the verb is typically restricted to ho, kar and the like, whereas in VV constructs ho reflects auxiliary usage, but a different set of verbs appear.",
        "The open class word (host) tends to be uninflected, and only the light verb (LV) carries tense, agreement and aspect markers.",

        "For resource-rich languages, one may use a parse tree and look for mutual information statistics in head-complement collocations, and also compare it with other \"similar\" collocations to determine if something is unusual about a given construct (Lin, 1999).",
        "As of now however, even POS-tagging remains a challenge for languages such as Hindi, thereby making it necessary to seek alternate methods.",

        "These approaches use minimal linguistic input and have been increasingly effective with the growth in the availability of large parallel corpuses.",

        "In our approach, we first use a similar approach to word-align an English-Hindi parallel corpus.",

        "We observe that words which are tagged as verbs by projection and have POS tag as N, A, Adv or V in the Hindi lexicon, and are followed by an LV, are usually CPs.",
        "Clearly the CP detection is limited to those instances where a CP in the target language is translated as a single verb in English.",

        "In the latter case (an example appearing quite frequently in this corpus), the correct POS projection would label jawaab as [N answer], thus failing to detect the CP.",
        "While this may not be significant in certain tasks (e.g. translation), it may be relevant in others (e.g. semantic processing).",
        "Furthermore, the POS tagging process is inherently biased towards projecting tags for frequently encountered constituents first, and this may lead to some constituents in certain CPs being flagged with their normal POS tags, resulting in missed CPs.",
        "However, this does not result in false positives, since non-CP constructs often fail on other criteria (e.g. list of LVs).",
        "For reasons discussed above, many CPs are not identifiable through parallel corpus methods.",
        "Some examples include ‘अिधकार होते’, ‘पैदा करने’, ‘हािन होती’.",
        "Our database is therefore correspondingly thin for these types of CPs.",
