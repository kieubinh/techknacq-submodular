        "However, due to the open-ended and dynamic nature of languages, and the difficulties of grammar engineering, such grammars are likely to contain errors and be incomplete.",
        "An error can be roughly classified as under-generating (if it prevents a grammatical sentence to be generated/parsed) or over-generating (if it allows an ungrammatical sentence to be generated/parsed).",
        "In the context of wide-coverage parsing, we focus on the under-generating errors which normally lead to parsing failure.",
        "Traditionally, the errors of the grammar are to be detected manually by the grammar developers.",
        "This is usually done by running the grammar over a carefully designed test suite and inspecting the outputs.",

        "They have found that the large majority of failures are caused by missing lexical entries, with 40% of the cases, and missing constructions, with 39%.",
        "To this effect, as mentioned above, in recent years, some approaches have been developed in order to (semi)automatically detect and/or repair the errors in linguistic grammars.",

        "By running the grammar over a large corpus, the corpus can be split into two subsets: the set of sentences covered by the grammar and the set of sentences that failed to parse.",
        "The errors can be identified by comparing the statistical difference between these two sets of sentences.",
        "By statistical difference, any kind of uneven distribution of linguistic phenomena is meant.",

        "Those sequences with the lowest parsabilities are taken as direct indication of grammar errors.",
        "Among them, one common error, and subsequently very common cause of parse failure is due to Multiword Expressions (MWEs), like phrasal verbs (break down), collocations (bread and butter), compound nouns (coffee machine), determiner-less PPs (in hospital), as well as so-called “frozen expressions” (by and large), as discussed by both Baldwin et al.",

        "If an MWE is syntactically marked, the standard grammatical rules and lexical entries cannot generate the string, as for instance in the case of a phrasal verb like take off, even if the individual words that make up the MWE are contained in the lexicon.",

        "The output of the error mining phase proposes a set of n-grams, which also contain MWEs.",
        "Therefore, the task is to distinguish the MWEs from the other cases.",
        "To do this, first we propose to use the World Wide Web as a very large corpus from which we collect evidence that enables us to rule out noisy cases (due to spelling errors, for instance), following Grefenstette (1999), Keller et al.",

        "The term Multiword Expressions (MWEs) has been used to describe expressions for which the syntactic or semantic properties of the whole expression cannot be derived from its parts ((Sag et al., 2002), (Villavicencio et al., 2005)), including a large number of related but distinct phenomena, such as phrasal verbs (e.g. come along), nominal compounds (e.g. frying pan), institutionalised phrases (e.g. bread and butter), and many others.",
        "They are used frequently in language, and in English, Jackendoff (1997) estimates the number of MWES in a speaker’s lexicon to be comparable to the number of single words.",
        "This is reflected in several existing grammars and lexical resources, where almost half of the entries are Multiword Expressions.",
        "However, due to their heterogeneous characteristics, MWEs present a tough challenge for both linguistic and computational work (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Some MWEs are fixed, and do not present internal variation, such as ad",
        "hoc, while others allow different degrees of internal variability and modification, such as touch a nerve (touch/find a nerve) and spill beans (spill several/musical/mountains of beans).",
        "In terms of semantics, some MWEs are more opaque in their meaning (e.g. to kick the bucket as to die), while others have more transparent meanings that can be inferred from the words in the MWE (e.g. eat up, where the particle up adds a completive sense to eat).",

        "By processing a huge amount of data, the parsability metrics briefly presented in section 1 have been used to successfully locate various errors introduced by the tokenizer, erroneous/incomplete lexical descriptions, frozen expressions with idiosyncratic syntax, or incomplete grammatical descriptions.",

        "Moreover, there is no concrete data given about the distribution of the different types of errors discovered.",

        "For the purpose of the detection of MWEs, we are interested in seeing what the major types of error for a typical large-scale deep grammar are.",

        "• P means at least one parse is found for the sentence; • L means the parser halted after the morphological analysis and has not been able to construct any lexical item for the input token; • N means the search has finished normally and there is no parse found for the sentence; • E means the search has finished abnormally by exceeding the edge number limit.",
        "It is interesting to notice that when the ambiguity packing mechanism (Oepen and Carroll, 2000) is used and the unpacking is turned off 2, E does not occur at all for our test corpus.",

        "The distribution of n-grams in length with parsability below 0.1 is shown in Table 2.",

        "Table 3 gives some examples of the word sequences.",
        "By intuition, we make the bold assumption that the low parsability of uni-grams is caused by the missing appropriate lexical entries for the corresponding word.3 For the bi-grams and tri-grams, we do see a lot of cases where the error can be repaired by just adding a multiword lexical entry into the grammar.",

        "For instance, Grefenstette employs the Web to do example-based machine translation of compounds from French into English.",
        "The method he employs would suffer considerably from data sparseness, if it were to rely only on corpus data.",

        "The scale of the Web can help to minimise the problem of data sparseness, that is especially acute for MWEs, and Villavicencio (2005) uses the Web to find evidence to verify automatically generated VPCs.",
        "This work is built on these, in that we propose to employ the Web as a corpus, using frequencies collected from the Web to detect MWEs among the n-grams that cause parse failure.",
        "We concentrate on the 482 most frequent candidates, to verify t he method.",
        "The candidate list has been preprocessed to remove systematic unrelated entries, like those including acronyms, names, dates and numbers, following Bouma and Villada (2002).",
        "Using Google as a search engine, we have looked for evidence on the Web for each of the candidate MWEs, that have occurred as an exact match in a webpage.",
        "For each candidate searched, Google has provided us with a measure of frequency in the form of the number of pages in which it appears.",
        "Table 4 shows the 10 most frequent candidates, and among these there are parts of formulae, frozen expressions and collocations.",
        "Table 5 on the other hand, shows the 10 least frequent candidates.",
        "From the total of candidates, 311 have been kept while the other have been discarded as noise.",
        "A manual inspection of the candidates has revealed that indeed the list contains a large amount of MWEs and frozen expressions like taking into account the, good and evil, by and large, put forward by and breach of contract.",
        "Some of these cases, like come into effect in, have very specific subcategorisation requirements, and this is reflected by the presence of the prepositions into and in in the ngram.",
        "Other cases seem to be part of formulae, like but also in, as part of not only X but",

        "However, among the candidates there still remain those that are not genuine MWEs, like of alcohol and and than that in, which contain very frequent words that enable them to obtain a very high frequency count without being an MWE.",
        "Therefore, to detect these cases, the remainder of the candidates could be further analysed using some statistical techniques to try to distinguish them from the more likely MWEs among the candidates.",
        "This is done by Bouma and Villada (2002) who investigated some measures that have been used to identify certain kinds of MWEs, focusing on collocational prepositional phrases, and on the tests of mutual information, log likelihood and χ2.",
        "One significant difference here is that this work is not constrained to a particular type of MWEs, but has to deal with them in general.",
        "Moreover, the statistical measures used by Bouma and Villada demand the knowledge of single word frequencies which can be a problem when using Google especially for common words like of and a.",
        "In Tables 4 and 5 we present two alternative measures that combined can help to detect false candidates.",
        "The rational is similar to the statistical tests, without the need of searching for the frequency of each of the words that make up the MWE.",
        "We assume that if a candidate is just a result of the random occurrence of very frequent words most probably the order of the words in the ngram is not important.",
        "Therefore, given a candidate, such as the likes of, we measure the frequency of occurrence of all its permutations (e.g. the of likes, likes the of, etc) and we calculate the candidate’s entropy as",
        "where Pi is the probability of occurrence of a given permutation, and N the total number of permutations.",
        "The entropy above defined has its maximum at 5 = 1 when all permutations are equally probably, which indicates a clear signature of a random nature.",
        "On the other hand, when order is very important and only a single configuration is allowed the entropy has its minimum, 5 = 0.",
        "An ngram with low entropy has good chances of being an MWE.",
        "A close inspection on Table 4 shows that the top two candidate ngrams have relatively high entropies ( here we consider high entropy when 5 > 0.3 ).",
        "In the first case this can be explained by the fact that the word the can appear after the word of without compromising the MWE meaning as in the burden of the job.",
        "In the second case it shows that the real MWE is cost effective and the word and can be either in the beginning or in the end of the trigram.",
        "In fact for a trigram with only two acceptable permutations the entropy is 5 = log 2/ log 6 ^_ 0.39, very close to what is obtained .",
        "We also show the probability of occurrence of each candidate ngram among its permutations (P1).",
        "Most of the candidates in the list are more frequent than their permutations.",
        "In Table 4 we find two exceptions which are clearly spelling errors in the last 2 ngrams.",
        "Therefore low P1 can be a good indicative of a noisy candidate.",
        "Another good predictor is the relative frequency between the candidates.",
        "Given the occurrence values for the most frequent candidates, we consider that by using a threshold of 20,000 occurrences, it is possible to remove the more noisy cases.",
        "We note that the grammar can also impose some restrictions in the order of the elements in the ngram, in the sense that some of the generated permutations are ungrammatical (e.g. the of likes) and will most probably have null or very low frequencies.",
        "Therefore, on top of the constraints on the lexical order there are also constraints on the constituent order of a candidate which will be reflected in these measures.",
        "The remainder candidates can be semi-automatically included in the grammar, by using a lexical type predictor, as described in the next section.",
        "With this information, each candidate is added as a lexical entry, with a possible manual check by a grammar writer prior to inclusion in the grammar.",
        "4Google ignores punctuation between the elements of the ngram.",

        "On the other hand, Google only returns the number of pages where a given ngram occurred, but not the number of times it occurred in that page.",
        "This can result in a huge underestimation especially for very frequent ngrams and words, which can be used more than once in a given page.",
        "Therefore, a conservative view of these frequencies must be adopted, given that for some ngrams they might be inflated and for others deflated."

        "One of the important challenges for robust natural language processing systems is to be able to deal with the systematic parse failures caused in great part by Multiword Expressions and related constructions.",
        "Therefore, in this paper we have proposed an approach for the semi-automatic extension of grammars by using an error mining technique for the detection of MWE candidates in texts and for predicting possible lexico-syntactic types for them.",
        "The approach presented is based on that of van Noord (2004) and proposes a set of MWE candidates.",
        "For this set of candidates, using the World Wide Web as a large corpus, frequencies are gathered for each candidate.",
        "These in conjunction with some statistical measures are employed for ruling out noisy cases like spelling mistakes (from",
        "ofgovernment) and frequent non-MWE sequences like input is complete.",
        "With this information the remaining sequences are analysed by a statistical type predictor that assigns the most likely lexical type for each of the candidates in a given context.",
        "By adding these to the grammar as new lexical entries, a considerable increase in coverage of 14.4% was obtained.",
        "The approach proposed employs simple and self-contained techniques that are language-independent and can help to semi-automatically extend the coverage of a grammar without relying on external resources, like electronic dictionaries and ontologies that are expensive to obtain and not available for all languages.",
        "Therefore, it provides an inexpensive and reusable manner of helping and speeding up the grammar engineering process, by relieving the grammar developer of some of the burden of extending the coverage of the grammar.",
        "As future work we intend to investigate further statistical measures that can be applied robustly to different types of MWEs for refining even more the list of candidates and distinguishing false positives, like of alcohol and from MWEs, like put forward by.",
        "The high frequency with which the former occur in corpora and the more accute problem of data sparseness that affects the latter make this a difficult task."
