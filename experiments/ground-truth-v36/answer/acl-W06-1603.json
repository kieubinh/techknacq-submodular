        "The ability to differentiate significant dissimilarities not only reveals what makes two sentences a non-paraphrase, but also helps to recall additional paraphrases that contain extra but insignificant information.",
        "Experimental results show that while being accurate at discerning non-paraphrasing dissimilarities, our implemented system is able to achieve higher paraphrase recall (93%), at an overall performance comparable to the alternatives."

        "A saving grace is that labeling errors rarely lead to incorrect pairing (one pairing in all the examined sentences).",
        "The labeling errors impact the whole system in two ways: 1) they caused similar tuples that should have been paired up to be added as noise in that dissimilarity classifier’s training set and 2) paired tuples with labeling errors erroneously increase the target weight in Equation (1).",

        "These examples give an indicative categorization of what significant tuples are and their corpus frequency (when predicate argument tuples are the reasons; we examined 40 such cases for this estimation).",
        "There is one thing in common: every case involves substantial information that is difficult to infer from context.",
