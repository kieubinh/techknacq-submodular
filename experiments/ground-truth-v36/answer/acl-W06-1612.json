        "Although there is a fine line in the distinction between Information Status and Information Structure, it is fair to say that whereas the latter models wider discourse coherence, the former focuses mainly on the local level of discourse entities.",
        "Section 2 provides more details on how this notion is encoded in our corpus.",
        "Information status has generated large interest among researchers because of its complex interaction with other linguistic phenomena, thus affecting several Natural Language Processing tasks.",
        "Since it correlates with word order and pitch accent (Lambrecht, 1994; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), for instance, incorporating knowledge on information status would be helpful for natural language generation, and in particular text-to-speech systems.",
        "St¨ober and colleagues, for example, ascribe to the lack of such information the lower performance of text-to-speech compared to concept-to-speech generation, where such knowledge could be made directly available to the system (St¨ober et al., 2000).",
        "Another area where information status can play an important role is anaphora resolution.",
        "A major obstacle in the resolution of definite noun phrases with full lexical heads is that only a small proportion of them is actually anaphoric (ca.",

        "An entity was annotated as new if it has not been previously referred to and is yet unknown to the hearer.",
        "The tag mediated was instead used whenever an entity that is newly mentioned in the dialogue can be inferred by the hearer thanks to prior or general context.2 Typical examples of mediated entities are generally known objects (such as “the sun”, or “the Pope” (L¨obner, 1985)), and bridging anaphors (Clark, 1975; Vieira and Poesio, 2000), where an entity is related to a previously introduced one.",
        "Whenever an entity was neither new nor mediated, it was considered as old.",
        "In order to account for the complexity of the notion of information status, the annotation also includes a subtype classification for old and mediated entities that provides a finer-grained distinction with information on why a given entity is mediated (e.g., set-relation, bridging) or old (e.g., coreference, generic pronouns).",
        "In order to test the feasibility of automatically assigning information status to discourse entities, we took a modular approach and only considered the coarser-grained distinctions for this first study.",
        "Information about the finer-grained subtypes will be used in future work.",
        "In addition to the main categories, we used two more annotation classes: a tag non-applicable, used for entities that were wrongly extracted in the automatic selection of markables (e.g. “course” in “of course”), for idiomatic occurrences, and expletive uses of “it”; and a tag not-understood to be applied whenever an annotator did not fully understand the text.",
        "Instances annotated with these two tags, as well as all traces, which were left unanno-tated, were excluded from all our experiments.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the kappa (K) statistics (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996) on 1,502 instances (three Switchboard dialogues) marked by two annotators who followed specific written guidelines.",
        "Given that the task involves a fair amount of subjective judgement, agreement was remarkably high.",
        "Over the three dialogues, the annotation yielded K = .845 for the old/med/new classification (K = .788 when including the finer-grained subtype distinction).",
        "Specifically, “old” proved to be the easiest to distinguish, with K = .902; for “med” and “new” agreement was measured at K = .800 and K = .794, respectively.",

        "We have presented a model for the automatic assignment of information status in English.",
        "On the three-way classification into old, mediated, and new that reflects the corpus annotation tags, the learnt tree outperforms a hand-crafted algorithm and achieves an accuracy of 79.5%, with high precision and recall for old entities, high recall for mediated entities, and a fair precision, but very poor recall, for new ones.",
        "When we collapsed mediated and new entities into one category only opposing this to old ones, the classifier performed with an accuracy of 93.1%, with high f-scores for both classes.",
        "Binning mediated and old entities together did not produce interesting results, mainly due to the highly skewed distribution of the resulting corpus towards old entities.",
        "This suggests that mediated entities are more similar to new than to old ones, and might provide interesting feedback for the theoretical assumptions underlying the annotation.",
        "Future work will examine specific cases and investigate how such insights can be used to make the theoretical framework more accurate.",
        "As the first experiments run on English to learn information status, we wanted to concentrate on the task itself and avoid noise introduced by automatic processing.",
        "More realistic settings for integrating an information status model in a large-scale NLP system would imply obtaining syntactic information via parsing rather than directly from the treebank.",
        "Future experiments will assess the impact of automatic preprocessing of the data.",
        "Results are very promising but there is room for improvement.",
        "First, the syntactic category “other” is far too large, and finer distinctions must be made by means of better extraction rules from the trees.",
        "Second, and most importantly, we believe that using more features will be the main trigger of higher accuracy.",
        "In particular, we plan to use additional lexical and relational features derived from knowledge sources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) which should be especially helpful in distinguishing mediated from new entities, the most difficult decision to make.",
        "For example, an entity that is linked in WordNet (within a given depth) and/or FrameNet to a previously introduced one is more likely to be mediated than new.",
        "Additionally, we will attempt to exploit dialogue turns, since knowing which speaker said what is clearly very valuable information.",
        "In a similar vein, we will experiment with distance measures, in terms of turns, sentences, or even time, for determining when an introduced entity might stop to be available.",
        "We also plan to run experiments on the automatic classification of old and mediated subtypes (the finer-grained classification) that is included in the corpus but that we did not consider for the present study (see Section 2.1).",
        "The major benefit of this would be a contribution to the resolution of bridging anaphora."
