        "As a part of a ongoing project on multilingual named entity identification, we investigate unsupervised methods for transliteration across languages that use different scripts.",
        "Starting from paired comparable texts that are about the same topic, but are not in general translations of each other, we aim to find the transliteration correspondences of the paired languages.",
        "For example, if there were an English and Arabic newspaper on the same day, each of the newspapers would likely contain articles about the same important international events.",
        "From these comparable articles across the two languages, the same named entities such as persons and locations would likely be found.",
        "For at least some of the English named entities, we would therefore expect to find Arabic equivalents, many of which would in fact be transliterations.",
        "The characteristics of transliteration differ according to the languages involved.",
        "In particular, the exact transliteration of say, an English name is highly dependent on the language since this will be influenced by the difference in the phonological systems of the language pairs.",
        "In order to show the reliability of a multilingual transliteration model, it should be tested with a variety of different languages.",
        "We have tested our transliteration methods with three unrelated target languages – Arabic, Chinese and Hindi, and a common source language – English.",
        "Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).",
        "For example, while Arabic orthography has a conventional way of writing long vowels using selected consonant symbols – basically <w>, <y> and <?>, in ordinary text short vowels are rarely written.",
        "When transliterating English names there is the option of representing the vowels as either short (i.e. unwritten) or long (i.e. written with one of the above three mentioned consonant symbols).",
        "For example London is transliterated as lndn, with no vowels; Washington often as wSnjTwn, with <w> representing the final <o>.",
        "Transliterations in Chinese are very different from the original English pronunciation due to the limited syllable structure and phoneme inventory of Chinese.",
        "For example, Chinese does not allow consonant clusters or coda consonants except [n, N], and this results in deletion, substitution of consonants or insertion of vowels.",
        "Thus while a syllable initial /d/ may surface as in Baghdad ba-ge-da, note that the syllable final /d/ is not represented.",
        "Hindi transliteration is not well-studied, but it is in principle easier than Arabic and Chinese since Hindi phonotactics is much more similar to that of English."

        "Named entity transliteration is the problem of producing, for a name in a source language, a set of one or more transliteration candidates in a target language.",
        "Previous work – e.g. (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Gao et al., 2004) – has mostly assumed that one has a training lexicon of transliteration pairs, from which one can learn a model, often a source-channel or MaxEnt-based model.",
        "Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature – e.g.,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al., 1998; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2004), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed.",
        "The general idea of exploiting time correlations to acquire word translations from comparable corpora has been explored in several previous studies – e.g., (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996).",
        "Recently, a Pearson correlation method was proposed to mine word pairs from comparable corpora (Tao and Zhai, 2005); this idea is similar to the method used in (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) for sentence alignment.",
        "In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration; note that (Tao and Zhai, 2005) compares several different metrics for time correlation, as we also note below – and see (Sproat et al., 2006)."

        "Our phonetic transliteration score uses a standard string-alignment and alignment-scoring technique based on (Kruskal, 1999) in that the distance is determined by a combination of substitution, insertion and deletion costs.",
        "These costs are computed from a language-universal cost matrix based on phonological features and the degree of phonetic similarity.",
        "(Our technique is thus similar to other work on phonetic similarity such as (Frisch, 1996) though details differ.)",
        "We construct a single cost matrix, and apply it to English and all target languages.",
        "This technique requires the knowledge of the phonetics and the sound change patterns of the language, but it does not require a transliteration-pair training dictionary.",
        "In this paper we assume the WorldBet transliteration system (Hieronymus, 1995), an ASCII-only version of the IPA.",
        "The cost matrix is constructed in the following way.",
        "All phonemes are decomposed into standard phonological features.",
        "However, phonological features alone are not enough to model the possible substution/insertion/deletion patterns of languages.",
        "For example, /h/ is more frequently deleted than other consonants, whereas no single phonological feature allows us to distinguish /h/ from other consonants.",
        "Similarly, stop and fricative consonants such as /p, t, k, b, d, g, s, z/ are frequently deleted when they appear in the coda position.",
        "This tendency is very salient when the target languages do not allow coda consonants or consonant clusters.",
        "So, Chinese only allows [n, N] in coda position, and stop consonants in coda position are frequently lost; Stanford is transliterated as sitanfu, with the final /d/ lost.",
        "Since phonological features do not consider the position in the syllable, this pattern cannot be captured by conventional phonological features alone.",
        "To capture this, an additional feature “deletion of stop/fricative consonant in the coda position” is added.",
        "We base these observations, and the concomitant pseudofeatures on pronunciation error data of learners of English as a second language, as reported in (Swan and Smith, 2002).",
        "Er",
        "rors in second language pronunciation are determined by the difference in the phonological system of learner’s first and second language.",
        "The same substitution/deletion/insertion patterns in the second language learner’s errors appear also in the transliteration of foreign names.",
        "For example, if the learner’s first language does not have a particular phoneme found in English, it is substituted by the most similar phoneme in their first language.",
        "Since Chinese does not have /v/, it is frequently substituted by /w/ or /f/.",
        "This substitution occurs frequently in the transliteration of foreign names in Chinese.",
        "Swan & Smith’s study covers 25 languages, and includes Asian languages such as Thai, Korean, Chinese and Japanese, European languages such as German, Italian, French, and Polish and Middle Eastern languages such as Arabic and Farsi.",
        "Frequent substitution/insertion/deletion patterns of phonemes are collected from these data.",
        "Some examples are presented in Table 1.",
        "Twenty phonological features and 14 pseudofeatures are used for the construction of the cost matrix.",
        "All features are classified into 5 classes.",
        "There are 4 classes of consonantal features – place, manner, laryngeality and major (consonant, sonorant, syllabicity), and a separate class of vocalic features.",
        "The purpose of these classes is to define groups of features which share the same substitution/insertion/deletion costs.",
        "Formally, given a class C, and a cost Cc, for each feature f E C, Cc defines the cost of substituting a different value for f than the one present in the source phoneme.",
        "Among manner features, the feature continuous is classified separately, since the substitution between stop and fricative consonants is very frequent; but between, say, nasals and fricatives such substitution is much less common.",
        "The cost for frequent sound change patterns should be low.",
        "Based on our intuitions, our pseudofeatures are classified into one or another of the above-mentioned five classes.",
        "The substitution/deletion/insertion cost for a pair of phonemes is the sum of the individual costs of the features which are different between the two phonemes.",
        "For example, /n/ and /p/ are different in sonorant, labial and coronal features.",
        "Therefore, the substitution cost of /n/ for /p/ is the sum of the sonorant, labial and coronal cost (20+10+10 = 40).",
        "Features and associated costs are shown in Table 2.",
        "Sample substitution, insertion, and deletion costs for /g/ are presented in Table 3.",
        "The resulting cost matrix based on these principles is then used to calculate the edit distance between two phonetic strings.",
        "Pronunciations for English words are obtained using the Festival text-to-speech system (Taylor et al., 1998), and the target language words are automatically converted into their phonemic level transcriptions by various language-dependent means.",
        "In the case of Mandarin Chinese this is based on the standard pinyin transliteration system.",
        "For Arabic this is based on the orthography, which works reasonably well given that (apart from the fact that short vowels are no represented) the script is fairly phonemic.",
        "Similarly, the pronunciation of Hindi can be reasonably well-approximated based on the standard Devanagari orthographic representation.",
        "The edit cost for the pair of strings is normalized by the number of phonemes.",
        "The resulting score ranges from zero upwards; the score is used to rank candidate transliterations, with the candidate having the lowest cost being considered the most likely transliteration.",
