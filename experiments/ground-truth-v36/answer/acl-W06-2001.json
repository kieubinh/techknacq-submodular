        "Then, an improved porting process was applied to Italian, where the automatic translation of the temporal expressions from English and from Spanish was combined with the extraction of new expressions from an Italian annotated corpus.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate how, while still adhering to the rule-based paradigm, the development of automatic rule translation procedures allowed us to minimize the effort required for porting to new languages.",
        "Relying on such procedures, and without any manual effort or previous knowledge of the target language, TERSEO recognizes and normalizes temporal expressions in Italian with good results (72% precision and 83% recall for recognition)."

        "In this direction, the outcomes of the first Time Expression Recognition and Normalization Workshop (TERN 20043) provide a clear indication of the state of the field.",
        "In spite of the good results obtained in the recognition task, normalization by means of machine learning techniques still shows relatively poor results with respect to rule-based approaches, and still remains an unresolved problem.",
        "The difficulty of porting systems to new languages (or domains) affects both rule-based and machine learning approaches.",
        "With rule-based approaches (Schilder and Habel, 2001; Filatova and Hovy, 2001), the main problems are related to the fact that the porting process requires rewriting from scratch, or adapting to each new language, large numbers of rules, which is costly and time",
        "consuming work.",
        "Machine learning approaches (Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2002; Katz and Arosio, 2001), on the other hand, can be extended with little human intervention through the use of language corpora.",
        "However, the large annotated corpora that are necessary to obtain high performance are not always available.",
        "In this paper we describe a new procedure to build temporal models for new languages, starting from previously defined ones.",
        "While still adhering to the rule-based paradigm, its main contribution is the proposal of a simple, but effective, methodology to automate the porting of a system from one language to another.",
        "In this procedure, we take advantage of the architecture of an existing system developed for Spanish (TERSEO, see (Saquete et al., 2005)), where the recognition model is language-dependent but the normalizing procedure is completely independent.",
        "In this way, the approach is capable of automatically learning the recognition model by adjusting the set of normalization rules.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a short overview of TERSEO; Section 3 describes the automatic extension of the system to Italian; Section 4 presents the results of our evaluation experiments, comparing the performance of Ita-TERSEO (i.e. our extended system) with the performance of a state of the art system for Italian."

        "As shown in Figure 1, the first step (recognition) includes preprocessing of the input texts, which are tagged with lexical and morphological information that will be used as input to the temporal parser.",

        "• Firstly, a set of Italian temporal expressions is extracted from an Italian annotated corpus and stored in a database.",

        "In this case, the TEs are filtered removing those not being found by Google.",
        "• Phase 2: TE Generalization.",
        "In this phase, the TEs Gramatics Generator uses the morphological and syntactical information from the collected TEs to generate the grammatical rules that generalize the recognition of the TEs.",
        "Moreover, the keyword unit is able to extract the temporal keywords that will be used to build new TEs.",
        "These keywords are augmented with their synonyms in WordNet (Vossen, 2000) to generate new TEs.",

        "This is",
        "due to the fact that in the Italian extension, more temporal expressions have been covered with respect to the English extension.",
        "In this case, in fact, Ita-TERSEO is not only using the temporal expressions translated from the English or Spanish knowledge database, but also the temporal expressions extracted from the training part of I-CAB.",

        "), new patterns had to be introduced to capture such variants.",
        "For example, as months’ names in Italian could start with a vowel, the temporal expression pattern “nell’-MONTH” has been inserted in the Knowledge DB.",
        "After these changes, the total amount of expressions stored in the DB are shown in Table 7.",
        "In order to evaluate the system after this manual revision, the training and the test part of I-CAB have been used.",
        "However, the results of precision (PREC), recall (REC) and F-Measure were exactly the same as presented in Table 6.",
        "That is not really surprising.",
        "The existence of wrong expressions in the knowledge database does not affect the final results of the system, as they will never be used for recognition or resolution.",

        "Like all the other state of the art systems addressing the recognition/normalization task, Chronos is a rule-based system.",

        "In particular, a set of around 350 rules is designed for TE recognition and is capable of recognizing with high Precision/Recall rates both explicit and implicit TEs.",
        "Other sets of regular expressions, for a total of around 700 rules, are used in the normalization phase, and are in charge of handling a specific TIMEX2 attribute (i.e. VAL, SET, ANCHOR VAL, and ANCHOR DIR).",
        "The results obtained by the Italian version of Chronos over the test part of I-CAB are shown in the last three columns of Table 6.",
        "As expected, the distance between the results obtained by the two systems is considerable.",
        "However, the following considerations should be taken into account.",
        "First, there is a great difference, both",
        "in terms of the required time and effort, in the development of the two systems.",
        "While the implementation of the manual one took several months, the porting procedure of TERSEO to Italian is a very fast process that can be accomplished in less than an hour.",
        "Second, even if an annotated corpus for a new language is not available, the automatic porting procedure we present still remains feasible.",
        "In fact, most of the TEs for a new language that are stored in the Knowledge DB are the result of the translation of the Spanish/English TEs into such a target language.",
        "In our case, as shown in Table 5, more than 80% of the acquired Italian TEs result from the automatic translation of the expressions already stored in the DB.",
        "This makes the proposed approach a viable solution which allows for a rapid porting of the system to other languages, while just requiring an on-line translator (note that the Altavista Babel Fish translator9 provides translations from English to 12 target languages).",
