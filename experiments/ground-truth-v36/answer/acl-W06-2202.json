        "In designing Information Extraction (IE) systems based on supervised machine learning techniques, there is usually a tradeoff between carefully tuning the system to specific tasks and domains and having a ”generic” IE system able to obtain good (even if not the topmost) performance when applied to different tasks and domains (requiring a very reduced porting time).",
        "Usually, the former alternative is chosen and system performance is often shown only for a very limited number of tasks (sometimes even only for a single task), after a careful tuning.",
        "For example, in the Bio-entity Recognition Shared Task at JNLPBA 2004 (Kim et al., 2004) the best performing system obtained a considerable performance improvement adopting domain specific hacks.",
        "A second important issue in designing IE systems concerns the fact that usually IE data sets are highly unbalanced (i.e., the number of positive examples constitutes only a small fraction with respect to the number of negative examples).",
        "This fact has important consequences.",
        "In some machine learning algorithms the unbalanced distribution of examples can yield a significant loss in classification accuracy.",
        "Moreover, very large data sets can be problematic to process due to the complexity of many supervised learning techniques.",
        "For example, using kernel methods, such as word sequence and tree kernels, can become prohibitive due to the difficulty of kernel based algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), to scale to large data sets.",
        "As a consequence, reducing the number of instances without degrading the prediction accuracy is a crucial issue for applying advanced machine learning techniques in IE, especially in the case of highly unbalanced data sets.",
        "In this paper, we present SIE (Simple Information Extraction), an information extraction system based on a supervised machine learning approach for extracting domain-specific entities from documents.",
        "In particular, IE is cast as a classification problem by applying SVM to train a set of classifiers, based on a simple and general-purpose feature representation, for detecting the boundaries of the entities to be extracted.",
        "SIE was designed with the goal of being easily and quickly portable across tasks and domains.",
        "To support this claim, we conducted a set of experiments on several tasks in different domains and languages.",
        "The results show that SIE is competitive with the state-of-the-art systems, and it often outperforms systems customized to a specific domain.",
        "SIE resembles the “Level One” of the ELIE algorithm (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004).",
        "How",
        "ever, a key difference between the two algorithms is the capability of SIE to drastically reduce the computation time by exploiting Instance Filtering (Gliozzo et al., 2005a).",
        "This characteristic allows scaling from toy problems to real-world data sets making SIE attractive in applicative fields, such as bioinformatics, where very large amounts of data have to be analyzed."

        "SIE has a modular system architecture.",
        "It is composed by a general purpose machine learning algorithm combined with several customizable components.",
        "The system components are combined in a pipeline, where each module constrains the data structures provided by the previous ones.",
        "This modular specification brings significant advantages.",
        "Firstly, a modular architecture is simpler to implement.",
        "Secondly, it allows to easily integrate different machine learning algorithms.",
        "Finally, it allows, if necessary, a fine tuning to a specific task by simply specializing few modules.",
        "Furthermore, it is worth noting that we tested SIE across different domains using the same basic configuration without exploiting any domain specific knowledge, such as gazetteers, and ad-hoc pre/post-processing.",
        "The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The information extraction task is performed in two phases.",
        "SIE learns off-line a set of data models from a specified labeled corpus, then the models are applied to tag new documents.",
        "In both phases, the Instance Filtering module (Section 3) removes certain tokens from the data set in order to speed-up the whole process, while Feature Extraction module (Section 4) is used to extract a predefined set of features from the tokens.",
        "In the training phase, the Learning Module (Section 5) learns two distinct models for each entity, one for the beginning boundary and another for the end boundary (Ciravegna, 2000; Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000).",
        "In the recognition phase, as a consequence, the Classification module (Section 5) identifies the entity boundaries as distinct token classifications.",
        "A Tag Matcher module (Section 6) is used to match the boundary predictions made by the Classification module.",
        "Tasks with multiple entities are considered as multiple independent single-entity extraction tasks (i.e. SIE only extracts one entity at a time)."

      "text": [
        "The purpose of the Instance Filtering (IF) module is to reduce the data set size and skewness by discarding harmful and superfluous instances without degrading the prediction accuracy.",
        "This is a generic module that can be exploited by any supervised system that casts IE as a classification problem.",
        "Instance Filtering (Gliozzo et al., 2005a) is based on the assumption that uninformative words are not likely to belong to entities to recognize, being their information content very low.",
        "A naive implementation of this assumption consists in filtering out very frequent words in corpora because they are less likely to be relevant than rare words.",
        "However, in IE relevant entities can be composed by more than one token and in some domains a few of such tokens can be very frequent in the corpus.",
        "For example, in the field of bioinformatics, protein names often contain parentheses, whose frequency in the corpus is very high.",
        "To deal with this problem, we exploit a set of Instance Filters (called Stop Word Filters), included in a Java tool called jInFil1.",
        "These filters perform a “shallow” supervision to identify frequent words that are often marked as positive examples.",
        "The resulting filtering algorithm consists of two stages.",
        "First, the set of uninformative tokens is identified by training the term filtering algorithm on the training corpus.",
        "Second, instances describing “uninformative” tokens are removed from both the training and the test sets.",
        "Note that instances are not really removed from the data set, but just",
        "marked as uninformative.",
        "In this way the learning algorithm will not learn from these instances, but they will still appear in the feature description of the remaining instances.",
        "A Stop Word Filter is fully specified by a list of stop words.",
        "To identify such a list, different feature selection methods taken from the text categorization literature can be exploited.",
        "In text categorization, feature selection is used to remove non-informative terms from representations of texts.",
        "In this sense, IF is closely related to feature selection: in the former non-informative words are removed from the instance set, while in the latter they are removed from the feature set.",
        "Below, we describe the different metrics used to collect a stop word list from the training corpora.",
        "Information Content (IC) The most commonly used feature selection metric in text categorization is based on document frequency (i.e, the number of documents in which a term occurs).",
        "The basic assumption is that very frequent terms are non-informative for document indexing.",
        "The frequency of a term in the corpus is a good indicator of its generality, rather than of its information content.",
        "From this point of view, IF consists of removing all tokens with a very low information content2.",
        "Correlation Coefficient (CC) In text categorization the x2 statistic is used to measure the lack of independence between a term and a category (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "The correlation coefficient CC2 = x2 of a term with the negative class can be used to find those terms that are less likely to express relevant information in texts.",
        "Odds Ratio (OR) Odds ratio measures the ratio between the odds of a term occurring in the positive class, and the odds of a term occurring in the negative class.",
        "In text categorization the idea is that the distribution of the features on the relevant documents is different from the distribution on non-relevant documents (Raskutti and Kowal-czyk, 2004).",
        "Following this assumption, a term is non-informative when its probability of being a negative example is sensibly higher than its probability of being a positive example (Gliozzo et al., 2005b).",
        "2 The information content of a word w can be measured by estimating its probability from a corpus by the equation I(w) = – p(w) log p(w).",
        "An Instance Filter is evaluated by using two metrics: the Filtering Rate (0), the total percentage of filtered tokens in the data set, and the Positive Filtering Rate (0+), the percentage of positive tokens (wrongly) removed.",
        "A filter is optimized by maximizing 0 and minimizing 0+; this allows us to reduce as much as possible the data set size preserving most of the positive instances.",
