        "The portion of text chosen has an adequate size which lends itself to significant statistical measurements: it is portion A, counting 35,000 tokens and some 1000 third person pronominal expressions.",

        "The problem of anaphora resolution (hence AR) looms more and more as a prominent one in unrestricted text processing due to the need to recover semantically consistent information in most current NLP applications.",
        "This problem does not lend itself easily to a statistical approach so that rule-based approaches seem the only viable solution.",
        "We present a new evaluation of three state-of-the-art algorithms for anaphora resolution – GuiTAR, JavaRAP, MARS – on the basis of a portion of Susan Corpus (derived from Brown Corpus) a much richer testbed than the ones previously used for evaluation, and in any case a much more comparable source with such texts as newspaper articles and stories.",
        "Texts used previously ranged from scientific manuals to descriptive scientific texts and were generally poor on pronouns and rich on nominal descriptions.",
        "Two of the algorithms – GuiTAR and JavaRAP - use Charniak’s parser output, which contributes to the homogeneity of the type of knowledge passed to the resolution procedure.",
        "MARS, on the contrary, uses a more sophisticated input, the one provided by Connexor FDG-parser.",
        "The algorithms will then be compared to our system, GETARUNS, which incorporated an AR algorithm at the end of a pipeline of interconnected modules that instantiate standard architectures for NLP.",
        "The version of the algorithm presented here is a newly elaborated one, and is devoted to unrestricted text processing.",
        "It is an upgraded version from the one discussed in Delmonte (1999;2002a;2002b) and tries to incorporate as much as possible of the more sophisticated version implemented in the complete GETARUN (see Delmonte 1990;1991;1992;1994; 2003;2004).",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 below we briefly discuss architectures and criteria for AR of the three algorithms evaluated.",
        "In section 3 we present our system.",
        "Section 4 is dedicated to a compared evaluation and a general discussion."

        "As reported by the authors (Long Qiu, Min-Yen Kan, Tat-Seng Chua, 2004) of the JAVA implementation, head-dependent relations required by RAP are provided by looking into the structural “argument domain” for arguments and into the structural “adjunct domain” for adjuncts.",
        "Domain information is important to establish disjunction relations, i.e. to tell whether a third person pronoun can look for antecedents within a certain structural domain or not.",
        "According to Binding Principles, Anaphors (i.e. reciprocal and reflexive pronouns),",

        "Within the same domains, Pronouns must be free.",
        "Head-argument or head-adjunct relation is determined whenever two or more NPs are sibling of the same VP.",
        "Additional information is related to agreement features, which in the case of pronominal expressions are directly derived.",

        "The authors (Poesio, M. and Mijail A. Kabadjov 2004) present their algorithm as an attempt at providing a domain independent anaphora resolution module, “that developers of NLE applications can pick off the shelf in the way of tokenizers, POS taggers, parsers, or Named Entity classifiers”.",
        "For these reasons, GuiTAR has been designed to be as independent as possible from other modules, and to be as modular as possible, thus “allowing for the possibility of replacing specific components (e.g., the pronoun resolution component)”.",
        "The authors have also made an attempt at specifying what they call the Minimal Anaphoric Syntax (MAS) and have devised a markup language based on GNOME mark-up scheme.",

        "The weighting algorithm seems to contain the most original approach.",
        "It is organized with a filtering approach by a series of indicators that are used to boost or reduce the score for antecedenthood to a given NP.",

        "Candidates are assigned a score (-1, 0, 1 or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the antecedent.",
        "The authors comment is that antecedent indicators have been identified empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, \"non- prepositional\" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.",
        "However it is clear that most of the indicators have been suggested for lack of better information, in particular no syntactic constituency was available.",

        "The authors seem to acknowledge the fact that anaphora resolution is a much more difficult task than previous work had suggested, In",
        "unrestricted text analysis, the tasks involved in the anaphora resolution process contribute a lot of uncertainty and errors that may be the cause for low performance measures.",

        "The new version of MARS includes three new indicators which seem more general and applicable to any text, so we shall comment on them.",
        "Frequent Candidates (FC) – this is a boosting score for most frequent three NPs; Syntactic Parallelism (SP) – this is a boosting score for NPs with the same syntactic role as the pronoun, roles provided by the FDG-Parser; Boost Pronoun (BP) – pronoun candidates are given a bonus (no indication of conditions for such a bonus).",

        "As Mitkov also notes, this phase jeopardizes the capacity of AR systems to reach satisfactory accuracy scores simply because of its intrinsic weakness: none of the off-the-shelf parsers currently available overcomes 90% accuracy.",
        "To clarify these issues, we present here below two Tables: in the first one we report data related to the vexed question of whether pleonastic “it” should be regarded as part of the task of anaphora resolution or rather part of a separate classification task – as suggested in a number of papers by Mitkov.",

        "In Table 1 we split results for “it” into Wrong Reference vs Wrong Classification: following Mitkov, in case we only computed anaphora related cases and disregarded those cases of “it” which were wrongly classified as expletives.",
        "Expletive “it” present in the text are 189: so at first we computed coverage and accuracy with the usual formula that we report below.",

        "• total number of anaphors present in the text; • anaphors identified by the system; • correctly resolved anaphors.",
        "Formulas related to Accuracy/Success Rate or Precision are as follows: Accuracy1 = number of successfully resolved anaphors/number of all anaphors; Accuracy2 = number of successfully resolved anaphors/number of anaphors found (attempted to be resolved).",
        "Recall - which should correspond to Coverage - we come up with formula: R= number of anaphors found /number of all anaphors to be resolved (present in the text).",

        "The overall number of resolution actions taken by the Discourse Level algorithm is 1861: this includes both cases of nominal and pronominal expressions.",
        "However, since only 366 can be pronouns, the remaining 1500 resolution actions have been carried out on nominal expressions present in the HL.",
        "If we compare these results to the ones computed by GuiTAR, which assign semantic indices to NamedEntities disregarding their status of anaphora, we can see that the whole text is made up of 12731 NEs.",
        "GuiTAR finds 1585 cases of identity relations between a NE and an antecedent.",
        "However, GuiTAR introduces always new indices and creates local antecedent-referring expression chains rather than repeating the same index of the chain head.",
        "In this way, it is difficult if not impossible to compute how many times the text corefers/cospecifies to the same referring expressions.",
        "On the contrary, in our case, this can be easily computed by counting how many times the same semantic index is being repeated in a “resolution” or “identity” action of the anaphora resolution algorithm.",
        "For instance, the Jury is coreferred/cospecified 12 times; Price Daniel also 12 times and so on."

        "The error rate of both Charniak’s and Connexor’s as reported in the literature, is approximately the same, 20%; this notwithstanding, MARS has a slightly reduced coverage when compared with JavaRAP, 96%.",
        "GuiTAR has the worst coverage, 85%.",
        "As to accuracy, none of the three algorithms overruns 50%: JavaRAP has the best score 49.9%.",
        "However GETARUNS has 63% correct score, with 90% coverage.",
        "There are at least three reasons why our system has a better performance: one is the presence of a richer functional and semantic information as explained above, which comes with augmented head-dependent structures.",
        "Second reason is the decision to split the referential process into two and treat utterance level pronominal expressions separately from discourse level ones.",
        "Third reason is the way in which discourse level anaphora resolution is",
        "organized: our version of the Centering algorithm hinges on a record of a list of best antecedents weighted on the basis of their behaviour in History List and on their intrinsic semantic properties.",
        "These three properties of our AR algorithm can be dubbed the Knowledge Rich approach.",
        "F-measures approximates very closely what we obtained in a previous experiment: however, as a whole it is an insufficient score to insure adequate confidence in semantic substitution of anaphoric items by the head of the antecedent.",
        "Improvements need to come from parsing and the lexical component."
