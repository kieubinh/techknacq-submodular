        "As in the case of other languages, the Japanese language has various types of functional words such as post-positional particles and auxiliary verbs.",
        "In addition to those functional words, the Japanese language has much more compound functional expressions which consist of more than one words including both content words and functional words.",
        "Those single functional words as well as compound functional expressions are very important for recognizing the syntactic structures of Japanese sentences and for understanding their semantic contents.",
        "Recognition and understanding of them are also very important for various kinds of NLP applications such as dialogue systems, machine translation, and question answering.",
        "However, recognition and semantic interpretation of compound functional expressions are especially difficult because it often happens that one compound expression may have both a literal (in other words, compositional) content word usage and a non-literal (in other words, non-compositional) functional usage.",
        "For example, Table 1 shows two example sentences of a compound expression 'IC- (ni) --)L IZ (tsuite)”, which consists of a post-positional particle 'IC- (ni)”, and a conjugated form '--) L I Z (tsuite)” of a verb '--) < (tsuku)”.",
        "In the sentence (A), the compound expression functions as a case-marking particle and has a non-compositional functional meaning 'about”.",
        "On the other hand, in the sentence (B), the expression simply corresponds to a literal concatenation of the usages of the constituents: the post-positional particle 'IC(ni)” and the verb '--)L I Z (tsuite)”, and has a content word meaning 'follow”.",
        "Therefore, when considering machine translation of those Japanese sentences into English, it is necessary to precisely judge the usage of the compound expression 'IC(ni) --)L IZ (tsuite)”, as shown in the English translation of the two sentences in Table 1.",
        "There exist widely-used Japanese text processing tools, i.e., pairs of a morphological analysis tool and a subsequent parsing tool, such as JU-MAN1+ KNP2 and ChaSen3+ CaboCha4.",
        "However, they process those compound expressions only partially, in that their morphological analysis dictionaries list only limited number of compound expressions.",
        "Furthermore, even if certain expressions are listed in a morphological analysis",
        "Grammatical Function Type # of major # of Example expressions variants post-positional subsequent to predicate 36 67 � ).,K;5 � particle / modifying predicate (to-naru-to) type subsequent to nominal 45 121 bZ:7b'GtZtt / modifying predicate (ni-kakete-ha) subsequent to predicate, nominal 2 3 � L � / modifying nominal (to-iu) auxiliary verb type 42 146 ZL L (te-ii) total 125 337 – dictionary, those existing tools often fail in resolving the ambiguities of their usages, such as those in Table 1.",
        "This is mainly because the framework of those existing tools is not designed so as to resolve such ambiguities of compound (possibly functional) expressions by carefully considering the context of those expressions.",
        "Considering such a situation, it is necessary to develop a tool which properly recognizes and semantically interprets Japanese compound functional expressions.",
        "In this paper, we apply a machine learning technique to the task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions in a text.",
        "We formalize this identification task as a chunking problem.",
        "We employ the technique of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1998) as the machine learning technique, which has been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks including chunking tasks such as phrase chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) and named entity chunking (Mayfield et al., 2003).",
        "In the preliminary experimental evaluation, we focus on 52 expressions that have balanced distribution of their usages in the newspaper text corpus and are among the most difficult ones in terms of their identification in a text.",
        "We show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing Japanese text processing tools as well as another tool based on hand-crafted rules.",
        "We further show that, in the proposed SVMs based framework, it is sufficient to collect and manually annotate about 50 training examples per expression."

        "There exist several collections which list Japanese functional expressions and examine their usages.",
        "For example, (Morita and Matsuki, 1989) examine 450 functional expressions and (Group Jamashii, 1998) also lists 965 expressions and their example sentences.",
        "Compared with those two collections, Gendaigo Hukugouji Youreishu (National Language Research Institute, 2001) (henceforth, denoted as GHY) concentrates on 125 major functional expressions which have non-compositional usages, as well as their variants5 (337 expressions in total), and collects example sentences of those expressions.",
        "As a first step of developing a tool for identifying Japanese compound functional expressions, we start with those 125 major functional expressions and their variants.",
        "In this paper, we take an approach of regarding each of those variants as a fixed expression, rather than a semi-fixed expression or a syntactically-flexible expression (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Then, we focus on evaluating the effectiveness of straightforwardly applying a stan",
        "dard chunking technique to the task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions.",
        "As in Table 2, according to their grammatical functions, those 337 expressions in total are roughly classified into post positional particle type, and auxiliary verb type.",
        "Functional expressions of post-positional particle type are further classified into three subtypes: i) those subsequent to a predicate and modifying a predicate, which mainly function as conjunctive particles and are used for constructing subordinate clauses, ii) those subsequent to a nominal, and modifying a predicate, which mainly function as case-marking particles, iii) those subsequent to a nominal, and modifying a nominal, which mainly function as adnominal particles and are used for constructing adnominal clauses.",
        "For each of those types, Table 2 also shows the number of major expressions as well as that of their variants listed in GHY, and an example expression.",

        "The task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions roughly consists of detecting candidates of compound functional expressions in a text and of judging the usages of those candidate expressions.",
        "The class of Japanese compound functional expressions can be regarded as closed and their number is at most a few thousand.",
        "Expression Example sentence (English translation) Usage L L 1 5 7C t I MM � L L -15t 0) 0)�� ��.",

        "Therefore, it is easy to enumerate all the compound functional expressions and their morpheme sequences.",
        "Then, in the process of detecting candidates of compound functional expressions in a text, the text are matched against the morpheme sequences of the compound functional expressions considered.",
        "Here, most of the 125 major functional expressions we consider in this paper are compound expressions which consist of one or more content words as well as functional words.",
        "As we introduced with the examples of Table 1, it is often the case that they have both a compositional content word usage as well as a non-compositional functional usage.",
        "For example, in Table 3, the expression “L ).1?a L (to-naru-to)” in the sentence (2) has the meaning “ that (something) becomes ∼”, which corresponds to a literal concatenation of the usages of the constituents: the post-positional particle “L”, the verb “).1?a”, and the post-positional particle “ L ”, and can be regarded as a content word usage.",
        "On the other hand, in the case of the sentence (1), the expression “L).1 ?a L (to-naru-to)” has a non-compositional functional meaning “if”.",
        "Based on this discussion, we classify the usages of those expressions into two classes: functional and content.",
        "Here, functional usages include both non-compositional and compositional functional usages, although most of the functional usages of those 125 major expressions can be regarded as non-compositional.",
        "On the other hand, content usages include compositional content word usages only.",
        "More practically, in the process of detecting candidates of compound functional expressions in a text, it can happen that more than one candidate expression is detected.",
        "For example, in Table 4, both of the candidate compound functional expressions “L L 1 5 (to-iu)” and “L L 1 5 t 0) 0) (to-iu-mono-no)” are detected in the sentence (9).",
        "This is because the sequence of the two morphemes “L (to)” and “L 1 5 (iu)” constituting the candidate expression “L L 1 5 (to-iu)” is a subsequence of the four morphemes constituting the candidate expression “L L 1 5 t 0)0) (to-iu-monono)” as below:",
        "This is also the case with the sentence (10).",
        "Here, however, as indicated in Table 4, the sentence (9) is an example of the functional usage of the compound functional expression “L L 1 5 (to-iu)”, where the sequence of the two morphemes “ L (to)” and “L 1 5 (iu)” should be identified and chunked into a compound functional expression.",
        "On the other hand, the sentence (10) is an example of the functional usage of the compound functional expression “ L L 1 5 t 0)0) (to-iu-monono)”, where the sequence of the four morphemes “ L (to)”, “L 1 5 (iu)”, “ t 0) (mono)”, and “0) (no)” should be identified and chunked into a compound functional expression.",
        "Actually, in the result of our preliminary corpus study, at least in about 20% of the occurrences of Japanese compound functional expressions, more than one candidate expression can be detected.",
        "This result indicates that it is necessary to consider more than one candidate expression in the task of identifying a Japanese compound functional expression, and also in the task of classifying the functional/content usage of a candidate expression.",
