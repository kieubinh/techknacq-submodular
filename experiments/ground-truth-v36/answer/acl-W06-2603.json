        "Many tasks related to the analysis of natural language are best solved today by machine learning and other data driven approaches.",
        "In particular, several subproblems related to information extraction can be formulated in the supervised learning framework, where statistical learning has rapidly become one of the preferred methods of choice.",
        "A common characteristic of many NLP problems is the relational and structured nature of the representations that describe data and that are internally used by various algorithms.",
        "Hence, in order to develop effective learning algorithms, it is necessary to cope with the inherent structure that characterize linguistic entities.",
        "Kernel methods (see e.g. Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) are well suited to handle learning tasks in structured domains as the statistical side of a learning algorithm can be naturally decoupled from any representational details that are handled by the kernel function.",
        "As a matter of facts, kernel-based statistical learning has gained substantial importance in the NLP field.",
        "Applications are numerous and diverse and include for example refinement of statistical parsers (Collins and Duffy, 2002), tagging named entities (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), syntactic chunking (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005), extraction of relations between entities (Zelenko et al., 2003; Cu-lotta and Sorensen, 2004), semantic role labeling (Moschitti, 2004).",
        "The literature is rich with examples of kernels on discrete data structures such as sequences (Lodhi et al., 2002; Leslie et al., 2002; Cortes et al., 2004), trees (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002), and annotated graphs (G¨artner, 2003; Smola and Kon-dor, 2003; Kashima et al., 2003; Horv´ath et al., 2004).",
        "Kernels of this kind can be almost invariably described as special cases of convolution and other decomposition kernels (Haussler, 1999).",
        "Thanks to its generality, decomposition is an attractive and flexible approach for defining the similarity between structured objects starting from the similarity between smaller parts.",
        "However, excessively large feature spaces may result from the combinatorial growth of the number of distinct subparts with their size.",
        "When too many dimensions in the feature space are irrelevant, the Gram matrix will be nearly diagonal (Sch¨olkopf et al., 2002), adversely affecting generalization in spite of using large margin classifiers (Ben-David et al., 2002).",
        "Possible cures include extensive use of prior knowledge to guide the choice of relevant parts (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Frasconi et al., 2004), the use of feature selection (Suzuki et al., 2004), and soft matches (Saunders et al., 2002).",
        "In (Menchetti et al., 2005) we have shown that better generalization can indeed be achieved by avoiding hard comparisons between large parts.",
        "In a",
        "weighted decomposition kernel (WDK) only small parts are matched, whereas the importance of the match is determined by comparing the sufficient statistics of elementary probabilistic models fitted on larger contextual substructures.",
        "Here we introduce a position-dependent version of WDK that can solve sequence labeling problems without searching the output space, as required by other recently proposed kernel-based solutions (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next two sections we briefly review decomposition kernels and its weighted variant.",
        "In Section 4 we introduce a version of WDK for solving supervised sequence labeling tasks and report a preliminary evaluation on a named entity recognition problem.",
        "In Section 5 we suggest a novel multi-instance approach for representing WordNet information and present an application to the PP attachment ambiguity resolution problem.",
        "In Section 6 we discuss how these ideas could be merged using a declarative formalism in order to integrate multiple sources of information when using kernel-based learning in NLP."
