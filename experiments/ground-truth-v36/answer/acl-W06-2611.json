        "During the last years a noticeable effort has been devoted to the design of lexical resources that can provide the training ground for automatic semantic role labelers.",
        "Unfortunately, most of the systems developed until now are confined to the scope of the resource that they use during the learning stage.",
        "A very recent example in this sense was provided by the CONLL 2005 Shared Task on PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) role labeling (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005).",
        "While the best F-measure recorded on a test set selected from the training corpus (WSJ) was 80%, on the Brown corpus, the F-measure dropped below 70%.",
        "The most significant causes for this performance decay were highly ambiguous and unseen predicates (i.e. predicates that do not have training examples, unseen in the training set).",
        "On the FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2003) role labeling task, the Senseval-3 competition (Lit-kowski, 2004) registered similar results (~80%) by using the gold frame information as a given feature.",
        "No tests were performed outside FrameNet.",
        "In this paper, we show that when the frame feature is not used, the performance decay on different corpora reaches 30 points.",
        "Thus, the context knowledge provided by the frame is very important and a free-text semantic parser using FrameNet roles depends on the accurate automatic detection of this information.",
        "In order to test the feasibility of such a task, we have trained an SVM (Support Vector Machine) Tree Kernel model for the automatic acquisition of the frame information.",
        "Although FrameNet contains three types of predicates (nouns, adjectives and verbs), we concentrated on the verb predicates and the roles associated with them.",
        "Therefore, we considered only the frames that have at least one verb lexical unit.",
        "Our experiments show that given a FrameNet predicate-argument structure, the task of identifying the originating frame can be performed with very good results when the verb predicates have enough training examples, but becomes very challenging otherwise.",
        "The predicates not yet included in FrameNet and the predicates belonging to new application domains (that require new frames) are especially problematic as for them there is no available training data.",
        "We have thus studied new means of capturing the semantic context, other than the frame, which can be easily annotated on FrameNet and are available on a larger scale (i.e. have a better coverage).",
        "A very good candidate seems to be the Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998) that can be found as well in other predicate resources like PropBank and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000).",
        "Thus, we have designed a semi-automatic algorithm for assigning an Intersective Levin class to each FrameNet verb predicate.",
        "The algorithm creates a mapping between FrameNet frames and the Intersective Levin classes.",
        "By doing that we could connect FrameNet to VerbNet and PropBank and obtain an increased training set for the Intersective Levin class.",
        "This leads to better verb coverage and a more robust semantic parser.",
        "The newly created knowledge base allows us to surpass the shortcomings that arise when FrameNet, VerbNet and PropBank are used separately while, at the same time, we benefit from the extensive research involving each of them (Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004).",
        "We mention that there are 3,672 distinct verb senses1 in PropBank and 2,351 distinct verb senses in FrameNet.",
        "Only 501 verb senses are in common between the two corpora which mean 13.64% of PropBank and 21.31% of FrameNet.",
        "Thus, by training an Intersective Levin class classifier on both PropBank and FrameNet we extend the number of available verb senses to 5,522.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 summarizes previous work done on FrameNet automatic role detection.",
        "It also explains in more detail why models based exclusively on this corpus are not suitable for free-text parsing.",
        "Section 3 focuses on VerbNet and PropBank and how they can enhance the robustness of our semantic parser.",
        "Section 4 describes the mapping between frames and Intersective Levin classes whereas Section 5 presents the experiments that support our thesis.",
        "Finally, Section 6 summarizes the conclusions.",
        "2 Automatic semantic role detection on FrameNet One of the goals of the FrameNet project is to design a linguistic ontology that can be used for automatic processing of semantic information.",
        "This hierarchy contains an extensive semantic analysis of verbs, nouns, adjectives and situations in which they are used, called frames.",
        "The basic assumption on which the frames are built is that each word evokes a particular situation with specific participants (Fillmore, 1968).",
        "The situations can be fairly simple depicting the entities involved and the roles they play or can be very complex and in this case they are called scenarios.",
        "The word that evokes a particular frame is called target word or predicate and can be an",
        "adjective, noun or verb.",
        "The participant entities are defined using semantic roles and they are called frame elements.",
        "Several models have been developed for the automatic detection of the frame elements based on the FrameNet corpus (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003; Litkowski, 2004).",
        "While the algorithms used vary, almost all the previous studies divide the task into 1) the identification of the verb arguments to be labeled and 2) the tagging of each argument with a role.",
        "Also, most of the models agree on the core features as being: Predicate, Headword, Phrase Type, Governing Category, Position, Voice and Path.",
        "These are the initial features adopted by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (henceforth G&J) for both frame element identification and role classification.",
        "A difference among the previous machine-learning models is whether the frame information was used as gold feature.",
        "Of particular interest for us is the impact of the frame over unseen predicates and unseen words in general.",
        "The results obtained by G&J are relevant in this sense; especially, the experiment that uses the frame to generalize from predicates seen in the training data to other predicates (i.e. when no data is available for a target word, G&J use data from the corresponding frame).",
        "The overall performance induced by the frame usage increased.",
        "Other studies suggest that the frame is crucial when trying to eliminate the major sources of errors.",
        "In their error analysis, (Thompson et al., 2003) pinpoints that the verb arguments with headwords that are “rare” in a particular frame but not rare over the whole corpus are especially hard to classify.",
        "For these cases the frame is very important because it provides the context information needed to distinguish between different word senses.",
        "Overall, the experiments presented in G&J’s study correlated with the results obtained in the Senseval-3 competition show that the frame feature increases the performance and decreases the amount of annotated examples needed in training (i.e. frame usage improves the generalization ability of the learning algorithm).",
        "On the other hand the results obtained without the frame information are very poor.",
        "This behavior suggests that predicates in the same frame behave similarly in terms of their argument structure and that they differ with respect to other frames.",
        "From this perspective, having a broader verb knowledge base becomes of major importance for free-text semantic parsing.",
        "Unfortunately, the 321 frames that contain at least one verb predicate cover only a small fraction of the English verb lexicon and of possible domains.",
        "Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see Litkowski, 2004 for more details).",
        "Our approach for solving such problems involves the usage of a frame-like feature, namely the Intersective Levin class.",
        "We show that the Levin class is similar in many aspects to the frame and can replace it with almost no loss in performance.",
        "At the same time, Levin class provides better coverage as it can be learned also from other corpora (i.e. PropBank).",
        "We annotate FrameNet with Intersective Levin classes by using a mapping algorithm that exploits current theories of linking.",
        "Our extensive experimentation shows the validity of our technique and its effectiveness on corpora different from FrameNet.",
        "The next section provides the theoretical support for the unified usage of FrameNet, VerbNet and PropBank, explaining why and how is possible to link them.",
        "3 Linking FrameNet to VerbNet and PropBank In general, predicates belonging to the same FrameNet frame have a coherent syntactic behavior that is also different from predicates pertaining to other frames (G&J).",
        "This finding is consistent with theories of linking that claim that the syntactic behavior of a verb can be predicted from its semantics (Levin 1993, Levin and Rap-paport Hovav, 1996).",
        "This insight determined us to study the impact of using a feature based on Intersective Levin classes instead of the frame feature when classifying FrameNet semantic roles.",
        "The main advantage of using Levin classes comes from the fact that other resources like PropBank and the VerbNet lexicon contain this kind of information.",
        "Thus, we can train a Levin class classifier also on the PropBank corpus, considerably increasing the verb knowledge base at our disposal.",
        "Another advantage derives from the syntactic criteria that were applied in defining the Levin clusters.",
        "As shown later in this article, the syntactic nature of these classes makes them easier to classify than frames, when using only syntactic and lexical features.",
        "More precisely, the Levin clusters are formed according to diathesis alternation criteria which are variations in the way verbal arguments are grammatically expressed when a specific semantic phenomenon arises.",
        "For example, two different types of diathesis alternations are the following:",
        "In both cases, what is alternating is the grammatical function that the Patient role takes when changing from the transitive use of the verb to the intransitive one.",
        "The semantic phenomenon accompanying these types of alternations is the change of focus from the entity performing the action to the theme of the event.",
        "Levin documented 79 alternations which constitute the building blocks for the verb classes.",
        "Although alternations are chosen as the primary means for identifying the classes, additional properties related to subcategorization, morphology and extended meanings of verbs are taken into account as well.",
        "Thus, from a syntactic point of view, the verbs in one Levin class have a regular behavior, different from the verbs pertaining to other classes.",
        "Also, the classes are semantically coherent and all verbs belonging to one class share the same participant roles.",
        "This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexicon that is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin classification called Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).",
        "The lexicon provides a regular association between the syntactic and semantic properties of each of the described classes.",
        "It also provides information about the syntactic frames (alternations) in which the verbs participate and the set of possible semantic roles.",
        "One corpus associated with the VerbNet lexicon is PropBank.",
        "The annotation scheme of PropBank ensures that the verbs belonging to the same Levin class share similarly labeled arguments.",
        "Inside one Intersective Levin class, to one argument corresponds one semantic role numbered sequentially from Arg0 to Arg5.",
        "Higher numbered argument labels are less consistent and assigned per-verb basis.",
        "The Levin classes were constructed based on regularities exhibited at grammatical level and the resulting clusters were shown to be semantically coherent.",
        "As opposed, the FrameNet frames were build on semantic bases, by putting together verbs, nouns and adjectives that evoke the same situations.",
        "Although different in conception, the",
        "FrameNet verb clusters and VerbNet verb clusters have common properties2:",
        "(1) Coherent syntactic behavior of verbs inside one cluster, (2) Different syntactic properties between any two distinct verb clusters, (3) Shared set of possible semantic roles for all verbs pertaining to the same cluster.",
        "Having these insights, we have assigned a correspondent VerbNet class not to each verb predicate but rather to each frame.",
        "In doing this we have applied the simplifying assumption that a frame has a unique corresponding Levin class.",
        "Thus, we have created a one-to-many mapping between the Intersective Levin classes and the frames.",
        "In order to create a pair (FrameNet frame, VerbNet class), our mapping algorithm checks both the syntactic and semantic consistency by comparing the role frequency distributions on different syntactic positions for the two candidates.",
        "The algorithm is described in detail in the next section."

        "As FrameNetis annotated with frame-specific semantic roles we manually mappedthese roles into the VerbNetsetofthematic roles.",
        "Given a frame, we assignedthematic roles to all frame elements that are associatedwithverbal predicates.",
        "Forexample the roles Speaker, Addressee, Message andTopic fromthe Telling frame were respectively mapped into Agent, Recipient, Theme an d Topic.",
        "Second, we build a frequency distribution of VerbNet thematic roles on different syntactic position.",
        "Based on our observation and previous studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume that each Levin class has a distinct frequency distribution of roles on different grammatical slots.",
        "As we do not have matching grammatical function in FrameNet and VerbNet, we approximate that subjects and direct objects are more likely to appear on positions adjacent to the predicate, while indirect objects appear on more distant positions.",
        "The same intuition is used successfully by G&J in the design of the Position feature.",
        "We will acquire from the corpus, for each thematic role Oi, the frequencies with which it appears on an adjacent (ADJ) or distant (DST) position in a given frame or VerbNet class (i.e. #(Oi, class, position)).",
        "Therefore, for each frame and class, we obtain two vectors with thematic role frequencies corresponding respectively to the adjacent and distant positions (see Figure 2).",
        "We compute a score for each pair (FrameNet frame, VerbNet class) using the normalized scalar product.",
        "We give a bigger weight to the adjacent dot product multiplying its score by 2/3 with respect to the distant dot product that is multiplied by 1/3.",

        "Also, both automatic features are very effective, decreasing the error rate of 20%.",
        "The next set of experiments show the impact of the ILC feature on semantic role labelling when few training data is available (Figure 3).",
        "As can be noted, the automatic ILC features (i.e. derived with classifers trained on FrameNet or PB) produce accuracy almost as good as the gold ILC one.",
        "Another observation is that the SRL classifiers are not saturated and more training examples would improve their accuracy.",
        "5.5 Annotating PropBank with FrameNet semantic roles To show that our approach can be suitable for semantic role free-text annotation, we have automatically classified PropBank sentences with the FrameNet semantic-role classifiers.",
        "In order to measure the quality of the annotation, we randomly selected 100 sentences and manually verified them.",
        "We measured the performance obtained with and without the automatic ILC feature.",
        "The sentences contained 189 arguments from which 35 were incorrect when ILC was used compared to 72 incorrect in the absence of this feature.",
        "This corresponds to an accuracy of 81% with Intersective Levin class versus 62% without it."

        "In this paper we have shown that the Intersective Levin class feature can successfully replace the FrameNet frame feature.",
        "By doing that we could interconnect FrameNet to VerbNet and PropBank obtaining better verb coverage and a more robust semantic parser.",
        "Our good results show that we have defined an effective framework which is a promising step toward the design of free-text semantic parsers.",
