        "Successful resolution and generation of definite anaphora requires knowledge of hypernym and hy-ponym relationships.",
        "For example, determining the antecedent to the definite anaphor “the drug” in text requires knowledge of what previous noun-phrase candidates could be drugs.",
        "Likewise, generating a definite anaphor for the antecedent “Morphine” in text requires both knowledge of potential hypernyms (e.g. “the opiate”, “the narcotic”, “the drug”, and “the substance”), as well as selection of the most appropriate level of generality along the hypernym tree in context (i.e. the “natural” hypernym anaphor).",
        "Unfortunately existing manual hypernym databases such as WordNet are very incomplete, especially for technical vocabulary and proper names.",
        "Word-Nets are also limited or non-existent for most of the",
        "world’s languages.",
        "Finally, WordNets also do not include notation of the “natural” hypernym level for anaphora generation, and using the immediate parent performs quite poorly, as quantified in Section 5.",
        "In first part of this paper, we propose a novel approach for resolving definite anaphora involving hy-ponymy relations.",
        "We show that it performs substantially better than previous approaches on the task of antecedent selection.",
        "In the second part we demonstrate how this approach can be successfully extended to the problem of generating a natural definite NP given a specific antecedent.",
        "In order to explain the antecedent selection task for definite anaphora clearly, we provide the following example taken from the LDC Gigaword corpus (Graff et al., 2005).",
        "(1) ...pseudoephedrine is found in an allergy treatment, which was given to Wilson by a doctor when he attended Blinn junior college in Houston.",
        "In a unanimous vote, the Norwegian sports confederation ruled that Wilson had not taken the drug to enhance his performance...",
        "In the above example, the task is to resolve the definite NP the drug to its correct antecedent pseudoephedrine, among the potential antecedents <pseudoephedrine, allergy, blinn, college, hous-ton, vote, confederation, wilson>.",
        "Only Wilson can be ruled out on syntactic grounds (Hobbs, 1978).",
        "To be able to resolve the correct antecedent from the remaining potential antecedents, the system requires the knowledge that pseudoephedrine is a drug.",
        "Thus, the problem is to create such a knowledge source and apply it to this task of antecedent selection.",
        "A total of 177 such anaphoric examples",
        "were extracted randomly from the LDC Gigaword corpus and a human judge identified the correct antecedent for the definite NP in each example (given a context of previous sentences).1 Two human judges were asked to perform the same task over the same examples.",
        "The agreement between the judges was 92% (of all 177 examples), indicating a clearly defined task for our evaluation purposes.",
        "We describe an unsupervised approach to this task that extracts examples containing definite NPs from a large corpus, considers all head words appearing before the definite NP as potential antecedents and then filters the noisy <antecedent, definite-NP> pair using Mutual Information space.",
        "The co-occurence statistics of such pairs can then be used as a mechanism for detecting a hypernym relation between the definite NP and its potential antecedents.",
        "We compare this approach with a WordNet-based algorithm and with an approach presented by Markert and Nis-sim (2005) on resolving definite NP coreference that makes use of lexico-syntactic patterns such as ’X and Other Ys’ as utilized by Hearst (1992)."

        "Then, the sentences containing instances of anaphoric definite NPs were kept and other cases of definite expressions (like existential NPs “The White House”,“The weather”) were discarded.",

        "However, our task is more challenging since the anaphoric definite NPs in our test set include only hypernym anaphors without including the much simpler cases of headword repetition and other instances of string matching.",
        "For direct evaluation, we also implemented their corpus-based approach and compared it with our models on identical test data.",
