        "Unlexicalized probabilistic context-free parsing is a simple and flexible approach that nevertheless has shown good performance (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "We applied this approach to the shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) for Arabic (Hajiˇc et al., 2004), Chinese (Chen et al., 2003), Czech (Böhmová et al., 2003), Danish (Kromann, 2003), Dutch (van der Beek et al., 2002), German (Brants et al., 2002), Japanese (Kawata and Bartels, 2000), Portuguese (Afonso et al., 2002), Slovene (Džeroski et al., 2006), Spanish (Civit Torruella and Martí An-tonín, 2002), Swedish (Nilsson et al., 2005), Turkish (Oflazer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003), but not Bulgarian (Simov et al., 2005).",
        "In our approach we put special emphasis on language independence: We did not use any extraneous knowledge; we did not do any transformations on the treebanks; we restricted language-specific parameters to a small, easily manageable set (a classification of dependency relations into complements, adjuncts, and conjuncts/coordinators, and a switch for Japanese to include coarse POS tag information, see section 3.4).",
        "In a series of post-submission experiments, we investigated how much the parse results can help a machine learner."

      "text": [
        "In order to determine the grammar rules required by the context-free parser, the dependency trees in the CONLL format have to be converted to constituency trees.",
        "Gaifman (1965) proved that projective dependency grammars can be mapped to context-free grammars.",
        "The main information that needs to be added in going from dependency to constituency structure is the category of non-terminals.",
        "The usage of special knowledge bases to determine projections of categories (Xia and Palmer, 2001) would have presupposed language-dependent knowledge, so we investigated two other options: Flat rules (Collins et al., 1999) and binary rules.",
        "In the flat rules approach, each lexical category projects to exactly one phrasal category, and every projection chain has a length of at most one.",
        "The binary rules approach makes use of the X-bar-scheme and thus introduces along with the phrasal category an intermediate category.",
        "The phrasal category must not occur more than once in a projection chain, and a projection chain must not end in an intermediate category.",
        "In both approaches, projection is only triggered if dependents are present; in case a category occurs as a dependent itself, no projection is required.",
        "In coordination structures, the parent category is copied from that of the last conjunct.",
        "Non-projective relations can be treated as unbounded dependencies so that their surface position (antecedent position) is related to the position of their head (trace position) with an explicit co-indexed trace (like in the Penn treebank).",
        "To find the position of trace and antecedent we assume three constraints: The antecedent should c-command its trace.",
        "The antecedent is maximally near to the trace in depth of embedding.",
        "The trace is maximally near to the antecedent in surface order.",
        "Finally the placement of punctuation signs has a major impact on the performance of a parser (Collins et al., 1999).",
        "In most of the treebanks, not much effort is invested into the treatment of punctuation.",
        "Sometimes, punctuation signs play a role in predicate-argument structure (commas acting as coordinators), but more often they do not, in which case they are marked by special roles (e.g. “pnct”, “punct”, “PUNC”, or “PUNCT”).",
        "We used a general mechanism to reinsert such signs, for all languages but CH (no punctuation signs) and AR, CZ, SL (reliable annotation).",
        "Correct placement of punctuation presupposes knowledge of the punctuation rules valid in a language.",
        "In the interest of generality, we opted for a suboptimal solution: Punctuation signs are inserted in the highest possible position in a tree."

      "text": [
        "The most important language-specific information that we made use of was a classification of dependency relations into complements, coordinators/conjuncts, and other relations (adjuncts).",
        "Given knowledge about complement relations, it is fairly easy to construct subcategorization frames for word occurrences: A subcategorization frame is simply the set of the complement relations by which dependents are attached to the word.",
        "To give the parser access to these lists, we annotated the category of a subcategorizing word with its subcategorization frame.",
        "In this way, the parser can learn to associate the subcategorization requirements of a word with its local syntactic context (Schiehlen, 2004).",
        "Coordination constructions are marked either in the conjuncts (CH, CZ, DA, DU, GE, PO, SW) or the coordinator (AR, SL).",
        "If conjuncts show coordination, a common representation of asyndetic coordination has one conjunct point to another conjunct.",
        "It is therefore important to distinguish coordinators from conjuncts.",
        "Coordinators are either singled out by special dependency relations (DA, PO, SW) or by their POS tags (CH, DU).",
        "In German, the first conjunct phrase is merged with the whole coordinated phrase (due to a conversion error?)",
        "so that determining the coordinator as a head is not possible.",
        "We also experimented with attaching the POS tags of heads to the categories of their adjunct dependents.",
        "In this way, the parser could differentiate between e.g. verbal and nominal adjuncts.",
        "In our experiments, the performance gains achieved by this strategy were low, so we did not incorporate it into the system.",
        "Possibly, better results could be achieved by restricting annotation to special classes of adjuncts or by generalizing the heads’ POS tags."

        "Only the dependency relation is really orthogonal; the other slots contain various generalizations of the same morphological information.",
        "We tested several options: coarse-grained POS tag (if available), fine-grained POS tag, fine-grained POS tag with morphosyntactic features (if available), name of dependency relation, and the combinations of coarse-grained or fine-grained POS tags with the dependency relation.",
        "Figure 1 shows F-score results on the development set for several languages and different combinations.",
        "The best overall performer is dep-rel; this somewhat astonishing fact may be due to the superior quality of the annotations in this slot (dependency relations were annotated by hand, POS tags automatically).",
        "Furthermore, being checked in evaluation, dependency relations directly affect performance.",
        "Since we wanted a general language-independent strategy, we used always the dep-rel tags but for Japanese.",

        "usually contain very many long rules of low frequency (presumably because inserting nodes costs annotators time).",
        "Such rules cannot have an impact in a statistical system (the line new-rules in Figure 2 shows the percentage of rules in the test set that are not in the training set); it is better to view them as products of a Markov process that chooses first the head, then the symbols left of the head and finally the symbols right of the hand.",
        "In a bigram model, the choice of left and right siblings is made dependent not only on the parent and head category, but also on the last sibling on the left or right, respectively.",
        "Formally the probability of a rule with left hand side and right hand side is broken down to the product of the probability of the head, the probabilities of the left siblings and those of the right siblings .",
        "Generic symbols designate beginning ( ) and end ( ) of the sibling lists.",
        "The method can be transferred to plain unlexicalized PCFG (Klein and Manning, 2003) by transforming long rules into a series of binary rules: If the bigram symbols and occur in less than a certain number of rules (50 in our case), we smooth to unigram symbols instead ( and ).",
        "We used a script of Schmid (2006) to Markovize infrequent rules in this manner (i.e. all rules with less than 50 occurrences that are not coordination rules).",

        "Collins (1999) used a lex-icalized approach, Schiehlen (2004) used the manually annotated phrasal categories of the treebank.",
        "Our second result is that context-free parsing can also boost the performance of a simple tagger-like machine learning system.",
        "While a maximum-entropy learner on its own achieves competitive results for only three languages (Ar, Po, Sl), competitive results in basically all languages are produced with access to the results of the probabilistic parser.",
