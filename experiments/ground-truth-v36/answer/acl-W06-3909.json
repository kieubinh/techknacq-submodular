        "Recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering [18] and textual entailment [10] has encouraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic resources.",
        "With seemingly endless amounts of textual data at our disposal, we have a tremendous opportunity to automatically grow semantic term banks and ontological resources.",
        "Methods must be accurate, adaptable and scalable to the varying sizes of domain corpora (e.g., textbooks vs. World Wide Web), and independent or weakly dependent on human supervision.",
        "In this paper we present Espresso, a novel bootstrapping algorithm for automatically harvesting semantic relations, aiming at effectively supporting NLP applications, emphasizing two major points that have been partially neglected by previous systems: generality and weak supervision.",
        "From the one side, Espresso is intended as a general-purpose system able to extract a wide variety of binary semantic relations, from the classical is-a and part-of relations, to more specific and domain oriented ones like chemical reactants in a chemistry domain and position succession in political texts.",
        "The system architecture is designed with generality in mind, avoiding any relation-specific inference technique.",
        "Indeed, for each semantic relation, the system builds specific lexical patterns inferred from textual corpora.",
        "From the other side, Espresso requires only weak human supervision.",
        "In order to start the extraction process, a user provides only a small set of seed instances of a target relation (e.g. Italy-country and Canada-country for the is-a relation.)",
        "In our experience, a handful of seed instances, in general, is sufficient for large corpora while for smaller corpora, a slightly larger set is required.",
        "To guarantee weakest supervision, Espresso combines its bootstrapping approach with a web-based knowledge expansion technique and linguistic analysis, exploiting the seeds as much as possible."

        "learn WordNet-based selectional restrictions, like [whole-NP(scene#4) 's part-NP(movie#I)].",
        "While making huge grounds on improving precision/recall, the system requires heavy supervision through manual semantic annotations.",
        "Ravichandran and Hovy [20] focus on efficiency issues for scaling relation extraction to terabytes of data.",
        "A simple and effective algorithm is proposed to infer surface patterns from a small set of instance seeds by extracting all substrings relating seeds in corpus sentences.",
        "The frequencies of the substrings in the corpus are then used to retain the best patterns.",

        "The Espresso algorithm is based on a similar framework to the one adopted in [12].",
        "For a specific semantic binary relation (e.g., is-a), the algorithm requires as input a small set of seed instances Is and a corpus C. An instance is a pair of terms x and y governed by the relation at hand (e.g., Pablo Picasso is-a artist).",
        "Starting from these seeds, the algorithm begins a four-phase loop.",
        "In the first phase, the algorithm infers a set of patterns P that captures as many of the seed instances as possible in C. In the second phase, we define a reliability measure to select the best set of patterns PtP.",
        "In phase three, the patterns in P' are used to extract a set of instances I.",
        "Finally, in phase four, Espresso scores each instance and then selects the best instances I' as input seeds for the next iteration.",
        "The algorithm terminates when a predefined stopping condition is met (for our preliminary experiments, the stopping condition is set according to the size of the corpus).",
        "For each induced patternp and instance i, the information theoretic scores, rjp) and r,(i) respectively, aim to express their reliability.",
        "Below, Sections 3.2-3.5 describe in detail these different phases of Espresso.",
        "Before one can extract relation instances from a corpus, it is necessary to define a tokenization procedure for extracting terms.",
        "Terms are commonly defined as surface representations of stable and key domain concepts [19].",
        "Defining regular expressions over POS-tagged corpora is the most commonly used technique to both define and extract terms.",
        "We adopt a slightly modified version of the term definition given in [13], as it is one of the most commonly used in the literature:",
        "We operationally extend the definition of Adj to include present and past participles as most noun phrases composed of them are usually intended as terms (e.g., boiling point).",
        "Thus, unlike many approaches for automatic relation extraction, we allow complex multi-word terms as anchor points.",
        "Hence, we can capture relations between complex terms, such as \"record of a criminal conviction\" part-of \"FBI report\".",
        "The pattern discovery phase takes as input a set of instances I' and produces as output a set of lexical patterns P. For the first iteration I' = Is, the set of initial seeds.",
        "In order to induce P, we apply a slight modification to the approach presented in [20].",
        "For each input instance i = {x, y}, we first retrieve all sentences Sxy containing the two terms x and y. Sentences are then generalized into a set of new sentences SGxy by replacing all terminological expressions by a terminological label (TR).",
        "For example:",
        "\"Because/IN HF/NNP is/VBZ a/DT weak/JJ acid/NN and/CC x is/VBZ a/DTy\" is generalized as:",
        "\"Because/IN TR is/VBZ a/DT TR and/CC x is/VBZ a/DTy\"",
        "All substrings linking terms x and y are then extracted from the set SGxy, and overall frequencies are computed.",
        "The most frequent substrings then represent the set of new patterns P, where the frequency cutoff is experimentally set.",
        "Term generalization is particularly useful for small corpora, where generalization is vital to ease the data sparseness.",
        "However, the generalized patterns are naturally less precise.",
        "Hence, when dealing with bigger corpora, the system allows the use of SxyvjSGxy in order to extract substrings.",
        "For our experiments, we used the set SGxy .",
        "In this phase, Espresso selects among the patterns P those that are most reliable.",
        "Intuitively, a reliable pattern is one that is both highly precise and one that extracts many instances.",
        "The recall of a pattern p can be approximated by the fraction of input instances in I' that are extracted by p. Since it is difficult at runtime to estimate the precision of a pattern, we are weary of keeping patterns that generate many instances (i.e., patterns that generate high recall but potentially disastrous precision).",
        "We thus prefer patterns that are highly associated with the input patterns I'.",
        "Pointwise mutual information [4] is a commonly used metric for measuring the strength of association between two events x and y:",
        "We define the reliability of a pattern p, rip), as its average strength of association across each input instance i in I', weighted by the reliability of each instance i:",
        "where r^i) is the reliability of instance i (defined in Section 3.5) and maxpmi is the maximum pointwise mutual information between all patterns and all instances.",
        "rip) ranges from [0,1].",
        "The reliability of the manually supplied seed instances are r^i) = 1.",
        "The pointwise mutual information between instance i = {x, y} and patternp is estimated using the following formula:",
        "where |x, p, y| is the frequency of pattern p instantiated with terms x and y and where the asterisk (*) represents a wildcard.",
        "A well-known problem is that pointwise mutual information is biased towards infrequent events.",
        "To address this, we multiply pmi(i, p) with the discounting factor suggested in [16].",
        "The set of highest n scoring patterns P', according to rip), are then selected and retained for the next phase, where n is the number of patterns of the previous iteration incremented by 1.",
        "In general, we expect that the set of patterns is formed by those of the previous iteration plus a new one.",
        "Yet, new statistical evidence can lead the algorithm to discard a pattern that was previously discovered.",
        "Moreover, to further discourage too generic patterns that might have low precision, a threshold t is set for the number of instances that a pattern retrieves.",
        "Patterns firing more than t instances are then discarded, no matter what their score is.",
        "In this paper, we experimentally set t to a value dependent on the size of the corpus.",
        "In future work, this parameter can be learned using a development corpus.",
        "Our reliability measure ensures that overly generic patterns, which may potentially have very low precision, are discarded.",
        "However, we are currently exploring a web-expansion algorithm that could both help detect generic patterns and also filter out their incorrect instances.",
        "We estimate the precision of the instance set generated by a new pattern p by looking at the number of these instances that are instantiated on the Web by previously accepted patterns.",
        "Generic patterns will generate instances with higher Web counts than incorrect patterns.",
        "Then, the Web counts can also be used to filter out incorrect instances from the generic patterns' instantiations.",
        "More details are discussed in Section 4.3.",
        "In this phase, Espresso retrieves from the corpus the set of instances I that match any of the lexical patterns in P'.",
        "In small corpora, the number of extracted instances can be too low to guarantee sufficient statistical evidence for the pattern discovery phase of the next iteration.",
        "In such cases, the system enters a web expansion phase, in which new instances for the given patterns are retrieved from the Web, using the Google search engine.",
        "Specifically, for each instance i g I, the system creates a set of queries, using each pattern in P' with its y term instantiated with i's y term.",
        "For example, given the instance \"Italy ; country\" and the pattern [Y such as X] , the resulting Google query will be \"country such as *\".",
        "New instances are then created from the retrieved Web results (e.g. \"Canada ; country\") and added to I.",
        "We are currently exploring filtering mechanisms to avoid retrieving too much noise.",
        "Moreover, to cope with data sparsity, a syntactic expansion phase is also carried out.",
        "A set of new instances is created for each instance ig I by extracting sub-terminological expressions from x corresponding to the syntactic head of terms.",
        "For example, expanding the relation \"new record of a criminal conviction\" part-of \"FBI report\", the following new instances are obtained: \"new record\"part-of \"FBIreport\", and \"record\"part-of \"FBIreport\".",
        "Estimating the reliability of an instance is similar to estimating the reliability of a pattern.",
        "Intuitively, a reliable instance is one that is highly associated with as many reliable patterns as possible (i.e., we have more confidence in an instance when multiple reliable patterns instantiate it.)",
        "Hence, analogous to our pattern reliability measure in Section 3.3, we define the reliability of an instance i, r,(i), as:",
        "where rip) is the reliability of patternp (defined in Section 3.3) and maxpmi is the maximum pointwise mutual information between all patterns and all instances, as in Section 3.3.",
        "Espresso finally selects the highest scoring m instances, I', and retains them as input for the subsequent iteration.",
        "In this paper, we experimentally set m = 200.",

        "Unlike Girju et al.",
        "[11] that propose a highly supervised machine learning approach based on selectional restriction, ours is an unsupervised method based on statistical evidence obtained from the Web.",
        "At a given iteration in Espresso, the intuition behind our solution is that the Web is large enough that correct instances will be instantiated by many of the currently accepted patterns P. Hence, we can distinguish between generic patterns and incorrect patterns by inspecting the relative frequency distribution of their instances using the patterns in P. More formally, given an instance i produced by a generic or incorrect pattern, we count how many times i instantiates on the Web with every pattern in P, using Google.",
        "The instance i is then considered correct if its web count surpasses a given threshold.",
        "The pattern in question is accepted as a generic pattern if a sufficient number of its instances are considered correct, otherwise it is rejected as an incorrect pattern.",
        "Although our results in Section 4.2 do not include this algorithm, we performed a small experiment by adding an a-posteriori generic pattern recovery phase to Espresso.",
        "We tested the 7,634 instances extracted by the generic pattern [X of Y] on the CHEM corpus for the part-of relation.",
        "We randomly sample 200 of these instances and then queried Google for these instances using the pattern [X consists of Y].",
        "Manual evaluation of the 25 instances that occurred at least once on Google showed 50% precision.",
        "Adding these instances to the results from Table 5 decreases the system precision from 60% to 51%, but dramatically increases Espresso's recall by a factor of 8.16.",
        "Furthermore, it is important to note that there are several other generic patterns, like [X's Y], from which we expect a similar precision of 50% with a continual increase of recall.",
        "This is a very exciting avenue of further investigation."

        "Given a small set of seed instances for a particular relation, the system learns reliable lexical patterns, applies them to extract new instances ranked by an information theoretic definition of reliability, and then uses the Web to filter and expand the instances.",
        "There are many avenues of future work.",
        "Preliminary results show that Espresso generates highly precise relations, but at the expense of lower recall.",
        "As mentioned above in Section 4.3, we are working on improving system recall with a web-based method to identify generic patterns and filter their instances.",
        "Early results appear very promising.",
        "We also plan to investigate the use of WordNet selectional constraints, as proposed by [11].",
        "We expect here that negative instances will play a key role in determining the selectional restriction on generic patterns.",
        "Espresso is the first system, to our knowledge, to emphasize both minimal supervision and generality, both in identification of a wide variety of relations and in extensibility to various corpus sizes.",
        "It remains to be seen whether one could enrich existing ontologies with relations harvested by Espresso, and if these relations can benefit NLP applications such as QA."
