        "This situation has caused the NLP community to develop approaches which use a resource rich language (Q say English) as pivot to build resources/applications between a new language pair P and R. Previous studies in machine translation (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Paul and Sumita, 2011), transliteration (Khapra et al2010), and dictionary mining (Saralegi et al2011) show that these bridge language approaches perform competitively with approaches that use resources between P and R.
