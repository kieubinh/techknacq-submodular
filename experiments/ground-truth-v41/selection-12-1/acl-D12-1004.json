        "Prior work has reported on characteristic language peculiarities exhibited by schizophrenia patients.",
        "There are more repetitions in speech of patients compared to controls (Manschreck et al., 1985).",
        "Patients also tend to repeatedly refer back to themselves (Andreasen., 1986).",
        "Deviations from normal language use in patients on different levels, including phonetics and syntax, have been documented (Covington et al2005), however lexical differences have not been investigated in detail.",
        "In this paper we introduce a dataset of autobiographical narratives told by schizophrenic patients and by healthy controls.",
        "The narratives are related to emotional personal experiences of the subjects for five basic emotions: ANGER, SAD, HAPPY, DISGUST, FEAR.",
        "We train an SVM classifier to predict subject status.",
        "Our good results on the relatively small dataset indicate the potential of the approach.",
        "An automatic system for predicting patient status from autobiographical narratives can aid psychiatrists in tracking patients over time and can serve as an easy way to administer large scale screening.",
        "The detailed feature analysis we performed also pinpoints key differences between the two populations.",
        "We study a range of lexical features including individual words, repetitions as well as classes of words defined in specialized dictionaries compiled by psychologists (Section 4).",
        "We use several approaches for feature analysis to identify statistically significant differences in the two populations.",
        "There are 169 significant features among all of the 6057 features we examined.",
        "Through feature selection we are able to obtain a small set of 25 highly predictive features which lead to status classification accuracy significantly better than chance (Section 6.3).",
        "We also show that differences between patients and controls are revealed best in stories related to SAD and ANGRY narratives, they are decent in HAPPY stories, and that distinctions are poor for DISGUST and FEAR (Section 6.5)."

        "One of the most interesting discoveries in that line of research is that people with physical or emotional pain are likely to use first-person singular pronouns more often than the general population (Rude et al2004).",
        "In the view of therapy, Pennebaker discovered that writing emotional experiences can be helpful in therapeutic process (Pennebaker, 1997).",
        "It has also been shown that the usage of pronouns and function words can be indicators of writing styles, physical health and other distinctions (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010).",
        "The combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) has been explored in many psychology related projects, and is gaining popularity.",
        "It has been shown that features from language models (LMs) can be used to detect impairment in monolingual and bilingual children (Gabani et al2009).",
        "Even better results are achieved when features derived from LMs are combined with other surface features to predict language impairment.",
        "Similarly, studies on child language development and autism have shown that n-gram cross-entropy from LMs representative of healthy and impaired subjects is a highly significant feature predictive of language impairment (Prud?hommeaux et al2011).",
        "The feasibility of making use of lexical features to analyze language dominance among bilingual children has also been confirmed (Solorio et al. 2011).",
        "In non-medically related research, LIWC and lexical features have been used to recognize different personalities such as introvert vs extrovert, openness vs experience, conscientiousness vs unconscientiousness, etc.",
        "(Mairesse et al2007).",
        "Similar features have been applied to differentiate author personality of emails (Gill et al2006), blogs (Gill et al2009) and other documents.",

        "Syntax features have been used in approaches of automatic detection of neurological problems.",
        "Parsing texts produced by subjects and using bag of rules as features have been applied in analyzing language dominance (Solorio et al. 2011).",
        "Methods that quantify syntactic complexity like Yngve score and Fraizer score have been used to analyze autism (Prud?hommeaux et al2011).",
        "Moreover, there has been research on detecting mild cognitive impairment, which could be an earlier state of Alzheimer's disease: five different ways of evaluating syntactic complexity measures were introduced in their paper (Roark et al2011).",
        "In our own work, we focus our analysis exclusively on lexical features.",
        "Similarly to prior work, we present the most significant features related to differences between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls.",
        "Unlike prior work, instead of doing class ablation studies we perform feature selection from the full set of available features and identify a small set of highly predictive features which are sufficient to achieve the top performance we report.",

        "For words in the vocabulary: we use a real value feature equal to the word frequency for each document.",
