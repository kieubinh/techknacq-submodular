        "Inference rules are an important building block of many semantic applications, such as Question Answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and Information Extraction (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006).",
        "For example, given the sentence ?Churros are coated with sugar?, one can use the rule ?coat ?",
        "cover?",
        "to answer the question ?What are Churros covered with??.",
        "Inference rules specify a directional inference relation between two text fragments, and we follow the Textual Entailment modeling of inference (Dagan et al2006), which refers to such rules as entailment rules.",
        "In this work we focus on one of the most important rule types, namely, lexical entailment rules between verbs (verb entailment), e.g., ?whisper ?",
        "talk?, ?win ?",
        "play?",
        "and ?buy ?",
        "own?.",
        "The significance of such rules has led to active research in automatic learning of entailment rules between verbs or verb-like structures (Zanzotto et al. 2006; Abe et al2008; Schoenmackers et al2010).",
        "Most prior efforts to learn verb entailment rules from large corpora employed distributional similarity methods, assuming that verbs are semantically similar if they occur in similar contexts (Lin, 1998; Berant et al2012).",
        "This led to the automatic acquisition of large scale knowledge bases, but with limited precision.",
        "Fewer works, such as VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), focused on identifying verb entailment through verb instantiation of manually constructed patterns.",
        "For example, the sentence ?he scared and even startled me?",
        "implies that ?startle?",
        "scare?.",
        "This led to more precise rule extraction, but with poor coverage since contrary to nouns, in which patterns are common (Hearst, 1992), verbs do not co-occur often within rigid patterns.",
        "However, verbs do tend to co-occur in the same document, and also in different clauses of the same sentence.",
        "In this paper, we claim that on top of standard pattern-based and distributional similarity methods, corpus-based learning of verb entailment can greatly benefit from exploiting additional linguistically-motivated cues that are specific to verbs.",
        "For instance, when verbs co-occur in different clauses of the same sentence, the syntactic relation between the clauses can be viewed as a proxy for the semantic relation between the verbs.",
        "Moreover, we claim that to",
        "improve performance it is crucial to combine information sources from different textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence and within a document, distributional similarity over the entire corpus, etc.",
        "Our contribution in this paper is two-fold.",
        "First, we suggest a novel set of entailment indicators that help to detect the likelihood of verb entailment.",
        "Our novel indicators are specific to verbs and are linguistically-motivated.",
        "Second, we encode our novel indicators as features within a supervised classification framework and integrate them with other standard features adapted from prior work.",
        "This results in a supervised corpus-based learning method that combines verb entailment information at the sentence, document and corpus levels.",
        "We test our model on a manually labeled data set, and show that it outperforms the best performing previous work by 24%.",
        "In addition, we examine the effectiveness of indicators that operate at the sentence-level, document-level and corpus-level.",
        "This analysis reveals that using a rich and diverse set of indicators that capture sentence-level interactions between verbs substantially improves verb entailment detection."

        "The main approach for learning entailment rules between verbs and verb-like structures has employed the distributional hypothesis, which assumes that words with similar meanings appear in similar contexts.",
        "For example, we expect the words ?buy?",
        "and ?purchase?",
        "to occur with similar subjects and objects in a large corpus.",
        "This observation has led to ample work on developing both symmetric and directional similarity measures that attempt to capture semantic relations between lexical items by comparing their neighborhood context (Lin, 1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Kotlerman et al2010).",
        "A far less explored direction for learning verb entailment involves exploiting verb co-occurrence in a sentence or a document.",
        "One prominent work is Chklovsky and Pantel's VerbOcean (2004).",
        "In VerbOcean, the authors manually constructed 33 patterns and divided them into five pattern groups, where each group signals one of the following five semantic relations: similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement and happens-before.",
        "For example, the pattern ?Xed and later Yed?",
        "signals the happens-before relation between the verbs ?X?",
        "and ?Y?.",
        "Starting with candidate verb pairs based on a distributional similarity measure, the patterns are used to choose a semantic relation per verb pair based on the different patterns this pair instantiates.",
        "This method is more precise than distributional similarity approaches, but it is highly susceptible to sparseness issues, since verbs do not typically co-occur within rigid patterns.",
        "Utilizing verb co-occurrence at the document level, Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) estimate whether a pair of verbs is narratively related by counting the number of times the verbs share an argument in the same document.",
        "In a similar manner, Pekar (2008) detects entailment rules between templates from shared arguments within discourse-related clauses in the same document.",
        "Recently, supervised classification has become standard in performing various semantic tasks.",
        "Mirkin et al2006) introduced a system for learning entailment rules between nouns (e.g., ?novel?",
        "book?)",
        "that combines distributional similarity and Hearst patterns as features in a supervised classifier.",
        "Pennacchiotti and Pantel (2009) augment Mirkin et alfeatures with web-based features for the task of entity extraction.",
        "Hagiwara et al2009) perform synonym identification based on both distributional and contextual features.",

        "presupposes the verb ?play?).",
        "Last, Berant et al2012) utilized various distributional similarity features to identify entailment between lexical-syntactic predicates.",
        "In this paper, we follow the supervised approach for semantic relation detection in order to identify verb entailment.",
        "While we utilize and adapt useful features from prior work, we introduce a diverse set of novel features for the task, effectively combining verb co-occurrence information at the sentence, document, and corpus levels."

        "introduce linguistically motivated indicators that are specific to verbs and may signal the semantic relation between verb pairs.",
        "Then, in Section 4 we describe how these indicators are exactly encoded as features within a supervised classification framework.",
        "Verb co-occurrence When (non-auxiliary) verbs co-occur in a sentence, they are often the main verbs of different clauses.",
        "We thus aim to use information about the relation between clauses to learn about the relation between the clauses?",
        "main verbs.",
        "Discourse markers (Hobbs, 1979; Schiffrin, 1988) are lexical terms such as ?because?",
        "and ?however?",
        "that indicate a semantic relation between discourse fragments (i.e., propositions or speech acts).",
        "We suggest that these markers can indicate semantic relations between the main verbs of the connected clauses.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?He always snores while he sleeps?, the marker ?while?",

        "occurs while ?sleeping?",
        "(and so ?snore?",
        "sleep?).",
        "Often the relation between clauses is not expressed explicitly with an overt discourse marker, but is still implied by the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "For example, in dependency parsing the relation can be captured by labeled dependency edges expressing that one clause is an adverbial adjunct of the other, or that two clauses are coordinated.",
        "This can indicate the existence (or lack) of entailment between verbs.",
        "For instance, in the sentence ?When I walked into the room, he was working out?, the verb ?walk?",
        "is an adverbial adjunct of the verb ?work out?.",
        "Such co-occurrence structure does not indicate a deep semantic relation, such as entailment, between the two verbs.",
        "Verb classes Verb classes are sets of semantically-related verbs sharing some linguistic properties (Levin, 1993).",
        "One of the most general verb classes are stative vs. event verbs (Jackendoff, 1983).",
        "Sta-tive verb, such as ?love?",
        "and ?think?, usually describe a state that lasts some time.",
        "On the other hand, event verbs, such as ?run?",
        "and ?kiss?, describe an action.",
        "We hypothesize that verb classes are relevant for determining entailment, for example, that stative verbs are not likely to entail event verbs.",
        "Verb generality Verb-particle constructions are multi-word expressions consisting of a head verb and a particle, e.g., switch off (Baldwin and Villav-icencio, 2002).",
        "We conjecture that the more general a verb is, the more likely it is to appear with many different particles.",
        "Detecting verb generality can help us tackle an infamous property of distributional similarity methods, namely, the difficulty in detecting the direction of entailment (Berant et al. 2012).",
        "For example, the verb ?cover?",
        "appears with many different particles such as ?up?",
        "and ?for?, while the verb ?coat?",
        "does not.",
        "Thus, assuming we have evidence for an entailment relation between the two verbs, this indicator can help us discern the direction of entailment and determine that ?coat?",
        "cover?.",
        "Typed Distributional Similarity As discussed in section 2, distributional similarity is the most common source of information for learning semantic relations between verbs.",
        "Yet, we suggest that on top of standard distributional similarity measures, which take several verbal arguments into account (such as subject, object, etc.)",
        "simultaneously, we should also focus on each type of argument independently.",
        "In particular, we apply this approach to compute similarity between verbs based on the set of adverbs that modify them.",
        "Our hypothesis is that adverbs may contain relevant information for capturing the direction of entailment.",
        "If a verb appears with a small set of adverbs, it is more likely to be a specific verb that already conveys a specific action or state, making an additional adverb redundant.",
        "For example, the verb ?whisper?",
        "conveys a specific manner of talking and will probably not appear with the adverb ?loudly?, while the verb ?talk?",
        "is more likely to appear with such an adverb.",
        "Thus, measuring similarity based solely on adverb modifiers could reveal this phenomenon."

        "We next detail features that address co-occurrence of the target verb pair within a sentence.",

        "Discourse markers As discussed in Section 3, discourse markers may signal relations between the main verbs of adjacent clauses.",
        "The literature is abundant with taxonomies that classify markers to various discourse relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Hovy and Maier, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998).",

        "For a target verb pair (v1, v2) and each discourse relation r, we count the number of times that v1 is the main verb in the main clause, v2 is the main verb in the subordinate clause, and the clauses are connected via a marker mapped to r. For example, given the sentence ?You must enroll in the competition before you can participate in it?, the verb pair (?en-roll?,?participate?)",
        "appears in the ?Temporal?",
        "relation, indicated by the marker ?before?, where ?enroll?",

        "We term the features by the relevant discourse relation, e.g., ?v1-contrast-v2?",
        "refers to v1 being in the main clause and connected to the subordinate clause via a contrast marker.",
        "Dependency relations between clauses As noted in Section 3, the syntactic structure of verb co-occurrence can indicate the existence or lack of entailment.",
        "In dependency parsing this may be expressed via the label of the dependency relation connecting the main and subordinate clauses.",
        "In our experiments we used the ukWaC corpus1 (Baroni et al. 2009) which was parsed by the MALT parser (Nivre et al2006).",
        "Hence, we identified three MALT dependency relations that connect a main clause with its subordinate clause.",
        "The first relation is the object complement relation ?obj?.",
        "In this case the subordinate clause is an object complement of the main clause.",
        "For example, in ?it surprised me that the lizard could talk?",
        "the verb pair (?surprise?,?talk?)",
        "is connected by the ?obj?",
        "relation.",
        "The second relation is the adverbial adjunct relation ?adv?, in which the subordinate clause is adverbial and describes the time, place, manner, etc.",
        "of the main clause, e.g., ?he gave his consent without thinking about the repercussions?.",
        "The last relation is the coordination relation ?coord?, e.g., ?every night my dog Lucky sleeps on the bed and my cat Flippers naps in the bathtub?.",
        "Similar to discourse markers, we compute for each verb pair (v1,v2) and each dependency label d the proportion of times that v1 is the main verb of the main clause, v2 is the main verb of the subordinate clause, and the clauses are connected by dependency relation d, out of all the times they are connected by any dependency relation.",
        "We term the features by the dependency label, e.g., ?v1-adv-v2?",
        "refers to v1 being in the main clause and connected to the subor",
        "Pattern-based We follow Chklovski and Pantel (2004) and extract occurrences of VerbOcean patterns that are instantiated by the target verb pair.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, VerbOcean patterns were originally grouped into five semantic classes.",
        "Based on a preliminary study we conducted, we decided to utilize only four strength-class patterns as positive indicators for entailment, e.g., ?he scared and even startled me?, and three antonym-class patterns as negative indicators for entailment, e.g., ?you can either open or close the door?.",
        "We note that these patterns are also commonly used by RTE systems2.",
        "Since the corpus pattern counts were very sparse, we defined for a target verb pair (v1, v2) two binary features: the first denotes whether the verb pair instantiates at least one positive pattern, and the second denotes whether the verb pair instantiates at least one negative pattern.",
        "For example, given the aforementioned sentences, the value of the positive feature for the verb pair (?startle?,?scare?)",
        "is ?1?.",
        "Patterns are directional, and so the value of (?scare?,?startle?)",
        "is ?0?.",
        "Polarity We compute the proportion of times that the two verbs appear in different polarity.",
        "For example, in ?he didn't say why he left?, the verb ?say?",
        "appears in negative polarity and the verb ?leave?",
        "in positive polarity.",
        "Such change in polarity is usually an indicator of non-entailment between the two verbs.",
        "Tense ordering The temporal relation between verbs may provide information about their semantic relation.",
        "For each verb pair co-occurrence, we extract the verbs?",
        "tenses and order them as follows: past < present < future.",
        "We then add the features ?tense-v1<tense-v2?, ?tense-v1=tense-v2?, and ?tense-v1>tense-v2?, corresponding to the propor",
        "tion of times the tense of v1 is smaller, equal to, or bigger than the tense of v2.",
        "This indicates the prevalent temporal relation between the verbs in the corpus and may assist in detecting the direction of entailment.",
        "e.g., if tense-v1>tense-v2, the verb pair is less likely to entail.",
        "Co-reference Following Tremper (2010), in every co-occurrence of (v1,v2) we extract for each verb the set of arguments at either the subject or object positions, denoted A1 and A2 (for v1 and v2, respectively).",
        "We then compute the proportion of co-occurrences in which v1 and v2 share an argument, i.e., A1 ?",
        "A2 6= ?, out of all the co-occurrences in which bothA1 andA2 are non-empty.",
        "The intuition, which is similar to distributional similarity, is that semantically related verbs tend to share arguments.",
        "Syntactic and lexical distance Following Tremper (2010) again, we compute the average distance d in dependency edges between the co-occurring verbs.",
        "We compute three features corresponding to three bins indicating if d < 3, 3 ?",
        "d ?",
        "7, or d > 7.",
        "Similar features are computed for the distance in words (bins are 0 < d < 5, 5 ?",
        "d ?",
        "10, d > 10).",
        "This feature provides insight into the syntactic relatedness of the verbs.",

        "Higher pmi should hint at semantically related verbs.",
        "This group of features addresses co-occurrence of a target verb pair within the same document.",
        "These features are less sparse, but tend to capture coarser semantic relations between the target verbs.",
        "Narrative score Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) suggested a method for learning sequences of actions or events (expressed by verbs) in which a sin",
        "gle entity is involved.",
        "They proposed a pmi-like narrative score (see Eq.",
        "(1) in their paper) that estimates whether a pair consisting of a verb and one of its dependency relations (v1, r1) is narratively-related to another such pair (v2, r2).",
        "Their estimation is based on quantifying the likelihood that two verbs will share an argument that instantiates both the dependency position (v1, r1) and (v2, r2) within documents in which the two verbs co-occur.",

        "We compute for every target verb pair nine features using their narrative score.",
        "In four features, r1 = r2 and the common dependency is either a subject, an object, a preposition complement (e.g., ?we meet at the station.",
        "), or an adverb (termed chamb-subj, chamb-obj, and so on).",
        "In the next three features, r1 6= r2 and r1, r2 denote either a subject, object, or preposition complement3 (termed chamb-subj-obj and so on).",
        "Last, we add as features the average of the four features where r1 = r2 (termed chamb-same), and the average of the three features where r1 6= r2 (termed chamb-diff ).",
        "Document-level pmi Similar to sentence-level pmi, we compute the pmi between v1 and v2, but this time the co-occurrence scope is a document.",
        "The final group of features ignores sentence or document boundaries and is based on overall corpus statistics.",
        "Distributional similarity Following our hypothesis regarding typed distributional similarity (Section 3), we first compute for each verb and each argument (subject, object, preposition complement and adverb) a separate vector that counts the number of times each word in the corpus instantiates the argument of that verb.",
        "In addition, we also compute a vector that is the concatenation of the previous separate vectors, which captures the standard distributional similarity statistics.",

        "We term each feature by the method and argument, e.g., weeds-prep and lin-all represent the Weeds measure over prepositional complements and the Lin measure over all arguments.",

        "This baseline is inspired by Mirkin et al2006), who combined distributional similarity features and Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) for learning entailment between nouns.",
        "All: Our full-blown model, including all features described in Section 4.1.",
        "For all tested methods, we performed 10-fold cross validation and averaged Precision, Recall, Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and F1 over the 10 folds.",
        "Table 3 presents the results of our full-blown model as well as the baselines.",
        "First, we note that, as expected, the VerbOcean baselines VO-KB and VO-ukWaC provide low recall,",
        "subset of the feature groups.",
        "due to the sparseness of rigid pattern instantiation for verbs both in the ukWaC corpus and on the web.",
        "Yet, VerbOcean positive and negative patterns do add some discriminative power over only distributional similarity measures, as seen by the improvement of TDS+VO over TDS in all criteria.",
        "But, it is the combination of all types of information sources that yields the best performance.",
        "Our complete model, employing the full set of features, outperforms all other models in terms of both precision and recall.",
        "Its improvement in terms of F1 over the second best model (TDS+VO), which includes all distributional similarity features as well as pattern-based features, is by 24%.",
        "This result shows the benefits of integrating linguistically motivated co-occurrence features with traditional pattern-based and distributional similarity information.",
        "To further investigate the contribution of features at various co-occurrence levels, we trained and tested our model with all possible combinations of feature groups corresponding to a certain co-occurrence scope (sentence, document and corpus).",
        "Table 4 presents the results of these tests.",
        "The most notable result of this analysis is that sentence-level features play an important role within our model.",

        "Yet, removing the sentence-level features (Doc+Corpus-level), ends in a more substantial decline of 8.5% in F1.",
        "In addition, sentence-level features alone (Sent-level) provide the best discriminative power for verb entailment, compared to document and corpus levels, which include distributional similarity features.",
        "Yet, we note that sentence-level features alone do not capture all the information within our model, and they should be combined with one of the other feature groups to reach performance close to the complete model.",
        "This shows again the importance of combining co-occurrence indicators at different levels.",
        "As an additional insight from Table 4, we point out that document-level features are not good entailment indicators by themselves (Doc-level in Table 4), and they perform worse than the distributional similarity baseline (TDS at Table 3).",
        "Still, they do complement each of the other feature groups.",
        "In particular, since the Sent+Doc-level model performs almost as good as the full model, this subset may be a good substitute to the full model, since its features are easier to extract from large corpora, as they may be extracted in an on-line fashion, processing one document at a time (contrary to corpus-level features).",
        "As a final analysis, we randomly sampled correct entailment rules learned by our model but missed by the typed distributional similarity classifier (TDS).",
        "Our overall impression is that employing co-occurrence information helps to better capture entailment relations other than synonymy and troponymy.",
