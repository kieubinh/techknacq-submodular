        "We assume that each string was derived from at most one parent, but may give rise to any number of children.",
        "The difficulty is that most or all of these parent-child relationships are unobserved.",
        "We must reconstruct this evolutionary phylogeny.",
        "At the same time, we must fit the parameters of a model of the relevant linguistic process p(y |x), which says what sort of children y might plausibly be derived from parent x.",

        "Some of these names can refer to the same person; we hope to detect this.",
