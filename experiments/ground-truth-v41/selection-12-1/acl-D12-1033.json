        "Using the AMI corpus which contains transcriptions of focus group meetings with precise word durations, we show that word durations correlate with syntactic surprisal estimated from the incremental Roark parser over and above simpler measures, such as word duration estimated from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system and word frequencies, and that the syntactic surprisal estimates are better predictors of word durations than a simpler version of surprisal based on trigram probabilities.",

        "This paper sets out to test whether UID holds across different linguistic levels, i.e. whether speakers adapt word duration during production to syntactic surprisal, such that words with higher surprisal have longer durations than words with lower surprisal.",

        "Using linear mixed-effects modeling, we found that syntactic surprisal as calculated from a top-down incremental PCFG parser accounts for a significant amount of variation in spoken word duration, using an HMM-trained text-to-speech system as a baseline.",
        "The findings of this paper provide additional support the uniform information density hypothesis and furthermore have implications for the design of text-to-speech systems, which currently do not take into account higher-level linguistic information such as syntactic surprisal (or even word frequencies) for their word duration models."

        "N-gram estimates We estimated 3-gram, 4-gram and 5-gram models on the AMI corpus (9-fold",

        "We found that coefficient estimates and significance levels of the resulting models were comparable.",

        "N-gram model surprisal estimated on newspaper texts from PTB or Gigaword were statistically significant positive predictors of spoken word durations beyond simple word frequencies (but PTB ngram surprisal did not improve fit over models containing Gigaword frequency estimates).",
        "Counter-intuitively however, ngram models estimated based on the AMI corpus have a small negative coefficient in models that already include word frequency as a predictor ?",
        "residuals of an AMI-estimated ngram model with respect to word frequency are very noisy and do not show a clear correlation anymore with word durations.",
        "Surprisal Surprisal effects were found to have a robust significant positive coefficient, meaning that words with higher surprisal are spoken more slowly / clearly than expected when taking into account only canonical word duration and word frequency.",
        "Surprisal achieves a better model fit than any of the n-gram models, based on a comparsion of AICs, and Surprisal significantly improved model fit over a model including frequencies and ngram models based on AMI and Gigaword.",

        "In order to make really sure that the observed surprisal effect has indeed to do with syntax and can not be explained away as a frequency effect, we also calculated frequency estimates for the corpus based on the Penn Treebank.",

        "It is difficult from these regression models to intuitively grasp the size of the effect of a particular predictor on reading times, since one would have to know the exact range and distribution of each predictor.",
        "To provide some intuition, we calculate the estimated effect size of Roark surprisal on speech durations.",
        "Per Roark surprisal ?unit?, the model estimates a 7 msec difference5.",

        "which in one instance in the AMI corpus was estimated with a surprisal of 2.179 and in another instance as 16.277, the estimated difference in duration between these instances would thus be 104msec, which is certainly an audible difference.",
        "(Full range for Roark surprisal: 174msec, whereas full range for gigaword 4gram surprisal is 35 msec.)",
        "When analysing the surprisal effect in more detail, we find that both the syntactic component of surprisal and its lexical component are significant positive predictors of word durations, as well as the interaction between them, which has a negative slope.",

        "The detailed model is shown in Table 5.",
        "To summarize, the positive coefficient of surprisal means that words which carry a lot of information from a structural point of view are spoken more slowly than words that carry less such information.",
        "These results thus provide good evidence for our hypothesis that the predictability of syntactic structure affects phonetic realization and that speakers use speech rate to achieve more uniform information density.",
        "Native vs. non-native speakers Finally, we also compared effects in our native vs. non-native speaker populations, see Table 6.",
        "Both populations show the same effects and tell the same story (note that significance values can't be compared as the sample sizes are different).",
        "It might be possible to interpret the findings in the sense that native speakers are more proficient at adapting their speech rate to (syntactic) complexity to achieve more uniform information density, given the slightly higher coefficient and significance for Surprisal for native speakers.",
        "Since the effects are statistically significant for both groups, we don't want to make too strong claims about differences between the groups."

        "We have shown evidence in this work that syntactic surprisal effects in transcribed speech data can be detected through word utterance duration in both native and non-native speech, and we did so using a meeting corpus not specifically designed to isolate these effects.",
        "This result is the potential foundation for futher work in applied, experimental, and",
        "speakers.",
        "Surprisal value is for model with residuals of other predictors as dependent variable.",
        "theoretical psycholinguistics.",
        "It provides additional direct support for approaches based on the UID hypothesis.",
        "From an applied perspective, the fact that frequency and syntactic surprisal have a significant effect beyond what a HMM-trained TTS model would predict for individual words is a case for further research into incorporating syntactic models into speech production systems.",
        "Our methodology immediately provides a framework for estimating the word-by-word effect on duration for increased naturalness in TTS output.",
        "This is relevant to spoken dialogue systems because it appears that synthesized speech requires a greater level of attention from the dialogue system users when compared to the same words delivered in natural speech (Delogu et al1998).",
        "Some of this effect may be attributable to peaks in information density which are caused by current generation systems not compensating for areas of high information density through speech rate, lexical and structural choice.",
        "Furthermore, syntax and semantics have been observed to interact with the mode of speech delivery.",
        "Eye-tracking experiments by Swift et al2002) showed that there was a synthetic vs. natural speech difference in the time required to pay attention to an object referred to using definite articles, but not indefinite articles.",
        "Our result points a way towards a direction for explaining of this phenomenon by demonstrating that the differences between current-technology artificial speech and natural speech can be partially explained through higher-level syntactic features.",
        "However, further experimentation is required on other measures of syntactic complexity (e.g. DLT, Gibson (2000)) as well as other levels of representation such as the semantic level.",
        "From a theoretical and neuroanatomical perspective, the finding that a measure of syntactic ambiguity reduction has an effect on the phonological layer of production has additional implications for the organization of the human language production system."
