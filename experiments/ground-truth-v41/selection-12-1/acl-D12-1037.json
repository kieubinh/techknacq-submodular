        "are source and target sentences, respectively.",
        "h is a feature vector which is scaled by a weight W .",
        "Parameter estimation is one of the most important components in SMT, and various training methods have been proposed to tune W .",
        "Some methods are based on likelihood (Och and Ney, 2002; Blunsom et al2008), error rate (Och, 2003; Zhao and Chen, 2009; Pauls et al2009; Galley and Quirk, 2011), margin (Watanabe et al2007; Chiang et al2008) and ranking (Hopkins and May, 2011), and among which minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) is the most popular one.",
        "All these training methods follow the same pipeline: they train only a single weight on a given development set, and then use it to translate all the sentences in a test set.",
        "We call them a global training method.",
        "One of its advantages is that it allows us to train a single weight offline and thereby it is efficient.",
        "However, due to the diversity and uneven distribution of source sentences(Li et al2010), there are some shortcomings in this pipeline.",
        "Firstly, on the document level, the performance of these methods is dependent on the choice of a development set, which may potentially lead to an unstable translation performance for testing.",
        "As referred in our experiment, the BLEU points on NIST08 are",
        "linearly separable classification problem transformed from (a) via tuning as ranking (Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "Since score of e11 is greater than that of e12, ?1, 0?",
        "corresponds to a possitive example denoted as ??",
        "?, and ?",
        "?1, 0?",
        "corresponds to a negative example denoted as ?*?.",
        "Since the transformed classification problem is not linearly separable, there does not exist a single weight which can obtain e11 and e21 as translation results meanwhile.",
        "However, one can obtain e11 and e21 with weights: ?1, 1?",
        "and ?",
        "?1, 1?, respectively.",
        "19.04 when the Moses system is tuned on NIST02 by MERT.",
        "However, its performance is improved to 21.28 points when tuned on NIST06.",
        "The automatic selection of a development set may partially address the problem.",
        "However it is inefficient since tuning requires iteratively decoding an entire development set, which is impractical for an online service.",
        "Secondly, translation becomes inconsistent on the sentence level (Ma et al2011).",
        "Global training method such as MERT tries to optimize the weight towards the best performance for the whole set, and it can not necessarily always obtain good translation for every sentence in the development set.",
        "The reason is that different sentences may need different optimal weights, and MERT can not find a single weight to satisfy all of the sentences.",
        "Figure 1(a) shows such an example, in which a development set contains two sentences f1 and f2 with translations e and feature vectors h. When we tune examples in Figure 1(a) by MERT, it can be regarded as a non-linearly separable classification problem illustrated in Figure 1(b).",
        "Therefore, there exists no single weightW which simultaneously obtains e11 and e21 as translation for f1 and f2 via Equation (1).",
        "However, we can achieve this with two weights: ?1, 1?",
        "for f1 and ?",
        "?1, 1?",
        "for f2.",
        "In this paper, inspired by KNN-SVM (Zhang et al., 2006), we propose a local training method, which trains sentence-wise weights instead of a single weight, to address the above two problems.",
        "Compared with global training methods, such as MERT, in which training and testing are separated, our method works in an online fashion, in which training is performed during testing.",
        "This online fashion has an advantage in that it can adapt the weights for each of the test sentences, by dynamically tuning the weights on translation examples which are similar to these test sentences.",
        "Similar to the method of development set automatical selection, the local training method may also suffer the problem of efficiency.",
        "To put it into practice, we propose incremental training methods which avoid retraining and iterative decoding on a development set.",
        "Our local training method has two advantages: firstly, it significantly outperforms MERT, especially when test set is different from the development set; secondly, it improves the translation consistency.",
        "Experiments on NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that our local training method significantly gains over MERT, with the maximum improvements up to 2.0 BLEU, and its efficiency is comparable to that of the global training method."

        "All the methods mentioned above train a single weight for the whole development set, whereas our local training method learns a weight for each sentence.",
        "Further, our translation framework integrates the training and testing into one unit, instead of treating them separately.",
        "One of the advantages is that it can adapt the weights for each of the test sentences.",
        "Our method resorts to some translation examples, which is similar as example-based translation or translation memory (Watanabe and Sumita, 2003; He et al2010; Ma et al2011).",
        "Instead of using translation examples to construct translation rules for enlarging the decoding space, we employed them to discriminatively learn local weights.",
        "Similar to (Hildebrand et al2005; Lu?",
        "et al 2007), our method also employes IR methods to retrieve examples for a given test set.",
        "Their methods utilize the retrieved examples to acquire translation model and can be seen as the adaptation of translation model.",
        "However, ours uses the retrieved examples to tune the weights and thus can be considered as the adaptation of tuning.",
        "Furthermore, since ours does not change the translation model which needs to run GIZA++ and it incrementally trains local weights, our method can be applied for online translation service."

        "This paper proposes a novel local training framework for SMT.",
        "It has two characteristics, which are different from global training methods such as MERT.",
        "First, instead of training only one weight for document level, it trains a single weight for sentence level.",
        "Second, instead of considering the training and testing as two separate units, we unify the training and testing into one unit, which can employ the information of test sentences and perform sentence-wise local adaptation of weights.",
        "Local training can not only alleviate the problem of the development data selection, but also reduce the risk of sentence-wise bad translation results, thus consistently improve the translation performance.",
        "Experiments show gains up to 2.0 BLEU points compared with a MERT baseline.",
        "With the help of incremental training methods, the time incurred by local training was negligible and the local training and testing totally took 2.9 seconds for each sentence.",
        "In the future work, we will further investigate the local training method, since there are more room for improvements as observed in our experiments.",
        "We will test our method on other translation models and larger training data6."
