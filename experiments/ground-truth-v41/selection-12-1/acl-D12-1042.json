        "era, when petabytes of natural-language text containing thousands of different structure types are readily available.",
        "However, traditional supervised methods are unlikely to scale in this context, as training data is either limited or nonexistent for most of these structures.",
        "One of the most promising approaches to IE that addresses this limitation is distant supervision, which generates training data automatically by aligning a",

        "Figure 1 shows a simple example for a RE domain with two labels.",
        "Distant supervision introduces two modeling challenges, which we highlight in the table.",
        "The first challenge is that some training examples obtained through this heuristic are not valid, e.g., the last sentence in Figure 1 is not a correct example for any of the known labels for the tuple.",
        "The percentage of such false positives can be quite high.",
        "For example, Riedel et al2010) report up to 31% of false positives in a corpus that matches Freebase relations with New York Times articles.",
        "The second challenge is that the same pair of entities may have multiple labels and it is unclear which label is instantiated by any textual mention of the given tuple.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the tuple (Barack Obama, United States) has two valid labels: BornIn and EmployedBy, each (latently) instantiated in different sentences.",
        "In the",
        "ing.",
        "To contrast, in traditional supervised learning there is one instance and one label per object.",
        "For relation extraction the object is a tuple of two named entities.",
        "Each mention of this tuple in text generates a different instance.",
        "Riedel corpus, 7.5% of the entity tuples in the training partition have more than one label.",
        "We summarize this multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning problem in Figure 2.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel graphical model, which we called MIML-RE, that targets MIML learning for relation extraction.",
        "Our work makes the following contributions: (a) To our knowledge, MIML-RE is the first RE approach that jointly models both multiple instances (by modeling the latent labels assigned to instances) and multiple labels (by providing a simple method to capture dependencies between labels).",

        "Since then, the approach grew in popularity (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al2009; Riedel et al. 2010; Hoffmann et al2011; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011; Sun et al2011; Surdeanu et al2011a).",
        "However, most of these approaches make one or more approximations in learning.",
        "For example, most proposals heuristically transform distant supervision to traditional supervised learning (i.e., single-instance single-label) (Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al2009; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011; Sun et al2011; Surdeanu et al2011a).",
        "Bunescu and Mooney (2007) and Riedel et al2010) model distant supervision for relation extraction as a multi-instance single-label problem, which allows multiple mentions for the same tuple but disallows more than one label per object.",
        "Our work is closest to Hoffmann et al2011).",
        "They address the same problem we do (binary relation extraction) with a MIML model, but they make two approximations.",
        "First, they use a deterministic model that aggregates latent instance labels into a set of labels for the corresponding tuple by OR-ing the classification results.",
        "We use instead an object-level classifier that is trained jointly with the classifier that assigns latent labels to instances and can capture dependencies between labels.",
        "Second, they use a Perceptron-style additive parameter update approach, whereas we train in a Bayesian framework.",
        "We show in Section 5 that these approximations generally have a negative impact on performance.",
        "MIML learning has been used in fields other than natural language processing.",
        "For example, Zhou and Zhang (2007) use MIML for scene classification.",
        "In this problem, each image may be assigned multiple labels corresponding to the different scenes captured.",
        "Furthermore, each image contains a set of patches, which forms the bag of instances assigned to the given object (image).",
        "Zhou and Zhang propose two algorithms that reduce the MIML problem to a more traditional supervised learning task.",
        "In one algorithm, for example, they convert the task to a multi-instance single-label problem by creating a separate bag for each label.",
        "Due to this, the proposed approach cannot model inter-label dependencies.",
        "Moreover, the authors make a series of approximations, e.g., they assume that each instance in a bag shares the bag's overall label.",
        "We instead model all these issues explicitly in our approach.",
        "In general, our approach belongs to the category of models that learn in the presence of incomplete or incorrect labels.",
        "There has been interest among machine learning researchers in the general problem of noisy data, especially in the area of instance-based learning.",
        "Brodley and Friedl (1999) summarize past approaches and present a simple, all-purpose method to filter out incorrect data before training.",

        "On the Riedel dataset we evaluate all models using standard precision and recall measures.",
        "For the KBP evaluation we used the official KBP scorer,10 with two changes: (a) we score with the parameter anydoc set to true, which configures the scorer to accept relation mentions as correct regardless of their supporting document; and (b) we score only on the subset of gold relations that have at least one mention in our sentences.",
        "The first decision is necessary because the gold KBP answers contain supporting documents only from the corpus provided by the organizers but we retrieve candidate answers from multiple collections.",
        "The second is required because the focus of this work is not on sentence retrieval but on RE, which should be evaluated in isolation.11 Similarly to previous work, we report precision/recall curves in Figure 4.",

        "While we use equation (6) to generate y?i , we found that the corresponding probabilities are too coarse to provide a good ranking score.",

        "Figure 4 indicates that MIML-RE generally outperforms the current state of the art.",
        "In the Riedel dataset, MIML-RE has higher overall recall than the Riedel et alodel, and, for the same recall point, MIML-RE's precision is between 2 and 15 points higher.",
        "For most of the curve, our model obtains better precision for the same recall point than the Hoffmann model, which currently has the best reported results on this dataset.",
        "The difference is as high as 5 precision points around the middle of the curve.",
        "The Hoffmann model performs better close to the extremities of the curve (low/high recall).",
        "Nevertheless, we argue that our model is more stable than Hoffmann?s: MIML-RE yields a smoother precision/recall curve, without most of the depressions seen in the Hoffmann results.",
        "In the KBP dataset, MIML-RE performs consistently better than our implementation of Hoffmann's model, with higher precision values for the same recall point, and much higher overall recall.",
        "We believe that these differences are caused by our Bayesian framework,",
        "sistent improvement over Mintz++ (with the exception of a few points in the low-recall portion of the KBP curves).",
        "The difference in precision for the same recall point is as high as 25 precision points in the Riedel dataset and up to 5 points in KBP.",
        "Overall, the best F1 score of MIML-RE is slightly over 1 point higher than the best F1 score of Mintz++ in the Riedel dataset and 3 points higher in KBP.",
        "Considering that Mintz++ is a strong baseline and we evaluate on two challenging domains, we consider these results proof that the correct modeling of the MIML scenario is beneficial.",
        "Lastly, Figure 4 shows that MIML-RE outperforms its variant without label-dependency features (MIML-RE At-Least-One) in the higher-recall part of the curve in the Riedel dataset.",
        "The improvement is approximately 1 F1 point throughout the last segment of the curve.",
        "The overall increase in F1 was found to be significant (p = 0.0296) in a one-sided, paired t-test over randomly sampled test data.",
        "We see a smaller improvement in KBP (concentrated around the middle of the curve), likely because the number of entity tuples with multiple labels in training is small (see Table 1).",

        "In a similar vein, we tested the models previously described on a subset of the Riedel evaluation dataset that only includes groups with at least 10 mentions.",
        "This corpus contains approximately 2% of the groups from the original testing partition, out of which 90 tuples have at least one known label and 1410 groups serve as negative examples.",
        "For conciseness, we do not include the entire precision/recall curves for this experiment, but summarize them in Table 2, which lists the performance peak (highest F1 score) for each of the models investigated.",
        "The table shows that MIML-RE obtains the highest F1 score overall, 1.5 points higher than MIML-RE At-Least-One and 2.6 points higher than Mintz++.",
        "More importantly, for approximately the same recall point, MIML-RE obtains a precision that is over 8 percentage points higher than that of MIML-RE At-Least-One.",
        "A post-hoc inspection of the results indicates that, indeed, MIML-RE successfully eliminates undesired labels when two (or more) incompatible labels are jointly assigned to the same tuple.",
        "Take for example the tuple (Mexico City, Mexico), for which the correct relation is /location/administrative division/country.",
        "MIML-RE At-Least-One incorrectly predicts the additional /location/location/contains relation, while MIML-RE does not make this prediction because it recognizes that these two labels are incompatible in general: one location cannot both be within another location and contain it.",
        "Indeed, examining the weights assigned to label-dependency features in MIML-RE, we see that the model has assigned a large negative weight to the dependency feature between /location/location/contains and /location/administrative division/country for the /location/location/contains class.",
        "We also observe positive dependencies between labels.",
        "For example, MIML-RE learns that the relations /people/person/place lived and /people/person/place of birth tend to co-occur and assigns a positive weight to this dependency feature for the corresponding classes.",
        "These results strongly suggest that when all aspects of the MIML scenario are present, our model can successfully capture them and make use of the additional structure to improve performance."

        "In this paper we showed that distant supervision for RE, which generates training data by aligning a database of facts with text, poses a distinct multi-instance multi-label learning scenario.",
        "In this setting, each entity pair to be modeled typically has multiple instances in the text and may have multiple labels in the database.",
        "This is considerably different from traditional supervised learning, where each instance has a single, explicit label.",
        "We argued that this MIML scenario should be formally addressed.",
        "We proposed, to our knowledge, the first approach that models all aspects of the MIML setting, i.e., the latent assignment of labels to instances and dependencies between labels assigned to the same entity pair.",
        "We evaluated our model on two challenging domains and obtained state-of-the-art results on both.",
        "Our model performs well even when not all aspects of the MIML scenario are common, and as seen in the discussion, shows significant improvement when evaluated on entity pairs with many labels or mentions.",
