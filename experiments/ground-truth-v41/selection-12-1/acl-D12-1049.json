        "Topic models can be improved by better modelling the semantic aspects of text, for instance integrating collocations into the model (Johnson, 2010; Hardisty et al2010) or encouraging topics to be more semantically coherent (Newman et al., 2011) based on lexical coherence models (Newman et al2010), modelling the structural aspects of documents, for instance modelling a document as a set of segments (Du et al2010; Wang et al. 2011; Chen et al2009), or improving the underlying statistical methods (Teh et al2006; Wallach et al2009).",
        "Topic models, like statistical parsing methods, are using more sophisticated latent variable methods in order to model different aspects of these problems.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in developing a new topic model which can take into account the structural topic dependency by following the higher level document subject structure, but we hope to retain the general flavour of topic models, where components (e.g., sentences) can be a mixture of topics.",
        "Thus we need to depart from the earlier HMM style models, see, e.g., (Blei and Moreno, 2001; Gruber et al2007).",
        "Inspired by the idea that documents usually exhibits internal structure (e.g., (Wang et al. 2011)), in which semantically related units are clustered together to form semantically structural segments, we treat documents as sequences of segments (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters).",
        "In this way, we can model the topic correlation be",

        "assumption, and reveal how topics evolve among segments.",
        "Indeed, we were impressed by the improvement in perplexity obtained by the segmented topic model (STM) (Du et al2010), so we considered the problem of whether one can add sequence information into a structured topic model as well.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the type of structural information being considered, where the vectors are some representation of the content.",

        "There are two possible hybrids, one called ?mixed?",
        "has distinct breaks in the sequence, while the other called ?both?",
        "overlays both sequence and hierarchy and there could be relative strengths associated with the arrows.",

        "Research in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing has attempted to model various topical dependencies.",
        "Some work considers structure within the sentence level by mixing hidden Markov models (HMMs) and topics on a word by word basis: the aspect HMM (Blei and Moreno, 2001) and the HMM-LDA model (Griffiths et al. 2005) that models both short-range syntactic dependencies and longer semantic dependencies.",
        "These models operate at a finer level than we are considering at a segment (like paragraph or section) level.",
        "To make a tool like the HMM work at higher levels, one needs to make stronger assumptions, for instance assigning each sentence a single topic and then topic specific word models can be used: the hidden topic Markov model (Gruber et al2007) that models the transitional topic structure; a global model based on the generalised Mallows model (Chen et al2009), and a HMM based content model (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).",
        "Researchers have also considered time-series of topics: various kinds of dynamic topic models, following early work of (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), represent a collection as a sequence of sub-collections in epochs.",
