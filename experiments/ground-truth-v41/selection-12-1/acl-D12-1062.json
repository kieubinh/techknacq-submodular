        "Inferring temporal relations amongst a collection of events in a text is a significant step towards various important tasks such as automatic information extraction and document comprehension.",
        "Over the past few years, with the development of the Time-Bank corpus (Pustejovsky et al. 2003) , there have been several works on building automatic systems for such a task (Mani et al. 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Yoshikawa et al. 2009; Denis and Muller, 2011).",
        "Most previous works devoted much efforts to the task of identifying relative temporal relations (such as before, or overlap) amongst events (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Denis and Muller, 2011), without addressing the task of identifying correct associations between events and their absolute time of occurrence.",
        "The e?s, t's and I's are events, time points and time intervals, respectively.",
        "Even if this issue is addressed, certain restrictions are often imposed for efficiency reasons (Yoshikawa et al. 2009; Verhagen et al. 2010).",
        "In practice, however, being able to automatically infer the correct time of occurrence associated with each event is crucial.",
        "Such information not only leads to better text comprehension, but also enables fusion of event structures extracted from multiple articles or domains.",
        "In this work, we are specifically interested in mapping events into an universal timeline representation.",
        "Besides inferring the relative temporal relations amongst the events, we would also like to automatically infer a specific absolute time of occurrence for each event mentioned in the text.",
        "Unlike previous work, we associate each event with a specific absolute time interval inferred from the text.",
        "An example timeline representation is illustrated in Fig. 1.",
        "Further details of our timeline representation are given in Sec. 2.3.",
        "We perform global inference by combining a collection of local pairwise classifiers through the use of an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that promotes global coherence among local decisions.",
        "The formulation allows our model to predict both event-event relations and event-time interval associations simultaneously.",
        "We show that, with the use of time intervals instead of time points, our approach leads to a more concise ILP formulation with reduced number of variables and constraints.",
        "Moreover, we observed that event coreference can reveal important information for such a task.",
        "We propose that different event mentions that refer to the same event can be grouped together before classification and performing global inference.",
        "This can reduce the amount of efforts in both classification and inference stages and can potentially eliminate mistakes that would be made otherwise without such coreference information.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our proposal of leveraging event coreference to support event timeline construction is novel.",
        "Our experiments on a collection of annotated news articles from the standard ACE dataset demonstrate that our approach produces robust timelines of events.",
        "We show that our algorithmic approach is able to combine various local evidences to produce a global coherent temporal structure, with improved overall performance.",
        "Furthermore, the experiments show that the overall performance can be further improved by exploiting knowledge from event coreference."
