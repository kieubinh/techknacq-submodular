        "The increasing availability of large document collections has the potential to revolutionize our ability to understand the world.",
        "However, the scale and complexity of such collections frequently make it difficult to quickly grasp the important details and the relationships between them.",
        "As a result, automatic interfaces for data navigation, exploration, aggregation, and analysis are becoming increasingly valuable.",
        "In this work we propose a novel approach: threading structured document collections.",
        "Consider a large graph, with documents as nodes and edges indicating relationships, as in Figure 1.",
        "Our goal is to find a diverse set of paths (or threads) through the collection that are individually coherent and together cover the most salient parts.",
        "For example, given a collection of academic papers, we might want to identify the most significant lines of research, threading the citation graph to produce chains of important papers.",
        "Or, given news articles connected chronologically, we might want to extract threads of articles to form timelines describing the major events from the most significant news stories.",
        "Top-tier news organizations like The New York Times and The Guardian regularly publish such timelines, but have so far been limited to creating them by hand.",
        "Other possibile applications might include discovering trends on social media sites, or perhaps mining blog entries for important conversations through trackback links.",
        "We show how these kinds of threading tasks can be done efficiently, providing a simple, practical tool for representing graph-based data that offers new possibilities compared with existing models.",
        "The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) program (Wayne, 2000) has recently led to some research in this direction.",
        "Several of TDT's core tasks, like link detection, topic detection, and topic tracking, can be seen as subroutines for the threading problem.",
        "Our work, however, addresses these tasks jointly, using a global probabilistic model with a tractable inference algorithm.",
        "To achieve this, we employ structured determinantal point processes (SDPPs) (Kulesza",
        "measures of importance and relatedness to weight nodes (documents) and build edges (relationships).",
        "Then, from this graph, we extract a diverse, salient set of threads to represent the collection.",
        "The supplement contains a version of this figure for our real-world news dataset.",
        "and Taskar, 2010), which offer a natural probabilistic model over sets of structures (such as threads) where diversity is desired, and we incorporate k-DPP extensions to control the number of threads (Kulesza and Taskar, 2011).",
        "We apply our model to two real-world datasets, extracting threads of research papers and timelines of news articles.",
        "An example of news threads extracted using our model is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Quantitative evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms multiple baselines, including dynamic topic models, in comparisons with human-produced news summaries.",
        "It also outperforms baseline methods in a user evaluation of thread coherence, and runs 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model.",
        "The primary contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing a novel framework for finding diverse and salient sets of document threads; (2) combining SDPPs and k-DPPs to implement the proposed model; (3) introducing random projections to improve efficiency with only bounded deviation; and (4) demonstrating the model on large-scale, real-world datasets."

        "The k-SDPP produces more consistent threads due to its use of graph information, while the DTM threads, though topic-focused, are less coherent as a story.",
