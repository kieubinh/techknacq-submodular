        "In the past decade, several coreference resolution systems have been proposed, e.g., (Ng and Cardie, 2002), (Denis and Baldridge, 2007) and (Stoyanov et al2010).",

        "to use the labeled documents from a domain to predict on the unlabeled ?The work is done during postdoc in NTU, Singapore.",

        "However, in practice, there is usually limited labeled data in a specific domain of interest, while there may be plenty of labeled data in other related domains.",
        "Effective use of data from the other domains for predicting in the domain of interest is therefore an important strategy in NLP.",
        "This is called domain adaptation, and, in this context, the former domains is called the source domains, while the latter domain is called the target domain (Blitzer et al2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "Based on the type of the knowledge to be transferred to the target domain, domain adaptation learning can be categorized as instance-based method, feature-based method, parameter-based method or relational-knowledge-based method (Pan and Yang, 2010).",
        "Previously, domain adaptation learning has been successfully used in other NLP tasks such as relation extraction (Jiang, 2009) and POS tagging (Jiang and Zhai, 2007), semantic detection (Tan et al., 2008), name entity recognition (Guo et al2009) and entity type classification (Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, it has yet to be explored for coreference resolution.",
        "In this paper, we propose an adaptive ensemble method to adapt coreference resolution across domains.",
        "This proposed method can be categorized as both feature-based and parameter-based domain adaptation learning methods.",
        "It has three main steps: ensemble creation, cross-domain knowledge learning and decision inference.",
        "The first step creates the ensemble by collecting a set of base models, which can be any individual methods with various features/instances/parameters settings.",
        "The second step analyzes the collected base models from vari",
        "ous domains and learns the cross-domain knowledge between each target domain and the source domain.",
        "The third step infers the final decision in the target domain based on all ensemble results.",
        "In addition to domain adaptation, the proposed adaptive ensemble method has the following features that are absent in the other ensemble methods.",
        "First, it can optimize any user-specified objective measure without using a separate development set.",
        "Second, it can provide document-specific prediction instead of relying on a fixed base model or a fixed set of base models for all documents.",
        "Third, it can automatically adjust the active ensemble members in decision inference so that underperforming base models are filtered out.",
        "The proposed method can also be used in the traditional within-domain problem with some simplifications.",
        "We conduct experiments for coreference resolution under both the within-domain setting and the domain-adaptation setting.",
        "In the within-domain setting, we compare the proposed adaptive ensemble method with the mention-pair methods and other ensemble methods on the MUC-6 and ACE 2005 corpora.",
        "The results show that the proposed adaptive ensemble method consistently outperforms these baselines.",
