        "Many NLP tasks are inherently tied to syntax, and state-of-the-art solutions to these tasks often rely on syntactic annotations as either a source for useful features (Zhang et al2006, path features in relation extraction) or as a scaffolding upon which a more narrow, specialized classification can occur (as often done in semantic role labeling).",
        "This decoupling of the end task from its intermediate representation is sometimes known as the two-stage approach (Chang et al2010) and comes with several drawbacks.",
        "Most notably this decomposition prohibits the learning method from utilizing the labels from the end task when predicting the intermediate representation, a structure which must have some correlation to the end task to provide any benefit.",
        "Relying on intermediate representations that are specifically syntactic in nature introduces its own unique set of problems.",
        "Large amounts of syntactically annotated data is difficult to obtain, costly to produce, and often tied to a particular domain that may vary greatly from that of the desired end task.",
        "Additionally, current systems often utilize only a small amount of the annotation for any particular task.",
        "For instance, performing named entity recognition (NER) jointly with constituent parsing has been shown to improve performance on both tasks, but the only aspect of the syntax which is leveraged by the NER component is the location of noun phrases (Finkel and Manning, 2009).",
        "By instead discovering a latent representation jointly with the end task we address all of these concerns, alleviating the need for any syntactic annotations, while simultaneously attempting to learn a latent syntax relevant to both the particular domain and structure of the end task.",
        "We phrase the joint model as factor graph and marginalize over the hidden structure of the intermediate representation at both training and test time, to optimize performance on the end task.",

        "We apply this strategy to two common NLP tasks, coupling a model for the end task prediction with latent and general syntactic representations via specialized logical factors which learn associations between latent and observed structure.",
        "In comparisons with identical models which observe ?gold?",
        "syntactic annotations, derived from off-the-shelf parsers or provided with the corpora, we find that our hidden marginalization method is comparable in both tasks and almost every language tested, sometimes significantly outperforming models which observe the true syntax.",

        "LCLR aims to provide a flexible latent structure for increasing the representational power of the model in a useful way, and is demonstrated on tasks and domains where data availability is not a key concern.",
        "In contrast, while our hidden structure models may outperform their observed syntax counterparts, our focus is as much on alleviating the burden of procuring large amounts of syntactic annotation as it is about increasing the expressiveness of the model.",
        "To that end we constrain a more sophisticated latent representation and couple it to highly structured output predictions, opposed to binary classification problems.",
        "In methodology, we perform the more computationally intensive marginalization operation instead of maximizing.",
        "Marginalization of hidden structure is also fundamental to other work, and featured most prominently in generative Bayesian latent variable models (Teh et al2006).",
        "Our approach is trained discrimina-tively, affording the use of very rich feature sets and the prediction of partial structures without needing to specify a full derivation.",
        "Similar approaches have been used in more linear latent variable CRF-based models (McCallum et al2005), but these must only marginalize only over hidden states of a much more compact representation.",
        "Naively extending this to tree-based constraints would often be computationally inefficient, and we avoid intractability through the encapsulation of much of the dynamic programming machinery into specialized factors.",
        "Moreover, using loopy belief propagation means that the inference method is not closely coupled to the task structure, and need not change when applying this method to other types of graphs."

        "We have presented a novel method of coupling syntactically-oriented NLP tasks to combinatorially-constrained hidden syntactic representations, and have shown that marginalizing over this latent representation not only provides significant improvements over syntactically-uninformed baselines, but occasionally improves performance when compared to systems which observe syntax.",
        "On the task of relation extraction we find that a constituency representation provides the most improvement over the baseline, while in the SRL domain our model is extremely competitive with the best reported results on Chinese, and outperforms the model using the provided parses on German and Japanese.",
        "We believe this method delivers very promising results in our presented tasks, opening the door to new lines of research examining what types of constraints and what configurations of hidden structure are most beneficial for particular tasks and languages.",
        "Moreover, we present one type of coordinating factor, as both D-CONNECT and C-CONNECT logically express a soft NAND function, but more sophisticated coupling schemes are another natural direction to pursue.",
        "Finally, we use sum-product variant of belief propagation inference, but more specialized inference schemes may show additional benefits."
