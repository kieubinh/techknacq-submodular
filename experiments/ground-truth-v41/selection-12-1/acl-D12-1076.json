        "This can alleviate the lack of clues where discriminative features can be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus level importance into account, not just relying on the current local context.",

        "Resolving ambiguity associated with person names found on the Web is a key challenge in many Internet applications, such as information retrieval, question answering, open information extraction, automatic knowledge acquisition(Wu and Weld, 2008) and so on.",
        "For example, if you want to know more about a guy named George Foster and feed Yahoo!",
        "with his name, the results are not satisfactory where you get more than 40 different persons named George Foster scattering in the top 100 returned pages.",
        "None of the dominant search engines currently helps users group those returned pages into clusters according to whether they refer to the same person.",
        "Users thus have to either read those pages carefully or adjust their queries by adding extra modifiers.",
        "This motivates an intensive study in automatically resolving person name ambiguity in various web applications.",
        "However, resolving web person name ambiguity is not a trivial task.",
        "Due to the difficulties in figuring out or predicting the number of namesakes in the returned pages, the task has been investigated in an unsupervised learning fashion in the literature, which is apparently different from the traditional word sense disambiguation or entity linking/disambiguation tasks, where the inventories of candidate word senses or entities are usually known given the target word or entity mention.",
        "A general framework for this task can be formulated as first extracting various features from the web pages, and then grouping these pages into several clusters each of which is assumed to represent one specific person.",
        "Despite of the inevitably noisy nature of web data, a key challenge is how to handle the data sparsity problem which we mean as: mismatch of vocabulary and lack of clues.",
        "The former refers to the case that two web pages may describe the same person but use different words thus the word overlap between them are small.",
        "Various features, including entities, biographical information, URL, etc., have been introduced to bridge the gap(Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Kalashnikov et al2008a; Ikeda et al2009; Jiang et al2009),",
        "and external knowledge resources are also employed to capture the semantic relationship between enti-ties(Han and Zhao, 2009, 2010).",
        "However, a more challenging scenario is that there are few clues available in the web pages.",
        "For example, there is a page mentioning a nutritionist Emily Bender in WePS2 dataset(Javier et al2009).",
        "Throughout the whole page we can find only one word, nutrition, related to her identification, while other pages about the nutritionist in the dataset contain substantial materials about her profession and job.",
        "In this case, current efforts, focusing on either feature engineering or background knowledge, are incapable to exploiting these limited clues from the current page to the whole Emily Bender document set, where nutrition, as an important feature for recognizing a nutritionist, should be paid more attention.",
        "As far as we know, there is less work focusing on exploring person specific information to relieve the lack of clues problem.",
        "Traditional vector space model (VSM) is most widely used to accommodate various features, but it ignores any relations between them(Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Ikeda et al2009).",
        "Beyond bag-of-features, two kinds of features are explored, co-occurrences of entities and Wikipedia based semantic relationship between entities, both of which provide a reasonable relatedness for entity pairs.",
        "More recent works adopt one of these relationships(Jiang et al2009; Kalashnikov et al. 2008a; Han and Zhao, 2009).",
        "Han and Zhao try to model both aspects, but their co-occurrence estimation, estimated from held-out resources, fails to capture the person specific importance for a feature, which is crucial to enhance limited clues in a corpus level, e.g., the significance of nutrition for Emily Bender in WePS1 dataset.",
        "In this paper, we explore different usages of features and propose an approach which mines cross document information to capture the person specific importance for a feature.",
        "Specifically, we construct a semantic graph from Wikipedia concepts appearing in all documents that contain the target name (which we refer to name observation set), then group them into several topics and further weight each feature by considering both the relatedness of the feature to its corresponding topic and the importance of this topic in the current name observation set.",
        "By incorporating both the Wikipedia and topic information into our person name similarity, our model exploits both Wikipedia based background knowledge and person specific importance.",
        "We argue that the corpus level importance provides more stable evidences for discriminative features in various scenarios, especially the tough case.",
        "We compared our model with the state of the arts on three WePS datasets (from the First and Second Web People Search Clustering Task), and our experiments show that our model consistently outperforms other competitive models on all three datasets.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first review related work, and in Section 3, show how we exploit the person specific importance in our disambiguation model.",
        "Experiment results are discussed in Section 4.",

        "Most approaches discussed above explore various features in the current page or rely on external knowledge resources to bridge the vocabulary gap, but pay less attention to the lack of clues since they ignore the person specific evidence in the current corpus level.",
        "Our model focuses on solving the data sparsity problem by utilizing other web pages in the same name observation set to provide a robust but person specific weighting for discriminative features beyond the current document alone.",
        "In terms of extra resources, the Wikipedia based model (WS) by Han and Zhao (2009) is close to our model.",
        "The WS model uses Wikipedia to capture the relationship between entities in the local context to bridge the vocabulary gap, but it is incapable to evaluate the importance of a feature with regarding to the target name, hence is unable to make use of limited clues in the current web page.",

        "By introducing the corpus level topic weighting scheme, our model improves in average 1.6% consistently over all datasets.",
        "Recall that our topic weightings are obtained over the whole name observation set beyond local context, this improvement indicates that this corpus level person specific evidences render the person similarity more reasonably than that of single document.",
        "On the other hand, by pruning the semantic graph, our model improves averagely 1.3% over TM-nCP.",
        "This",
        "shows that our co-occurrence based pruning strategy can help render the semantic graph with less noisy edges, thus generate more reasonable topics.",
        "Generally, our proposed model works best consistently over all three datasets.",

        "We also performed significance testing on F-measures: the differences between our model and other models are significant.",
        "We notice there are many noisy or short web pages which lead to inaccurate concept extraction, but this cross document evidences, to some extent, can remedy this.",

        "while the rest, excluding WS and SSR, failed.",
        "Surprisingly, SSR combines both kinds of relations and implicit structural knowledge, but performs in the same bulk with VSM in WePS1 training set.",
        "We think the reason may be that some name observation sets are too small to estimate non-concept relatedness via random walk.",
        "In WePS1 training set, many names in this dataset contains several namesakes, each of which corresponds to a few web pages.",
        "In this case, our corpus level weighting scheme and WS show no advantage over GRAPE which considers word co-occurrences solely.",
        "From the results, we can also find that there is no clear winner between GRAPE and WS.",
        "The former does not use Wikipedia relatedness but only includes local relationship, and performs even slightly better than WS in WePS2, which indicates that non-Wikipedia concepts are important disambiguation features as well."

        "In this paper, we explore the feature space in the web person name disambiguation task and propose a topic-based model which exploits corpus level person specific evidences to handle the data sparsity challenges, especially the case that limited evidences can be collected from the local context.",
        "In particular, we harvest topics from wikipedia concepts appearing in the name observation set, and weight a concept based on both the relatedness of the concept to its corresponding topic and the importance of this topic in the current name observation set, so that some discriminative but sparse features can obtain more reliable weights.",
        "Experimental results show that our weighting strategy does its job and the proposed model outperforms the-state-of-the-art systems.",
        "Our current work utilizes the topic information shared in one name observation set but is incapable to handle sparse name set, which needs more accurate relation extraction inside the name observations.",
        "Jointly modeling entity linking and person (entity) disambiguation tasks will be an interesting direction where the two tasks are closely related and usually need to be considered at the same time.",
        "Investigating the person name disambiguation task in different web applications will also be of great importance, e.g., disambiguating a name in streaming data or during knowledge base construction.",
        "In addition, graphical model, which has been studied in academic author disambiguation, may be a good choice to cope with the noises and non-standard forms in web data."
