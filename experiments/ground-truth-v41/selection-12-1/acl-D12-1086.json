        "Thus identifying the best set of features and best learning algorithms for syntactic category acquisition is still an open problem.",
        "Relationships between linguistic units can be classified into two types: syntagmatic (concerning positioning), and paradigmatic (concerning substitution).",

        "The dimensions of a substitute vector represent words in the vocabulary, and the magnitudes represent the probability of occurrence in the given position.",
        "Note that the substitute vector for a word position (e.g. the second word in Fig. 1) is a function of the context only (i.e. ?the cried?",

        "Our preliminary experiments indicated that using context information alone without the identity or the features of the target word (e.g. using dimensionality reduction and clustering on substitute vectors) has limited success and modeling the co-occurrence of word and context types is essential for inducing syntactic categories.",
        "In the models presented in this paper, we combine paradigmatic representations of word context with features of co-occurring words within the co-occurrence data embedding (CODE) framework (Globerson et al. 2007; Maron et al. 2010).",
        "The resulting embeddings for word types are split into 45 clusters using k-means and the clusters are compared to the 45 gold tags in the 1M word Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al. 1999).",

        "One problem with such a model is its tendency to distribute probabilities equally and the resulting inability to model highly skewed word-tag distributions observed in hand-labeled data (Johnson, 2007).",
        "To favor sparse word-tag distributions one can enforce a strict one-tag-per-word solution (Brown et al. 1992; Clark, 2003), use sparse pri-ors in a Bayesian setting (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007), or use posterior regularization (Ganchev et al. 2010).",
        "Each of these techniques provide significant improvements over the standard HMM model: for example Gao and Johnson (2008) show that sparse priors can gain from 4% (.62 to .66 with a 1M word corpus) in cross-validated many-to-one accuracy.",
        "However Christodoulopoulos et al. (2010) show that the older one-tag-per-word models such as (Brown et al. 1992) outperform the more sophisticated sparse prior and posterior regularization methods both in speed and accuracy (the Brown model gets .68 many-to-one accuracy with a 1M word corpus).",
        "Given that close to 95% of the word occurrences in human labeled data are tagged with their most frequent part of speech (Lee et al. 2010), this is probably not surprising; one-tag-per-word is a fairly good first approximation for induction."
