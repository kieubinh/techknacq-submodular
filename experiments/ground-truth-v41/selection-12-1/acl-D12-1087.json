        "Topic models learn bags of related words from large corpora without any supervision.",
        "Based on the words used within a document, they mine topic level relations by assuming that a single document covers a small set of concise topics.",
        "Once learned, these topics often correlate well with human concepts.",
        "For example, one model might produce topics that cover ideas such as government affairs, sports, and movies.",
        "With these unsupervised methods, we can extract useful semantic information in a variety of tasks that depend on identifying unique topics or concepts, such as distributional semantics (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010), word sense induction (Van de Cruys and Apidianaki, 2011; Brody and Lapata, 2009), and information retrieval (Andrzejewski and Buttler, 2011).",
        "When using a topic model, we are primarily concerned with the degree to which the learned topics match human judgments and help us differentiate between ideas.",
        "But until recently, the evaluation of these models has been ad hoc and application specific.",
        "Evaluations have ranged from fully automated intrinsic evaluations to manually crafted extrinsic evaluations.",
        "Previous extrinsic evaluations have used the learned topics to compactly represent a small fixed vocabulary and compared this distributional space to human judgments of similarity (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010).",
        "But these evaluations are hand constructed and often costly to perform for domain-specific topics.",
        "Conversely, intrinsic measures have evaluated the amount of information encoded by the topics, where perplexity is one common example(Wallach et al. 2009), however, Chang et al(2009) found that these intrinsic measures do not always correlate with semantically interpretable topics.",
        "Furthermore, few evaluations have used the same metrics to compare distinct approaches such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al. 2003), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dutnais, 1997), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 2000).",
        "This has made it difficult to know which method is most useful for a given application, or in terms of extracting useful topics.",
        "We now provide a comprehensive and automated evaluation of these three distinct models (LDA, LSA, NMF), for automatically learning semantic topics.",
        "While these models have seen significant improvements, they still represent the core differences between each approach to modeling topics.",
        "For our evaluation, we use two recent automated coherence measures (Mimno et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2010)",
        "originally designed for LDA that bridge the gap between comparisons to human judgments and intrinsic measures such as perplexity.",

        "Our comparison between topic coherence scores and feature importance in classification revealed that relatively high quality topics, but not the most coherent topics, drive most of the classification decisions, and most topics do not affect the accuracy.",
        "Overall, we see that each topic model paradigm has it's own strengths and weaknesses.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis with Singular Value Decomposition fails to form individual topics that aggregate similar words, but it does remarkably well when considering all the learned topics as similar words develop a similar topic representation.",
