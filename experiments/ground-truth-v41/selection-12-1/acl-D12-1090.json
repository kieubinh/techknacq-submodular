        "Research in automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics has been a key driving force behind the recent advances of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems.",
        "The early seminal work on automatic MT metrics (e.g., BLEU and NIST) is largely based on n-gram matches (Papineni et al. 2002; Doddington, 2002).",
        "Despite their simplicity, these measures have shown good correlation with human judgments, and enabled large-scale evaluations across many different MT systems, without incurring the huge labor cost of human evaluation (Callison-Burch et al(2009; 2010; 2011), inter alia).",
        "Recent studies have also confirmed that tuning MT systems against better MT metrics ?",
        "using algorithms like MERT (Och, 2003) ?",
        "leads to better system performance (He and Way, 2009; Liu et al. 2011).",
        "Later metrics that move beyond n-grams achieve higher accuracy and improved robustness from resources like WordNet synonyms (Miller et al. 1990), and paraphrasing (Snover et al. 2009; Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).",
        "But a common problem in these metrics is they typically resort to ad-hoc tuning methods instead of principled approaches to incorporate linguistic features.",
        "Recent models use linear or SVM regression and train them against human judgments to automatic learn feature weights, and have shown state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b; Sun et al. 2008; Padó et al. 2009).",
        "The drawback, however, is they rely on time-consuming preprocessing modules to extract linguistic features (e.g., a full end-to-end textual entailment system was needed in Padó et al.",
        "(2009)), which severely limits their practical use.",
        "Furthermore, these models employ a large number of features (on the order of hundreds), and consequently make the model predictions opaque and hard to analyze.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful probabilistic Finite State Machine (pFSM) for the task of MT evaluation.",
        "It is built on the backbone of weighted edit distance models, but learns to weight edit operations in a probabilistic regression framework.",
        "One of the major contributions of this paper is a novel extension of the pFSM model into a probabilistic Pushdown Automaton (pPDA), which enhances traditional edit-distance models with the ability to model phrase shift and word swapping.",
        "Furthermore, we give a new log-linear parameterization to the pFSM model, which allows it to easily incor",
        "porate rich linguistic features.",
        "We experiment with a set of simple features based on labeled head-modifier dependency structure, in order to test the hypothesis that modeling overall sentence structure can lead to more accurate evaluation measures.",
