      "text": [
        "In the field of translation studies, it is undisputed that discourse-wide context must be considered carefully for good translation results (Hatim and Mason, 1990).",
        "By contrast, the state of the art in statistical machine translation (SMT), despite significant advances in the last twenty years, still assumes that texts can be translated sentence by sentence under strict independence assumptions, even though it is well known that certain linguistic phenomena such as pronominal anaphora cannot be translated correctly without referring to extra-sentential context.",
        "This is true both for the phrase-based and the syntax-based approach to SMT.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we shall concentrate on phrase-based SMT.",
        "One reason why it is difficult to experiment with document-wide models for phrase-based SMT is that the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm which has been used almost exclusively for decoding SMT models in the recent literature has very strong assumptions of locality built into it.",
        "DP beam search for phrase-based SMT was described by Koehn et al(2003), extending earlier work on word-based SMT (Tillmann et al. 1997; Och et al. 2001; Tillmann and Ney, 2003).",
        "This algorithm constructs output sentences by starting with an empty hypothesis and adding output words at the end until translations for all source words have been generated.",
        "The core models of phrase-based SMT, in particular the n-gram language model (LM), only depend on a constant number of output words to the left of the word being generated.",
        "This fact is exploited by the search algorithm with a DP technique called hypothesis recombination (Och et al. 2001), which permits the elimination of hypotheses from the search space if they coincide in a certain number of final words with a better hypothesis and no future expansion can possibly invert the relative ranking of the two hypotheses under the given models.",
        "Hypothesis recombination achieves a substantial reduction of the search space without affecting search optimality and makes it possible to use aggressive pruning techniques for fast search while still obtaining good results.",
        "The downside of this otherwise excellent approach is that it only works well with models that have a local dependency structure similar to that of an n-gram language model, so they only depend on a small context window for each target word.",
        "Sentence-local models with longer dependencies can be added, but doing so greatly increases the risk for search errors by inhibiting hypothesis recombination.",
        "Cross-sentence dependencies cannot be directly integrated into DP SMT decoding in",
        "any obvious way, especially if joint optimisation of a number of interdependent decisions over an entire document is required.",
        "Research into models with a more varied, non-local dependency structure is to some extent stifled by the difficulty of decoding such models effectively, as can be seen by the problems some researchers encountered when they attempted to solve discourse-level problems.",
        "Consider, for instance, the work on cache-based language models by Tiedemann (2010) and Gong et al(2011), where error propagation was a serious issue, or the works on pronominal anaphora by Le Nagard and Koehn (2010), who implemented cross-sentence dependencies with an ad-hoc two-pass decoding strategy, and Hardmeier and Federico (2010) with the use of an external decoder driver to manage backward-only dependencies between sentences.",
        "In this paper, we present a method for decoding complete documents in phrase-based SMT.",
        "Our decoder uses a local search approach whose state consists of a complete translation of an entire document at any time.",
        "The initial state is improved by the application of a series of operations using a hill climbing strategy to find a (local) maximum of the score function.",
        "This setup gives us complete freedom to define scoring functions over the entire document.",
        "Moreover, by optionally initialising the state with the output of a traditional DP decoder, we can ensure that the final hypothesis is no worse than what would have been found by DP search alone.",
        "We start by describing the decoding algorithm and the state operations used by our decoder, then we present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its usability with a document-level semantic language model, and finally we discuss some related work."

        "A notable difference between this algorithm and other hill climbing algorithms that have been used for SMT decoding (Germann et al. 2004; Langlais et al. 2007) is its non-determinism.",
        "Previous work for sentence-level decoding employed a steepest ascent strategy which amounts to enumerating the complete neighbourhood of the current state as defined by the state operations and selecting the next state to be the best state found in the neighbourhood of the current one.",
        "Enumerating all neighbours of a given state, costly as it is, has the advantage that it makes it easy to prove local optimality of a state by recognising that all possible successor states have lower scores.",
        "It can be rather inefficient, since at every step only one modification will be adopted; many of the modifications that are discarded will very likely be generated anew in the next iteration.",
        "As we extend the decoder to the document level, the size of the neighbourhood that would have to be explored in this way increases considerably.",
        "Moreover, the inefficiency of the steepest ascent approach potentially increases as well.",

        "tence, even though this is not guaranteed to be true in the presence of cross-sentence models.",
        "We therefore adopt a first-choice hill climbing strategy that non-deterministically generates successor states and accepts the first one that meets the acceptance criterion.",
        "This frees us from the necessity of generating the full set of successors for each state.",
        "On the downside, if the full successor set is not known, it is no longer possible to prove local optimality of a state, so we are forced to use a different condition for halting the search.",

        "Thus, the framework makes it possible to exploit decomposability for efficient scoring without imposing any particular decomposition on the features as beam search does.",
        "To make scoring even more efficient, scores are computed in two passes: First, every feature function is asked to provide an upper bound on the score that will be obtained for the new state.",
        "In some cases, it is possible to calculate reasonable upper bounds much more efficiently than computing the exact feature value.",
        "If the upper bound fails to meet the acceptance criterion, the new state is discarded right away; if not, the full score is computed and the acceptance criterion is tested again.",

        "This two-pass scoring approach allows us",
        "to avoid LM lookups altogether for states that will be rejected anyhow because of low scores from the other models, e. g. because the distortion limit is violated.",

        "Obviously, more exact search comes at a cost, and in this case, it comes at a considerable cost, which is an explosion of the time required to decode the test set from 4 minutes at rejection limit 103 to 224 minutes at rejection limit 105 and 38 hours 45 minutes at limit 107.",

        "In SMT, it has mostly been used for domain adaptation (Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Tam et al. 2007), or to measure sentence similarities (Banchs and Costa-jussa`, 2011).",
        "The model we use is inspired by Bellegarda (2000).",
        "It is a Markov model, similar to a standard n-gram model, and assigns to each content word a score given a history of n preceding content words, where n = 30 below.",

        "The score is defined based on the cosine similarity between the word vector of the predicted word and the mean word vector of the words in the history, which is converted to a probability by histogram lookup as suggested by Bellegarda (2000).",
        "The model is structurally different from a regular n-gram model in that word vector n-grams are defined over content words occurring in the word vector model only and can cross sentence boundaries.",
        "Stop words, identified by an extensive stop word list and amounting to around 60 % of the tokens, are scored by a different mechanism based on their relative frequency (undis-counted unigram probability) in the training corpus.",

        "A marginal increase in scores for all three test sets demonstrates that the hill climbing decoder manages to fix some of the search errors made by the DP search.",

        "We note that the NIST score turned out to react more sensitively to improvements due to the semantic LM in all our experiments, which is reasonable because the model specifically targets content words, which benefit from the information weighting done by the NIST score.",
        "While the results we present do not constitute compelling evidence in favour of our semantic LM in its current form, they do suggest that this model could be improved to realise higher gains from cross-sentence semantic information.",

        "Even though DP beam search (Koehn et al. 2003) has been the dominant approach to SMT decoding in recent years, methods based on local search have been explored at various times.",
        "For word-based SMT, greedy hill-climbing techniques were advocated as a faster replacement for beam search (Germann et al. 2001; Germann, 2003; Germann et al. 2004), and a problem formulation specifically targeting word reordering with an efficient word reordering algorithm has been proposed (Eisner and Tromble, 2006).",
        "A local search decoder has been advanced as a faster alternative to beam search also for phrase-based SMT (Langlais et al. 2007; Langlais et al. 2008).",
        "That work anticipates many of the features found in our decoder, including the use of local search to refine an initial hypothesis produced by DP beam search.",
        "The possibility of using models that do not fit well into the beam search paradigm is mentioned and illustrated with the example of a reversed n-gram language model, which the authors claim would be difficult to implement in a beam search decoder.",
        "Similarly to the work by Germann et al(2001), their decoder is deterministic and explores the entire neighbourhood of a state in order to identify the most promising step.",
        "Our main contribution with respect to the work by Langlais et al. (2007) is the introduction of the possibility of handling document-level models by lifting the assumption of sentence independence.",
        "As a consequence, enumerating the entire neighbourhood becomes too expensive, which is why we resort to a ?first-choice?",
        "strategy that non-deterministically generates states and accepts the first one encountered that meets the acceptance criterion.",
        "More recently, Gibbs sampling was proposed as a way to generate samples from the posterior distribution of a phrase-based SMT decoder (Arun et al. 2009; Arun et al. 2010), a process that resembles local search in its use of a set of state-modifying operators to generate a sequence of decoder states.",
        "Where local search seeks for the best state attainable from a given initial state, Gibbs sampling produces a representative sample from the posterior.",
        "Like all work on SMT decoding that we know of, the Gibbs sampler presented by Arun et al(2010) assumes independence of sentences and considers the complete neighbourhood of each state before taking a sample."

      "text": [
        "In the last twenty years of SMT research, there has been a strong assumption that sentences in a text",
        "are independent of one another, and discourse context has been largely neglected.",
        "Several factors have contributed to this.",
        "Developing good discourse-level models is difficult, and considering the modest translation quality that has long been achieved by SMT, there have been more pressing problems to solve and lower hanging fruit to pick.",
        "However, we argue that the popular DP beam search algorithm, which delivers excellent decoding performance, but imposes a particular kind of local dependency structure on the feature models, has also had its share in driving researchers away from discourse-level problems.",
        "In this paper, we have presented a decoding procedure for phrase-based SMT that makes it possible to define feature models with cross-sentence dependencies.",
        "Our algorithm can be combined with DP beam search to leverage the quality of the traditional approach with increased flexibility for models at the discourse level.",
        "We have presented preliminary results on a cross-sentence semantic language model addressing the problem of lexical cohesion to demonstrate that this kind of models is worth exploring further.",
        "Besides lexical cohesion, cross-sentence models are relevant for other linguistic phenomena such as pronominal anaphora or verb tense selection.",
        "We believe that SMT research has reached a point of maturity where discourse phenomena should not be ignored any longer, and we consider our decoder to be a step towards this goal."
