        "More recently, Spitkovsky et al(2010) and Poon and Domingos (2011) observed that the use of Viterbi EM (also called hard EM) in place of standard EM can lead to significantly improved results in unsupervised learning of probabilistic grammars from natural language and image data respectively, even if no prior information is used.",
        "This finding is surprising because Viterbi EM is a degenerate case of standard EM and is therefore generally considered to be less effective in locating the optimum of the objective function.",

        "Against this background, we propose the use of a novel type of prior information for unsupervised learning of probabilistic natural language grammars, namely the syntactic unambiguity of natural language.",
        "Although it is often possible to correctly parse a natural language sentence in more than one way, natural language is remarkably unambiguous in the sense that the number of plausible parses of a natural language sentence is rather small in comparison with the total number of possible parses.",

        "The fact that Viterbi EM is a special case of our approach also gives an explanation of the advantage of Viterbi EM observed in previous work: it is because Viterbi EM implicitly utilizes unambiguity regularization.",

        "It should be noted that our approach is closely related to the deterministic annealing (DA) technique studied in the optimization literature (Rose, 1998).",
        "However, DA has a very different motivation than ours and differs from our approach in a few important algorithmic details, as will be discussed in section 5.",
        "When applied to unsupervised grammar learning, DA has been shown to lead to worse parsing accuracy than standard EM (Smith and Eis-ner, 2004); in contrast, we show that our approach leads to significantly higher parsing accuracy than standard EM in unsupervised dependency grammar learning.",

        "To highlight the unambiguity of natural language grammars, here we compare the parse probabilities shown in Figure 1 with the parse probabilities produced by two other probabilistic context-free grammars.",
        "In figure 2(a) we show the probabilities of the 100 best parses of the example sentence produced by a random grammar.",
        "The random grammar has a similar number of nonterminals as in the Berkeley parser, and its grammar rule probabilities are sampled from a uniform distribution and then normalized.",
        "It can be seen that unlike the natural language grammar, the random grammar produces a very uniform probability distribution over parses.",

        "An exponential decrease can be observed in the probabilities, but the probability mass is still much less concentrated than in the case of the natural language grammar.",
        "Again, we confirmed this observation by repeating the experiments on many other natural language sentences.",

        "In contrast, the goal of unambiguity regularization is to bias learning in favor of unambiguous grammars, which is achieved by setting the exponent in the E-step (i.e., 11??",
        "in Eq.1) to a value larger than 1, so that the distribution of the hidden variables becomes less uniform (i.e., parses become less ambiguous); in our annealing approach, the exponent is initialized to a very large value (positive infinity in our experiment) to push the learner away from the ambiguous initial grammar, and then gradually decreased to 1 to avoid inducing excessive unambiguity in the learned grammar.",

        "However, entropy regularization is either motivated by the theoretical result that unlabeled data samples are informative when classes are well separated (Grandvalet and Bengio, 2005), or derived from the expected conditional log-likelihood (Smith and Eisner, 2007).",
        "In contrast, our approach is motivated by the observed unambiguity of natural language grammars.",
