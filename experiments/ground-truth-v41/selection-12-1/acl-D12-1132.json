        "The formulation of the concept of words has baffled linguists from ancient to modern times (Hock-ett, 1969).",
        "Things are even worse for Chinese, partly due to the fact that its written form does not delimit words explicitly.",
        "While we have no doubt that there are linguistic units which are definitely words (or phrases, for that matter), it's a sad truth that in many cases we cannot manage to draw such a clear boundary between morphology and syntax, for which we now give two arguments.",
        "The first argument is that many sub-word linguistic units (such as suffixes and prefixes) are so productive that they can lead to a huge number of out-of-vocabulary words for natural language processing systems.",
        "This phenomenon brings us into an awkward situation if we adhere to a rigid separation of morphology and syntax.",
        "Consider character ?",
        "?someone?",
        "as an example.",
        "On the one hand, there is strong evidence that it's not a word as it can never be used alone.",
        "On the other hand, taking it as a mere suffix leads to many out-of-vocabulary words because of the productivity of such characters.",
        "For instance, Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB6) contains ???",
        "?one that fails?",
        "as a word but not ???",
        "?one that succeeds?, even with the word ??",
        "?succeed?",
        "appearing 207 times.",
        "We call words like ?",
        "??",
        "?one that succeeds?",
        "pseudo OOVs.",
        "By definition, pseudo OOVs are OOVs since they do not occur in the training corpus, though their components are frequently-seen words.",
        "Our estimation is that over 60% of OOVs in Chinese are of this kind (Section 2).",
        "Of course, the way out of this dilemma is to parse the internal structures of these words.",
        "That is to say, we can still regard characters like ?",
        "as suffixes, taking into account the fact that they cannot be used alone.",
        "Meanwhile, pseudo OOVs can be largely eliminated through analyzing their structures, thus greatly facilitating syntactic and semantic analysis of sentences.",
        "In fact, previous studies have revealed other good reasons for parsing internal structures of words (Zhao, 2009; Li, 2011).",
        "The second argument is that in Chinese many linguistic units can form both words and phrases with exactly the same meaning and part-of-speech, which",

        "Take character?",
        "?law?",

        "These annotations are incompatible since in both cases the character ?",
        "?law?",
        "bears exactly the same meaning and usage (e.g. part-of-speech).",
        "We examined several widely used corpora and found that about 90% of affixes were annotated incompatibly (Section 2).",
        "Incompatibility can be avoided through parsing structures of both words and phrases.",

        "appears twice in phrases but 377 times in words (e.g.",
        "???",
        "?accelerator?).",
        "Word structures in Chinese can be excellent guide for parsing phrase structures, and vice versa, due to their similarity.",
        "The present paper makes two contributions in light of these issues.",
        "Firstly, in order to get rid of pseudo OOVs and incompatible annotations, we have annotated structures of words in CTB6, after which statistical models can learn structures of words as well as phrases from the augmented treebank (Section 4).",
        "Although previous authors have noticed the importance of word-structure parsing (Li, 2011; Zhao, 2009), no detailed description about annotation of word structures has been provided in the literature.",
        "Secondly, we designed a unified dependency parser whose input is unsegmented sentences and its output incorporates both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm (Section 5).",
        "By removing the intermediate step of word segmentation, our unified parser no longer depends on the unsound notion that there is a clear boundary between words and phrases.",
        "Evaluation (Section 6) shows that our unified parser achieves satisfactory accuracies in parsing both morphological and syntactic structures."

        "Researchers have noticed the necessity of parsing the internal structures of words in Chinese.",
        "Li (2011) gave an method that could take raw sentences as input and output phrase structures and internal structures of words.",
        "This paper assumes that the input are unsegmented, too, and our output also in",
        "two key differences, though.",
        "The first is we output dependency relations instead of constituent structures.",
        "Although dependencies can be extracted from the constituent trees of Li (2011), the time complexity of their algorithm is O(n5) while our parser runs in linear time.",
        "Secondly, we specify the details of annotating structures of words, with the annotations being made publicly available.",
        "Zhao (2009) presented a dependency parser which regards each Chinese character as a word and then analyzes the dependency relations between characters, using ordinary dependency parsing algorithms.",
        "Our parser is different in two important ways.",
        "The first is we output both part-of-speech tags and labeled dependency relations, both of which were absent in Zhao's parser.",
        "More importantly, the APPEND transition for handling flat words were unseen in previous studies as far as we know.",
        "The difference can best be described with an example: For the sentence in Section 3, Zhao's parser output the result in Figure 4 while in contrast our output is Figure 2.",
        "In recent years, considerable efforts have been made in joint modeling and learning in natural language processing (Lee et al. 2011; Sun, 2011; Li et al., 2011; Finkel and Manning, 2009; Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Jiang et al. 2008; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008).",
        "Joint modeling can improve the performance of NLP systems due to the obvious reason of being able to make use of various levels of information simultaneously.",
        "However, the thesis of this paper, i.e, unified parsing of Chinese word and phrase structures, bears a deeper meaning.",
        "As demonstrated in Section 1 and by Li (2011), structures of words and phrases usually have significant similarity, and the distinction between them is very difficult to define, even for expert linguists.",
        "But for real world applications, such subtle matters can safely be ignored if we could analyzed morphological and syntactic structures in a unified framework.",
        "What applications really cares is structures instead of whether a linguistic unit is a word or phrase.",
        "Another notable line of research closely related to the present work is to annotate and parse the flat structures of noun phrases (NP) (Vadas and Curran, 2007; Vadas and Curran, 2011).",
        "This paper differs from those previous work on parsing NPs in at least two significant ways.",
        "First, we aim to parse all kinds of words (e.g, nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives etc) whose structures are not annotated by CTB, and whose presence could cause lots of pseudo OOVs and incompatible annotations.",
        "Second, the problem we are trying to solve is a crucial observation specific to Chinese language, that is, in lots of cases forcing a separation of words and phrases leads to awkward situations for NLP systems.",
        "Remember that in Section 2 we demonstrated that all corpora we examined had the problem of pseudo OOVs and incompatible annotations.",
        "In comparison, the problem Vadas and Curran (2007) tried to solve is a lack of annotation for structures of NPs in currently available treebanks, or to put it in another way, a problem more closely related to treebanks rather than certain languages."

        "Chinese word segmentation is an indispensable step for traditional approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese.",
        "The purpose of word segmentation is to decide what goes to words, with the remaining processing (e.g, parsing) left to higher level structures of phrases and sentences.",
        "This paper shows that it could be very difficult to make such a distinction between words and phrases.",
        "This difficulty cannot be left unheeded, as we have shown quantitatively that in practice it causes lots of real troubles such as too many OOVs and incompatible annotations.",
        "We showed how these undesirable consequences can be resolved by annotation of the internal structures of words, and by unified parsing of morphological and syntactic structures in Chinese.",
        "Unified parsing of morphological and syntactic structures of Chinese can also be implemented with a pipelined approach, in which we first segment input sentences into words or affixes (i.e, with the finest possible granularity), and then we do part-of-speech tagging followed by dependency (or constituent) parsing.",
        "However, a unified parsing approach using a single model as presented in this paper offers several advantages over pipelined approaches.",
        "The first one is that joint modeling tends to result in higher accuracy and suffer less from error propagation than do pipelined methods.",
        "Secondly, both the unified model and the algorithm are conceptually much more simpler than pipelined approaches.",
        "We only need one implementation of the model and algorithm, instead of several ones in pipelined approaches.",
        "Thirdly, our model and algorithm might comes closer to modeling the process of human language understanding, because human brain is more likely a parallel machine in understanding languages than an alternative pipelined processor.",
        "Hence this work, together with previous studies by other authors like Li (2011) and Zhao (2009), open up a possibly new direction for future research efforts in parsing the Chinese language."
