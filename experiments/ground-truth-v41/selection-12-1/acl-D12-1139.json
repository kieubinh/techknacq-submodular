        "Much of the writing styles recognized in rhetorical and composition theories involve deep syntactic elements in style (e.g., Bain (1887), Kemper (1987) Strunk and White (2008)).",
        "However, previous research for automatic authorship attribution and computational stylometric analysis have relied mostly on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g., Mendenhall (1887), Mosteller and Wallace (1984), Stamatatos et al(2001), Baayen et al(2002), Koppel and Schler (2003), Zhao and Zobel (2007), Luyckx and Daelemans (2008)).",
        "Some very recent works have shown that PCFG models can detect distributional difference in sentence structure in gender attribution (Sarawgi et al. 2011), authorship attribution (Raghavan et al. 2010), and native language identification (Wong and Dras, 2011).",
        "However, still very little has been understood exactly what constitutes salient stylistic elements in sentence structures that characterize each author.",
        "Although the work of Wong and Dras (2011) has extracted production rules with highest information gain, their analysis stops short of providing insight any deeper than what simple n-gram-level analysis could also provide.1 One might even wonder whether PCFG models are hinging mostly on leaf production rules, and whether there are indeed deep syntactic differences at all.",
        "This paper attempts to answer these questions.",
        "As an example of syntactic stylistic elements that have been much discussed in rhetorical theories, but have not been analyzed computationally, let us consider two contrasting sentence styles: loose (cumulative) and periodic:2 a loose sentence places the main clause at the beginning, and then appends subordinate phrases and clauses to develop the main message.",
        "In contrast, a periodic sentence starts with subordinate phrases and clauses, suspending the most",

        "of words and POS tags important part to the end.",
        "The example in Table 2 highlights the difference: Notice that these two sentences comprise of an identical set of words and part-of-speech.",
        "Hence, shallow lexico-syntactic analysis will not be able to catch the pronounced stylistic difference that is clear to a human reader.",
        "One might wonder whether we could gain interesting insights simply by looking at the most discriminative production rules in PCFG trees.",
        "To address this question, Table 1 shows the top ten most discriminative production rules for authorship attribution for scientific articles,3 ranked by LIBLINEAR (Fan et al. 2008).4 Note that terminal production rules are excluded so as to focus directly on syntax.",
        "It does provide some insights, but not to a satisfactory degree.",
        "For instance, Hobbs seems to favor inverted declarative sentences (SINV) and adverbs with prepositions (RB PP).",
        "While the latter can be easily obtained by simple part-of",

        "speech analysis, the former requires using parse trees.",
        "We can also observe that none of the top 10 most discriminative production rules for Hobbs includes SBAR tag, which represents subordinate clauses.",
        "But examining discriminative rules alone is limited in providing more comprehensive characterization of idiolects.",
        "Can we unveil something more in deep syntactic structure that can characterize the collective syntactic difference between any two authors?",
        "For instance, what can we say about distributional difference between loose and periodic sentences discussed earlier for each author?",
        "As can be seen in Table 1, simply enumerating most discriminative rules does not readily answer questions such as above.",
        "In general, production rules in CFGs do not directly map to a wide variety of stylistic elements in rhetorical and composition theories.",
        "This is only as expected however, partly because CFGs are not designed for stylometric analysis in the first place, and also because some syntactic elements can go beyond the scope of context free grammars.",

        "In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive exploration of syntactic elements in writing styles, with particular emphasis on interpretable characterization of stylistic elements, thus distinguishing our work from other recent work on syntactic stylometric analysis.",
        "Our analytical study provides novel statistically supported insights into stylistic elements that have not been computationally analyzed in previous literature.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate the use of syntactic feature generators for text categorization (e.g., Collins and Duffy (2002), Moschitti (2008), Pighin and Moschitti (2009)) for stylom-etry analysis.",
