        "These data challenge past approaches in two ways: First, Arabic is a morphologically rich language (Habash, 2010).",
        "Named entities are referenced using complex syntactic constructions (cf. English NEs, which are primarily sequences of proper nouns).",
        "The Arabic script suppresses most vowels, increasing lexical ambiguity, and lacks capitalization, a key clue for English NER.",
        "Second, much research has focused on the use of news text for system building and evaluation.",
        "Wikipedia articles are not news, belonging instead to a wide range of domains that are not clearly",
        "delineated.",
        "One hallmark of this divergence between Wikipedia and the news domain is a difference in the distributions of named entities.",
        "Indeed, the classic named entity types (person, organization, location) may not be the most apt for articles in other domains (e.g., scientific or social topics).",
        "On the other hand, Wikipedia is a large dataset, inviting semisupervised approaches.",
        "In this paper, we describe advances on the problem of NER in Arabic Wikipedia.",
        "The techniques are general and make use of well-understood building blocks.",

        "Most of the effort in NER has been focused around a small set of domains and general-purpose entity classes relevant to those domains?especially the categories PER(SON), ORG(ANIZATION), and LOC(ATION) (POL), which are highly prominent in news text.",
        "Arabic is no exception: the publicly available NER corpora?ACE (Walker et al. 2006), ANER (Be-najiba et al. 2008), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006)?all are in the news domain.2 However, 2OntoNotes contains news-related text.",
        "ACE includes some text from blogs.",
        "In addition to the POL classes, both corpora include additional NE classes such as facility, event, product, vehicle, etc.",
        "These entities are infrequent and may not be comprehensive enough to cover the larger set of pos",
        "of Arabic Wikipedia articles in our development and test sets, and some NEs with standard and article-specific classes.",
        "Additionally, Prussia and Amman were reserved for training annotators, and Gulf War for estimating inter-annotator agreement.",
        "appropriate entity classes will vary widely by domain; occurrence rates for entity classes are quite different in news text vs. Wikipedia, for instance (Balasuriya et al. 2009).",
        "This is abundantly clear in technical and scientific discourse, where much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it holds elsewhere.",
        "Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism).",
        "Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis.",
        "Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al. 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al. 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al. 2003).",
        "Coarse, general-purpose categories have also been used for semantic tagging of nouns and verbs (Cia-ramita and Johnson, 2003).",
        "Yet as the number of classes or domains grows, rigorously documenting and organizing the classes?even for a single language?requires intensive effort.",
        "Ideally, an NER system would refine the traditional classes (Hovy et al. 2011) or identify new entity classes when they arise in new domains, adapting to new data.",
        "For this reason, we believe it is valuable to consider NER systems that identify (but do not necessarily label) entity mentions, and also to consider annotation schemes that allow annotators more freedom in defining entity classes.",
        "Our aim in creating an annotated dataset is to provide a testbed for evaluation of new NER models.",
        "We will use these data as development and sible NEs (Sekine et al. 2002).",

        "III, 2007); we alter the loss function.",
        "Not surprisingly, the double-ROP approach harms performance on the original domain (on ACE data, we achieve 55.41% F1, far below the standard perceptron).",
        "Yet we observe that models can be prepared for adaptation even before a learner is exposed a new domain, sacrificing performance in the original domain.",
        "The recall-oriented bias is not merely encouraging the learner to identify entities already seen in training.",
        "As recall increases, so does the number of new entity types recovered by the model: of the 2,070 NE types in the test data that were never seen in training, only 450 were ever found by the baseline, versus 588 in the reg/ROP condition, 632 in the ROP/none condition, and 717 in the double-ROP condition.",
        "We note finally that our method is a simple extension to the standard structured perceptron; cost-augmented inference is often no more expensive than traditional inference, and the algorithmic change is equivalent to adding one additional feature.",
        "Our recall-oriented cost function is parameterized by a single value, ?",
        "; recall is highly sensitive to the choice of this value (figure 1 shows how we tuned it on development data), and thus we anticipate that, in general, such tuning will be essential to leveraging the benefits of arrogance."
