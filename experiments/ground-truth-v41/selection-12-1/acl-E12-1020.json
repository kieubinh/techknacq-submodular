        "Supervised methods for relation extraction have been studied extensively since rich annotated linguistic resources, e.g. the Automatic Content Extraction1 (ACE) training corpus, were released.",
        "We will give a summary of related methods in section 2.",
        "Those methods rely on accurate and complete annotation.",
        "To obtain high quality annotation, the common wisdom is to let",
        "two annotators independently annotate a corpus, and then asking a senior annotator to adjudicate the disagreements 2 .",
        "This annotation procedure roughly requires 3 passes3 over the same corpus.",
        "Therefore it is very expensive.",
        "The ACE 2005 annotation on relations is conducted in this way.",
        "In this paper, we analyzed a snapshot of ACE training data and found that each annotator missed a significant fraction of relation mentions and annotated some spurious ones.",
        "We found that it is possible to separate most missing examples from the vast majority of true-negative unlabeled examples, and in contrast, most of the relation mentions that are adjudicated as incorrect contain useful expressions for learning a relation extractor.",
        "Based on this observation, we propose an algorithm that purifies negative examples and applies transductive inference to utilize missing examples during the training process on the single-pass annotation.",
        "Results show that the extractor trained on single-pass annotation with the proposed algorithm has a performance that is close to an extractor trained on the 3-pass annotation.",
        "We further show that the proposed algorithm trained on a single-pass annotation on the complete set of documents has a higher performance than an extractor trained on 3-pass annotation on 90% of the documents in the same corpus, although the effort of doing a single-pass annotation over the entire set costs less than half that of doing 3 passes over 90% of the documents.",
        "From the perspective of learning a high-performance relation extractor, it suggests that a better way to do relation annotation is not to annotate with a high-cost quality assurance, but to annotate more.",
        "2 The senior annotator also found some missing examples as shown in figure 1.",
        "3 In this paper, we will assume that the adjudication pass has a similar cost compared to each of the two first-passes.",
        "The adjudicator may not have to look at as many sentences as an annotator, but he is required to review all instances found by both annotators.",
        "Moreover, he has to be more skilled and may have to spend more time on each instance to be able to resolve disagreements."

        "ACE 2005 defined 7 major entity types, such as PER (Person), LOC (Location), ORG (Organization).",
        "A relation in ACE is defined as an ordered pair of entities appearing in the same sentence which expresses one of the predefined relations.",
        "ACE 2005 defines 7 major relation types and more than 20 subtypes.",
        "Following previous work, we ignore subtypes in this paper and only evaluate on types when reporting relation classification performance.",
        "Types include General-affiliation (GEN-AFF), Part-whole (PART-WHOLE), Person-social (PER-SOC), etc.",
        "ACE provides a large corpus which is manually annotated with entities (with coreference chains between entity mentions annotated), relations, events and values.",
        "Each mention of a relation is tagged with a pair of entity mentions appearing in the same sentence as its arguments.",
        "More details about the ACE evaluation are on the ACE official website.",
        "Given a sentence s and two entity mentions arg1 and arg2 contained in s, a candidate relation mention r with argument arg1 preceding arg2 is defined as r=(s, arg1, arg2).",
        "The goal of Relation Detection and Classification (RDC) is to determine whether r expresses one of the types defined.",
        "If so, classify it into one of the types.",
        "Supervised learning treats RDC as a classification problem and solves it with supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as MaxEnt and SVM.",
        "There are two commonly used learning strategies (Sun et al. 2011).",
        "Given an annotated corpus, one could apply a flat learning strategy, which trains a single multi-class classifier on training examples labeled as one of the relation types or not-a-relation, and apply it to determine its type or output not-a relation for each candidate relation mention during testing.",
        "The examples of each type are the relation mentions that are tagged as instances of that type, and the not-a-relation examples are constructed from pairs of entities that appear in the same sentence but are not tagged as any of the types.",
        "Alternatively, one could apply a hierarchical learning strategy, which trains two classifiers, a binary classifier RD for relation detection and the other a multi-class classifier RC for relation classification.",
        "RD is trained by grouping tagged relation mentions of all types as positive instances and using all the not-a-relation cases (same as described above) as negative examples.",
        "RC is trained on the annotated examples with their tagged types.",
        "During testing, RD is applied first to identify whether an example expresses some relation, then RC is applied to determine the most likely type only if it is detected as correct by RD.",
        "State-of-the-art supervised methods for relation extraction also differ from each other on data representation.",
        "Given a relation mention, feature-based methods (Miller et al. 2000; Kambhatla, 2004; Boschee et al. 2005; Grishman et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2005; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Sun et al. 2011) extract a rich list of structural, lexical, syntactic and semantic features to represent it; in contrast, the kernel based methods (Zelenko et al. 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang et al. 2006a; Zhang et al. 2006b; Zhou et al. 2007; Qian et al. 2008) represent each instance with an object such as augmented token sequences or a parse tree, and used a carefully designed kernel function, e.g. subsequence kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b) or convolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), to calculate their similarity.",
        "These objects are usually augmented with features such as semantic features.",
        "In this paper, we use the hierarchical learning strategy since it simplifies the problem by letting us focus on relation detection only.",
        "The relation classification stage remains unchanged and we will show that it benefits from improved detection.",
        "For experiments on both relation detection and relation classification, we use SVM4 (Vapnik 1998) as the learning algorithm since it can be extended to support transductive inference as discussed in section 4.3.",
        "However, for the analysis in section 3.2 and the purification preprocess steps in section 4.2, we use a MaxEnt5 model since it outputs probabilities6 for its predictions.",
        "For the choice of features, we use the full set of features from Zhou et al(2005) since it is reported to have a state-of-the-art performance (Sun et al. 2011)."
