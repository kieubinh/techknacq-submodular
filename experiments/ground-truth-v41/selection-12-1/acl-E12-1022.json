        "Update summarization is the problem of extracting and synthesizing novel information in a collection of documents with respect to a set of documents assumed to be known by the reader.",
        "This problem has received much attention in recent years, as can be observed in the number of participants to the special track on update summarization organized by DUC and TAC since 2007.",
        "The problem is usually formalized as follows: Given two collections A and B, where the documents in A chronologically precede the documents in B, generate a summary of B under the assumption that the user of the summary has already read the documents in A. Extractive techniques are the most common approaches in multi-document summarization.",
        "Summaries generated by such techniques consist of sentences extracted from the document collection.",
        "Extracts can have coherence and cohesion problems, but they generally offer a good trade-off between linguistic quality and informativeness.",
        "While numerous extractive summarization techniques have been proposed for multi-document summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Radev et al. 2004; Shen and Li, 2010; Li et al., 2011), few techniques have been specifically designed for update summarization.",
        "Most existing approaches handle it as a redundancy removal problem, with the goal of producing a summary of collection B that is as dissimilar as possible from either collection A or from a summary of collec-tionA.",
        "A problem with this approach is that it can easily classify as redundant sentences in which novel information is mixed with existing information (from collection A).",
        "Furthermore, while this approach can identify sentences that contain novel information, it cannot model explicitly what the novel information is.",
        "Recently, Bayesian models have successfully been applied to multi-document summarization showing state-of-the-art results in summarization competitions (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Jin et al. 2010).",
        "These approaches offer clear and rigorous probabilistic interpretations that many other techniques lack.",
        "Furthermore, they have the advantage of operating in unsupervised settings, which can be used in real-world scenarios, across domains and languages.",
        "To our best knowledge, previous work has not used this approach for update summarization.",
        "In this article, we propose a novel nonpara-metric Bayesian approach for update summarization.",
        "Our approach, which is a variation of Latent",
        "Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al. 2003), aims to learn to distinguish between common information and novel information.",
        "We have evaluated this approach on the ROUGE scores and demonstrate that it produces comparable results to the top system in TAC-2011.",
        "Furthermore, our approach improves over that system when evaluated manually in terms of linguistic quality and overall responsiveness."

        "These generative models represent documents as mixtures of latent topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words.",
        "In TOPICSUM (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), each word is generated by a single topic which can be a corpus-wide background distribution over common words, a distribution of document-specific words or a distribution of the core content of a given cluster.",
        "BAYESSUM (Daume?",
        "and Marcu, 2006) and the Special Words and Background model (Chemudugunta et al. 2006) are very similar to TOPICSUM.",
        "A commonality of all these models is the use of collection and document-specific distributions in order to distinguish between the general and specific topics in documents.",
        "In the context of summarization, this distinction helps to identify the important pieces of information in a collection.",
        "Models that use more structure in the representation of documents have also been proposed for generating more coherent and less redundant summaries, such as HIERSUM (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and TTM (Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011).",
        "For instance, HIERSUM models the intuitions that first sentences in documents should contain more general information, and that adjacent sentences are likely to share specic content vocabulary.",
        "However, HIERSUM, which builds upon TOPICSUM, does not show a statistically signicant improvement in ROUGE over TOPICSUM.",
        "A number of techniques have been proposed to rank sentences of a collection given a word distribution (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Goldstein et al. 1999).",
        "The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) is a widely used measure in summarization.",
        "Given a target distribution T that we want a summary S to approximate, KL is commonly used as the scoring function to select the subset of sentences S?",
        "that minimizes the KL divergence with",
        "where w is a word from the vocabulary V. This strategy is called KLSum.",
        "Usually, a smoothing factor ?",
        "is applied on the candidate distribution S in order to avoid the divergence to be undefined1.",
        "This objective function selects the most representative sentences of the collection, and at the same time it also diversifies the generated summary by penalizing redundancy.",
        "Since the problem of finding the subset of sentences from a collection that minimizes the KL divergence is NP-complete, a greedy algorithm is often used in practice2.",
        "Some variations of this objective function can be considered, such as penalizing sentences that contain document-specific topics (Mason and Charniak, 2011) or rewarding sentences appearing closer to the beginning of the document.",
        "Wang et al(2009) propose a Bayesian approach for summarization that does not use KL for reranking.",
        "In their model, Bayesian Sentence-based Topic Models, every sentence in a document is assumed to be associated to a unique latent topic.",
        "Once the model parameters have been calculated, a summary is generated by choosing the sentence with the highest probability for each topic.",
        "While hierarchical topic modeling approaches have shown remarkable effectiveness in learning the latent topics of document collections, they are not designed to capture the novel information in a collection with respect to another one, which is the primary focus of update summarization."

        "Thus, while the goal of novelty detection is to determine whether some information is new, the goal of update summarization is to extract and synthesize the novel information.",
        "Update summarization is also related to contrastive summarization, i.e. the problem of jointly generating summaries for two entities in order to highlight their differences (Lerman and McDonald, 2009).",
        "The primary difference here is that update summarization aims to extract novel or updated information in the update collection with respect to the base collection.",
        "The most common approach for update summarization is to apply a normal multi-document summarizer, with some added functionality to remove sentences that are redundant with respect to collection A.",
        "This can be achieved using simple filtering rules (Fisher and Roark, 2008), Maximal Marginal Relevance (Boudin et al. 2008), or more complex graph-based algorithms (Shen and Li, 2010; Wenjie et al. 2008).",
        "The goal here is to boost sentences in B that bring out completely novel information.",
        "One problem with this approach is that it is likely to discard as redundant sentences in B containing novel information if it is mixed with known information from collection A.",
        "Another approach is to introduce specific features intended to capture the novelty in collection B.",
        "For example, comparing collections A and B, FastSum derives features for the collection B such as number of named entities in the sentence that already occurred in the old cluster or the number of new content words in the sentence not already mentioned in the old cluster that are subsequently used to train a Support Vector Machine classifier (Schilder et al. 2008).",
        "A limitation with this approach is there are no large training sets available and, the more features it has, the more it is affected by the sparsity of the training data."

        "To evaluate such aspects, a manual evaluation is required.",
        "A fairly standard approach for manual evaluation is through pairwise comparison (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011).",
        "In this approach, raters are presented with pairs of summaries generated by two systems and they are asked to say which one is best with respect to some aspects.",
        "We followed a similar approach to compare DualSum with Peer 43 - the best system with respect to ROUGE-2, on the TAC 2011 dataset.",
        "For each collection, raters were presented with three summaries: a reference summary randomly chosen from the model summaries, and the summaries generated by Peer 43 and DualSum.",
        "They were asked to read the summaries and say which one of the two generated summaries is best with respect to: 1) Overall responsiveness: which summary is best overall (both in terms of content and fluency), 2) Focus: which summary contains less irrelevant details, 3) Coherence: which summary is more coherent and 4) Non-redundancy: which summary repeats less the same information.",
        "For each aspect, the rater could also reply that both summary were of the same quality.",
        "For each of the 44 collections in TAC-2011, 3 ratings were collected from raters7.",
        "Results are reported in Table 2.",
        "DualSum outperforms Peer 43 in three aspects, including Overall Responsiveness, which aggregates all the other scores and can be considered the most important one.",

        "The running time for summarizing the TAC collections with DualSum, averaged over a hundred runs, is 4.97 minutes, using one core (2.3 GHz).",
        "Memory consumption was 143 MB.",
        "It is important to note as well that, while TOPICSUM incorporates an additional layer to model topic distributions at the sentence level, we noted early in our experiments that this did not improve the performance (as evaluated with ROUGE) and consequently relaxed that assumption in DualSum.",
        "This resulted in a simplification of the model and a reduction of the sampling time.",
        "While five minutes is fast enough to be able to experiment and tune parameters with the TAC collections, it would be quite slow for a real-time summarization system able to generate summaries on request.",
        "As can be seen from the plate diagram in Figure 2, all the collections are generated independently from each other.",
        "The only exception, for which it is necessary to have all",
        "the collections available at the same time during Gibbs sampling, is the background distribution, which is estimated from all the collections simultaneously, roughly representing 27% of the words, that should appear distributed across all documents.",
        "The good news is that this background distribution will contain closed-class words in the language, which are domain-independent (see supplementary material for examples).",
        "Therefore, we can generate this distribution from one of the TAC datasets only once, and then it can be reused.",
        "Fixing the background distribution to a precomputed value requires a very simple modification of the Gibbs sampling implementation, which just needs to adjust at each iteration the collection and document-specific models, and the topic assignment for the words.",
        "Using this modified implementation, it is now possible to summarize a single collection independently.",
        "The summarization of a single collection of the size of the TAC collections is reduced on average to only three seconds on the same hardware settings, allowing the use of this summarizer in an on-line application."

      "text": [
        "The main contribution of this paper is DUALSUM, a new topic model that is specifically designed to identify and extract novelty from pairs of collections.",
        "It is inspired by TOPICSUM (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), with two main changes: Firstly, while TOPICSUM can only learn the main topic of a collection, DUALSUM focuses on the differences between two collections.",
        "Secondly, while TOPICSUM incorporates an additional layer to model topic distributions at the sentence level, we have found that relaxing this assumption and modeling the topic distribution at document level does not decrease the ROUGE scores and reduces the sampling time.",
        "The generated summaries, tested on the TAC2011 collection, would have resulted on the second and third position in the last summarization competition according to the different ROUGE scores.",
        "This would make DUALSUM statistically indistinguishable from the top system with 0.95 confidence.",
        "We also propose and evaluate the applicability of an alternative implementation of Gibbs sampling to on-line settings.",
        "By fixing the background distribution we are able to summarize a distribution in only three seconds, which seems reasonable for some on-line applications.",
        "As future work, we plan to explore the use of DUALSUM to generate more general contrastive summaries, by identifying differences between collections whose differences are not of temporal nature."
