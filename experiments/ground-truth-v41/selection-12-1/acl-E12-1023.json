        "Automatic document summarization is the problem of constructing a short text describing the main points in a (set of) document(s).",
        "Example applications range from generating short summaries of news articles, to presenting snippets for URLs in web-search.",
        "In this paper we focus on extractive multi-document summarization, where the final summary is a subset of the sentences from multiple input documents.",
        "In this way, extractive summarization avoids the hard problem of generating well-formed natural-language sentences, since only existing sentences from the input documents are presented as part of the summary.",
        "A current state-of-the-art method for document summarization was recently proposed by Lin and Bilmes (2010), using a submodular scoring function based on inter-sentence similarity.",
        "On the one hand, this scoring function rewards summaries that are similar to many sentences in the original documents (i.e. promotes coverage).",
        "On the other hand, it penalizes summaries that contain sentences that are similar to each other (i.e. discourages redundancy).",
        "While obtaining the exact summary that optimizes the objective is computationally hard, they show that a greedy algorithm is guaranteed to compute a good approximation.",
        "However, their work does not address how to select a good inter-sentence similarity measure, leaving this problem as well as selecting an appropriate trade-off between coverage and redundancy to manual tuning.",
        "To overcome this problem, we propose a supervised learning method that can learn both the similarity measure as well as the coverage/reduncancy trade-off from training data.",
        "Furthermore, our learning algorithm is not limited to the model of Lin and Bilmes (2010), but applies to all monotone submodular summarization models.",
        "Due to the diminishing-returns property of monotone submodular set functions and their computational tractability, this class of functions provides a rich space for designing summarization methods.",
        "To illustrate the generality of our approach, we also provide experiments for a coverage-based model originally developed for diversified information retrieval (Swaminathan et al. 2009).",
        "In general, our method learns a parameterized monotone submodular scoring function from supervised training data, and its implementation is available for download.1 Given a set of documents and their summaries as training examples,",
        "we formulate the learning problem as a structured prediction problem and derive a maximum-margin algorithm in the structural support vector machine (SVM) framework.",
        "Note that, unlike other learning approaches, our method does not require a heuristic decomposition of the learning task into binary classification problems (Ku-piec et al. 1995), but directly optimizes a structured prediction.",
        "This enables our algorithm to directly optimize the desired performance measure (e.g. ROUGE) during training.",
        "Furthermore, our method is not limited to linear-chain dependencies like (Conroy and O?leary, 2001; Shen et al. 2007), but can learn any monotone submodular scoring function.",
        "This ability to easily train summarization models makes it possible to efficiently tune models to various types of document collections.",
        "In particular, we find that our learning method can reliably tune models with hundreds of parameters based on a training set of about 30 examples.",
        "This increases the fidelity of models compared to their hand-tuned counterparts, showing significantly improved empirical performance.",
        "We provide a detailed investigation into the sources of these improvements, identifying further directions for research."

        "Work on extractive summarization spans a large range of approaches.",
        "Starting with unsupervised methods, one of the widely known approaches is Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Car-bonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "It uses a greedy approach for selection and considers the trade-off between relevance and redundancy.",
        "Later it was extended (Goldstein et al. 2000) to support multi-document settings by incorporating additional information available in this case.",
        "Good results can be achieved by reformulating this as a knapsack packing problem and solving it using dynamic programing (McDonald, 2007).",
        "Alternatively, we can use annotated phrases as textual units and select a subset that covers most concepts present in the input (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004) (which can also be achieved by our coverage scoring function if it is extended with appropriate features).",
        "A popular stochastic graph-based summarization method is LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "It computes sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph of sentence similarities.",
        "Similarly, TextRank (Mi-halcea and Tarau, 2004) is also graph based ranking system for identification of important sentences in a document by using sentence similarity and PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "Sentence extraction can also be implemented using other graph based scoring approaches (Mihalcea, 2004) such as HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) and positional power functions.",
        "Graph based methods can also be paired with clustering such as in Col-labSum (Wan et al. 2007).",
        "This approach first uses clustering to obtain document clusters and then uses graph based algorithm for sentence selection which includes inter and intra-document sentence similarities.",
        "Another clustering-based algorithm (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001) is a diversity-based extension of MMR that finds diversity by clustering and then proceeds to reduce redundancy by selecting a representative for each cluster.",
        "The manually tuned sentence pairwise model (Lin and Bilmes, 2010; Lin and Bilmes, 2011) we took inspiration from is based on budgeted submodular optimization.",
        "A summary is produced by maximizing an objective function that includes coverage and redundancy terms.",
        "Coverage is defined as the sum of sentence similarities between the selected summary and the rest of the sentences, while redundancy is the sum of pairwise intra-summary sentence similarities.",
        "Another approach based on submodularity (Qazvinian et al. 2010) relies on extracting important keyphrases from citation sentences for a given paper and using them to build the summary.",
        "In the supervised setting, several early methods (Kupiec et al. 1995) made independent binary decisions whether to include a particular sentence in the summary or not.",
        "This ignores dependencies between sentences and can result in high redundancy.",
        "The same problem arises when using learning-to-rank approaches such as ranking support vector machines, support vector regression and gradient boosted decision trees to select the most relevant sentences for the summary (Metzler and Kanungo, 2008).",
        "Introducing some dependencies can improve the performance.",
        "One limited way of introducing dependencies between sentences is by using a linear-chain HMM.",
        "The HMM is assumed to produce the summary by having a chain transitioning",
        "between summarization and non-summarization states (Conroy and O?leary, 2001) while traversing the sentences in a document.",
        "A more expressive approach is using a CRF for sequence label-ing (Shen et al. 2007) which can utilize larger and not necessarily independent feature spaces.",
        "The disadvantage of using linear chain models, however, is that they represent the summary as a sequence of sentences.",
        "Dependencies between sentences that are far away from each other cannot be modeled efficiently.",
        "In contrast to such linear chain models, our approach on submodular scoring functions can model long-range dependencies.",
        "In this way our method can use properties of the whole summary when deciding which sentences to include in it.",
        "More closely related to our work is that of Li et al(2009).",
        "They use the diversified retrieval method proposed in Yue and Joachims (2008) for document summarization.",
        "Moreover, they assume that subtopic labels are available so that additional constraints for diversity, coverage and balance can be added to the structural SVM learning problem.",
        "In contrast, our approach does not require the knowledge of subtopics (thus allowing us to apply it to a wider range of tasks) and avoids adding additional constraints (simplifying the algorithm).",
        "Furthermore, it can use different submodular objective functions, for example word coverage and sentence pairwise models described later in this paper.",
        "Another closely related work also takes a max-margin discriminative learning approach in the structural SVM framework (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011) or by using MIRA (Martins and Smith, 2009) to learn the parameters for summarizing a set of documents.",
        "However, they do not consider submodular functions, but instead solve an Integer Linear Program (ILP) or an approximation thereof.",
        "The ILP encodes a compression model where arbitrary parts of the parse trees of sentences in the summary can be cut and removed.",
        "This allows them to select parts of sentences and yet preserve some gramatical structure.",
        "Their work focuses on learning a particular compression model based on ILP inference, while our work explores learning a general and large class of sentence selection models using submodular optimization.",
        "The third notable approach uses SEARN (Daume?, 2006) to learn parameters for joint summarization and compression model, however it uses vine-growth model and employs search to to find the best policy which is then used to generate a summary.",
        "A specific subclass of submodular (but not monotone) functions are defined by Determinan-tal Point Processes (DPPs) (Kulesza and Taskar, 2011).",
        "While they provide an elegant probabilistic interpretation of the resulting summarization models, the lack of monotonicity means that no efficient approximation algorithms are known for computing the highest-scoring summary."

        "Third, we expect some drop in performance, since our model may not be able to fit the optimal extractive summaries due to a lack of expressiveness.",
        "This can be estimated by looking at training set performance, as reported in row model fit of Figure 5.",
        "On both datasets, we see a drop of about 5 points of ROUGE performance.",
        "Adding more and better features might help the model fit the data better.",

        "The test set ROUGE scores are given in the row prediction of Figure 5.",
        "Note that the drop between training and test performance is rather small, so overfitting is not an issue and is well controlled in our algorithm.",

        "The most important group of features are the basic features (pure cosine similarity between sentences) since removing them results in the largest drop in performance.",

        "This confirms that performance can be improved by adding richer fatures instead of using only a single similarity score as in Lin and Bilmes (2010).",
        "Using learning for these complex model is essential, since hand-tuning is likely to be intractable.",
        "The second most important group of features considering the drop in performance (i.e. location) looks at positions of sentences in the articles.",
        "This makes intuitive sense because the first sentences in news articles are usually packed with information.",

        "The most important are basic similarity features including all words (similar to (Lin and Bilmes, 2010)).",
        "The last feature group actually lowered the score but is included in the model because we only found this out later on DUC ?04 dataset.",
        "5.5 How important is it to train with multiple summaries?",
        "While having four manual summaries may be important for computing a reliable ROUGE score for evaluation, it is not clear whether such an approach is the most efficient use of annotator resources for training.",
        "In our final experiment, we trained our method using only a single manual summary for each set of documents.",
        "When using only a single manual summary, we arbitrarily took the first one out of the provided four reference summaries and used only it to compute the target label for training (instead of using average loss towards all four of them).",
        "Otherwise, the experimental setup was the same as in the previous subsections, using the pairwise model.",
        "For DUC ?04, the ROUGE-1 F score obtained using only a single summary per document set was 0.4010, which is slightly but not significantly lower than the 0.4066 obtained with four summaries (as shown on Figure 3).",
        "Similarly, on DUC ?03 the performance drop from 0.3929 to 0.3838 was not significant as well.",
        "Based on those results, we conjecture that having more documents sets with only a single manual summary is more useful for training than fewer training examples with better labels (i.e. multiple summaries).",
        "In both cases, we spend approximately the same amount of effort (as the summaries are the most expensive component of the training data), however having more training examples helps (according to the learning curve presented before) while spending effort on multiple summaries appears to have only minor benefit for training."
