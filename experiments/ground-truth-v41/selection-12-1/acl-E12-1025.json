        "In these and many other examples, data can be viewed as an incoming unbounded stream since it grows continually with time (Levenberg et al. 2010).",
        "Manual translation of such streams of data is extremely expensive given the huge volume of translation required,",
        "therefore various automatic machine translation methods have been proposed.",
        "However, automatic statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are far from generating error-free translations and their outputs usually require human post-editing in order to achieve high-quality translations.",
        "One way of taking advantage of SMT systems is to combine them with the knowledge of a human translator in the interactive-predictive machine translation (IMT) framework (Foster et al. 1998; Langlais and La-palme, 2002; Barrachina et al. 2009), which is a particular case of the computer-assisted translation paradigm (Isabelle and Church, 1997).",

        "Unfortunately, the application of either post-editing or IMT to data streams with massive data volumes is still too expensive, simply because manual supervision of all instances requires huge amounts of manpower.",
        "For such massive data streams the need of employing active learning (AL) is compelling.",
        "AL techniques for IMT selectively ask an oracle (e.g. a human translator) to supervise a small portion of the incoming sentences.",
        "Sentences are selected so that SMT models estimated from them translate new sentences as accurately as possible.",
        "There are three challenges when applying AL to unbounded data streams (Zhu et al. 2010).",

        "The pool of candidate sentences is dynamically changing, whereas existing AL algorithms are dealing with static datasets only.",

        "In addition to this, we used a block size of 500 sentences.",
        "Similar results were obtained for other block sizes.",
        "Results in Figure 2 indicate that the performances for the data blocks fluctuate and fluctuations are quite significant.",
        "This phenomenon is due to the eclectic domain of the sentences in the data stream.",
        "Additionally, the steady increase in performance is caused by the increasing amount of data used to retrain the SMT model.",
        "Regarding the results for the different sampling strategies, DCS consistently outperformed RS and NS.",
        "This observation asserts that for concept drifting data streams with constant changing translation distributions, DCS can adaptively ask the user to translate sentences to build a superior SMT model.",
        "On the other hand, NS obtains worse results that RS.",
        "This result can be explained by the",
        "as a function of the percentage of the corpus used to retrain the model.",
        "fact that NS is independent of the target language and just looks into the source language, while DCS takes into account both the source sentence and its automatic translation.",
        "Similar phenomena has been reported in a previous work on AL for SMT (Haffari et al. 2009).",
        "We carried out experiments to study the performance of the different sampling strategies.",
        "To this end, we compare the quality of the initial automatic translations generated in our AL implementation for IMT (line 6 in Algorithm 1).",
        "Figure 3 shows the BLEU score of these initial translations represented as a function of the percentage of the corpus used to retrain the SMT model.",
        "The percentage of the corpus is measured in number of running words.",
        "In Figure 3, we present results for the three sampling strategies described in section 5.",
        "Additionally, we also compare our techniques with the AL technique for IMT proposed in (Gonza?lez-Rubio et al. 2011).",
        "Such technique is similar to DCS but it does not update the IBM model 1 used by the confidence sampler with the newly available human-translated sentences.",
        "This technique is referred to as static confidence sampler (SCS).",
        "Results in Figure 3 indicate that the performance of the retrained SMT models increased as more data was incorporated.",
        "Regarding the sampling strategies, DCS improved the results obtained by the other sampling strategies.",
        "NS obtained by far the worst results, which confirms the results shown in the previous experiment.",
        "Finally,",
        "(BLEU) as a function of the required human effort (KSMR).",
        "w/o AL denotes a system with no retraining.",
        "as it can be seen, SCS obtained slightly worst results than DCS showing the importance of dynamically adapting the underlying model used by the sampling strategy.",
        "7.3.3 Balancing human effort and translation quality Finally, we studied the balance between required human effort and final translation error.",
        "This can be useful in a real-world scenario where a translation company is hired to translate a stream of sentences.",
        "Under these circumstances, it would be important to be able to predict the effort required from the human translators to obtain a certain translation quality.",
        "The experiment simulate this situation using our proposed IMT system with AL to translate the stream of sentences.",
        "To have a broad view of the behavior of our system, we repeated this translation process multiple times requiring an increasing human effort each time.",
        "Experiments range from a fully-automatic translation system with no need of human intervention to a system where the human is required to supervise all the sentences.",
        "Figure 4 presents results for SCS (see section 7.3.2) and the sentence selection strategies presented in section 5.",
        "In addition, we also present results for a static system without AL (w/o AL).",
        "This system is equal to SCS but it do not perform any SMT retraining.",
        "Results in Figure 4 show a consistent reduction in required user effort when using AL.",
        "For a given human effort the use of AL methods allowed to obtain twice the translation quality.",
        "Regarding the different AL sampling strategies, DCS obtains the better results but differences with other methods are slight.",
        "Varying the sentence classifier, we can achieve a balance between final translation quality and required human effort.",
        "This feature allows us to adapt the system to suit the requirements of the particular translation task or to the available economic or human resources.",
        "For example, if a translation quality of 60 BLEU points is satisfactory, then the human translators would need to modify only a 20% of the characters of the automatically generated translations.",
        "Finally, it should be noted that our IMT systems with AL are able to generate new suffixes and retrain with new sentence pairs in tenths of a second.",
        "Thus, it can be applied in real time scenarios."

        "In this work, we have presented an AL framework for IMT specially designed to process data streams with massive volumes of data.",
        "Our proposal splits the data stream in blocks of sentences of a certain size and applies AL techniques individually for each block.",
        "For this purpose, we implemented different sampling strategies that measure the informativeness of a sentence according to different criteria.",
        "To evaluate the performance of our proposed sampling strategies, we carried out experiments comparing them with random sampling and the only previously proposed AL technique for IMT described in (Gonza?lez-Rubio et al. 2011).",
        "According to the results, one of the proposed sampling strategies, specifically the dynamic confidence sampling strategy, consistently outperformed all the other strategies.",
        "The results in the experimentation show that the use of AL techniques allows us to make a tradeoff between required human effort and final translation quality.",
        "In other words, we can adapt our system to meet the translation quality requirements of the translation task or the available human resources.",
        "As future work, we plan to investigate on more sophisticated sampling strategies such as those based in information density or query-by-committee.",
        "Additionally, we will conduct experiments with real users to confirm the results obtained by our user simulation."
