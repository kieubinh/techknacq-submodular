        "Given the success of work on sentiment analysis in NLP, increasing attention is being focused on how to present the results of sentiment analysis to the user.",
        "In this paper, we address an important use case that has so far been neglected: quick scanning of short summaries of a body of reviews with the purpose of finding a subset of reviews that can be studied in more detail.",
        "This use case occurs in companies that want to quickly assess, perhaps on a daily basis, what consumers think about a particular product.",
        "One-sentence summaries can be quickly scanned ?",
        "similar to the summaries that search engines give for search results ?",
        "and the reviews that contain interesting and new information can then be easily identified.",
        "Consumers who want to quickly scan review summaries to pick out a few reviews that are helpful for a purchasing decision are a similar use case.",
        "For a one-sentence summary to be useful in this context, it must satisfy two different ?information needs?",
        ": it must convey the sentiment of the review, but it must also provide a specific reason for that sentiment, so that the user can make an informed decision as to whether reading the entire review is likely to be worth the user's time ?",
        "again similar to the purpose of the summary of a web page in search engine results.",
        "We call a sentence that satisfies these two criteria a supporting sentence.",
        "A supporting sentence contains information on the sentiment as well as a specific reason for why the author arrived at this sentiment.",
        "Examples for supporting sentences are ?The picture quality is very good?",
        "or ?The battery life is 2 hours?.",
        "Non-supporting sentences contain opinions without such reasons such as ?I like the camera?",
        "or ?This camera is not worth the money?.",
        "To address use cases of sentiment analysis that involve quick scanning and selective reading of large numbers of reviews, we present a simple unsupervised system in this paper that extracts one supporting sentence per document and show that it is superior to a baseline of selecting the sentence with the strongest sentiment.",
        "One problem we faced in our experiments was that standard evaluations of summarization would have been expensive to conduct for this study.",
        "We therefore used crowdsourcing to perform a new type of comparative evaluation method that is different from training set and gold standard creation, the dominant way crowdsourcing has been used in NLP so far.",
        "In summary, our contributions in this paper are as follows.",
        "We define supporting sentences, a new type of sentiment summary that is appropriate in situations where both the sentiment of a review and a good reason for that sentiment need to be",
        "conveyed succinctly.",
        "We present a simple unsupervised method for extracting supporting sentences and show that it is superior to a baseline in a novel crowdsourcing-based evaluation.",
        "In the next section, we describe related work that is relevant to our new approach.",
        "In Section 3 we present the approach we use to identify supporting sentences.",
        "Section 4 describes the feature representation of sentences and the classification method.",
        "In Section 5 we give an overview of the crowdsourcing evaluation.",

        "Both sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010) and summarization (Nenkova and McKeown, 2011) are important subfields of NLP.",
        "The work most relevant to this paper is work on summarization methods that addresses the specific requirements of summarization in sentiment analysis.",
        "There are two lines of work in this vein with goals similar to ours: (i) aspect-based and pro/con-summarization and (ii) approaches that extract summary sentences from reviews.",
        "An aspect is a component or attribute of a product such as ?battery?, ?lens cap?, ?battery life?, and ?picture quality?",
        "for cameras.",
        "Aspect-oriented summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al. 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006) collects sentiment assessments for a given set of aspects and returns a list of pros and cons about every aspect for a review or, in some cases, on a per-sentence basis.",
        "Aspect-oriented summarization and pro/consummarization differ in a number of ways from supporting sentence summarization.",
        "First, aspects and pros&cons are taken from a fixed inventory.",
        "The inventory is typically small and does not cover the full spectrum of relevant information.",
        "Second, in its most useful form, aspect-oriented summarization requires classification of phrases and sentences according to the aspect they belong to; e.g., ?The camera is very light?",
        "has to be recognized as being relevant to the aspect ?weight?.",
        "Developing a component that assigns phrases and sentences to their corresponding categories is time-consuming and has to be redone for each domain.",
        "Any such component will make mistakes and undetected or incorrectly classified aspects can result in bad summaries.",
        "Our approach enables us to find strong supporting sentences even if the reason given in that sentence does not fit well into the fixed inventory.",
        "No manual work like the creation of an aspect inventory is necessary and there are no requirements on the format of the reviews such as author-provided pros and cons.",
        "Aspect-oriented summarization also differs in that it does not differentiate along the dimension of quality of the reason given for a sentiment.",
        "For example, ?I don't like the zoom?",
        "and ?The zoom range is too limited?",
        "both give reasons for why a camera gets a negative evaluation, but only the latter reason is informative.",
        "In our work, we evaluate the quality of the reason given for a sentiment.",
        "The use case we address in this paper requires a short, easy-to-read summary.",
        "A well-formed sentence is usually easier to understand than a pro/con table.",
        "It also has the advantage that the information conveyed is accurately representing what the user wanted to say ?",
        "this is not the case for a presentation that involves several complex processing steps and takes linguistic material out of the context that may be needed to understand it correctly.",
        "Berend (2011) performs a form of pro/con summarization that does not rely on aspects.",
        "However, most of the problems of aspect-based pro/con summarization also apply to this paper: no differentiation between good and bad reasons, the need for human labels to train a classifier, and inferior readability compared to a well-formed sentence.",
        "Two previous approaches that have attempted to extract sentences from reviews in the context of summarization are (Beineke et al. 2004) and (Arora et al. 2009).",
        "Beineke et al(2004) train a classifier on rottentomatoes.com summary sentences provided by review authors.",
        "These sentences sometimes contain a specific reason for the overall sentiment of the review, but sometimes they are just catchy lines whose purpose is to draw moviegoers in to read the entire review; e.g., ?El Bulli barely registers a pulse stronger than a book?s?",
        "(which does not give a specific reason for why the movie does not register a strong pulse).",
        "Arora et al(2009) define two classes of sentences: qualified claims and bald claims.",
        "A qualified claim gives the reader more details (e.g., ?This camera is small enough to fit easily in a",
        "coat pocket?)",
        "while a bald claim is open to interpretation (e.g., ?This camera is small?).",
        "Qualified/bald is a dimension of classification of sentiment statements that is to some extent orthogonal to quality of reason.",
        "Qualified claims do not have to contain a reason and bald claims can contain an informative reason.",
        "For example, ?I didn't like the camera, but I suspect it will be a great camera for first timers?",
        "is classified as a qualified claim, but the sentence does not give a good reason for the sentiment of the document.",
        "Both dimensions (qualified/bald, high-quality/low-quality reason) are important and can be valuable components of a complete sentiment analysis system.",
        "Apart from the definition of the concept of supporting sentence, which we believe to be more appropriate for the application we have in mind than rottentomatoes.com summary sentences and qualified claims, there are two other important differences of our approach to these two papers.",
        "First, we directly evaluate the quality of the reasons in a crowdsourcing experiment.",
        "Second, our approach is unsupervised and does not require manual annotation of a training set of supporting sentences.",
        "As we will discuss in Section 5, we propose a novel evaluation measure for summarization based on crowdsourcing in this paper.",
        "The most common use of crowdsourcing in NLP is to have workers label a training set and then train a supervised classifier on this training set.",
        "In contrast, we use crowdsourcing to directly evaluate the relative quality of the automatic summaries generated by the unsupervised method we propose."

      "heading": "3 Approach",
      "text": [
        "Our approach is based on the following three premises.",
        "(i) A good supporting sentence conveys both the review's sentiment and a supporting fact.",
        "We make this assumption because we want the sentence to be self-contained.",
        "If it only describes a fact about a product without evaluation, then it does not on its own explain which sentiment is conveyed by the article and why.",
        "(ii) Supporting facts are most often expressed by noun phrases.",
        "We call a noun phrase that expresses a supporting fact a keyphrase.",
        "We are not assuming that all important words in the supporting sentence are nominal; the verb will be needed in many cases to accurately convey the reason for the sentiment expressed.",
        "However, it is a fairly safe assumption that part of the information is conveyed using noun phrases since it is difficult to convey specific information without using specific noun phrases.",
        "Adjectives are often important when expressing a reason, but frequently a noun is also mentioned or one would need to resolve a pronoun to make the sentence a self-contained supporting sentence.",
        "In a sentence like ?It's easy to use?",
        "it is not clear what the adjective is referring to.",
        "(iii) Noun phrases that express supporting facts tend to be domain-specific; they can be automatically identified by selecting noun phrases that are frequent in the domain ?",
        "either in relative terms (compared to a generic corpus) or in absolute terms.",
        "By making this assumption we may fail to detect supporting sentences that are worded in an original way using ordinary words.",
        "However, in a specific domain there is usually a lot of redundancy and most good reasons occur many times and are expressed by similar words.",
        "Based on these assumptions, we select the supporting sentence in two steps.",
        "In the first step, we determine the n sentences with the strongest sentiment within every review by classifying the polarity of the sentences (where n is a parameter).",
        "In the second step, we select one of the n sentences as the best supporting sentence by means of a weighting function.",
        "In this step, we apply a sentiment classifier to all sentences of the review to classify sentences as positive or negative.",
        "We then select the n sentences with the highest probability of conforming with the overall sentiment of the document.",
        "For example, if the document's polarity is negative, we select the n sentences that are most likely to be negative according to the sentiment classifier.",
        "We restrict the set of n sentences to sentences with the ?right?",
        "sentiment because even an excellent supporting sentence is not a good characterization of",
        "the content of the review if it contradicts the overall assessment given by the review.",
        "Only in cases where there are fewer than n sentences with the correct sentiment, we also select sentences with the ?wrong?",
        "sentence to obtain a minimum of n sentences for each review.",
        "Based on premises (ii) and (iii) above, we score a sentence based on the number of noun phrases that occur with high absolute and relative frequency in the domain.",
        "We only consider simple nouns and compound nouns consisting of two nouns in this paper.",
        "In general, compound nouns are more informative and specific.",
        "A compound noun may refer to a specific reason even if the head noun does not (e.g., ?life?",
        "vs. ?battery life?).",
        "This means that we need to compute scores in a way that allows us to give higher weight to compound nouns than to simple nouns.",
        "In addition, we also include counts of nouns and compounds in the scoring that do not have high absolute/relative frequency because frequency heuristics identify keyphrases with only moderate accuracy.",
        "However, theses nouns and compounds are given a lower weight.",
        "This motivates a scoring function that is a weighted sum of four variables: number of simple nouns with high frequency, number of infrequent simple nouns, number of compound nouns with high frequency, and number of infrequent compound nouns.",
        "High frequency is defined as follows.",
        "Let fdom(p) be the domain-specific absolute frequency of phrase p, i.e., the frequency in the review corpus, and fwiki(p) the frequency of p in the English Wikipedia.",
        "We view the distribution of terms in Wikipedia as domain-independent and define the relative frequency as in Equation 1.",

        "compound nouns) with the highest frel(p) where k is a parameter.",

        "= 0 otherwise.",

        "The two classes in the regression problem are then the top ranked sentences vs. the sentences at rank 2.",
        "Since taking all sentences turned out to be too noisy, we eliminate sentence pairs where the top sentence is better than the second sentence on almost all of the set counts (i.e., count of members of F1, I1, F2, and I2).",
        "Our hypothesis in setting up this regression was that the sentence with the strongest sentiment often does not give a good reason.",

        "The system sentence (SY) contains a similar or different reason.",
        "Since rating reasons is a very subjective task, it is impossible to define which of these two sentences contains the better reason and depends on how the workers think about it.",
        "(1) BL:The best thing is that everything is just so easily displayed and one doesn't need a manual to start getting the work done.",
        "SY: The zoom is incredible, the video was so clear that I actually thought of making a 15 min movie.",
        "(2) BL:The colors are horrible, indoor shots are horrible, and too much noise.",
        "SY: Who cares about 8 mega pixels and 1600 iso when it takes such bad quality pictures.",
        "In example (3) the system sentence is an incomplete sentence consisting of only two noun phrases.",
        "These cut-off sentences are mainly caused by incorrect usage of grammar and punctuation by the reviewers which results in wrongly determined sentence boundaries in the preprocessing step.",
        "(3) BL:Gives peace of mind to have it fit perfectly.",
        "SY: battery and SD card.",
        "In some cases, the two sentences that were presented to the worker in the evaluation had a different polarity.",
        "This can have two reasons: (i) due to noisy training input, the classifier misclassified some of the sentences, and (ii) for short reviews we also used sentences with the nonconforming polarity.",
        "Sentences with different polarity often confused the workers and they tended to prefer the positive sentence even if the negative one contained a more convincing reason as can be seen in example (4).",
        "(4) BL:It shares same basic commands and setup, so the learning curve was minimal.",
        "SY: I was not blown away by the image quality, and as others have mentioned, the flash really is weak.",
        "A general problem with our approach is that the weighting function favors sentences with many noun phrases.",
        "The system sentence in example (5) contains many noun phrases, including some highly frequent nouns (e.g., ?lens?, ?battery?",
        "), but there is no convincing reason and the baseline sentence has been selected by the workers.",
        "(5) BL:I have owned my cd300 for about 3 weeks and have already taken 700 plus pictures.",
        "SY: It has something to do with the lens because the manual says it only happens to the 300 and when I called Sony tech support the guy tried to tell me the battery was faulty and it wasn't.",
        "Finally, there are a number of cases where our assumption that good supporting sentences contain keyphrases is incorrect.",
        "For example, sentence (6) does not contain any keyphrases indicative of good reasons.",
        "The information that makes it a good supporting sentence is mainly expressed using verbs and particles.",
