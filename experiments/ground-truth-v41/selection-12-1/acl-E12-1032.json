        "A particularly popular coherence model is the entity-based local coherence model of Barzilay and Lapata (B&L) (2005; 2008).",
        "This model represents local coherence by transitions, from one sentence to the next, in the grammatical role of references to entities.",
        "It learns a pairwise ranking preference between alternative renderings of a document based on the probability distribution of those transitions.",
        "In particular, B&L associated a lower rank with automatically created permutations of a source document, and learned a model to discriminate an original text from its permutations (see Section 3.1 below).",
        "However, coherence is matter of degree rather than a binary distinction, so a model based only on such pairwise rankings is insufficiently fine-grained and cannot capture the subtle differences in coherence between the permuted documents.",
        "Since the first appearance of B&L's model, several extensions have been proposed (see Section 2.3 below), primarily focusing on modifying or enriching the original feature set by incorporating other document information.",
        "By contrast, we wish to refine the learning procedure in a way such that the resulting model will be able to evaluate coherence on a more fine-grained level.",
        "Specifically, we propose a concise extension to the standard entity-based coherence model by learning not only from the original document and its corresponding permutations but also from ranking preferences among the permutations themselves.",
        "We show that this can be done by assigning a suitable objective score for each permutation indicating its dissimilarity from the original one.",
        "We call this a multiple-rank model since we train our model on a multiple-rank basis, rather than taking the original pairwise ranking approach.",
        "This extension can also be easily combined with other extensions by incorporating their enriched feature sets.",
        "We show that our multiple-rank model outperforms B&L's basic model on two tasks, sentence ordering and summary coherence rating, evaluated on the same datasets as in Barzilay and Lapata (2008).",
        "In sentence ordering, we experiment with different approaches to assigning dissimilarity scores and ranks (Section 5.1.1).",
        "We also experiment with different entity extraction approaches",
        "across three sentences.",
