        "In predicting selectional preferences, a key issue is generalization.",
        "Our DEP baseline simply counts co-occurrences of target and relative words in a corpus to predict selectional preferences, but only for words seen in the corpus.",
        "Prior work, summarized in Table 6, has therefore tried to infer the similarity of unseen relatives to seen relatives.",
        "To illustrate, consider the problem of inducing that the direct objects of celebrate tend to be days or events.",
        "Resnik (1996) combined WordNet with a labeled corpus to model the probability that relatives of a predicate belong to a particular conceptual class.",
        "This method could notice, for example, that the direct objects of celebrate tend to belong to the conceptual class event.",
        "Thus it could prefer anniversary or occasion as the object of celebrate even if unseen in its training corpus.",
        "However, this method depends strongly on the WordNet taxonomy.",
        "Rather than use linguistic resources such as WordNet, Rooth et al(1999) and Wald et al. (2008) induced semantically annotated subcategorization frames from unlabeled corpora.",
        "They modeled semantic classes as hidden variables, which they estimated using EM-based clustering.",
        "Ritter (2010) computed selectional preferences by using unsupervised topic models such as LinkLDA, which infers semantic classes of words automatically instead of requiring a predefined set of classes as input.",
        "The contexts in which a linguistic unit occurs provide information about its meaning.",
        "Erk (2007) and Erk et al(2010) modeled the contexts of a word as the distribution of words that co-occur with it.",
        "They calculated the semantic similarity of two words as the similarity of their context distributions according to various measures.",
        "Erk et al(2010) reported the state-of-the-art method we used as our EPP baseline.",
        "In contrast to prior work that explored various solutions to the generalization problem, we don't so much solve this problem as circumvent it.",
        "Instead of generalizing from a training corpus directly to unseen words, PONG abstracts a word N-gram to a POS N-gram and maps it to the relations that the word N-gram is labeled with.",
        "To compute selectional preferences, whether the words are in the training corpus or not, PONG applies these abstract mappings to word N-grams in the much larger Google N-grams corpus.",
        "Some prior work on selectional preferences has used POS N-grams and a large unlabeled corpus.",
        "The most closely related work we found was by Gormley et al(2011).",
        "They used patterns in POS N-grams to generate test data for their selectional preferences model, but not to infer preferences.",
        "Zhou et al(2011) identified selectional preferences of one word for another",
        "by using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Fano, 1961) to check whether they co-occur more frequently in a large corpus than predicted by their unigram frequencies.",
        "However, their method did not distinguish among different relations."

        "This paper describes, derives, and evaluates PONG, a novel probabilistic model of selectional preferences.",
        "PONG uses a labeled corpus to map POS N-grams to grammatical relations.",
        "It combines this mapping with probabilities estimated from a much larger POS-tagged but unlabeled Google N-grams corpus.",
        "We tested PONG on the eight most common relations in the WSJ corpus, and their inverses ?",
        "more relations than evaluated in prior work.",
        "Compared to the state-of-the-art EPP baseline (Erk et al. 2010), PONG averaged higher precision but lower coverage and recall.",
        "Compared to the DEP baseline, PONG averaged lower precision but higher coverage and recall.",
        "All these differences were substantial (p < 0.001).",
        "Compared to both baselines, PONG's average F-score was higher, though not significantly.",
        "Some directions for future work include: First, improve PONG by incorporating models of lexical similarity explored in prior work.",
        "Second, use the universal tag set to extend PONG to other languages, or to perform better in English.",
        "Third, in place of grammatical relations, use rich, diverse semantic roles, while avoiding sparsity.",
        "Finally, use selectional preferences to teach word connotations by using various relations to generate example sentences or useful questions."
