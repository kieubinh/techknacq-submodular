        "Kernel methods are considered the most effective techniques for various relation extraction (RE) tasks on both general (e.g. newspaper text) and specialized (e.g. biomedical text) domains.",
        "In particular, as the importance of syntactic structures for deriving the relationships between entities in text has been growing, several graph and tree kernels have been designed and experimented.",
        "Early RE approaches more or less fall in one of the following categories: (i) exploitation of statistics about co-occurrences of entities, (ii) usage of patterns and rules, and (iii) usage of flat features to train machine learning (ML) classifiers.",
        "These approaches have been studied for a long period and have their own pros and cons.",
        "Exploitation of co-occurrence statistics results in high recall but low precision, while rule or pattern based approaches can increase precision but suffer from low recall.",
        "Flat feature based ML approaches employ various kinds of linguistic, syntactic or contextual information and integrate them into the feature space.",
        "They obtain relatively good results but are hindered by drawbacks of limited feature space and excessive feature engineering.",
        "Kernel based approaches have become an attractive alternative solution, as they can exploit huge amount of features without an explicit representation.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new hybrid kernel for RE.",
        "We apply the kernel to Protein?protein interaction (PPI) extraction, the most widely researched topic in biomedical relation extraction.",
        "PPI1 information is very critical in understanding biological processes.",
        "Considerable progress has been made for this task.",
        "Nevertheless, empirical results of previous studies show that none of the approaches already known in the literature is consistently better than other approaches when evaluated on different benchmark PPI corpora (see Table 4).",
        "This demands further study and innovation 1PPIs occur when two or more proteins bind together, and are integral to virtually all cellular processes, such as metabolism, signalling, regulation, and proliferation (Tikk et al. 2010).",
        "of new approaches that are sensitive to the variations of complex linguistic constructions.",
        "The proposed hybrid kernel is the composition of one tree kernel and two feature based kernels (one of them is already known in the literature and the other is proposed in this paper for the first time).",
        "The novelty of the newly proposed feature based kernel is that it envisages to accommodate the advantages of pattern based approaches.",
        "More precisely: 1.",
        "We propose a new feature based kernel (details in Section 4.1) by using syntactic dependency patterns, trigger words, negative cues, regular expression (henceforth, regex) patterns and walk features (i.e. e-walks and v-walks)2.",
        "2.",
        "The syntactic dependency patterns are automatically collected from a type of dependency subgraph (we call it reduced graph, more details in Section 4.1.1) during runtime.",
        "3.",
        "We only use the regex patterns, trigger words and negative cues mentioned in the literature (Ono et al. 2001; Fundel et al. 2007; Bui et al., 2010).",
        "The objective is to verify whether we can exploit knowledge which is already known and used.",
        "4.",
        "We propose a hybrid kernel by combining the proposed feature based kernel (outlined above) with the Shallow Linguistic (SL) kernel (Giuliano et al. 2006) and the Path-enclosed Tree (PET) kernel (Moschitti, 2004).",
        "The aim of our work is to take advantage of different types of information (i.e., dependency patterns, regex patterns, trigger words, negative cues, syntactic dependencies among words and constituent parse trees) and their different representations (i.e. flat features, tree structures and graphs) which can complement each other to learn more accurate models.",
        "2The syntactic dependencies of the words of a sentence create a dependency graph.",
        "A v-walk feature consists of (wordi ?",
        "dependency typei,i+1 ?",
        "wordi+1), and an e-walk feature is composed of (dependency typei?1,i ?",
        "wordi ?",
        "dependency typei,i+1).",
        "Note that, in a dependency graph, the words are nodes while the dependency types are edges.",

        "Section 3 lists the datasets.",
        "Then, in Section 4, we define our proposed hybrid kernel and describe its individual component kernels.",
        "Section 5 outlines the experimental settings.",

        "Their presence inside a pattern might make it unnecessarily rigid and less general.",

        "For the work reported in this paper, we used the dependency patterns as they are initially constructed.",
        "We also did experiments to see whether collecting features for trigger words from the whole reduced graph would help.",
        "But that also decreased performance.",
        "This suggests that trigger words are more likely to appear in the least common governors."

        "In this paper, we have proposed a new hybrid kernel for RE that combines two vector based kernels and a tree kernel.",
        "The proposed kernel outperforms any of the exiting approaches by a wide margin on the BioInfer corpus, the largest PPI benchmark corpus available.",
        "On the other four smaller benchmark corpora, it performs either better or almost as good as the existing state-of-the art approaches.",
        "We have also proposed a novel feature based kernel, called TPWF kernel, using (automatically collected) dependency patterns, trigger words, negative cues, walk features and regular expression patterns.",
        "The TPWF kernel is used as a component of the new hybrid kernel.",
        "Empirical results show that the proposed hybrid kernel achieves considerably higher precision than the existing approaches, which indicates its capability of learning more accurate models.",
        "This also demonstrates that the different types of information that we use are able to complement each other for relation extraction.",
        "We believe there are at least three ways to further improve the proposed approach.",
        "First of all, the 22 regular expression patterns (collected from Ono et al(2001) and Bui et al. (2010)) are applied at the level of the sentences and this sometimes produces unwanted matches.",
        "For example, consider the sentence ?X activates Y and inhibits Z?",
        "where X, Y, and Z are entities.",
        "The pattern ?Entity1.",
        "?",
        "activates.",
        "?Entity2?",
        "matches both the X?Y and X?Z pairs in the sentence.",
        "But only the X?Y pair should be considered.",
        "So, the patterns should be constrained to reduce the number of unwanted matches.",
        "For example, they could be applied on smaller linguistic units than full sentences.",
        "Secondly, different techniques could be used to identify less-informative syntactic dependencies inside dependency patterns to make them more accurate and effective.",
        "Thirdly, usage of automatically collected paraphrases of regular expression patterns instead of the patterns directly could be also helpful.",
        "Weakly supervised collection of paraphrases for RE has been already investigated (e.g. Romano et al(2006)) and, hence, can be tried for improving the TPWF kernel (which is a component of the proposed hybrid kernel)."
