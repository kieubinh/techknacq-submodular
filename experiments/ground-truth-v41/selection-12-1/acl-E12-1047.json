        "Discontinuity in constituent structures (cf. figure 1 & 2) is important for a variety of reasons.",
        "For one, it allows a tight correspondence between syntax and semantics by letting constituent structure express argument structure (Skut et al. 1997).",
        "Other reasons are phenomena such as extraposition and word-order freedom, which arguably require discontinuous annotations to be treated systematically in phrase-structures (McCawley, 1982; Levy, 2005).",
        "Empirical investigations demonstrate that discontinuity is present in non-negligible amounts: around 30% of sentences contain discontinuity in two German treebanks (Maier and S?gaard, 2008; Maier and Lichte, 2009).",
        "Recent work on treebank parsing with discontinuous constituents (Kallmeyer and Maier, 2010; Maier, 2010; Evang and Kallmeyer, 2011; van Cranenburgh et al. 2011) shows that it is feasible to directly parse discontinuous constituency annotations, as given in the German Negra (Skut et al",

        "However, the computational complexity is such that until now, the length of sentences needed to be restricted.",
        "In the case of Kallmeyer and Maier (2010) and Evang and Kallmeyer (2011) the limit was 25 words.",
        "Maier (2010) and van Cranenburgh et al(2011) manage to parse up to 30 words with heuristics and optimizations, but no further.",
        "Algorithms have been suggested to binarize the grammars in such a way as to minimize parsing complexity, but the current paper shows that these techniques are not sufficient to parse longer sentences.",
        "Instead, this work presents a novel form of coarse-to-fine parsing which does alleviate this limitation.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, we introduce linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS).",
        "Next, we discuss and evaluate binarization strategies for LCFRS.",
        "Third, we present a technique for approximating an LCFRS by a PCFG in a coarse-to-fine framework.",

        "Furthermore, they can be used to parse dependency structures (Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).",
        "Since LCFRS subsumes various synchronous grammars, they are also important for machine translation.",

        "As all mildly context-sensitive formalisms, LCFRS are parsable in polynomial time, where the degree depends on the productions of the grammar.",
        "Intuitively, LCFRS can be seen as a generalization of context-free grammars to rewriting other objects than just continuous strings: productions are context-free, but instead of strings they can rewrite tuples, trees or graphs.",
        "We focus on the use of LCFRS for parsing with discontinuous constituents.",
        "This follows up on recent work on parsing the discontinuous annotations in German corpora with LCFRS (Maier, 2010; van Cranenburgh et al. 2011) and work on parsing the Wall Street journal corpus in which traces have been converted to discontinuous constituents (Evang and Kallmeyer, 2011).",
