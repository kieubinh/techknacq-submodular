      "text": [
        "Much of the work in natural language processing relies on intrinsic evaluation: computing standard evaluation metrics such as precision, recall and F-score on the same data set to compare the performance of different approaches to the same NLP problem.",
        "However, once a component, such as a parser, is included in a larger system, it is not always clear that improvements in intrinsic evaluation scores will translate into improved overall system performance.",
        "Therefore, extrinsic or task-based evaluation can be used to complement intrinsic evaluations.",
        "For example, NLP components such as parsers and co-reference resolution algorithms could be compared in terms of how much they contribute to the performance of a textual entailment (RTE) system (Sammons et al., 2010; Yuret et al. 2010); parser performance could be evaluated by how well it contributes to an information retrieval task (Miyao et al. 2008).",
        "However, task-based evaluation can be difficult and expensive for interactive applications.",
        "Specifically, task-based evaluation for dialogue systems typically involves collecting data from a number of people interacting with the system, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.",
        "Thus, it is desirable to develop an off-line evaluation procedure that relates intrinsic evaluation metrics to predicted interaction outcomes, reducing the need to conduct experiments with human participants.",
        "This problem can be addressed via the use of the PARADISE evaluation methodology for spoken dialogue systems (Walker et al. 2000).",
        "In a PARADISE study, after an initial data collection with users, a performance function is created to predict an outcome metric (e.g., user satisfaction) which can normally only be measured through user surveys.",
        "Typically, a multiple linear regression is used to fit a predictive model of the desired metric based on the values of interaction parameters that can be derived from system logs without additional user studies (e.g., dialogue length, word error rate, number of misunderstandings).",
        "PARADISE models have been used extensively in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems to establish which components of the system most need improvement, with user satisfaction as the outcome metric (Mo?ller et al. 2007; Mo?ller et al. 2008; Walker et al. 2000; Larsen, 2003).",
        "In tutorial dialogue, PARADISE studies investigated",
        "which manually annotated features predict learning outcomes, to justify new features needed in the system (Forbes-Riley et al. 2007; Rotaru and Litman, 2006; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006).",
        "We adapt the PARADISE methodology to evaluating individual NLP components, linking commonly used intrinsic evaluation scores with extrinsic outcome metrics.",
        "We describe an evaluation of an interpretation component of a tutorial dialogue system, with student learning gain as the target outcome measure.",
        "We first describe the evaluation setup, which uses standard classification accuracy metrics for system evaluation (Section 2).",
        "We discuss the results of the intrinsic system evaluation in Section 3.",
        "We then show that standard evaluation metrics do not serve as good predictors of system performance for the system we evaluated.",
        "However, adding confusion matrix features improves the predictive model (Section 4).",
        "We argue that in practical applications such predictive metrics should be used alongside standard metrics for component evaluations, to better predict how different components will perform in the context of a specific task.",
        "We demonstrate how this technique can help differentiate the output quality between a majority class baseline, the system's output, and the output of a new classifier we trained on our data (Section 5).",
        "Finally, we discuss some limitations and possible extensions to this approach (Section 6)."

        "In this paper, we proposed an approach for cost-sensitive evaluation of language interpretation within practical applications.",
        "Our approach is based on the PARADISE methodology for dialogue system evaluation (Walker et al. 2000).",
        "We followed the typical pattern of a PARADISE study, but instead of relying on a variety of features that characterize the interaction, we used scores that reflect only the performance of the interpretation component.",
        "For BEETLE II we could build regression models that account for nearly 50% variance in the desired outcomes, on par with models reported in earlier PARADISE studies (Mo?ller et al. 2007; Mo?ller et al. 2008; Walker et al. 2000; Larsen, 2003).",
        "More importantly, we demonstrated that combining averaged scores with features based on confusion frequencies improves prediction quality and allows us to see differences between systems which are not obvious from the scores alone.",
        "Previous work on task-based evaluation of NLP components used RTE or information extraction as target tasks (Sammons et al. 2010; Yuret et al. 2010; Miyao et al. 2008), based on standard corpora.",
        "We specifically targeted applications which involve human-computer interaction, where running task-based evaluations is particularly expen",
        "sive, and building a predictive model of system performance can simplify system development.",
        "Our evaluation data limited the set of features that we could use in our models.",
        "For most confusion features, there were not enough instances in the data to build a model that would reliably predict learning gain for those cases.",
        "One way to solve this problem would be to conduct a user study in which the system simulates random errors appearing some of the time.",
        "This could provide the data needed for more accurate models.",
        "The general pattern we observed in our data is that a model based on F-scores alone predicts only a small proportion of the variance.",
        "If a full set of metrics (including F-score, precision and recall) is used, linear regression derives a more complex equation, with different weights for precision and recall.",
        "Instead of the linear model, we may consider using a model based on F?",
        "score, F?",
        "= (1 + ?2) PR?2P+R , and fitting it to the data to derive the ?",
        "weight rather than using the standard F1 score.",
        "We plan to investigate this in the future.",
        "Our method would apply to a wide range of systems.",
        "It can be used straightforwardly with many current spoken dialogue systems which rely on classifiers to support language understanding in domains such as call routing and technical support (Gupta et al. 2006; Acomb et al. 2007).",
        "We applied it to a system that outputs more complex logical forms, but we showed that we could simplify its output to a set of labels which still allowed us to make informed decisions.",
        "Similar simplifications could be derived for other systems based on domain-specific dialogue acts typically used in dialogue management.",
        "For slot-based systems, it may be useful to consider concept accuracy for recognizing individual slot values.",
        "Finally, for tutoring systems it is possible to annotate the answers on a more fine-grained level.",
        "Nielsen et al(2008) proposed an annotation scheme based on the output of a dependency parser, and trained a classifier to identify individual dependencies as ?expressed?, ?contradicted?",
        "or ?unaddressed?.",
        "Their system could be evaluated using the same approach.",
        "The specific formulas we derived are not likely to be highly generalizable.",
        "It is a well-known limitation of PARADISE evaluations that models built based on one system often do not perform well when applied to different systems (Mo?ller et al., 2008).",
        "But using them to compare implementation variants during the system development, without rerunning user evaluations, can provide important information, as we illustrated with an example of evaluating a new classifier we built for our interpretation task.",
        "Moreover, the confusion frequency feature that our models picked is consistent with earlier results from a different tutoring domain (see Section 4.2).",
        "Thus, these models could provide a starting point when making system development choices, which can then be confirmed by user evaluations in new domains.",
        "The models we built do not fully account for the variance in the training data.",
        "This is expected, since interpretation performance is not the only factor influencing the objective outcome: other factors, such choosing the the appropriate tutoring strategy, are also important.",
        "Similar models could be built for other system components to account for their contribution to the variance.",
        "Finally, we could consider using different learning algorithms.",
        "Mo?ller et al(2008) examined decision trees and neural networks in addition to multiple linear regression for predicting user satisfaction in spoken dialogue.",
        "They found that neural networks had the best prediction performance for their task.",
        "We plan to explore other learning algorithms for this task as part of our future work."

        "In this paper, we described an evaluation of an interpretation component of a tutorial dialogue system using predictive models that link intrinsic evaluation scores with learning outcomes.",
        "We showed that adding features based on confusion frequencies for individual classes significantly improves the prediction.",
        "This approach can be used to compare different implementations of language interpretation components, and to decide which option to use, based on the predicted improvement in a task-specific target outcome metric trained on previous evaluation data."
