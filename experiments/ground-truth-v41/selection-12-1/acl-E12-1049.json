        "We present a set of experiments into classifying Twitter messages into the six basic emotion classes of (Ekman, 1972).",
        "The motivation behind this work is twofold: firstly, to investigate the possibility of detecting emotions of multiple classes (rather than purely positive or negative sentiment) in such short texts; and secondly, to investigate the use of distant supervision to quickly bootstrap large datasets and classifiers without the need for manual annotation.",
        "Text classification according to emotion and sentiment is a well-established research area.",
        "In this and other areas of text analysis and classification, recent years have seen a rise in use of data from online sources and social media, as these provide very large, often freely available datasets (see e.g. (Eisenstein et al. 2010; Go et al. 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010) amongst many others).",
        "However, one of the challenges this poses is that of data annotation: given very large amounts of data, often consisting of very short texts, written in unconventional style and without accompanying metadata, audio/video signals or access to the author for disambiguation, how can we easily produce a gold-standard labelling for training and/or for evaluation and test?",
        "One possible solution that is becoming popular is crowd-sourcing the labelling task, as the easy access to very large numbers of annotators provided by tools such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk can help with the problem of dataset size; however, this has its own attendant problems of annotator reliability (see e.g. (Hsueh et al. 2009)), and cannot directly help with the inherent problem of ambiguity ?",
        "using many annotators does not guarantee that they can understand or correctly assign the author's intended interpretation or emotional state.",
        "In this paper, we investigate a different approach via distant supervision (see e.g. (Mintz et al. 2009)).",
        "By using conventional markers of emotional content within the texts themselves as a surrogate for explicit labels, we can quickly retrieve large subsets of (noisily) labelled data.",
        "This approach has the advantage of giving us direct access to the authors?",
        "own intended interpretation or emotional state, without relying on third-party annotators.",
        "Of course, the labels themselves may be noisy: ambiguous, vague or not having a direct correspondence with the desired classification.",
        "We therefore experiment with multiple such conventions with apparently similar meanings ?",
        "here, emoticons (following (Read, 2005)) and Twitter hashtags ?",
        "allowing us to examine the similarity of classifiers trained on independent labels but intended to detect the same underlying class.",
        "We also investigate the precision and correspondence of particular labels with the desired emotion classes by testing on a small set of man",
        "ually labelled data.",
        "We show that the success of this approach depends on both the conventional markers chosen and the emotion classes themselves.",
        "Some emotions are both reliably marked by different conventions and distinguishable from other emotions; this seems particularly true for happiness, sadness and anger, indicating that this approach can provide not only the basic distinction required for sentiment analysis but some more finer-grained information.",
        "Others are either less distinguishable from short text messages, or less reliably marked."

        "see e.g. (Pang and Lee, 2008)).",
        "We are interested in emotion detection: classifying subjective texts according to a finer-grained classification of the emotions they convey, and thus providing richer and more informative data for social media analysis than simple positive/negative sentiment.",

(2008) used neural networks for an 8-way classification (hope, love, thank, neutral, happy, sad, fear, anger) and achieved per-class accuracies of 45% to 65%.",
        "Chuang and Wu (2004) used supervised classifiers (SVMs) and manually defined keyword features over a seven-way classification consisting of the same six-class taxonomy plus a neutral category, and achieved an average accuracy of 65.5%, varying from 56% for disgust to 74% for anger.",

        "This approach has been exploited in several ways in recent work; Tanaka et al(2005) used Japanese-style emoticons as classification labels, and Go et al(2009) and Pak and Paroubek (2010) used Western-style emoticons to label and classify Twitter messages according to positive and negative sentiment, using traditional supervised classification methods.",

        "The approach shows reasonable performance at individual emotion label prediction, for both emoticons and hashtags.",
        "For some emotions (happiness, sadness and anger), performance across label conventions (training on one, and testing on the other) is encouraging; for these classes, performance on those manually labelled examples where annotators agree is also reasonable.",
        "This gives us confidence not only that the approach produces reliable classifiers which can predict the labels, but that these classifiers are actually detecting the desired underlying emotional classes,",
        "without requiring manual annotation.",
        "We therefore plan to pursue this approach with a view to improving performance by investigating training with combined mixed-convention datasets, and cross-training between classifiers trained on separate conventions.",
        "However, this cross-convention performance is much better for some emotions (happiness, sadness and anger) than others (fear, surprise and disgust).",
        "Indications are that the poor performance on these latter emotion classes is to a large degree an effect of ambiguity or vagueness of the emoticon and hashtag conventions we have used as labels here; we therefore intend to investigate other conventions with more specific and/or less ambiguous meanings, and the combination of multiple conventions to provide more accurately/specifically labelled data.",
        "Another possibility might be to investigate approaches to analyse emoticons semantically on the basis of their shape, or use features of such an analysis ?",
        "see (Ptaszynski et al. 2010; Radulovic and Milikic, 2009) for some interesting recent work in this direction."
