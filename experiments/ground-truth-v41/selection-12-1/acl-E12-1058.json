        "Part of an investigation is a patent portfolio comparison between one or more competitors (Lupu et al. 2011).",
        "Within all tasks recall is preferred over precision, a fact which distinguishes patent search from general web search.",
        "This retrieval constraint has produced a variety of sophisticated approaches tailored to the patent domain: citation analysis (Magdy and Jones, 2010), the learning of section-specific retrieval models (Lopez and Romary, 2010), and automated query generation (Xue and Croft, 2009).",
        "Each approach improves retrieval performance, but what keeps them from attaining maximum effectiveness in terms of recall are the inconsistencies found in patents: incomplete citation sets, incorrectly assigned classification codes, and, not least, spelling errors.",
        "Our paper deals with spelling errors in an obligatory and important field of each patent, namely, the patent assignee name.",
        "Bibliographic fields are widely used among professional patent searchers in order to constrain keyword-based search sessions (Joho et al. 2010).",
        "The assignee name is particularly helpful for patentability searches and portfolio analyses since it determines the company holding the patent.",
        "Patent experts address these search tasks by formulating queries containing the company name in question, in the hope of finding all patents owned by that company.",
        "A formal and more precise description of this relevant search task is as follows: Given a query q which specifies a company, and a set D of patents, determine the set Dq ?",
        "D comprised of all patents held by the respective company.",
        "For this purpose, all assignee names in the patents in D should be analyzed.",

        "While the trivial expansion of q by the entire set A ensures maximum recall but entails an unacceptable precision, the expansion of q by the empty set yields a reasonable baseline.",
        "The latter approach is implemented in patent search engines such as PatBase1 or FreePatentsOnline,2 which return all patents where the company name q occurs as a substring of the assignee name a.",
        "This baseline is simple but reasonable; due to trademark law, a company name q must be a unique identifier (i.e. a key), and an assignee name a that contains q can be considered as relevant.",

        "The difference of 0.17 to a perfect recall can be addressed by considering query expansion techniques.",
        "If the trivial expansion A is applied to the task the maximum recall can be achieved, which, however, 4We use the implementation of the WEKA toolkit with default parameters.",
        "is bought with precision close to zero.",
        "Using the edit distance expansion A+q yields a precision of 0.274 while keeping the recall at maximum.",
        "Finally, the machine learning expansion A?q leads to a dramatic improvement (cf. Table 5, bottom lines), whereas the exploitation of patent meta-features significantly outperforms the exclusive use of orthography-related features; the increase in recall which is achieved by A?q is statistically significant (matched pair t-test) for both tasks (assignee names task: t = ?7.6856, df = 99, p = 0.00; patents task: t = ?2.1113, df = 99, p = 0.037).",
        "Note that when being applied as a single feature none of the spelling metrics (Levenshtein, SoftTfIdf, Soundex) is able to achieve a recall close to 1 without significantly impairing the precision."

      "text": [
        "Encouraged by the promising retrieval results achieved on the Webis-PRA-12 corpus, we extend the analysis of spelling errors in patents to the entire USPTO corpus of granted patents between 2001 and 2010.",
        "The analysis focuses on the following two research questions: 1.",
        "Are spelling errors an increasing issue in patents?",
        "According to Adams (2010), the amount of spelling errors should have been increased in the last years due to the electronic patent filing process (cf.",
        "Section 1.2).",
        "We address this hypothesis by analyzing the distribution of spelling errors in company names that occur in patents granted between 2001 and 2010.",
        "2.",
        "Are misspellings introduced deliberately in patents?",
        "We address this question by analyzing the patents with respect to the eight technological areas based on the International Patent Classification scheme IPC: A (Human necessities), B (Performing operations; transporting), C (Chemistry; metallurgy), D (Textiles; paper), E (Fixed constructions), F (Mechanical engineering; lighting; heating; weapons; blasting), G (Physics), and H (Electricity).",
        "If spelling errors are introduced accidentally, then we expect them to be uniformly distributed across all areas.",
        "A biased distribution, on the other hand, indicates that errors might be inserted deliberately.",
        "In the following, we compile a second corpus on the basis of the entire set A of assignee names.",
        "In order to yield a uniform distribution of the companies across years, technological areas and countries, a set of 120 assignee names is extracted for each dimension.",
        "After the removal of duplicates, we revised these assignee names manually in order to check (and correct) their spelling.",
        "Finally, trailing business suffixes are removed, which results in a set of 3 110 company names.",
        "For each company name q, we generate the set A?q as described in Section 3.",
        "The results of our analysis are shown in Table 6.",
        "Table 6(a) refers to the first research question and shows that the amount of misspellings in companies decreased over the years from 6.67% in 2001 to 4.74% in 2010 (cf. Row 3).",
        "These results let us reject the hypothesis of Adams (2010).",
        "Nevertheless, the analysis provides evidence that spelling errors are still an issue.",
        "For example, the company identified with most spelling errors are ?Konin-klijke Philips Electronics?",
        "with 45 misspellings in 2008, and ?Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique?",
        "with 28 misspellings in 2009.",
        "The results are consistent with our findings with re",
        "errors per company identifier and the standard deviation ?",
        "refer to companies with misspellings.",
        "The last row in each table shows the number of patents that are additionally found if the original query q is expanded by A?q .",
        "spect to the Fortune 500 sample (cf. Table 4), where company names that are longer and presumably more difficult to write contain more spelling errors.",
        "In contrast to the uniform distribution of misspellings over the years, the situation with regard to the technological areas is different (cf. Table 6(b)).",
        "Most companies are associated with the IPC sections G and B, which both refer to technical domains (cf. Table 6(b), Row 1).",
        "The percentage of misspellings in these sections increased compared to the spelling errors grouped by year.",
        "A significant difference can be seen for the sections D and E. Here, the number of assigned companies drops below 450 and the percentage of misspellings decreases significantly from about 6% to 2.5%.",
        "These findings might support the hypothesis that spelling errors are inserted deliberately in technical domains."

      "text": [
        "While researchers in the patent domain concentrate on retrieval models and algorithms to improve the search performance, the original aspect of our paper is that it points to a different (and orthogonal) research avenue: the analysis of patent inconsistencies.",
        "With the analysis of spelling errors in assignee names we made a first yet considerable contribution in this respect; searches with assignee constraints become a more sensible operation.",
        "We showed how a special treatment of spelling errors can significantly raise the effectiveness of patent search.",
        "The identification of this untapped potential, but also the utilization of machine learning to combine patent features with typography, form our main contributions.",
        "Our current research broadens the application of a patent spelling analysis.",
        "In order to identify errors that are introduced deliberately we investigate different types of misspellings (edit distance versus phonological).",
        "Finally, we consider the analysis of acquisition histories of companies as promising research direction: since acquired companies often own granted patents, these patents should be considered while searching for the company in question in order to further increase the recall."
