        "Microblogging websites such as Twitter offer a wealth of insight into a population's current mood.",
        "Automated approaches to identify general sentiment toward a particular topic often perform two steps: Topic Identification and Sentiment Analysis.",
        "Topic Identification first identifies tweets that are relevant to a desired topic (e.g., a politician or event), and Sentiment Analysis extracts each tweet's attitude toward the topic.",
        "Many techniques for Topic Identification simply involve selecting tweets using a keyword search.",
        "Here, we present an approach that instead uses distant supervision to train a classifier on the tweets returned by the search.",
        "We show that distant supervision leads to improved performance in the Topic Identification task as well in the downstream Sentiment Analysis stage.",
        "We then use a system that incorporates distant supervision into both stages to analyze the sentiment toward President Obama expressed in a dataset of tweets.",

        "Social networks and blogs contain a wealth of data about how the general public views products, campaigns, events, and people.",
        "Automated algorithms can use this data to provide instant feedback on what people are saying about a topic.",
        "Two challenges in building such algorithms are (1) identifying topic-relevant posts, and (2) identifying the attitude of each post toward the topic.",
        "This paper studies distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) as a solution to both challenges.",
        "We apply our approach to the problem of predicting Presidential Job Approval polls from Twitter data, and we present results that improve on previous work in this area.",
        "We also present a novel baseline that performs remarkably well without using topic identification.",
        "Topic identification is the task of identifying text that discusses a topic of interest.",
        "Most previous work on microblogs uses simple keyword searches to find topic-relevant tweets on the assumption that short tweets do not need more sophisticated processing.",
        "For instance, searches for the name ?Obama?",
        "have been assumed to return a representative set of tweets about the U.S. President (O?Connor et al. 2010).",
        "One of the main contributions of this paper is to show that keyword search can lead to noisy results, and that the same keywords can instead be used in a distantly supervised framework to yield improved performance.",
        "Distant supervision uses noisy signals in text as positive labels to train classifiers.",
        "For instance, the token ?Obama?",
        "can be used to identify a series of tweets that discuss U.S. President Barack Obama.",
        "Although searching for token matches can return false positives, using the resulting tweets as positive training examples provides supervision from a distance.",
        "This paper experiments with several diverse sets of keywords to train distantly supervised classifiers for topic identification.",
        "We evaluate each classifier on a hand-labeled dataset of political and apolitical tweets, and demonstrate an improvement in F1 score over simple keyword search (.39 to .90 in the best case).",
        "We also make available the first labeled dataset for topic identification in politics to encourage future work.",
        "Sentiment analysis encompasses a broad field of research, but most microblog work focuses on two moods: positive and negative sentiment.",
        "Algorithms to identify these moods range from matching words in a sentiment lexicon to training classifiers with a hand-labeled corpus.",
        "Since la-beling corpora is expensive, recent work on Twitter uses emoticons (i.e., ASCII smiley faces such as :-( and :-)) as noisy labels in tweets for distant supervision (Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Davidov et al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al. 2011).",
        "This paper presents new analysis of the downstream effects of topic identification on sentiment classifiers and their application to political forecasting.",
        "Interest in measuring the political mood of a country has recently grown (O?Connor et al. 2010; Tumasjan et al. 2010; Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2010; Carvalho et al. 2011; Tan et al. 2011).",
        "Here we compare our sentiment results to Presidential Job Approval polls and show that the sentiment scores produced by our system are positively correlated with both the Approval and Disapproval job ratings.",
        "In this paper we present a method for coupling two distantly supervised algorithms for topic identification and sentiment classification on Twitter.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our approach to topic identification and present a new annotated corpus of political tweets for future study.",
        "In Section 5, we apply distant supervision to sentiment analysis.",

        "The most straightforward approach to sentiment analysis is using a sentiment lexicon to label tweets based on how many sentiment words appear.",
        "This approach tends to be used by applications that measure the general mood of a population.",
        "O?Connor et al(2010) use a ratio of positive and negative word counts on Twitter, Kramer (2010) counts lexicon words on Facebook, and Thelwall (2011) uses the publicly available Sen-tiStrength algorithm to make weighted counts of keywords based on predefined polarity strengths.",
        "In contrast to lexicons, many approaches instead focus on ways to train supervised classifiers.",
        "However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al. 2011).",
        "Instead, distant supervision has grown in popularity.",
        "These algorithms use emoticons to serve as semantic indicators for sentiment.",
        "For instance, a sad face (e.g., :-() serves as a noisy label for a negative mood.",
        "Read (2005) was the first to suggest emoticons for UseNet data, followed by Go et al(Go et al. 2009) on Twitter, and many others since (Bifet and Frank, 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Davidov et al. 2010; Kouloumpis et al. 2011).",
        "Hashtags (e.g., #cool and #happy) have also been used as noisy sentiment labels (Davidov et al. 2010; Kouloumpis et al. 2011).",
        "Finally, multiple models can be blended into a single classifier (Barbosa and Feng, 2010).",
        "Here, we adopt the emoticon algorithm for sentiment analysis, and evaluate it on a specific domain (politics).",
        "Topic identification in Twitter has received much less attention than sentiment analysis.",
        "The majority of approaches simply select a single keyword (e.g., ?Obama?)",
        "to represent their topic (e.g., ?US President?)",
        "and retrieve all tweets that contain the word (O?Connor et al. 2010; Tumasjan et al. 2010; Tan et al. 2011).",
        "The underlying assumption is that the keyword is precise, and due to the vast number of tweets, the search will return a large enough dataset to measure sentiment toward that topic.",
        "In this work, we instead use a distantly supervised system similar in spirit to those recently applied to sentiment analysis.",
        "Finally, we evaluate the approaches presented in this paper on the domain of politics.",

        "Our results (Table 2) show that distant supervision avoids a negative correlation with Approval, but the ratio hides this important advantage.",
        "One reason the ratio may mask the negative Approval correlation is because tweets are often classified as both positive and negative by a lexicon (Section 5.1).",

        "However, further experimentation did not rectify this pattern.",

        "First, this work is one of the first to evaluate distant supervision for topic identification.",
        "All five political classifiers outperformed the lexicon-driven keyword equivalent that has been widely used in the past.",
        "Our model achieved .90 F1 compared to the keyword .39 F1 on our political tweet dataset.",
        "On twitter as a whole, distant supervision increased F1 by over 100%.",
        "The results also suggest that performance is relatively insensitive to the specific choice of seed keywords that are used to select the training set for the political classifier.",
        "Second, the sentiment analysis experiments build upon what has recently been shown in the literature: distant supervision with emoticons is a valuable methodology.",
        "We also expand upon prior work by discovering drastic performance differences between positive and negative lexicon words.",
        "The OpinionFinder lexicon failed to correlate (inversely) with Gallup's Approval polls, whereas a distantly trained classifier correlated strongly with both Approval and Disapproval (Pearson's .71 and .73).",
        "We only tested OpinionFinder and SentiStrength, so it is possible that another lexicon might perform better.",
        "However, our results suggest that lexicons vary in their quality across sentiment, and distant supervision may provide more robustness.",
        "Third, our results outperform previous work on Presidential Job Approval prediction (O?Connor et al. 2010).",
        "We presented two novel approaches to the domain: a coupled distantly supervised system, and a topic-neutral baseline, both of which outperform previous results.",
        "In fact, the baseline surprisingly matches or outperforms the more sophisticated approaches that use topic identification.",
        "The baseline correlates .69 with Approval and .74 with Disapproval.",
        "This suggests a new baseline that should be used in all topic-specific sentiment applications.",
        "Fourth, we described and made available two new annotated datasets of political tweets to facilitate future work in this area.",
        "Finally, Twitter users are not a representative sample of the U.S. population, yet the high correlation between political sentiment on Twitter and Gallup ratings makes these results all the more intriguing for polling methodologies.",
        "Our specific 7-month period of time differs from previous work, and thus we hesitate to draw strong conclusions from our comparisons or to extend implications to non-political domains.",
        "Future work should further investigate distant supervision as a tool to assist topic detection in microblogs."
