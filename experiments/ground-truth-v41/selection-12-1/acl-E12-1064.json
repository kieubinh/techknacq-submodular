        "In this paper, we have studied the distinction between formal and information (T/V) address, which is not expressed overtly through pronoun choice or morphosyntactic marking in modern English.",
        "Our hypothesis was that the T/V distinction can be recovered in English nevertheless.",
        "Our manual annotation study has shown that annotators can in fact tag monolingual English sentences as T or V with reasonable accuracy, but only if they have sufficient context.",
        "We exploited the overt information from German pronouns to induce T/V labels for English and used this labeled corpus to train a monolingual T/V classifier for English.",
        "We experimented with features based on words, semantic classes, and Politeness Theory predictions.",
        "With regard to our NLP goal of building a T/V classifier, we conclude that T/V classification is a phenomenon that can be modelled on the basis of corpus features.",
        "A major factor in classification performance is the inclusion of a wide context to counteract sparse data, and more sophisticated context definitions improve results.",
        "We currently achieve top accuracies of 67%-68%, which still leave room for improvement.",
        "We next plan to couple our T/V classifier with a machine translation system for a task-based evaluation on the translation of direct address into German and other languages with different T/V pronouns.",
        "Considering our sociolinguistic goal of determining the ways in which English realizes the T/V distinction, we first obtained a negative result: only word features perform well, while semantic classes and politeness features do hardly better than a frequency baseline.",
        "Notably, there are no clear ?topical?",
        "divisions between T and V, like for example in text categorization: almost all words are very weakly correlated with either class, and semantically similar words can co-occur with different classes.",
        "Consequently, distributionally determined semantic classes are not helpful for the distinction.",
        "Politeness features are difficult to operationalize with sufficiently high precision and recall.",
        "An interesting result is the asymmetry between the linguistic features for V and T at the lexical level.",
        "V language appears to be more conventionalized; the models therefore identified formulaic expressions and titles as indicators for V. On the other hand, very few such generic features exist for the class T; consequently, the classifier has a hard time learning good discriminating and yet generic features.",
        "Those features that are indicative of T, such as first names, are highly novel-specific and were deliberately excluded from the main experiment.",
        "When we switched to individual novels, the models picked up such features, and accuracy increased ?",
        "at the cost of lower generalizability between novels.",
        "A more technical solution to this problem would be the training of a single-class classifier for V, treating T as the ?default?",
        "class (Tax and Duin, 1999).",
        "Finally, an error analysis showed that many errors arise from sentences that are too short or unspecific to determine T or V reliably.",
        "This points to the fact that T/V should not be modelled as a sentence-level classification task in the first place: T/V is not a choice made for each sentence, but one that is determined once for each pair of interlocutors and rarely changed.",
        "In future work, we will attempt to learn social networks from novels (Elson et al. 2010), which should provide constraints on all instances of communication between a speaker and an addressee.",
        "However, the big ?",
        "and unsolved, as far as we know ?",
        "challenge is to automatically assign turns to interlocutors, given the varied and often inconsistent presentation of direct speech turns in novels."
