        "Phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) suffers from problems of data sparsity with respect to inflection and word-formation which are particularly strong when translating to a morphologically rich target language, such as German.",
        "We address the problem of inflection by first translating to a stem-based representation, and then using a second process to inflect these stems.",
        "We study several models for doing this, including: strongly lexicalized models, unlexicalized models using linguistic features, and models combining the strengths of both of these approaches.",
        "We address the problem of word-formation for compounds in German, by translating from English into German word parts, and then determining whether to merge these parts to form compounds.",
        "We make the following new contributions: (i) we introduce the first SMT system combining inflection prediction with synthesis of portmanteaus and compounds.",
        "(ii) For inflection, we compare the mostly unlexicalized prediction of linguistic features (with a subsequent surface form generation step) versus the direct prediction of surface forms, and show that both approaches have complementary strengths.",
        "(iii) We combine the advantages of the prediction of linguistic features with the prediction of surface forms.",
        "We implement this in a CRF framework which improves on a standard phrase-based SMT baseline.",
        "(iv) We develop separate (but related) procedures for inflection prediction and dealing with word-formation (compounds and portmanteaus), in contrast with most previous work which usually either approaches both problems as inflectional problems, or approaches both problems as word-formation problems.",
        "We evaluate on the end-to-end SMT task of translating from English to German of the 2009 ACL workshop on SMT.",
        "We achieve BLEU score increases on both the test set and the blind test set.",
        "2 Overview of the translation process for inflection prediction The work we describe is focused on generalizing phrase-based statistical machine translation to better model German NPs and PPs.",
        "We particularly want to ensure that we can generate novel German NPs, where what we mean by novel is that the (inflected) realization is not present in the parallel German training data used to build the SMT system, and hence cannot be produced by our baseline (a standard phrase-based SMT system).",
        "We first present our system for dealing with the difficult problem of inflection in German, including the inflection-dependent phenomenon of portmanteaus.",
        "Later, after performing an extensive analysis of this system, we will extend it",
        "to model compounds, a highly productive phenomenon in German (see Section 8).",
        "The key linguistic knowledge sources that we use are morphological analysis and generation of German based on SMOR, a morphological ana-lyzer/generator of German (Schmid et al. 2004) and the BitPar parser, which is a state-of-the-art parser of German (Schmid, 2004)."
