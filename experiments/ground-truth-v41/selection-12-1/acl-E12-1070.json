        "Recent developments of large semantic resources have accelerated empirical research on semantic processing (Ma`rquez et al. 2008).",
        "Specifically, corpora with semantic role annotations, such as PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), are indispensable resources for semantic role labeling.",
        "However, there are two topics we have to carefully take into consideration regarding role assignment frameworks: (1) clarity of semantic role meanings and (2) the constraint that a single semantic role is assigned to each syntactic argument.",
        "While these resources are undoubtedly invaluable for empirical research on semantic process-Sentence [John] threw [a ball] [from the window] .",
        "isting resources.",
        "ing, current usage of semantic labels for SRL systems is questionable from a theoretical viewpoint.",
        "For example, most of the works on SRL have used PropBank's numerical role labels (Arg0 to Arg5).",
        "However, the meanings of these numbers depend on each verb in principle and PropBank does not expect semantic consistency, namely on Arg2 to Arg5.",
        "Moreover, Yi et al(2007) explicitly showed that Arg2 to Arg5 are semantically inconsistent.",
        "The reason why such labels have been used in SRL systems is that verb-specific roles generally have a small number of instances and are not suitable for learning.",
        "However, it is necessary to avoid using inconsistent labels since those labels confuse machine learners and can be a cause of low accuracy in automatic processing.",
        "In addition, clarity of the definition of roles are particularly important for users to rationally know how to use each role in their applications.",
        "For this reasons, well-organized and generalized labels grounded in linguistic characteristics are needed in practice.",
        "Semantic roles of FrameNet and VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2000) are used more consistently to some extent, but the definition of the roles is not given in a formal manner and their semantic characteristics are unclear.",
        "Another somewhat related problem of existing annotation frameworks is that it is presupposed",
        "that a single semantic role is assigned to each syntactic argument.1In fact, one syntactic argument can play multiple roles in the event (or events) expressed by a verb.",
        "For example, Table 1 shows a sentence containing the verb ?throw?",
        "and semantic roles assigned to its arguments in each framework.",
        "The table shows that each framework assigns a single role, such as Arg0 and Agent, to each syntactic argument.",
        "However, we can acquire information from this sentence that John is an agent of the throwing event (the ?Affection?",
        "row), as well as a source of the movement event of the ball (the ?Movement?",
        "row).",
        "Existing frameworks of assigning single roles simply ignore such information that verbs inherently have in their semantics.",
        "We believe that giving a clear definition of multiple argument roles would be beneficial not only as a theoretical framework but also for practical applications that require detailed meanings derived from secondary roles.",
        "This issue is also related to fragmentation and the unclear definition of semantic roles in these frameworks.",
        "As we exemplify in this paper, multiple semantic characteristics are conflated in a single role label in these resources due to the manner of single-role assignment.",
        "This means that semantic roles of existing resources are not monolithic and inherently not mutually independent, but they share some semantic characteristics.",
        "The aim of this paper is more on theoretical discussion for role-labeling frameworks rather than introducing a new resource.",
        "We developed a framework of verb lexical semantics, which is an extension of the lexical conceptual structure (LCS) theory, and compare it with other existing frameworks which are used in VerbNet and FrameNet, as an annotation scheme of SRL.",
        "LCS is a decomposition-based approach to verb semantics and describes a meaning by composing a set of primitive predicates.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that primitive predicates and their compositions are formally defined.",
        "As a result, we can give a strict definition of semantic roles by grounding them to lexical semantic structures of verbs.",
        "In fact, we define semantic roles as argument slots in primitive predicates.",
        "With this ap1To be precise, FrameNet permits multiple-role assignment, while it does not perform this systematically as we show in Table 1.",
        "It mostly defines a single role label for a corresponding syntactic argument, that plays multiple roles in several sub-events in a verb.",
        "proach, we demonstrate that some sort of semantic characteristics that VerbNet and FrameNet informally/implicitly describe in their roles can be given formal definitions and that multiple argument roles can be represented strictly and naturally by extending the LCS theory.",
        "In the first half of this paper, we define our extended LCS framework and describe how it gives a formal definition of roles and solves the problem of multiple roles.",
        "In the latter half, we discuss the analysis of the empirical data we collected for 60 Japanese verbs and also discuss theoretical relationships with the frameworks of existing resources.",

        "Constructing a LCS dictionary is generally a difficult work since LCS has a high flexibility for describing structures and different people tend to write different structures for a single verb.",

        "This idea was inspired by automatic calculation of semantic relations of lexicon as we mentioned above.",
        "We created a LCS structure for each lexical entry as we can calculate semantic relations between related verbs and maintained high-level consistency among the verbs.",

        "From this result, we believe that our extended theory is stable to some extent.",

        "We discussed the two problems in current labeling approaches for argument-structure analysis: the problems in clarity of role meanings and multiple-role assignment.",
        "By focusing on the fact that an approach of predicate decomposition is suitable for solving these problems, we proposed a new framework for semantic role assignment by extending Jackendoff's LCS framework.",
        "The statistics of our LCS dictionary for 60 Japanese verbs showed that 37.6% of the created frames included multiple events and the number of assigned roles for one syntactic argument increased 77% from that in single-role assignment.",
        "Compared to the other resources such as VerbNet and FrameNet, the role definitions in our extended LCS framework are clearer since the primitive predicates limit the meaning of each role to a function in the action-change-state chain.",
        "We also showed that LCS can separate three types of information, the functions represented by primitives, the selectional preference and structural relation of arguments, which are conflated in role labels in existing resources.",
        "As a potential of LCS, we demonstrated that several types of frame relations, which are similar to those in FrameNet, are automatically calculated using the structural relations between LCSs.",
        "We still must perform a thorough investigation for enumerating relations which can be represented in terms of rewriting rules for LCS structures.",
        "However, automatic construction of a consistent relation graph of semantic frames may be possible based on lexical structures.",
        "We believe that this kind of decomposed analysis will accelerate both fundamental and application research on argument-structure analysis.",
        "As a future work, we plan to expand the dictionary and construct a corpus based on our LCS dictionary."
