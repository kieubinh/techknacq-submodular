        "It is becoming a real possibility for intelligent systems to talk about the visual world.",
        "New ways of mapping computer vision to generated language have emerged in the past few years, with a focus on pairing detections in an image to words (Farhadi et al. 2010; Li et al. 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al. 2011).",
        "The goal in connecting vision to language has varied: systems have started producing language that is descriptive and poetic (Li et al. 2011), summaries that add content where the computer vision system does not (Yang et al. 2011), and captions copied directly from other images that are globally (Farhadi et al. 2010) and locally similar (Ordonez et al. 2011).",
        "A commonality between all of these approaches is that they aim to produce natural-sounding descriptions from computer vision detections.",
        "This commonality is our starting point: We aim to design a system capable of producing natural-sounding descriptions from computer vision detections that are flexible enough to become more descriptive and poetic, or include likely in-The bus by the road with a clear blue sky",
        "formation from a language model, or to be short and simple, but as true to the image as possible.",
        "Rather than using a fixed template capable of generating one kind of utterance, our approach therefore lies in generating syntactic trees.",
        "We use a tree-generating process (Section 4.3) similar to a Tree Substitution Grammar, but preserving some of the idiosyncrasies of the Penn Treebank syntax (Marcus et al. 1995) on which most statistical parsers are developed.",
        "This allows us to automatically parse and train on an unlimited amount of text, creating data-driven models that flesh out descriptions around detected objects in a principled way, based on what is both likely and syntactically well-formed.",

        "Our solution lies in usingAi andAd as description anchors.",
