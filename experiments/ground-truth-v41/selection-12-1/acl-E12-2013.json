        "The ?cognitive linguistics enterprise?",
        "(Evans et al. 2007) is a rapidly expanding research discipline that has so far avoided rigorous formalizations.",
        "This choice was wholly justified in the 70s-90s when the foundations of this scientific movement were laid (Rosch, 1975; Lakoff, 1987; Langacker, 1987), and it remained so during the past two decades while the enterprise worked on getting its facts straight through empirical studies in various subfields such as language acquisition (Tomasello, 2003; Goldberg et al. 2004; Lieven, 2009), language change and grammati-calization (Heine et al. 1991; Bar?dal and Chelliah, 2009), and corpus research (Boas, 2003; Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003).",
        "However, with numerous textbooks on the market (Lee, 2001; Croft and Cruse, 2004; Evans and Green, 2006), cognitive linguistics has by now established itself as a serious branch in the study of language, and many cognitive linguists are looking for ways of explicitly formalizing their work through computational models (McClelland, 2009).",
        "Unfortunately, it turns out to be very difficult to adequately formalize a cognitive linguistic approach to grammar (or ?construction grammar?)",
        "using the tools for precision-grammars developed in the 70s-90s such as unification (Kay, 1979; Carpenter, 1992), because these tools are typically incorporated in a generative grammar (such as HPSG; Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) whose assumptions are incompatible with the foundations of construction grammar.",
        "First, cognitive linguistics blurs the distinction between ?competence?",
        "and ?performance?, which means giving up the sharp distinction between declarative and procedural representations.",
        "Next, construction grammarians argue for a usage-based approach (Langacker, 2000), so the constraints on features may change and features may emerge or disappear from a grammar at any given time.",
        "This demonstration introduces Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG; Steels, 2011, 2012a), a novel unification-based grammar formalism that addresses these issues, and which is available as open-source software at www.fcg-net.org.",
        "After more than a decade of development, FCG is now ready to handle sophisticated linguistic issues.",
        "FCG revisits many of the technologies developed by computational linguists and introduces several key innovations that are of interest to anyone working on deep language processing.",
        "The demonstration illustrates these innovations through FCG's interactive web interface.",
        "conditional units of the semantic pole of a construction are matched against a transient structure, before additional semantic constraints and the syntactic pole are merged with the structure.",

        "Reversible or bidirectional grammar formalisms can achieve both production and parsing (Strza-lkowski, 1994).",
        "Several platforms, such as the LKB (Copestake, 2002), already achieve bidirec-tionality, but they do so through separate algorithms for parsing and production (mainly for efficiency reasons).",
        "One problem with this approach is that there may be a loss of coherence in grammar engineering.",
        "For instance, the LKB parser can handle a wider variety of structures than its generator.",
        "FCG uses one core engine that handles both parsing and production with a single linguistic inventory (see Figure 1).",
        "When processing, the FCG-system builds a transient structure that contains all the information concerning the utterance that the system has to parse or produce, divided into a semantic and syntactic pole (both of whom are feature structures).",
        "Grammar rules or ?constructions?",
        "are coupled feature structures as well and thus contain a semantic and syntactic pole.",
        "When applying constructions, the FCG-system goes through three phases.",
        "In production, FCG first matches all feature-value pairs of the semantic pole of a construction with the semantic pole of the transient structure, except fv-pairs that are marked for being attributed by the construction (De Beule and Steels, 2005).",
        "Matching is a more strict form of unification that resembles a sub-sumption test (see Steels and De Beule, 2006).",
        "If matching is successful, all the marked fv-pairs of the semantic pole are merged with the transient structure in a first merge phase, after which the whole syntactic pole is merged in a second phase.",
        "FCG-merge is equivalent to ?unification?",
        "in other formalisms.",
        "The same three-phase algorithm is applied in parsing as well, but this time in the opposite direction: if the syntactic pole of the construction matches with the transient structure, the attributable syntactic fv-pairs and the semantic pole are merged."

        "point-of-view, it puts the burden of efficient processing on the shoulders of computational linguists, who have to find a balance between faithfulness to the handwritten theory and computational efficiency (Mel-nik, 2005).",

        "Unfortunately, the optimizations and technologies developed within these platforms are often considered by theoretical linguists as engineering solutions rather than scientific contributions.",
        "FCG, on the other hand, adheres to the cognitive linguistics assumption that linguistic performance is equally important as linguistic competence, hence processing becomes a central notion in the formalism.",
        "FCG representations therefore offer a ?what you see is what you get?",
        "approach to grammar engineering where the representations have a direct impact on processing and vice versa.",
        "For instance, a construction's division between a semantic and syntactic pole is informative with respect to how the construction is applied.",
        "Some grammarians may object that this design choice forces linguists to worry about processing, but that is entirely the point.",
        "It has already been demonstrated in other unification-based formalisms that different grammar representations have a significant impact on processing efficiency (Flickinger, 2000).",
        "Moreover, FCG-style representations can be directly implemented and tested without having to compromise on either faithfulness to a theory or computational efficiency.",
        "Since writing grammars is highly complex, however, FCG also features a ?design level?",
        "on top of its operational level (Steels, 2012b).",
        "On this level, grammar engineers can use templates that build detailed constructions.",
        "The demonstration shows how to write a grammar in FCG, switching between its design level, its operational level and its interactive web interface (see Figure 2).",
