        "Automated text classification has become standard practice with applications in fields such as information retrieval and natural language processing.",
        "The most common basis for text classification is by topic (Joachims, 1998; Sebastiani, 2002), but other classification criteria have evolved, including sentiment (Pang et al. 2002), authorship (de Vel et al. 2001; Stamatatos et al. 2000a), and author personality (Oberlander and Nowson, 2006), as well as categories relevant to filter algorithms (e.g., spam or inappropriate contents for minors).",
        "Genre is another text characteristic, often described as orthogonal to topic.",
        "It has been shown by Biber (1988) and others after him, that the genre of a text affects its formal properties.",
        "It is therefore possible to use cues (e.g., lexical, syntactic, structural) from a text as features to predict its genre, which can then feed into information retrieval applications (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al. 1997; Finn and Kushmer-ick, 2006; Freund et al. 2006).",
        "This is because users may want documents that serve a particular communicative purpose, as well as being on a particular topic.",
        "For example, a web search on the topic ?crocodiles?",
        "may return an encyclopedia entry, a biological fact sheet, a news report about attacks in Australia, a blog post about a safari experience, a fiction novel set in South Africa, or a poem about wildlife.",
        "A user may reject many of these, just because of their genre: Blog posts, poems, novels, or news reports may not contain the kind or quality of information she is seeking.",
        "Having classified indexed texts by genre would allow additional selection criteria to reflect this.",
        "Genre classification can also benefit Language Technology indirectly, where differences in the cues that correlate with genre may impact system performance.",
        "For example, Petrenz and Webber (2011) found that within the New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008), the word ?states?",
        "has a higher likelihood of being a verb in letters (approx.",
        "20%) than in editorials (approx.",
        "2%).",
        "Part-of-Speech (PoS) taggers or statistical machine translation (MT) systems could benefit from knowing such genre-based domain variation.",
        "Kessler et al(1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification.",
        "Webber (2009) found that different genres have a different distribution of discourse relations, and Goldstein et al(2007) showed that knowing the genre of a text can also improve automated summarization algorithms, as genre conventions dictate the location and structure of important information within a document.",
        "All the above work has been done within a single language.",
        "Here I describe a new approach to genre classification that is cross-lingual.",
        "Cross-lingual genre classification (CLGC) differs",
        "from both poly-lingual and language-independent genre classification.",
        "CLGC entails training a genre classification model on a set of labeled texts written in a source language LS and using this model to predict the genres of texts written in the target language LT 6= LS .",
        "In poly-lingual classification, the training set is made up of texts from two or more languages S = {LS1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", LSN } that include the target language LT ?",
        "S. Language-independent classification approaches are monolingual methods that can be applied to any language.",
        "Unlike CLGC, both poly-lingual and language-independent genre classification require labeled training data in the target language.",
        "Supervised text classification requires a large amount of labeled data.",
        "CLGC attempts to leverage the available annotated data in well-resourced languages like English in order to bring the aforementioned advantages to poorly-resourced languages.",
        "This reduces the need for manual annotation of text corpora in the target language.",
        "Manual annotation is an expensive and time-consuming task, which, where possible, should be avoided or kept to a minimum.",
        "Considering the difficulties researchers are encountering in compiling a genre reference corpus for even a single language (Sharoff et al. 2010), it is clear that it would be infeasible to attempt the same for thousands of other languages."

      "text": [
        "Work on automated genre classification was first carried out by Karlgren and Cutting (1994).",
        "Like Kessler et al(1997) and Argamon et al(1998) after them, they exploit (partly) hand-crafted sets of features, which are specific to texts in English.",
        "These include counts of function words such as ?we?",
        "or ?therefore?, selected PoS tag frequencies, punctuation cues, and other statistics derived from intuition or text analysis.",
        "Similarly language specific feature sets were later explored for monolingual genre classification experiments in German (Wolters and Kirsten, 1999) and Russian (Braslavski, 2004).",
        "In subsequent research, automatically generated feature sets have become more popular.",
        "Most of these tend to be language-independent and might work in monolingual genre classification tasks in languages other than English.",
        "Examples are the word based approaches suggested by Stamatatos et al(2000b) and Freund et al(2006), the image features suggested by Kim and Ross (2008), the PoS histogram frequency approach by Feldman et al(2009), and the character n-gram approaches proposed by Kanaris and Stamatatos (2007) and Sharoff et al(2010).",
        "All of them were tested exclusively on English texts.",
        "While language-independence is a popular argument often claimed by authors, few have shown empirically that this is true of their approach.",
        "One of the few authors to carry out genre classification experiments in more than one language was Sharoff (2007).",
        "Using PoS 3-grams and a variation of common word 3-grams as feature sets, Sharoff classified English and Russian documents into genre categories.",
        "However, while the PoS 3 gram set yielded respectable prediction accuracy for English texts, in Russian documents, no improvement over the baseline of choosing the most frequent genre class was observed.",
        "While there is virtually no prior work on CLGC, cross-lingual methods have been explored for other text classification tasks.",
        "The first to report such experiments were Bel et al(2003), who predicted text topics in Spanish and English documents, using one language for training and the other for testing.",
        "Their approach involves training a classifier on language A, using a document representation containing only content words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs with a high corpus frequency).",
        "These words are then translated from language B to language A, so that texts in either language are mapped to a common representation.",
        "Thereafter, cross-lingual text classification was typically regarded as a domain adaptation problem that researchers have tried to solve using large sets of unlabeled data and/or small sets of labeled data in the target language.",
        "For instance, Rigutini et al(2005) present an EM algorithm in which labeled source language documents are translated into the target language and then a classifier is trained to predict labels on a large, unlabeled set in the target language.",
        "These instances are then used to iteratively retrain the classification model and the predictions are updated until convergence occurs.",
        "Using information gain scores at every iteration to only retain the most predictive words and thus reduce noise, Rigutini et al. (2005) achieve a considerable improvement over the baseline accuracy, which is a simple translation of the training instances and subsequent",
        "mono-lingual classification.",
        "They, too, were classifying texts by topics and used a collection of English and Italian newsgroup messages.",
        "Similarly, researchers have used semi-supervised bootstrapping methods like co-training (Wan, 2009) and other domain adaptation methods like structural component learning (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) to carry out cross-lingual text classification.",
        "All of the approaches described above rely on MT, even if some try to keep translation to a minimum.",
        "This has several disadvantages however, as applications become dependent on parallel corpora, which may not be available for poorly-resourced languages.",
        "It also introduces problems due to word ambiguity and morphology, especially where single words are translated out of context.",
        "A different method is proposed by Gliozzo and Strapparava (2006), who use latent semantic analysis on a combined collection of texts written in two languages.",
        "The rationale is that named entities such as ?Microsoft?",
        "or ?HIV?",
        "are identical in different languages with the same writing system.",
        "Using term correlation, the algorithm can identify semantically similar words in both languages.",
        "The authors exploit these mappings in cross-lingual topic classification, and their results are promising.",
        "However, using bilingual dictionaries as well yields a considerable improvement, as Gliozzo and Strapparava (2006) also report.",
        "While all of the methods above could technically be used in any text classification task, the idiosyncrasies of genres pose additional challenges.",
        "Techniques relying on the automated translation of predictive terms (Bel et al. 2003; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) are workable in the contexts of topics and sentiment, as these typically rely on content words such as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.",
        "For example, ?hospital?",
        "may indicate a text from the medical domain, while ?excellent?",
        "may indicate that a review is positive.",
        "Such terms are relatively easy to translate, even if not always without uncertainty.",
        "Genres, on the other hand, are often classified using function words (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Stamatatos et al. 2000b) like ?of?, ?it?, or ?in?.",
        "It is clear that translating these out of context is next to impossible.",
        "This is true in particular if there are differences in morphology, since function words in one language may be morphological affixes in another.",
        "Although it is theoretically possible to use the bilingual low-dimension approach by Gliozzo and Strapparava (2006) for genre classification, it relies on certain words to be identical in two different languages.",
        "While this may be the case for topic-indicating named entities ?",
        "a text containing the words ?Obama?",
        "and ?McCain?",
        "will almost certainly be about the U.S. elections in 2008, or at least about U.S. politics ?",
        "there is little indication of what its genre might be: It could be a news report, an editorial, a letter, an interview, a biography, or a blog entry, just to name a few.",
        "Because topics and genres correlate, one would probably reject some genres like instruction manuals or fiction novels.",
        "However, uncertainty is still large, and Petrenz and Webber (2011) show that it can be dangerous to rely on such correlations.",
        "This is particularly true in the cross-lingual case, as it is not clear whether genres and topics correlate in similar ways in a different language."

        "I then treated this text as a ranked list of relevant and non-relevant words, where the position of a word in the text determined its rank.",
        "This allowed me to compute an average precision (AP) value.",
        "The intuition behind this value is that genre conventions dictate the location of important content words within a text.",
        "A high AP score means that the top tf-idf weighted words are found predominantly in the beginning of a text.",
        "In addition, for the same ten words, I added the tf-idf value to the feature set, divided by the sum of all ten.",
        "These values indicate whether a text is very focused (a sharp drop between higher and lower ranked words) or more spread out across topics (relatively flat distribution).",
        "For each of these features, Table 2 shows the mean values for the four broad genre classes in the LCMC and Brown corpus, after the sets have been standardized to zero mean and unit variance.",
        "This is the same preprocessing process used for training and testing the SVM model, although the statistics in Table 2 are not available to the classifier, since they require genre labels.",
        "Each row gives an idea of how suitable a feature might be to distinguish between these genres in Chinese (upper row) and English (lower row).",
        "Both rows together indicate how stable a feature is across languages for this task.",
        "Some features, such as the topic AP value, seems to be both a good predictor for genre and stable across languages.",
        "In both Chinese and English, for example, the topical words seem to be concentrated around the beginning of the text in Non-Fiction, but much less so in Fiction.",
        "These patterns can be seen in other features as well.",
        "The type/token ratio is, on average, highest in Press texts, followed by Miscellaneous texts, Fiction texts, and Non-Fiction texts in both corpora.",
        "While this does not hold for all the features, many such patterns can be observed in Table 2.",
        "Since uncertainty after the initial prediction is very high, the subset used to retrain the SVM model was chosen to be small.",
        "In the first iteration, I used up to 60% of texts with the highest confidence value within each genre.",
        "To avoid an imbalanced class distribution, texts were chosen so that the genre distribution in the new training set matched the one in the source language.",
        "To illustrate this, consider an example with two genre classes A and B, represented by 80% and 20% of texts respectively in the source language.",
        "Assuming that after the initial prediction both classes are assigned to 100 texts in a test set of size 200, the 60 texts with the highest confidence values would be chosen for class A.",
        "To keep the genre distribution of the source language, only the top 15 texts would be chosen for class B.",
        "In the second iteration, I simply used the top 90% of texts overall.",
        "This number was increased by 5% in each subsequent iteration, so that the full set was used from the fourth iteration.",

        "Figure 2 shows the accuracies for the two genre task (informative texts vs. imaginative texts) in both directions: English as a source language with Chinese being the target language (en?zh) and vice versa (zh?en).",
        "As the class distribution is skewed (374 vs. 126 texts), always predicting the most dominant class yields acceptable performance.",
        "However, this is simplistic and might fail in practice, where the most dominant class will typically be unknown.",
        "Full text translation combined with monolingual classification performs well.",
        "Stable features alone yield a respectable prediction accuracy, but perform significantly worse than MT Source in both tasks and MT Target in the zh?en task.",
        "However, subsequent TLA significantly improves the accuracy on both tasks, eliminating any significant difference from baseline performance.",
        "Figure 3 shows results for the four genre classification task (Fiction vs. Non-Fiction vs. Press vs.",
        "Misc.).",
        "Again, MT Source and MT Target perform well.",
        "However, translating from Chinese into English yields better results than the reverse.",
        "This might be due to the easier identification of",
        "four genre classification task.",
        "Labels as in Figure 2. words in English and thus a more accurate bag of words representation.",
        "TLA manages to significantly improve the stable feature results.",
        "My approach outperforms both baselines in this experiment, although the differences are only significant if texts are translated from English to Chinese.",
        "These results are encouraging, as they show that in CLGC tasks, equal or better performance can be achieved with fewer resources, when compared the baseline of full text translation.",
        "The reason why TLA works well in this case can be understood by comparing the confusion matrices before the first iteration and after convergence (Table 3).",
        "While it is obvious that the stable feature approach works better on some classes than on others, the distributions of predicted and actual genres are fairly similar.",
        "For Fiction, Non-Fiction, and Press, precision is above 50%, with correct predictions outweighing incorrect ones, which is an important basis for subsequent iterative learning.",
        "However, too many texts are predicted to belong to the Miscellaneous category, which reduces recall on the other genres.",
        "By using a different feature set and concentrating on the documents with high confidence values, TLA manages to remedy this problem to an extent.",
        "While misclassifications are still present, recalls for the Fiction and Non-Fiction genres are increased significantly, which explains the higher overall accuracy."

        "My approach exploits stable features to bridge the language gap and subsequently applies iterative target language adaptation (TLA) in order to improve accuracy.",
        "The approach performed equally well or better than full text translation combined with monolingual classification.",
        "Considering that English and Chinese are very dissimilar linguistically, I expect the approach to work at least equally well for more closely related language pairs.",
        "This work is still in progress.",
        "While my results are encouraging, more work is needed to make the CLGC approach more robust.",
        "At the moment, classification accuracy is low for problems with many classes.",
        "I plan to remedy this by implementing a hierarchical classification framework, where a text is assigned a broad genre label first and then classified further within this category.",
        "Since TLA can only work on a sufficiently good initial labeling of target language texts, stable feature classification results have to be improved as well.",
        "To this end, I propose to focus initially on features involving punctuation.",
        "This could include analyses of the different punctuation symbols used in comparison with the rest of the document set, their frequencies and deviations between sentences, punctuation n-gram patterns, as well as the analyses of the positions of punctuation symbols within sentences or whole texts.",
        "Punctuation has frequently been used in genre classification tasks and it is expected that some of the features based on such symbols are valuable in a cross-lingual setting as well.",
        "As vocabulary richness seems to be a useful predictor of genres, experiments will also be extended beyond the simple inclusion of type/token ratios in the feature set.",
        "For example, hapax legomena statistics could be used, as well as the conformance to text laws, such as Zipf, Benford, and Heaps.",
        "After this, I will examine text structure a predictor.",
        "While single line statistics and topic AP scores already reflect text structure, more sophisticated preprocessing methods, such as text segmentation and unsupervised PoS induction, might yield better results.",
        "The experiments using the tf-idf values of terms will be extended.",
        "Resulting features may include the positions of highly weighted words in a text, the amount of topics covered, or identification of summaries.",
        "TLA techniques can also be refined.",
        "An obvious choice is to consider different types of features, as mentioned in Section 3.3.",
        "Different representations may even be combined to capture the notion of different communicative purpose, similar to the multidimensional approach by Biber (1995).",
        "An interesting idea to combine different sets of features was suggested by Chaker and Habib (2007).",
        "Assigning a document to all genres with different probabilities and repeating this for different sets of features may yield a very flexible classifier.",
        "The impact of the feature sets on the final prediction could be weighted according to different criteria, such as prediction certainty or overlap with other feature sets.",
        "Improvements may also be achieved by choosing a more reliable method for finding the most confident genre predictions as a function of the distance to the SVM decision boundary.",
        "Cross-validation techniques will be explored to estimate confidence values.",
        "Finally, I will have to test the approach on a larger set of data with texts from more languages.",
        "To this end, I am working to compile a reference corpus for CLGC by combining publicly available sources.",
        "This would be useful to compare methods and will hopefully encourage further research."
