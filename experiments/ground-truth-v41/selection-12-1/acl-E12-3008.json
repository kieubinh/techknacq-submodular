        "The importance of effective language models in machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) is widely recognised.",
        "n-gram models, in particular ones using Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing, have become the standard workhorse for these tasks.",
        "These models are not ideal for languages that have relatively free word order and/or complex morphology.",
        "The ability to encode additional linguistic intuitions into models that already have certain attractive properties is an important piece of the puzzle of improving machine translation quality for those languages.",
        "But despite their widespread use, KN n-gram models are not easily extensible with additional model components that target particular linguistic phenomena.",
        "I argue in this paper that the family of hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models (HPYLM) (Teh, 2006; Goldwater et al., 2006) are suitable for investigations into more linguistically-informed n-gram language models.",
        "Firstly, the flexibility to specify arbitrary back-off distributions makes it easy to incorporate multiple models into a larger n-gram model.",
        "Secondly, the Pitman-Yor process prior (Pitman and Yor, 1997) generates distributions that are well-suited to a variety of power-law behaviours, as is often observed in language.",
        "Catering for a variety of those is important since the frequency distributions of, say, suffixes, could be quite different from that of words.",
        "KN smoothing is less flexibility in this regard.",
        "And thirdly, the basic inference algorithms have been paral-lelised (Huang and Renals, 2009), which should in principle allow the approach to still scale to large data sizes.",
        "As a test bed, I consider compounding in German, a common phenomenon that creates challenges for machine translation into German."

        "n-gram language models assign probabilities to word sequences.",
        "Their key approximation is that a word is assumed to be fully determined by n?1 words preceding it, which keeps the number of independent probabilities to estimate in a range that is computationally attractive.",
        "This basic model structure, largely devoid of syntactic insight, is surprisingly effective at biasing MT and ASR systems toward more fluent output, given a suitable choice of target language.",
        "But the real challenge in constructing n-gram models, as in many other probabilistic settings, is how to do smoothing, since the vast majority of linguistically plausible n-grams will occur rarely or be absent altogether from a training corpus, which often renders empirical model estimates misleading.",
        "The general picture is that probability mass must be shifted away from some events and redistributed across others.",
        "The method of Kneser and Ney (1995) and",
        "its later modified version (Chen and Goodman, 1998) generally perform best at this smoothing, and are based on the idea that the number of distinct contexts a word appears in is an important factor in determining the probability of that word.",
        "Part of this smoothing involves discounting the counts of n-grams in the training data; the modified version uses different levels of discounting depending on the frequency of the count.",
        "These methods were designed with surface word distributions, and are not necessarily suitable for smoothing distributions of other kinds of surface units.",
        "Bilmes and Kirchhoff (2003) proposed a more general framework for n-gram language modelling.",
        "Their Factored Language Model (FLM) views a word as a vector of features, such that a particular feature value is generated conditional on some history of preceding feature values.",
        "This allowed the inclusion of n-gram models over sequences of elements like PoS tags and semantic classes.",
        "In tandem, they proposed more complicated back-off paths; for example, trigrams can back-off to two underlying bigram distributions, one dropping the leftmost context word and the other the right-most.",
        "With the right combination of features and back-off structure they got good perplexity reductions, and obtained some improvements in translation quality by applying these ideas to the smoothing of the bilingual phrase table (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).",
        "My approach has some similarity to the FLM: both decompose surface word forms into elements that are generated from unrelated conditional distributions.",
        "They differ predominantly along two dimensions: the types of decompositions and conditioning possible, and my use of a particular Bayesian prior for handling smoothing.",
        "In addition to the HPYLM for n-gram language modelling (Teh, 2006), models based on the Pitman-Yor process prior have also been applied to good effect in word segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2006; Mochihashi et al., 2009) and speech recognition (Huang and Renals, 2007; Neubig et al., 2010).",
        "The Graphical Pitman-Yor process enables branching back-off paths, which I briefly revisit in ?7, and have proved effective in language model domain-adaptation (Wood and Teh, 2009).",
        "Here, I extend this general line of inquiry by considering how one might incorporate linguistically informed sub-models into the HPYLM framework."

        "I focus on compound nouns in this work for two reasons: Firstly, compounding is in general a very productive process, and in some languages (including German, Swedish and Dutch) they are written as single orthographic units.",
        "This increases data sparsity and creates significant challenges for NLP systems that use whitespace to identify their elementary modelling units.",
        "A proper account of compounds in terms of their component words therefore holds the potential of improving the performance of such systems.",
        "Secondly, there is a clear linguistic intuition to exploit: the morphosyntactic properties of these compounds are often fully determined by the head component within the compound.",

        "To get a better idea of how the extended models employ the increased expressiveness, I calculated the cross-entropy over only the compound words in the monolingual test set (second column of Table 2).",

        "This implies that the differences in whole-corpus perplexities are at least in part due to their different levels of adeptness at handling compounds, as opposed to some fluke event.",
        "It is, however, somewhat surprising to observe that HPYLM+c do not achieve a lower compound cross-entropy than the mKN baseline, as it suggests that HPYLM+c's perplexity reductions compared to mKN arise in part from something other than compound handling, which is their whole point.",
        "This discrepancy could be related to the fairness of this direct comparison of models that ul",

        "These direct comparisons are thus lightly skewed in favour of the baselines.",
        "This bolsters confidence in the perplexity reductions presented in the previous section, but the skew may afflict compounds more starkly, leading to the slight discrepancy observed in the compound cross-entropies.",
        "What matters more is the performance among the HPYLM+c variants, since they are directly comparable.",
        "To home in still further on the compound modelling, I selected those compounds for which HPYLM+c (FHPY LM ,?ling) does best/worst in terms of the probabilities assigned, compared to the mKN baseline (see Table 5).",
