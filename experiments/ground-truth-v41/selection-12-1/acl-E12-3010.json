        "As already mentioned, we have not found the solution to some problems yet.",
        "First of all, we would like to include an AR module in our system.",
        "As it is a rule-base system, some problems as the subject pronoun mistranslation in subordinated sentences can be fixed by means of more specific rules and heuristics.",
        "Besides, an approach based on binding theory (Bu?ring, 2005) could be effective as deep syntactic information is available, even though limited.",
        "For example, binding theory does not contain any formalization on gender, reason why a specific statistical component could be a more ideal option in order to tackle aspects such as masculine/feminine pronouns.",
        "Secondly, an overt pronoun cannot be restored from a finite impersonal verb without making the sentence ungrammatical; therefore, our approach is not useful for treating impersonal sentences.",
        "As a consequence, we think that an annotation of the empty category, as done by Chung and Gildea (2010), could provide better results.",
        "Also, in order to correctly render the meaning of a preprocessed sentence, we plan to mark restored subject pronouns in such a way that the information about their absence/presence in the original text is preserved as a feature in parsing and translation.",
        "Finally, we would like to use a larger corpus to train the SPE component and compare the effects of utilizing machine translations on the target side versus human reference translations.",
        "Besides, we would like to further explore variations on the plain SPE technique, for example, by injecting Moses translation of sentences being translated into the phrase-table of the post-editor (Chen and Eisele, 2010)."

        "We then improved the rule-based system using a rule-based preprocessor to restore pro-drop as overt pronouns and a statistical post-editor to correct the translation.",
        "Results obtained from the second evaluation showed an improvement in the translation of both sorts of pronouns.",
        "In particular, the system now generates more pronouns in French than before, confirming the advantage of using a combination of preprocessing and post-editing with rule-based machine translation."
