        "On this view, a lexical item L is veridical if the meaning of L applied to argument p entails the truth of p. For example, because both true and false things can be believed, one should not infer directly from A believes that S that S is true, making believe non-veridical.",
        "Conversely, realize appears to be veridical, because realizing S entails the truth of S. The prototypical anti-veridical operator is negation, because not S entails the falsity of S, but anti-veridicality is a characteristic of a wide range of words and constructions (e.g., have yet to, fail, without).",

        "In the lexical view, say can only be classified as non-veridical (both true and false things can be said), and yet, if aNew York Times article contained the sentence United Widget said that its chairman resigned, readers would reliably infer that United Widget's chairman resigned?the sentence is, in this context, veridical (at least to some degree) with respect to the event described by the embedded clause, with United Widget said functioning to mark the source of evidence (Simons 2007).",
        "Cognitive authority, as termed in information science (Rieh 2010), plays a crucial role in how people judge the veridicality of events.",
        "Here, the provenance of the document (theNew York Times) and the source (United Widget) combine to reliably lead a reader to infer that the author intended to convey that the event really happened.",
        "Conversely, allege is lexically non-veridical, and yet this only begins to address the complex interplay of world knowledge and lexical meaning that will shape people's inferences about the sentence FBI agents alleged in court documents today that Zazi had admitted receiving weapons and explosives training from al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan last year.",
        "We conclude from examples like this that veridicality judgments have an important pragmatic component, and, in turn, that veridicality should be assessed using information from the entire sentence as well as from the context.",
        "Lexical theories have a significant role to play here, but we expect their classifications to be buffeted by other communicative pressures.",
        "For example, the lexical theory can tell us that, as a narrowly semantic fact, X alleges S is non-veridical with regard to S. Where X is a trustworthy source for S-type information, however, we might fairly confidently conclude that S is true.",
        "Where X is known to spread disinformation, we might tentatively conclude that S is false.",

        "Our central goal for this article was to explore veridicality judgments at the level of utterance meaning.",
        "To do this, we extended FactBank (Saur??",
        "and Pustejovsky 2009) with veridicality annotations that are informed by context and world knowledge (Section 2).",
        "Although the two sets of annotations are similar in many ways, their differences highlight areas in which pragmatic factors play a leading role in shaping readers?",
        "judgments (Section 3.1).",
        "In addition, because each one of our sentences was judged by 10 annotators, we actually have annotation distributions for our sentences, which allows us to identify areas of uncertainty in veridicality assessment (Section 3.2).",
        "This uncertainty is so pervasive that the problem itself seems better modeled as one of predicting a distribution over veridicality categories, rather than trying to predict a single label.",
        "The predictive model we developed (Section 4) is true to this intuition, because it trains on and predicts distributions.",
        "All the features of the model, even the basic lexical ones, show the influence of interacting pragmatic factors (Section 5).",
        "Although automatically assigning veridicality judgments that correspond to readers?",
        "intuitions when pragmatic factors are allowed to play a role is challenging, our classifier shows that it can be done effectively using a relatively simple feature set, and we expect performance to improve as we find ways to model richer contextual features.",
        "These findings resonate with the notion of entailment used in the Recognizing Textual Entailment challenges (Dagan, Glickman, and Magnini 2006), where the goal is to determine, for each pair of sentences ?T,H?, whether T (the text) justifies H (the hypothesis).",
        "The original task definition draws on ?common-sense?",
        "understanding of language (Chapman 2005), and focuses on how people interpret utterances naturalisti-cally.",
        "Thus, these entailments are not calculated over just the information contained in the sentence pairs, as amore classical logical approachwould have it, but rather over the full utterance meaning.",
        "As a result, they are imbuedwith all the uncertainty of utterance meanings (Zaenen, Karttunen, and Crouch 2005; Crouch, Karttunen, and Zaenen 2006; Manning 2006).",
        "This is strongly reminiscent of our distinction between semantic and pragmatic veridicality.",
        "For example, as a purely semantic fact, might(S) is non-veridical",
        " with regard to S. Depending on the nature of S, however, the nature of the source, the context, and countless other factors, one might nonetheless infer S. This is one of the central lessons of our new annotations.",
        "In an important sense, we have been conservative in bringing semantics and pragmatics together, because we do not challenge the basic veridicality categorizations that come from linguistic and logical work on this topic.",
        "Rather, we just showed that those semantic judgments are often enriched pragmatically?for example, from uncertainty to one of the positive or negative categories, or from PS to PR or even CT.",
        "The interaction between lexical markers and pragmatic context is also crucial in the case of absolutism: Too many lexical markers conveying certainty might in some cases undermine the speaker's credibility (e.g., in a car salesman pitch) and actually incite mistrust in the hearer/reader.",
        "In such instances, lexical markers only are not good indicators of the veridicality of the event, but the pragmatic context of the utterance needs to be taken into account to fully appreciate the interpretation people assign to it.",
        "There is, however, evidence suggesting that we should be even more radically pragmatic (Searle 1978; Travis 1996), by dropping the notion that lexical items can be reliably classified once and for all.",
        "For example, lexical theories generally agree that know is veridical with respect to its sentential complement, and the vast majority of its uses seem to support that claim.",
