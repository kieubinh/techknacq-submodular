        "This article describes the resource-and system-building efforts of an 8-week Johns Hopkins Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration (SCALE-2009) on Semantically InformedMachine Translation (SIMT) (Baker et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2010d).",
        "Specifically, we describe our modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that were built using the lexicon and annotation scheme.",
        "Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation), and a holder (an experiencer of modality).",
        "Two examples of MN tagging are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Note that modality and negation are unified into single MN tags (e.g., the ?Able?",
        "modality tag is combined with ?NOT?",
        "to form the ?NOTAble?",
        "tag) and also that Figure 1 Modality/negation tagging examples.",
        "Baker et al. Modality and Negation in SIMT MN tags occur in pairs of triggers (e.g., TrigAble and TrigNegation) and targets (e.g., TargNOTAble).",
        "We apply our modality and negation mechanism to the problem of Urdu?English machine translation using a technique that we call tree grafting.",
        "This technique incorporates syntactic labels and semantic annotations in a unified and coherent framework for implementing semantically informed machine translation.",
        "Our framework is not limited to the semantic annotations produced by the MN taggers that are the subject of this article and we exploit this capability to additionally include named-entity annotations produced by a pre-existing tagger.",
        "By augmenting hierarchical phrase-based translation rules with syntactic labels that were extracted from a parsed parallel corpus, and further augmenting the parse trees with markers for modality, negation, and entities (through the tree grafting process), we produced a better model for translating Urdu and English.",
        "The resulting system significantly outperformed the linguistically naive baseline Hiero model, and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu?English translation task.",
        "We note that although our largest gains were from syntactic enrichments to the model, smaller (but significant) gains were achieved by injecting semantic knowledge into the syntactic paradigm.",
        "Verbal semantics (modality and negation) contributed slightly more gains than nominal semantics (named entities) and their combined gains were the sum of their individual contributions.",
        "Of course, the limited semantic types we explored (modality, negation, and entities) are only a small piece of the much larger semantic space, but demonstrating success on these semantic aspects of language, the combination of which has been unexplored by the statistical machine translation community, bodes well for (larger) improvements based on the incorporation of other semantic aspects (e.g., relations and temporal knowledge).",
        "Moreover, we believe this syntactic framework to be well suited for further exploration of the impact of many different types of semantics on the quality of machine-translation (MT) output.",
        "Indeed, it would not have been possible to initiate the current study without the foundational work that gave rise to a syntactic paradigm that could support these semantic enrichments.",
        "In the SIMT paradigm, semantic elements (e.g., modality/negation) are identified in the English portion of a parallel training corpus and projected to the source language (in our case, Urdu) during a process of syntactic alignment.",
        "These semantic elements are subsequently used in the translation rules that are extracted from the parallel corpus.",
        "The goal of adding them to the translation rules is to constrain the space of possible translations to more grammatical and more semantically coherent output.",
        "We explored whether including such semantic elements could improve translation output in the face of sparse training data and few source language annotations.",
        "Results were encouraging.",
        "Translation quality, as measured by the Bleu metric (Papineni et al. 2002), improved when the training process for the Joshua machine translation system (Li et al. 2009) used in the SCALE workshop included MN annotation.",
        "We were particularly interested in identifying modalities and negation because they can be used to characterize events in a variety of automated analytic processes.",
        "Modalities and negation can distinguish realized events from unrealized events, beliefs from certainties, and can distinguish positive and negative instances of entities and events.",
        "For example, the correct identification and retention of negation in a particular language?such as a single instance of the word ?not?",
        "?is very important for a correct representation of events and likewise for translation.",

        " MN taggers.",
        "Section 5 presents the MN annotation scheme used by our human annotators and describes the creation of a MN lexicon based on this scheme.",

        "and evaluates the effectiveness of the structure-based tagger.",

        "As in many of the frameworks described herein, the aim of the SIMT effort was to provide a generalized framework for representing structured semantic information, such as modality and negation.",
        "Unlike many of the previous semantic annotation efforts (where the emphasis tends to be on English), however, our approach is designed to be directly integrated into a translation engine, with the goal of translating highly divergent language pairs, such as Urdu and English.",
        "As such, our choice of annotation scheme?illustrated in the trigger-target example shown in Figure 1?was based on a simplified structural representation that is general enough to accommodate divergent modality/negation phenomena, easy for language experts to follow, and straightforward to integrate into a tree-grafting mechanism for MT.",
        "Our objective is to investigate whether incorporating this sort of information into machine translation systems could produce better translations, particularly in settings where only small parallel corpora are available.",
        "It is informative to look at an example translation to understand the challenges of translating important semantic elements when working with a low-resource language pair.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example taken from the 2008 NIST Urdu?English translation task, and illustrates the translation quality of a state-of-the-art Urdu?English system (prior to the SIMT effort).",

        "an Arabic?English system that has more than 100 times the amount of training data.",
        "The output in Figure 2 was produced using Moses (Koehn et al. 2007), a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system that by default does not incorporate any linguistic information (e.g., syntax or morphology or transliteration knowledge).",
        "As a result, words that were not directly observed in the bilingual training data were untranslatable.",
        "Names, in particular, are problematic.",
        "For example, the lack of translation for Nagaland and Nagas induces multiple omissions throughout the translated text, thus producing several instances where the holder of a claim (or belief ) is missing.",
        "This is because out-of-vocabulary words are deleted from the Moses output.",
        "We use syntactic and semantic tags as higher-order symbols inside the translation rules used by the translation models.",
        "Generic symbols in translation rules (i.e., the non-terminal symbol ?X?)",
        "were replaced with structured information at multiple levels of abstraction, using a tree-grafting approach that we describe subsequently.",
        "Figure 3 Figure 3 The evolution of a semantically informed approach to our synchronous context-free grammars.",
        "At the start of the 8 weeks the decoder used translation rules with a single generic non-terminal symbol.",

        "Other semantic units, such as relations between entities and events, were not part of this effort but we believe they could be similarly incorporated into the framework.",
        "We chose to examine semantic units that canonically exhibit two different syntactic types: verbal, in the case of modality and negation, and nominal, in the case of named entities.",

        "This is because, although MN targets vary, MN triggers are generally identifiable with lexical items.",
