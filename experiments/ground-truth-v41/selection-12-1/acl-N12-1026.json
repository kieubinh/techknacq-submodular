        "The advancement of statistical machine translation (SMT) relies on efficient tuning of several or many parameters in a model.",
        "One of the standards for such tuning is minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003), which directly minimize the loss of translation evaluation measures, i.e. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "MERT has been successfully used in practical applications, although, it is known to be unstable (Clark et al., 2011).",
        "To overcome this instability, it requires multiple runs from random starting points and directions (Moore and Quirk, 2008), or a computationally expensive procedure by linear programming and combinatorial optimization (Galley and Quirk, 2011).",
        "Many alternative methods have been proposed based on the algorithms in machine learning, such as averaged perceptron (Liang et al., 2006), maximum entropy (Och and Ney, 2002; Blunsom et al., 2008), Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b), or pairwise rank optimization (PRO) (Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "They primarily differ in the mode of training; online or MERT-like batch, and in their objectives; max-margin (Taskar et al., 2004), conditional log-likelihood (or softmax loss) (Berger et al., 1996), risk (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Li and Eisner, 2009), or ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999).",
        "We present an online learning algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a larger batch size (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007).",
        "Like Hopkins and May (2011), we optimize ranking in n-best lists, but learn parameters in an online fashion.",
        "As proposed by Haddow et al. (2011), BLEU is approximately computed in the local batch, since BLEU is not linearly decomposed into a sentence-wise score (Chiang et al., 2008a), and optimization for sentence-BLEU does not always achieve optimal parameters for corpus-BLEU.",
        "Setting the larger batch size implies the more accurate corpus-BLEU, but at the cost of slower convergence of SGD.",
        "Therefore, we propose an optimized update method inspired by the passive-aggressive algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006), in which each parameter update is further rescaled considering the tradeoff between the amount of updates to the parameters and the ranking loss.",
        "Learning is efficiently parallelized by splitting training data among shards and by merging parameters in each round (McDonald et al., 2010).",
        "Instead",
        "of simple averaging, we perform an additional line search step to find the optimal merging across parallel jobs.",
        "Experiments were carried out on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English OpenMT task.",

        "Our work is largely inspired by pairwise rank optimization (Hopkins and May, 2011), but runs in an online fashion similar to (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b).",
        "Major differences come from the corpus-BLEU computation used to select oracle translations.",
        "Instead of the sentence-BLEU used by Hopkins andMay (2011) or the corpus-BLEU statistics accumulated from previous translations generated by different parameters (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b), we used a simple batch local corpus-BLEU (Haddow et al., 2011) in the same way as an online approximation to the objectives.",
        "An alternative is the use of a Taylor series approximation (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Rosti et al., 2011), which was not investigated in this paper.",
        "Training is performed by SGD with a parameter projection method (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007).",
        "Slower training incurred by the larger batch size",
        "for more accurate corpus-BLEU is addressed by optimally scaling parameter updates in the spirit of a passive-aggressive algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006).",
        "The derived algorithm is very similar to MIRA, but differs in that the learning rate is employed as a hyperparameter for controlling the fitness to training data which decays when training proceeds.",
        "The non-uniform sub-gradient based update is also employed in an exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithm (Kivinen and Warmuth, 1997; Kivinen andWarmuth, 2001) in which parameter updates are maximum-likely estimated using an exponentially combined sub-gradients.",
        "In contrast, our approach relies on an ultraconservative update which tradeoff between the amount of updates performed to the parameters and the progress made for the objectives by solving a QP subproblem.",
        "Unlike a complex parallelization by Chiang et al.",
        "(2008b), in which support vectors are asynchronously exchanged among parallel jobs, training is efficiently and easily carried out by distributing training data among shards and by mixing parameters in each iteration (McDonald et al., 2010).",
        "Rather than simple averaging, new parameters are derived by linearly interpolating with the previously mixed parameters, and its weight is determined by the line search algorithm employed in (Och, 2003)."

        "We proposed a variant of an online learning algorithm inspired by a batch learning algorithm of (Hopkins and May, 2011).",

        "Learning is efficiently parallelized (McDonald et al., 2010) and the locally learned parameters are mixed by an additional line search step.",
        "Experiments indicate that better performance was achieved by our optimized updates and by the more sophisticated parameter mixing.",
        "In future work, we would like to investigate other objectives with a more direct task loss, such as max-margin (Taskar et al., 2004), risk (Smith and Eisner, 2006) or softmax-loss (Gimpel and Smith, 2010), and different regularizers, such as L1-norm for a sparse solution.",
        "Instead of n-best approximations, we may directly employ forests for a better conditional log-likelihood estimation (Li and Eisner, 2009).",
        "We would also like to explore other mixing strategies for parallel training which can directly minimize the training objectives like those proposed for a cutting-plane algorithm (Franc and Sonnen-burg, 2008)."
