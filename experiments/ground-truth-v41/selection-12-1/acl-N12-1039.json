        "Speakers can often associate proper names with their language of origin, even when the words have not been seen before.",
        "For example, many English speakers will recognize that Makowski and Masiello are Polish and Italian respectively, without prior knowledge of either name.",
        "Such recognition is important for language processing tasks since the pronunciations of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words may depend on the language of origin.",
        "For example, as noted by Llitjo's (2001), ?sch?",
        "is likely to be pronounced as /sh/ for German-origin names (Schoenenberg) and /sk/ for Italian-origin words (Schiavone).",
        "In this work, we apply word origin recognition to grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, the task of predicting the phonemic representation of a word given its written form.",
        "We specifically study G2P conversion for personal surnames, a domain where OOVs are common and expected.",
        "Our goal is to show how word origin information can be used to train language-specific G2P models, and how output from these models can be combined to improve prediction of the best pronunciation of a name.",
        "We deal with data sparsity in rare language classes by re-weighting the output of the language-specific and language-independent models."
