        "Temporal resolution is the task of mapping from a textual phrase describing a potentially complex time, date, or duration to a normalized (grounded) temporal representation.",
        "For example, possibly complex phrases such as the week before last are often more useful in their grounded form ?",
        "e.g., January 1 - January 7.",
        "The dominant approach to this problem in previous work has been to use rule-based methods, generally a combination of regular-expression matching followed by handwritten interpretation functions.",
        "In general, it is appealing to learn the interpretation of temporal expressions, rather than hand-building systems.",
        "Moreover, complex hierarchical temporal expressions, such as the Tuesday before last or the third Wednesday of each month, and ambiguous expressions, such as last Friday, are difficult to handle using deterministic rules and would benefit from a recursive and probabilistic phrase structure representation.",
        "Therefore, we attempt to learn a temporal interpretation system where temporal phrases are parsed by a grammar, but this grammar and its semantic interpretation rules are latent, with only the input phrase and its grounded interpretation given to the learning system.",
        "Employing probabilistic techniques allows us to capture ambiguity in temporal phrases in two important respects.",
        "In part, it captures syntactic ambiguity ?",
        "e.g., last Friday the 13th bracketing as either [last Friday] [the 13th], or last [Friday the 13th].",
        "This also includes examples of lexical ambiguity ?",
        "e.g., two meanings of last in last week of November versus last week.",
        "In addition, temporal expressions often carry a pragmatic ambiguity.",
        "For instance, a speaker may refer to either the next or previous Friday when he utters Friday on a Sunday.",
        "Similarly, next week can refer to either the coming week or the week thereafter.",
        "Probabilistic systems furthermore allow propagation of uncertainty to higher-level components ?",
        "for example recognizing that May could have a number of non-temporal meanings and allowing a system with a broader contextual scope to make the final judgment.",
        "We implement a CRF to detect temporal expressions, and show our model's ability to act as a component in such a system.",
        "We describe our temporal representation, followed by the learning algorithm; we conclude with experimental results showing our approach to be competitive with state of the art systems."

        "Like these representations, a parse ?",
        "in conjunction with the reference time ?",
        "defines a set of matching entities, in this case the grounded time.",
        "The matching times can be thought of as analogous to the entities in a logical model which satisfy a given expression.",
        "Supervised approaches to logical parsing prominently include Zelle and Mooney (1996), Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), Kate et al. (2005), Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007), inter alia.",
        "For example, Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007) learn a mapping from textual queries to a logical form.",
        "This logical form importantly contains all the predicates and entities used in their parse.",
        "We loosen the supervision required in these systems by allowing the parse to be entirely latent; the annotation of the grounded time neither defines, nor gives any direct cues about the elements of the parse, since many parses evaluate to the same grounding.",
        "To demonstrate, the grounding for a week ago could be described by specifying a month and day, or as a week ago, or as last x ?",
        "substituting today's day of the week for x.",
        "Each of these correspond to a completely different parse.",
        "Recent work by Clarke et al. (2010) and Liang et al.",
        "(2011) similarly relax supervision to require only annotated answers rather than full logical forms.",
        "For example, Liang et al. (2011) constructs a latent parse similar in structure to a dependency grammar, but representing a logical form.",
        "Our proposed lexical entries and grammar combination rules can be thought of as paralleling the lexical entries and predicates, and the implicit combination rules respectively in this framework.",
        "Rather than querying from a finite database, however, our system must compare temporal expression within an infinite timeline.",
        "Furthermore, our system is run using neither lexical cues nor intelligent initialization.",
        "Related work on interpreting temporal expressions has focused on constructing hand-crafted interpretation rules (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Saquete et al., 2003; Puscasu, 2004; Grover et al., 2010).",
        "Of these, HeidelTime (Stro?tgen and Gertz, 2010) and SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) provide particularly strong competition.",
        "Recent probabilistic approaches to temporal resolution include UzZaman and Allen (2010), who employ a parser to produce deep logical forms, in conjunction with a CRF classifier.",
        "In a similar vein, Kolomiyets and Moens (2010) employ a maximum entropy classifier to detect the location and temporal type of expressions; the grounding is then done via deterministic rules."
