        "Consider statement (1) The company won't ship the new product to the United States until next year.",
        "Existing approaches to represent the meaning of (1) either indicate that the verb ship is negated or disregard the negation altogether.",
        "Semantic role labelers trained over PropBank would link n't to ship with MNEG (i.e., negate the verb); any system based on FrameNet and more recent unsupervised proposals (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Liang et al., 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2011) ignore negation.",
        "In order to represent the meaning of (1), one must first ascertain that the negation mark n't is actually negating the TEMPORAL context linked to ship and not the verb per se; more specifically, n't is negating exclusively the preposition until.",
        "Only doing so one can aim at representing the actual meaning of (1): The company will ship the new product to the United States during next year.",
        "Note that the verb ship, and its AGENT, THEME and LOCATION (i.e., The company, the new product and to the United States) are positive, as well as the temporal anchor next year.",
        "Regardless of the semantic representation one fa-vors (logic forms, predicate calculus, semantic relations, semantic frames, etc.",
        "), we argue that pinpointing the numerous words that contribute to implicit positive meanings within a negated statement is a required subtask to obtain it.",
        "This paper aims at extracting specific positive implicit meaning from",
        "negated statements.",
        "The main contributions are: (1) interpretation of negation using fine-grained focus; (2) fine-grained focus of negation annotation over a subset of PropBank; (3) feature set to detect fine-grained focus of negation; and (4) model",
        "to retrieve precise positive implicit meaning from negated statements."

      "heading": "7 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have argued that negated statements often carry positive implicit meaning and that its detection is key in order to capture their semantics, regardless of the semantic representation one favors (e.g., predicate calculus, semantic relations).",
        "We have introduced the concept of granularity of focus of negation.",
        "Going beyond previous work, considering fine-grained focus allows us to reveal narrow positive implicit meaning.",
        "In the majority of cases (68%, Table 4) we are able to detect more positive implicit meaning than previous work considering a coarse-grained focus.",
        "We do not impose any syntactic restriction on which parts of a sentence might belong to the fine-grained focus.",
        "The annotation was done selecting words without taking into account any syntactic or semantic information.",
        "This approach effectively marks only the words that should be negated, but arguably makes prediction more difficult since fine-grained focus often does not correspond to a single node in the syntactic tree.",
        "We have approached the task of fine-grained focus detection as a chunking problem in which we predict one chunk, FGF.",
        "The best model obtains an f-measure of 68.84, calculated by considering exact matches between chunks.",
        "In other words, unless the model predicts as fine-grained focus exactly the actual fine-grained focus, it is considered wrong when calculating performance.",
        "We believe this is the honest way of evaluating performance, even though partial matches could be useful for an actual application.",
        "For example, in The U.S.'s largest suppliers haven't been filling their quotas : to :::::::: the full :::::: extent [interpretation: they have been fullfilling their quotas to a partial extent], if the model predicts full as the only word belonging to fine-grained focus we count it wrong even though it successfully detects the most important part of it, i.e., the adjective full."
