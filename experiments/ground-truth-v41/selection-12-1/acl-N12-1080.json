        "Extensive research has gone into determining which features of text documents are useful for calculating the importance of sentences for extractive summarization, as well as how to use these features (Gupta and Lehal, 2010).",
        "Little work, however, has considered the importance of temporal information towards single document summarization.",
        "This is likely because many text documents have very few explicit time features and do not necessarily describe topics in chronological order.",
        "Historical articles, such as Wikipedia articles describing wars, battles, or other major events, tend to contain many explicit time features.",
        "Historical articles also tend to describe events in chronological order.",
        "In addition, historical articles tend to focus on a single central event.",
        "The importance of other events can then be judged by their temporal distance from this central event.",
        "Finally, important events in an article will be described in greater detail, employing more sentences than less important events.",
        "This paper investigates the value of a temporal-based score towards automatic summarization, specifically focusing on historical articles.",
        "We investigate whether or not such a score can be used as a weight in traditional sentence ranking techniques to improve summarization quality."
