        "Bullying takes multiple forms, most noticeably face-to-face physical (e.g., hitting), verbal (e.g., name-calling), and relational (e.g., exclusion) (Archer and Coyne, 2005; Little et al., 2003; Nylund et al., 2007).",
        "Cyberbullying reflects a venue (other than face to face contact) through which verbal and relational forms can occur.",
        "A main reason individuals are targeted with bullying is perceived differences, i.e., any characteristic that makes an individual stand out differently from his or her peers.",
        "These include race, socio-economic status, gender, sexuality, physical appearance, and behaviors.",
        "Participants in a bullying episode take well-defined roles (see Figure 1).",
        "More than one person can have the same role in a bullying episode.",
        "Roles include the bully (or bullies), the victims, bystanders (who saw the event but did not intervene), defenders of the victim, assistants to the bully (who did not initiate but went along with the bully), and rein-forcers (who did not directly join in with the bully but encouraged the bully by laughing, for example) (Salmivalli, 1999).",
        "This recognition that bullying involves multiple roles makes evident the broad-ranging impact of bullying; any child or adolescent is susceptible to participation in bullying, even those who are not directly involved (Janosz et al., 2008; Rivers et al., 2009)."
