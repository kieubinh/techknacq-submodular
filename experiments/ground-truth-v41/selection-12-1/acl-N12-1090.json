        "Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution is the task of determining which NPs (or mentions) refer to each real-world entity in a document.",
        "Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in multilingual coreference resolution.",
        "For instance, the ACE 2004/2005 evaluations and SemEval-2010 Shared Task 1 have both involved coreference resolution in multiple languages.",
        "As evidenced by the participants in these evaluations, the most common approach to building a resolver for a new language is supervised, which involves training a resolver on coreference-annotated documents from the target language.",
        "Although supervised approaches work reasonably well, they present a challenge to deploying coreference technologies across a large number of natural languages.",
        "Specifically, for each new language of interest, one has to hire native speakers of the language to go through the labor-intensive, time-consuming process of hand-annotating a potentially large number of documents with coreference annotation before a supervised resolver can be trained.",
        "One may argue that a potential solution to this corpus annotation bottleneck is to employ an unsupervised or heuristic approach to coreference resolution, especially in light of the fact that they have recently started to rival their supervised counterparts.",
        "However, by adopting these approaches, we are simply replacing the corpus annotation bottleneck by another, possibly equally serious, bottleneck, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "Specifically, in these approaches, one has to employ knowledge of the target language to design coreference rules (e.g., Mitkov (1999), Poon and Domingos (2008), Raghu-nathan et al. (2010)) or sophisticated generative models (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007,2010), Ng (2008)) to combine the available knowledge sources.",
        "One could argue that designing coreference rules and generative models may not be as time-consuming as annotating a large coreference corpus.",
        "This may be true for a well-studied language like English, where we can easily compose a rule that disallows coreference between two mentions if they disagree in number and gender, for instance.",
        "However, computing these features may not be as simple as we hope for a language like Chinese: the lack of morphology complicates the determination of number information, and the fact that most Chinese first names are used by both genders makes gender determination difficult.",
        "The difficulty in accurately computing features translates to difficulties in composing coreference rules: for example, the aforementioned rule involving gender and number agreement, as well as rules that implement traditional linguistic",
        "constraints on coreference, may no longer be accurate and desirable to have if the features involved cannot be accurately computed.",
        "Consequently, we believe that research in multilingual coreference resolution will continue to be dominated by supervised approaches.",
        "Given the high cost of annotating data with coreference chains, it is crucial to explore methods for obtaining annotated data in a cost-effective manner.",
        "Motivated in part by this observation, we examine one such method that has recently shown promise for a variety of NLP tasks, translation-based projection, which is composed of three steps.",
        "To coreference annotate a text in the target language, we (1) machine-translate it to a resource-rich language (henceforth the source language); (2) automatically produce the desired linguistic annotations (which in our case are coreference annotations) on the translated text using the linguistic tool developed for the source language (which in our case is a coreference resolver) ; and (3) project the annotations from the source language to the target language.",
        "Unlike supervised approaches, this projection approach does not require any coreference-annotated data from the target language.",
        "Equally importantly, unlike its unsupervised counterparts, this approach does not require that we have any linguistic knowledge of the target language.",
        "In fact, we have no knowledge of the target languages we employ in our evaluation.",
        "One of our goals is to examine the feasibility of building a coreference resolver for a language for which we have no coreference-annotated data and no linguistic knowledge of the language.",
        "Recall that we view projection as an approach for alleviating the corpus annotation bottleneck, not as a solution to the multilingual coreference resolution problem.",
        "In fact, though rarely emphasized in previous work on applying projection, we note that projection alone cannot be used to solve multilingual NLP problems, including coreference resolution.",
        "The reason is that every language has its own idiosyncrasies with respect to linguistic properties, and projection simply cannot produce annotations capturing those properties that are specific to the target language.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to explore the extent to which projection, which does not require that we have any knowledge of the target language, can push the limits of multilingual coreference resolution.",
        "If our results indicate that projection is a promising approach, then the automatic coreference annotations it produces can be used to augment the manual annotations that capture the properties specific to the target language, thus alleviating the corpus annotation bottleneck."

        "The idea of projecting annotations from a resource-rich language to a resource-scarce language was originally proposed by Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) and subsequently developed by others (e.g., Resnik (2004), Hwa et al. (2005)).",
        "These projection algorithms assume as input a parallel corpus for the source language and the target language.",
        "Given the recent availability of machine translation (MT) services on the Web, researchers have focused more on translated-based projection rather than acquiring a parallel corpus themselves.",
        "MT-based projection has been applied to various NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (e.g., Das and Petrov (2011)), mention detection (e.g., Zitouni and Florian (2008)), and sentiment analysis (e.g., Mihalcea et al. (2007)).",
        "There have been two initial attempts to apply projection to create coreference-annotated data for a resource-poor language, both of which involve projecting hand-annotated coreference data from English to Romanian via a parallel corpus.",
        "Specifically, Harabagiu and Maiorano (2000) create an English-Romanian corpus by manually translating the MUC6 corpus into Romanian and manually project the English annotations to Romanian.",
        "On the other hand, Postolache et al. (2006) apply a word alignment algorithm to project the hand-annotated English coreference chains and then manually fix the projection errors on the Romanian side.",
        "Hence, their goal is different from ours in at least two respects.",
        "First, while they employ significant knowledge of the target language to create a clean coreference corpus, we examine the quality of coreference-annotated data created via an entirely automatic process, determining quality by the performance of the resolver trained on the data.",
        "Second, unlike ours, neither of these attempts is at the level of defining a technology for projection annotations that can potentially be deployed across a large number of languages without coreference-annotated data."

        "Hence, all we can do is to employ the three steps involved in the projection approach as described at the beginning of this section to create coreference-annotated data for French.",
        "Specifically, we translate a French text to an English text using GoogleTranslate1 , and create coreference chains for the translated English text using Reconcile2 (Stoy-anov et al., 2010).",
        "To project mentions from English to French, we first align the English and French words in each pair of parallel sentences, and then project the English mentions onto the French text using the alignment.",
        "However, since the alignment is noisy, the French words to which the words in the English mention are aligned may not form a contiguous text span.",
        "To fix this problem, we follow Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) and use the smallest text span that covers all the aligned French words to create the French mention.3 We process the English mentions in the text in a left-to-right manner, as processing the mentions sequentially enables us to ensure that an English mention is not mapped to a",
        "tolache et al. (2006), for example.",
        "French text span that has already been mapped to by a previously-processed English mention.4 To align English and French words, we trained a word alignment model using GIZA++5 (Och and Ney, 2000) on a parallel corpus comprising the English-French section of Europarl6 (Koehn, 2005) as well as all the French texts (and their translated English counterparts) for which we want to automatically create coreference chains.",
        "Following common practice, we stemmed the parallel corpus using the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980) in order to reduce data sparseness.",
        "However, even with stemming, we found that many English words were not aligned to any French words by the resulting alignment model.",
        "This would prevent many English mentions from being projected to the French side, potentially harming the recall of the French coreference annotations.",
        "To improve alignment coverage, we retrained the alignment model by supplying GIZA++ with an English-French bilingual dictionary that we assembled using three online dictionary databases: OmegaWiki, Wiktionary, and Universal Dictionary.",
        "Furthermore, if a word w appears in both the English side and the French side in a pair of parallel sentences, we assume that it has the same orthographic form in both languages and hence we augment the bilingual dictionary with the entry (w, w).",
        "Note that the use of a supervised resolver like Reconcile does not render our approach supervised, since we can replace it with any resolver, be it supervised, heuristic, or unsupervised.",
        "In other words, we treat the resolver built for the source language as a black box that can produce coreference annotations."

        "annotate, we first translate it to English using GoogleTranslate and align the French and English words using a French-to-English word alignment algorithm.",

        "Finally, we run Reconcile on the resulting English mentions to generate coreference chains for the translated text, and project these chains back to the French text.",
        "As explained before, the performance of this method is sensitive to the accuracy of the NP projection algorithm in recovering the English mentions, which in turn depends on the accuracy of the word alignment algorithm.",
        "To make this method more robust to noisy word alignment, we make a modification to it.",
        "Rather than running Reconcile on the mentions produced by the NP projection algorithm, we use Reconcile to identify the mentions directly from the translated text.",
        "After that, we create a mapping between the English mentions produced by the NP projection algorithm and those produced by Reconcile using a small set of heuristics.",
        "Specifically, let MP be the set of mentions identified by the NP projection algorithm and MR be the set of mentions identified by Reconcile.",

        "Finally, we discard all mentions in MR that are not mapped by any mention in MP , and present MR to Reconcile for coreference resolution.",
        "Since we now have a 1-to-1 mapping between the Reconcile mentions and the French mentions, projecting the coreference results back to French is trivial.",
        "It may not be immediately clear why the exploitation of the mention extractor in this setting may yield better coreference annotations than those produced in Setting 1.",
        "To see the reason, recall that one source of errors inherent in a projection approach is word alignment errors.",
        "In Setting 1, when we tried to project English mentions to the French text, word alignment errors would adversely affect the ability of the NP projection algorithm to correctly define the boundaries of the French mentions.",
        "Since coreference performance depends crucially on the ability to correctly identify mentions (Stoyanov et al., 2009), the presence of word alignment errors implies that the resulting French coreference annotations could score poorly even if the English coreference annotations produced by Reconcile were of high quality.",
        "In the current setting, on the other hand, we reduce the sensitivity of coreference performance to word alignment errors via the use of the French mention extractor to produce more accurate French mention boundaries."

        "These results provide evidence for our earlier hypothesis that our projection algorithm can profitably exploit the linguistic knowledge about the target language that is available to it.",
        "In particular, the mention extractor helps make our approach less sensitive to word alignment and NP projection errors.",
        "In comparison to our supervised results in rows 1 and 2, our algorithm still lags behind by about 8?10 points in average F-score.",
        "However, this should not be surprising, since our algorithm is unsupervised.",
        "Looking closer at the results, we can see that the performance lag by our approach can be attributed to its lower recall: in general, the lag in MUC recall appears to be more acute than that in B3 and CEAF recall.",

        "According to CEAF, the Spanish resolvers in Setting 3 are significantly better than their counterparts in Setting 2, but the opposite is true for the Italian resolvers.",
        "To understand these somewhat contradictory performance trends, let us first note that the dramatic increase in the MUC F-score can be attributed to large",
        "gains in MUC recall.",
        "This suggests that the classifiers being trained in Setting 3 have enabled the discovery of additional coreference links.",
        "In other words, there are benefits to be obtained just by learning over noisy coreference annotations, a result that we believe is quite interesting.",
        "However, not all of these newly discovered coreference links are correct.",
        "The fact that some scoring programs (e.g., B3) are more sensitive to spurious coreference links than the others (e.g., MUC) explains these mixed results.",
        "Nevertheless, according to average F-score, the resolvers in Setting 3 perform significantly better than those in Setting 2 for both languages: F-score increases by 5.3 points for Spanish and 0.7 points for Italian.",

        "While our Setting 3 results still underperform the supervised results in rows 1 and 2, we can see that they achieve 93?94% of the average F-scores of the supervised Spanish resolvers and 89?91% of the average F-scores of the supervised Italian resolvers.",
        "Importantly, recall that our approach achieves this level of performance without relying on any gold-standard coreference annotations in Spanish and Italian, and we believe that these results demonstrate the promise of our MT-based projection approach.",
        "Since these results suggest that our approach cannot be successfully applied without MT services, a parallel corpus for learning a word alignment model, and a mention extractor for the target language, a natural question is: to what extent do these requirements limit the applicability of our approach?",
        "While it is the case that our approach cannot be applied to a truly resource-scarce language, it can be applied to the numerous Indian and East European languages for which the aforementioned requirements are satisfied but coreference-annotated data is not readily available."

        "First, we will isolate the impact of each factor that adversely affects its performance, including errors in projection, translation, and coreference resolution in the resource-rich language.",
        "Second, we will perform an empirical comparison of two approaches to projecting coreference annotations, our translation-based approach and Camargo de Souza and Orasan's (2011) approach, where annotations are projected via a parallel corpus.",
        "Third, rather than translate from the target to the source language, we will examine whether it is better to translate all the coreference-annotated data available in the source language to the target language, and train a coreference model for the target language on the translated data.",
        "Fourth, since the success of our projection approach depends heavily on the accuracies of machine translation as well as coreference resolution in the source language, we will determine whether their accuracies can be improved via an ensemble approach, where we employ multiple MT engines and multiple coreference resolvers.",
        "Finally, we plan to employ our approach to alleviate the corpus-annotation bottleneck, specifically by using the annotated data it produces to augment the manual coreference annotations that capture the specific properties of the target language."
