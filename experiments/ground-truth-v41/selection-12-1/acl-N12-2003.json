        "As a significant body of linguistic research has observed (see e.g. Quirk et al. (1985)), English pre-nominal adjective strings exhibit subtle order restrictions.",
        "Although example (2), below, does not represent a clear-cut violation of established grammatical principles, it would sound distinctly unnatural to native speakers in the majority of contexts, in contrast to the entirely unproblematic (1).",
        "(1) He poked it with a long metal fork (2) ?",
        "He poked it with a metal long fork The problem of determining the principles that govern Adjective Ordering (henceforth, AO) in English has been studied from a range of academic perspectives, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology and neuroscience.",
        "AO is also of interest in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), since a method that consistently selects felicitous orders would serve to improve the output of language modeling and generation systems.",
        "Previous NLP approaches to AO infer the ordering of adjective combinations from instances of the same, or superficially similar, combinations in training corpora (Shaw & Hatzivassiloglou, 1999) (Malouf, 2000), or from distributional tendencies of the adjectives in multiple-modifier strings (Mitchell, 2009) (Dunlop, Mitchell, & Roark, 2010).",
        "Such methods are susceptible to data sparseness, since the combinations from which they learn are rare in everyday language.",
        "By contrast, the approach taken here determines AO based on semantic features of adjectives, guided by the theoretical observation that the cognitive notion of subjectivity governs ordering in the general case (Adamson, 2000).",
        "The semantic features developed are each highly significant predictors of AO, and they combine to classify combinations with 73.0% accuracy.",
        "These preliminary results indicate that semantic AO systems can perform comparably to existing systems, and that classifiers exploiting semantic and direct evidence might surpass the current best-performing systems."

        "The subtle nature of human ordering preferences makes AO a particularly challenging NLP task.",
        "In perhaps the first specific attempt to address the problem, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) apply a direct evidence method.",
        "For a given adjective combination in the test data, their system searches a training corpus and selects the most frequent ordering of that combination.",
        "Because there is no basis to determine the order of adjective combinations that are not in the training data, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou extend the domain of the classifi",
        "er by assuming transitivity in the order relation, increasing the coverage with only a small reduction in accuracy.",
        "Nevertheless, the system remains highly dependent on the domain and quantity of training data.",
        "For example, accuracy is 92% when training and test data are both within the medical domain but only 54% in cross-domain contexts.",
        "Malouf (2000) combines a direct evidence approach with an alternative method for extending the domain of his classifier.",
        "His system infers the order of unseen combinations from ?similar?",
        "seen combinations, where similarity is defined purely in terms of morphological form.",
        "The method works by exploiting a degree of correlation between form and order (e.g. capital letters indicate nominal modifiers, which typically occur to the right).",
        "Mitchell (2009) applies a less ?direct?",
        "approach, clustering adjectives based on their position in multiple-modifier strings.",

        "Dunlop et al. (2010) apply Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), a statistical technique for automatic sequence ordering, which, as with Malouf's system, quantifies word-similarity based solely on morphological features.",

(2011) showed that a simple n-gram (direct evidence) classifier trained on 170 million words of New York Times and Wall Street Journal text and tested on the Brown Corpus (82.3% accuracy) outperforms both the clustering (69.0%) and MSA (81.8%) methods.",
        "Wulff (2003) uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to quantify the effects of various potential AO correlates, and confirms that semantic features are better predictors than morphological and syntactic features.",
        "The features, extracted from the 10-million word Spoken British National Corpus (BNC) and weighted by LDA, combine to predict unseen adjective orders with 72% accuracy.",
        "Wulff's study is unique in applying semantics to the problem, although her focus is theoretical and several features are implemented manually.",

        "Once trained, the system orders unseen combinations in the test data with accuracy of 73.0%, as detailed in Table 2.",
        "This figure is not directly comparable with previous work because of differences in the evaluation framework.",
        "It is notable that the accuracy of the classifier rises to 86.2% when the test data is hand-picked as the 3000 pairs for which the strength of ordering preference is highest.4 This suggests that the approach could be particularly effective at detecting highly unnatural combinations.",
        "Moreover, the performance when tested on the 3000 (unseen) pairs with the lowest ordering preference is 70.1%, indicating the potential to cope well with marginal cases and rare combinations.",

        "The relative magnitude of the model coefficients is not informative, since the measurement scale is not common to all features.",

      "text": [
        "This paper has tested the efficacy of applying automatic subjectivity quantification to the problem of AO.",
        "The reported results highlight the utility of such semantically oriented approaches.",
        "Although direct comparison with existing systems was beyond the scope of this study, exploratory analyses suggested that a refined version of this system might compare favorably with reported benchmarks, if trained on a corpus of comparable size.",
        "Nevertheless, the comparatively weak performance of the present system on previously seen examples (?underfitting?, see Table 2) is strong evidence that six features alone are insufficient to capture the complexity of ordering patterns.",
        "Therefore, beyond the adjustments discussed above, the next stage in this research will evaluate the effects of combining semantic features with direct evidence in a single system.",
        "Other future work might apply subjectivity features to cluster adjectives into classes pertinent to AO, perhaps in combination with independent distributional measures of semantic similarity.",
        "Finally, the approach presented here for English AO could have applications across languages, and may also be applicable to related tasks, such as ordering binomials5, parsing noun phrases (?wild animal hunt?",
        "vs. ?wild birthday party?)",
        "and selecting thematically appropriate modifiers for a given head noun.",
        "Some interesting theoretical insights also emerge as a corollary to the results of this study.",
        "The supposition that gradability, polarity, adver-biability, predicativity and ?nouniness?",
        "can be associated, either positively or negatively, with subjectivity, was confirmed.",
        "Moreover, the performance of the classifier lends support to the status of subjectivity as a determining principle of AO, and an important dimension of adjective semantics in general.",
        "As such, the reason we say beautiful English rose, (c.240,000 direct matches on Google) and not English beautiful rose (c.2,730) is because beauty is in the eye of the beholder, whereas nationality, evidently, is not.",
