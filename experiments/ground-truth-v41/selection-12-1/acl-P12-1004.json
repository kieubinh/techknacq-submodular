        "Nowadays, modern portable devices, such as the smartphones and tablets, are equipped with microphone and touchscreen display.",

        "Currently, text entry using an onscreen virtual keyboard is the most widely adopted input method on these modern mobile devices.",
        "Unfortunately, typing with a small virtual keyboard can sometimes be cumbersome and frustratingly slow for many people.",
        "Instead of using a virtual keyboard, it is also possible to use handwriting gestures to input text.",
        "Handwriting input offers a more convenient input method for writing systems with complex orthography, including many Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean.",
        "However, handwriting input is not necessarily more efficient compared to keyboard input for English.",
        "Moreover, handwriting recognition is susceptible to recognition errors, too.",
        "Voice input offers a hands-free solution for text entry.",
        "This is an attractive alternative for text entry because it completely eliminates the need for typing.",
        "Voice input is also more natural and faster for human to convey messages.",
        "Normally, the average human speaking rate is approximately 100 words per minute (WPM).",
        "Clarkson et al. (2005) showed that the typing speed for regular users reaches only 86.79 ?",
        "98.31 using a full-size keyboard and 58.61 ?",
        "61.44 WPM using a mini-QWERTY keyboard.",
        "Evidently, speech input is the preferred text entry method, provided that speech signals can be reliably and efficiently converted into texts.",
        "Unfortunately, voice input relies on automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Rabiner, 1989) technology, which requires high computational resources and is susceptible to performance degradation due to acoustic interference, such as the presence of noise.",
        "In order to improve the reliability and efficiency of ASR, Haptic Voice Recognition (HVR) was proposed by Sim (2010) as a novel multimodal input method combining both speech and touch inputs.",
        "Touch inputs are used to generate haptic events, which correspond to the initial letters of the words in the spoken utterance.",
        "In addition to the regular beam",
        "pruning used in traditional ASR (Ortmanns et al., 1997), search paths which are inconsistent with the haptic events are also pruned away to achieve further reduction in the recognition search space.",
        "As a result, the runtime of HVR is generally more efficient than ASR.",
        "Furthermore, haptic events are not susceptible to acoustic distortion, making HVR more robust to noise.",
        "This paper proposes a probabilistic framework that encompasses multiple knowledge sources for combining the speech and touch inputs.",
        "This framework allows coherent probabilistic models of different knowledge sources to be tightly integrated.",
        "In addition to the acoustic model and language model used in ASR, haptic model and partial lexical model are also introduced to facilitate the integration of more sophisticated haptic events, such as the keystrokes, into HVR.",

        "There are many techniques reported in the literature which aim at improving the robustness of ASR in noisy environment.",
        "These techniques can be largely divided into two groups: 1) using speech enhancement techniques to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the noisy speech (Ortega-Garcia and Gonzalez-Rodriguez, 1996); and 2) using model-based compensation schemes to adapt the acoustic models to noisy environment (Gales and Young, 1996; Acero et al., 2000).",

        "On the other hand, there are significant speedup in the runtime of HVR systems.",
