        "We analyzed the difficulty of extending traditional sentence-level discourse parsing to text-level parsing by showing that using exactly the same set of features, the performance of Structure and Relation classification on cross-sentence instances is consistently inferior to that on within-sentence instances.",
        "We also explored the effect of contextual features on the overall performance.",
        "We showed that contextual features are highly effective for both Structure and Relation classification under all discourse conditions.",
        "Although perfect contextual features are available only in idealized situations, when they are correct, together with other features, they can almost correctly predict the tree structure and better predict the relation labels.",
        "Therefore, an iterative updating approach, which progressively updates the tree structure and the labeling based on the current estimation, may push the final results toward this idealized end.",
