        "There has been much recent interest in identifying events, times and their relations along the timeline, from event and time ordering problems in the Temp-Eval shared tasks (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010), to identifying time arguments of event structures in the Automated Content Extraction program (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2005; Gupta and Ji, 2009), to timestamping event intervals in the Knowledge Base Population shared task (Artiles et al., 2011; Amigo?",
        "et al, 2011).",
        "However, to date, this research has produced fragmented document timelines, because only specific types of temporal relations in specific contexts have been targeted.",
        "For example, the TempEval tasks only looked at relations between events in the same or adjacent sentences (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010), and the Automated Content Extraction program only looked at time arguments for specific types of events, like being born or transferring money.",
        "In this article, we propose an approach to temporal information extraction that identifies a single connected timeline for a text.",
        "The temporal language in a text often fails to specify a total ordering over all the events, so we annotate the timelines as temporal dependency structures, where each event is a node in the dependency tree, and each edge between nodes represents a temporal ordering relation such as BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP or IDENTITY.",
        "We construct an evaluation corpus by annotating such temporal dependency trees over a set of children's stories.",

        "The TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b; Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) provided a corpus annotated for all events and times, but temporal relations were only annotated when the relation was judged to be salient by the annotator.",
        "In the TempEval competitions (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010), annotated texts were provided for a few different event and time configurations, for example, an event and a time in the same sentence, or two main-clause events from adjacent sentences.",
        "Bethard et al. (2007) proposed to annotate temporal relations one syntactic construction at a time, producing an initial corpus of only verbal events linked to events in subordinated clauses.",
        "One notable exception to this pattern of incomplete timelines is the work of Bramsen et al. (2006) where temporal structures were annotated as directed acyclic graphs.",
        "However they worked on a much coarser granularity, annotating not the ordering between individual events, but between multi-sentence segments of text.",
        "In part because of the structure of the available training corpora, most existing temporal information extraction models formulate temporal linking as a pairwise classification task, where each pair of events and/or times is examined and classified as having a temporal relation or not.",
        "Early work on the TimeBank took this approach (Boguraev and Ando, 2005), classifying relations between all events and times within 64 tokens of each other.",
        "Most of the top-performing systems in the TempEval competitions also took this pairwise classification approach for both event-time and event-event temporal relations (Bethard and Martin, 2007; Cheng et al., 2007; UzZa-man and Allen, 2010; Llorens et al., 2010).",
        "Systems have also tried to take advantage of more global information to ensure that the pairwise classifications satisfy temporal logic transitivity constraints, using frameworks such as integer linear programming and Markov logic networks (Bramsen et al., 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2009; UzZaman and Allen, 2010).",
        "Yet the basic approach is still centered around pairwise classifications, not the complete temporal structure of a document.",
        "Our work builds upon this prior research, both improving the annotation approach to generate the fully connected timeline of a story, and improving the models for timeline extraction using dependency parsing techniques.",
        "We use the annotation scheme introduced in more detail in Bethard et.",

        "In this article, we have presented an approach to temporal information extraction that represents the timeline of a story as a temporal dependency tree.",
        "We have constructed an evaluation corpus where such temporal dependencies have been annotated over a set of 100 children's stories.",
        "We have introduced two dependency parsing techniques for extracting story timelines and have shown that both outperform a rule-based baseline and a prior-work-inspired pairwise classification baseline.",
        "Comparing the two dependency parsing models, we have found that a shift-reduce parser, which more closely mirrors the incremental processing of our human annotators, outperforms a graph-based maximum spanning tree parser.",
        "Our error analysis of the shift-reduce parser revealed that being able to estimate differences in event durations may play a key role in improving parse quality.",
        "We have focused on children's stories in this study, in part because they typically have simpler temporal structures (though not so simple that our rule-based baseline could parse them accurately).",
        "In most of our fables, there were only one or two characters with at most one or two simultaneous sequences of actions.",
        "In other domains, the timeline of a text is likely to be more complex.",
        "For example, in clinical records, descriptions of patients may jump back and forth between the patient history, the current examination, and procedures that have not yet happened.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate how to best apply the dependency structure approach to such domains.",
        "One approach might be to first group events into their narrative containers (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2011), for example, grouping together all events linked to the time of a patient's examination.",
        "Then within each narrative container, our dependency parsing approach could be applied.",
        "Another approach might be to join the individual timeline trees into a document-wide tree via discourse relations or relations to the document creation time.",
        "Work on how humans incrementally process such timelines in text may help to decide which of these approaches holds the most promise."
