        "First, bound morphemes in translation hypotheses are segmented.",

        "Our model scores hypotheses during decoding.",
        "Unlike previous models for scoring syntactic relations, our model does not require bitext annotations, phrase table features, or decoder modifications.",
        "The model can be implemented using the feature APIs of popular phrase-based decoders such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and Phrasal (Cer et al., 2010).",

        "Our class-based agreement model improves translation quality by promoting local agreement, but with a minimal increase in decoding time and no additional storage requirements for the phrase table.",

        "We achieved best results when the model training data, MT tuning set, and MT evaluation set contained roughly the same genre.",
        "Nevertheless, we also showed an improvement, albeit less significant, on mixed genre evaluation sets.",
        "In principle, our class-based model should be more robust to unseen word types and other phenomena that make non-newswire genres challenging.",
        "However, our analysis has shown that for Arabic, these genres typically contain more Latin script and transliterated words, and thus there is less morphology to score.",
