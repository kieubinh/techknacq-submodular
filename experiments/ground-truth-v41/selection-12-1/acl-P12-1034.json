        "However, reviews only give the evaluations and experiences of the reviewers.",
        "Often a reviewer may not be an expert of the product and may misuse the product or make other mistakes.",
        "There may also be aspects of the product that the reviewer did not mention but a reader wants to know.",
        "Some reviewers may even write fake reviews to promote some products, which is called opinion spamming (Jindal and Liu 2008).",
        "To improve the online review system and user experience, some review hosting sites allow readers to write comments about reviews (apart from just providing a feedback by clicking whether the review is helpful or not).",
        "Many reviews receive a large number of comments.",
        "It is difficult for a reader to read them to get a gist of them.",
        "An automated comment analysis would be very helpful.",
        "Review comments mainly contain the following information: Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: Some readers may comment on whether they find the review useful in helping them make a buying decision.",
        "Agreement or disagreement: Some readers who comment on a review may be users of the product themselves.",
        "They often state whether they agree or disagree with the review.",
        "Such comments are valuable as they provide a second opinion, which may even identify fake reviews because a genuine user often can easily spot reviewers who have never used the product.",
        "Question and answer: A commenter may ask for clarification or about some aspects of the product that are not covered in the review.",
        "In this paper, we use statistical modeling to model review comments.",
        "Two new generative models are proposed.",

        "Agreement (e.g., ?I agree?",
        ").",

        "TME provides a basic model for extracting these pieces of information and topics.",
        "Its generative process separates topics and C-expression types using a switch variable and treats posts as random mixtures over latent topics and C-expression types.",
        "The second model, called ME-TME, improves TME by using Maximum-Entropy priors to guide topic/expression switching.",
        "In short, the two models provide a principled and integrated approach to simultaneously discover topics and C-expressions, which is the goal of this work.",
        "Note that topics are usually product aspects in this work.",
        "The extracted C-expressions and topics from review comments are very useful in practice.",
        "First of all, C-expressions enable us to perform more accurate classification of comments, which can give us a good evaluation of the review quality and credibility.",
        "For example, a review with many Disagreeing and Thumbs-down comments is dubious.",
        "Second, the extracted C-expressions and topics help identify the key product aspects that people are troubled with in disagreements and in questions.",
        "Our experimental results in Section 5 will demonstrate these capabilities of our models.",
        "With these pieces of information, comments for a review can be summarized.",
        "The summary may include, but not limited to, the following: (1) percent of people who give the review thumbs-up or thumbs-down; (2) percent of people who agree or disagree (or contend) with the reviewer; (3) contentious (disagreed) aspects (or topics); (4) aspects about which people often have questions.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported work on such a fine-grained modeling of review comments.",
        "The related works are mainly in sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu 2012), e.g., topic and sentiment modeling, review quality prediction and review spam detection.",
        "However, our work is different from them.",
        "We will compare with them in detail in Section 2.",

        "There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), labeled (Ramage et al., 2009), partially-labeled (Ramage et al., 2011), constrained (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) models, etc.",
        "These models produce only topics but not multiple types of expressions together with topics.",
        "Note that in labeled models, each document is labeled with one or multiple labels.",
        "For our work, there is no label for each comment.",
        "Our labeling is on topical terms and C-expressions with the purpose of obtaining some priors to separate topics and C-expressions.",
        "In sentiment analysis, researchers have jointly modeled topics and sentiment words (Lin and He, 2009; Mei et al., 2007; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Lu et al., 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Maghaddam and Ester, 2011; Sauper et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a).",
        "Our model is more related to the ME-LDA model in (Zhao et al., 2010), which used a switch variable trained with Maximum-Entropy to separate topic and sentiment words.",
        "We also use such a variable.",
        "However, unlike sentiments and topics in reviews, which are emitted in the same sentence, C-expressions often interleave with topics across sentences and the same comment post may also have multiple types of C-expressions.",
        "Additionally, C-expressions are mostly phrases rather than individual words.",
        "Thus, a different model is required to model them.",
        "There have also been works aimed at putting authors in debate into support/oppose camps, e.g., (Galley et al., 2004; Agarwal et al., 2003; Murakami and Raymond, 2010), modeling debate discussions considering reply relations (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012b), and identifying stances in debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Thomas et al.,",
        "2006; Burfoot et al., 2011).",
        "(Yano and Smith, 2010) also modeled the relationship of a blog post and the number of comments it receives.",
        "These works are different as they do not mine C-expressions or discover the points of contention and questions in comments.",
        "In (Kim et al., 2006; Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006; Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2007; Liu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; O?Mahony and Smyth, 2009; Tsur and Rappoport 2009), various classification and regression approaches were taken to assess the quality of reviews.",
