        "These two sentences have the same sequence of lexical syntactic categories (VP-NP-SCOMP), but the first is a simple transitive (?X understood Y?",
        "), while the second is a ditransitive with a sentential complement (?X persuaded Y that Z?",

        "Kim (VP persuaded (NP the judge) (SCOMP that Sandy was present))",
        "An SCF lexicon would indicate that ?persuade?",
        "is likely to take a direct object and sentential complement (NP-SCOMP), while ?understand?",
        "is more likely to take just a direct object (NP).",
        "A comprehensive lexicon would also include semantic information about selectional preferences (or restrictions) on argument heads of verbs, diathesis alternations (i.e. semantically-motivated alternations between pairs of SCFs) and a mapping from surface frames to the underlying predicate-argument structure.",
        "Information about verb subcategorization is useful for tasks like information extraction (Cohen and Hunter, 2006; Rupp et al., 2010), verb clustering (Korhonen et al., 2006b; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001) and parsing (Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "In general, tasks that depend on predicate-argument structure can benefit from a high-quality SCF lexicon (Surdeanu et al., 2003).",
        "Large, manually-constructed SCF lexicons mostly target general language (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987; Grishman et al., 1994).",
        "However, in many domains verbs exhibit different syntactic behavior (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998; Lippincott et al., 2010).",
        "For example, the verb ?develop?",
        "has specific usages in newswire, biomedicine and engineering that dramatically change its probability distribution over SCFs.",
        "In a few domains like biomedicine, the need for focused SCF lexicons has led to manually-built resources (Bodenreider, 2004).",
        "Such resources, however, are costly, prone to human error, and in domains where new lexical and syntactic constructs are frequently coined, quickly become obsolete (Cohen and Hunter, 2006).",
        "Data-driven methods for SCF acquisition can alleviate",
        "these problems by building lexicons tailored to new domains with less manual effort, and higher coverage and scalability.",
        "Unfortunately, high quality SCF lexicons are difficult to build automatically.",
        "The argument-adjunct distinction is challenging even for humans, many SCFs have no reliable cues in data, and some SCFs (e.g. those involving control such as type raising) rely on semantic distinctions.",
        "As SCFs follow a Zip-fian distribution (Korhonen et al., 2000), many genuine frames are also low in frequency.",
        "State-of-the-art methods for building data-driven SCF lexicons typically rely on parsed input (see section 2).",
        "However, the treebanks necessary for training a high-accuracy parsing model are expensive to build for new domains.",
        "Moreover, while parsing may aid the detection of some frames, many experiments have also reported SCF errors due to noise from parsing (Korhonen et al., 2006a; Preiss et al., 2007).",
        "Finally, many SCF acquisition methods operate with predefined SCF inventories.",
        "This subscribes to a single (often language or domain-specific) interpretation of subcategorization a priori, and ignores the ongoing debate on how this interpretation should be tailored to new domains and applications, such as the more prominent role of adjuncts in information extraction (Cohen and Hunter, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel probabilistic data-driven method for SCF acquisition aimed at addressing some of the problems with current approaches.",
        "In our model, a Bayesian network describes how verbs choose their arguments in terms of a small number of frames, which are represented as distributions over syntactic relationships.",
        "First, we show that by allowing the inference process to automatically define a probabilistic SCF inventory, we outperform systems with hand-crafted rules and inventories, using identical syntactic features.",
        "Second, by replacing the syntactic features with an approximation based on POS tags, we achieve state-of-the-art performance without relying on error-prone unlexicalized or domain-specific lex-icalized parsers.",
        "Third, we highlight a key advantage of our method compared to previous approaches: the ease of integrating and performing joint inference of additional syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We describe how we plan to exploit this in our future research."

        "Many state-of-the-art SCF acquisition systems take grammatical relations (GRs) as input.",
        "GRs express binary dependencies between lexical items, and many parsers produce them as output, with some variation in inventory (Briscoe et al., 2006; De Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "For example, a subject-relation like ?ncsubj(HEAD, DEPENDENT)?",
        "expresses the fact that the lexical item referred to by HEAD (such as a present-tense verb) has the lexical item referred to by DEPENDENT as its subject (such as a singular noun).",
        "GR inventories include direct and indirect objects, complements, conjunctions, among other relations.",
        "The dependency relationships included in GRs correspond closely to the head-complement structure of SCFs, which is why they are the natural choice for SCF acquisition.",
        "There are several SCF lexicons for general language, such as ANLT (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987) and COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994), that depend on manual work.",
        "VALEX (Preiss et al., 2007) provides SCF distributions for 6,397 verbs acquired from a parsed general language corpus via a system that relies on hand-crafted rules.",
        "There are also resources which provide information about both syntactic and semantic properties of verbs: VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008) draws on several hand-built and semi-automatic sources to link the syntax and semantics of 5,726 verbs.",
        "FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) provides semantic frames and annotated example sentences for 4,186 verbs.",
        "PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is a corpus where each verb is annotated for its arguments and their semantic roles, covering a total of 4,592 verbs.",
        "There are many language-specific SCF acquisition systems, e.g. for French (Messiant, 2008), Italian (Lenci et al., 2008), Turkish (Han et al., 2008) and Chinese (Han et al., 2008).",
        "These typically rely on language-specific knowledge, either directly through heuristics, or indirectly through parsing models trained on treebanks.",
        "Furthermore, some require labeled training instances for supervised (Uzun et al., 2008) or semi-supervised (Han et al., 2008) learning algorithms.",
        "Two state-of-the-art data-driven systems for English verbs are those that produced VALEX, Preiss et al.",
        "(2007), and the BioLexicon (Venturi et al., 2009).",
        "The Preiss system extracts a verb instance's GRs using the Rasp general-language unlexicalized parser (Briscoe et al., 2006) as input, and based on hand-crafted rules, maps verb instances to a predefined inventory of 168 SCFs.",
        "Filtering is then performed to remove noisy frames, with methods ranging from a simple single threshold to SCF-specific hypothesis tests based on external verb classes and SCF inventories.",
        "The BioLexicon system extracts each verb instance's GRs using the lexicalized Enju parser tuned to the biomedical domain (Miyao, 2005).",
        "Each unique GR-set considered a potential SCF, and an experimentally-determined threshold is used to filter low-frequency SCFs.",
        "Note that both methods require extensive manual work: the Preiss system involves the a priori definition of the SCF inventory, careful construction of matching rules, and an unlexicalized parsing model.",
        "The BioLexicon system induces its SCF inventory automatically, but requires a lexicalized parsing model, rendering it more sensitive to domain variation.",
        "Both rely on a filtering stage that depends on external resources and/or gold standards to select top-performing thresholds.",
        "Our method, by contrast, does not use a predefined SCF inventory, and can perform well without parsed input.",
        "Graphical models have been increasingly popular for a variety of tasks such as distributional semantics (Blei et al., 2003) and unsupervised POS tagging (Finkel et al., 2007), and sampling methods allow efficient estimation of full joint distributions (Neal, 1993).",
        "The potential for joint inference of complementary information, such as syntactic verb and semantic argument classes, has a clear and interpretable way forward, in contrast to the pipelined methods described above.",
        "This was demonstrated in Andrew et al. (2004), where a Bayesian model was used to jointly induce syntactic and semantic classes for verbs, although that study relied on manually annotated data and a predefined SCF inventory and MLE.",
        "More recently, Abend and Rappoport (2010) trained ensemble classifiers to perform argument-adjunct disambiguation of PP complements, a task closely related to SCF acquisition.",
        "Their study employed unsupervised POS tagging and parsing, and measures of selectional preference and argument structure as complementary features for the classifier.",
        "Finally, our task-based evaluation, verb clustering with Levin (1993)'s alternation classes as the gold standard, was previously conducted by Joanis and Stevenson (2003), Korhonen et al. (2008) and Sun and Korhonen (2009)."

        "Our study reached two important conclusions: first, given the same data as input, an unsupervised probabilistic model can outperform a hand-crafted rule-based SCF extractor with a predefined inventory.",
        "We achieve better results with far less effort than previous approaches by allowing the data to govern the definition of frames while estimating the verb-specific distributions in a fully Bayesian manner.",
        "Second, simply treating POS tags within a small window of the verb as pseudo-GRs produces state-of-the-art results without the need for a parsing model.",
        "This is particularly encouraging when building resources for new domains, where complex models fail to generalize.",
        "In fact, by integrating results from unsupervised POS tagging (Teichert and Daume?",
        "III, 2009) we could render this approach fully domain-and language-independent.",
        "We did not dwell on issues related to choosing our hyper-parameters or latent class count.",
        "Both of these can be accomplished with additional sampling methods: hyper-parameters of Dirichlet priors can be estimated via slice sampling (Heinrich, 2009), and their dimensionality via Dirichlet Process priors (Heinrich, 2011).",
        "This could help address the redundancy we find in the induced SCF inventory, with the potential SCFs growing to accommodate the data.",
        "Our initial attempt at applying graphical models to subcategorization also suggested several ways to extend and improve the method.",
        "First, the independence assumptions between GRs in a given instance turned out to be too strong.",
        "To address this, we could give instances internal structure to capture conditional probability between generated GRs.",
        "Second, our results showed the conflation of several verbal aspects, most notably the syntactic and semantic.",
        "In a sense this is encouraging, as it motivates our most exciting future work: augmenting this simple model to explicitly capture complementary information such as distributional semantics (Blei et al., 2003), diathesis alternations (McCarthy, 2000) and selectional preferences (O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2010).",
        "This study targeted high-frequency verbs, but the use of syntactic and semantic classes would also help with data sparsity down the road.",
        "These extensions would also call for a more comprehensive evaluation, averaging over several tasks, such as clustering by semantics, syntax, alternations and selectional preferences.",
        "In concrete terms, we plan to introduce latent variables corresponding to syntactic, semantic and alternation classes, that will determine a verb's syntactic arguments, their semantic realization (i.e. selectional preferences), and possible predicate-argument structures.",
        "By combining the syntactic classes with unsupervised POS tagging (Teichert and Daume?",
        "III, 2009) and the selectional preferences with distributional semantics (O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2010), we hope to produce more accurate results on these complementary tasks while avoiding the use of any supervised learning.",
        "Finally, a fundamental advantage of a data-driven, parse-free method is that it can be easily trained for new domains.",
        "We next plan to test our method on a new domain, such as biomedical text, where verbs are known to take on distinct syntactic behavior (Lippincott et al., 2010)."
