        "There are, however, inherent problems in the entity repositories: (a) coverage: although coverage of head entity types is often reliable, the tail can be sparse; (b) noise: created by spammers, extraction errors or errors in crowdsourced content; (c) ambiguity: multiple types or entity identifiers are often associated with the same surface string; and (d) over-expression: many entities have types that are never used in the context of Web search.",
        "There is an opportunity to automatically tailor knowledge repositories to the Web search scenario.",
        "Desirable capabilities of such a system include: (a) determining the prior type distribution in Web search for each entity in the repository; (b) assigning a type distribution to new entities; (c) inferring the correct sense of an entity in a particular query context; and (d) adapting to a search engine and time period.",
        "In this paper, we build such a system by lever-aging Web search usage logs with large numbers of user sessions seeking or transacting on entities.",
