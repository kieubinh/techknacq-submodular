        "Here, we use a probabilistic model to infer a structured representation of canonical forms of entity attributes through transductive learning from named entity mentions with a small number of seeds (see Table 1).",
        "The input is a collection of mentions found by a named entity recognizer, along with their con-texts, and, following Eisenstein et al. (2011), the output is a table in which entities are rows (the number of which is not pre-specified) and attribute words are organized into columns.",

        "In this scenario, given a few seed examples, the model begins to identify simple relations among named entities (in addition to discovering attribute structures), since attributes are expressed as named entities across multiple mentions.",

        "Initially, each unique mention forms its own cluster that we incrementally merge together to form rows in the table.",
        "This method requires a similarity score between two clusters.",
        "For the politics dataset, we follow Eisenstein et al. (2011) and use the string edit distance between mention strings in each cluster to define the score.",
        "For the sports dataset, since mentions contain person and organization named entity types, our score for clustering uses the Jaccard distance between context words of the mentions.",
        "However, such clusterings do not produce columns.",
        "Therefore, we first match words in mentions of type person against a regular expression to recognize entity attributes from a fixed set of titles and suffixes, and the first, middle and last names.",
        "We treat words in mentions of type organization as a single attribute.7 As we merge clusters together, we arrange words such that 6Eisenstein et al. (2011) used precision and recall for their similarity function.",
        "Precision prefers a more compact response row (or column), which unfairly penalizes situations like those of our sports dataset, where rows are heterogeneous (e.g., including people and organizations).",
        "Consider a response table made up of two rows: ?Kobe, Bryant?",
        "and ?Los, Ange-les, Lakers?, and a reference table containing all NBA players and their team names, e.g., ?Kobe, Bryant, Los, Angeles, Lakers?.",
        "Evaluating with the precision similarity function, we will have perfect precision by matching the first row to the reference row for Kobe Bryant and the latter row to any Lakers player.",
        "The system is not rewarded for merging the two rows together, even if they are describing the same entity.",
        "Our evaluation scores, however, reward the system for accurately filling in more cells.",
        "7Note that the baseline system uses NER tags, list of titles and suffixes; which are also provided to our model through the features in ?3.1.2.",
        "all words within a column belong to the same at-tribute, creating columns as necessary to accomo-date multiple similar attributes as a result of merging.",
        "We can evaluate the tables produced by each step of the clustering to obtain the entire sequence of response-reference scores.",
        "As a strong baseline, we also compare our approach with the original implementation of the model of Eisenstein et al. (2011), denoted by EEA.",

        "The results for the politics dataset are shown in Figure 2.",
        "Our model consistently outperformed both baselines.",
        "We also analyze how much each of our four main extensions (shape features, context information, noise, and first-order column dependencies) to EEA contributes to overall performance by ablating each in turn (also shown in Fig. 2).",
        "The best-performing complete model has 415 rows, of which 113 were matched to the reference table.",
        "Shape features are useful: removing them was detrimental, and they work even better without column dependencies.",
        "Indeed, the best model did not have column dependencies.",
        "Removing context features had a strong negative effect, though perhaps this could be overcome with a more carefully tuned initializer.",
        "In row evaluation, the baseline system can achieve a high reference score by creating one entity row per unique string, but as it merges strings, the clusters encompass more word tokens, improving response score at the expense of reference score.",
        "With fewer clusters, there are fewer entities in the response table for matching and the response score suffers.",
        "Although we use the same seed table in both exper-iments, the results from EEA are below the baseline curve because it has the additional complexity of inferring the number of columns from data.",

        "Furthermore, fixing C (unlike EEA) does appear to have benefits.",

        "The EEA model is not designed for this and performed poorly.",
        "Our model can do better, since it makes use of context information and features, and it can put a person and an organization in one row even though they do not share common words.",
        "Table 4 shows a few noteworthy entities from our complete model's output.",
        "Surprisingly, the model failed to infer that Derek Jeter plays for New York Yankees, although mentions of the organization New York Yankees can be found in our dataset.",
        "This is because the model did not see enough evidence to put them in the same row.",
        "However, it successfully inferred the missing information for Ben Roethlisberger.",
        "The next two rows show cases where our model successfully matched players with their teams and put each word token to its respective column.",

        "It shows that in some cases context information is not adequate, and a possible improvement might be obtained by providing more context to the model.",
        "The sixth row is interesting because Dave Toub is indeed affiliated with the Chicago Bears.",
        "However, when the model saw a mention token The Bears, it did not have any other columns to put the word token The, and decided to put it in the fourth column although it is not a location.",
        "If we added more columns, determiners could become another attribute of the entities that might go into one of these new columns.",
        "5 Related Work There has been work that attempts to fill predefined templates using Bayesian nonparametrics (Haghighi and Klein, 2010) and automatically learns template structures using agglomerative clustering (Cham- bers and Jurafsky, 2011).",
        "Charniak (2001) and Elsner et al. (2009) focused specifically on names and discovering their structure, which is a part of the problem we consider here.",
        "More similar to our work, Eisenstein et al. (2011) introduced a nonparametric Bayesian approach to extract structured databases of entities.",
        "A fundamental difference of our approach from any of the previous work is it maximizes conditional likelihood and thus allows beneficial incorporation of arbitrary features.",
        "Our model is focused on the problem of canonicalizing mention strings into their parts, though its r variables (which map mentions to rows) could be interpreted as (within-document and cross-document) coreference resolution, which has been tackled using a range of probabilistic models (Li et al., 2004; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Singh et al., 2011).",
        "We have not evaluated it as such, believing that further work should be done to integrate appropriate linguistic cues before such an application."
