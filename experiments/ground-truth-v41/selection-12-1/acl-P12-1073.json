        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a frequently needed technology in NLP applications.",
        "State-of-the-art statistical models for NER typically require a large amount of training data and linguistic expertise to be sufficiently accurate, which makes it nearly impossible to build high-accuracy models for a large number of languages.",
        "Recently, there have been two lines of work which have offered hope for creating NER analyzers in many languages.",
        "The first has been to devise an algorithm to tag foreign language entities using metadata from the semi-structured Wikipedia repository: inter-wiki links, article categories, and cross-language links (Richman and Schone, 2008).",
        "The second has been to use parallel English-foreign language data, a high-quality NER tagger for English, and projected annotations for the foreign language (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "Parallel data has also been used to improve existing monolingual taggers or other analyzers in two languages (Burkett et al., 2010a; Burkett et al., 2010b).",
        "?This research was conducted during the author's internship at Microsoft Research The goal of this work is to create high-accuracy NER annotated data for foreign languages.",
        "Here we combine elements of both Wikipedia metadata-based approaches and projection-based approaches, making use of parallel sentences extracted from Wikipedia.",
        "We propose a statistical model which can combine the two types of information.",
        "Similarly to the joint model of Burkett et al. (2010a), our model can incorporate both monolingual and bilingual features in a log-linear framework.",
        "The advantage of our model is that it is much more efficient as it does not require summing over matchings of source and target entities.",
        "It is a conditional model for target sentence annotation given an aligned English source sentence, where the English sentence is used only as a source of features.",
        "Exact inference is performed using standard semi-markov CRF model inference techniques (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "Our results show that the semi-CRF model improves on the performance of projection models by more than 10 points in F-measure, and that we can achieve tagging F-measure of over 91 using a very small number of annotated sentence pairs.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: We first describe the datasets and task setting in Section 2.",
        "Next, we present our two baseline methods: A Wikipedia metadata-based tagger and a cross-lingual projection tagger in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.",

        "As we can see, less than 100% of entities have parallels in the other language.",
        "This is due to two phenomena: one is that the parallel sentences sometimes contain different amounts of information and one language might use more detail than the other.",
        "The other is that the same information might be expressed using a named entity in one language, and using a nonentity phrase in the other language (e.g. ?He is from Bulgaria?",

        "We look at performance using four sets of features: (i) Monolingual Wiki-tagger based, using only the features in Group 1 (MONO); (ii) Bilingual label match and Wiki-tagger based, using features in Groups 1 and 3 (BI); (iii) Monolingual all, using features in Groups 1 and 2 (MONO-ALL), and (iv) Bilingual all, using all features (BI-ALL).",
        "Additionally, we report performance of the full bilingual model with all features, but when English candidate entities are generated only according to the local+global Wiki-taggger (BI-ALL-WT).",
        "The main results show that the full semi-CRF model greatly outperforms the baseline projection and Wiki-taggers.",
        "For Bulgarian, the F-measure of the full model is 92.8 compared to the best baseline result of 83.2.",
        "For Korean, the F-measure of the semi-CRF is 91.2, more than 10 points higher than the performance of the projection model.",
        "Within the semi-CRF model, the contribution of English sentence context was substantial, leading to 2.5 point increase in F-measure for Bulgarian (92.8 versus 90.3 F-measure), and 4.0 point increase for Korean (91.2 versus 87.2).",
        "The additional gain due to considering candidate source entities generated from all English taggers was 1.3 F-measure points for both language pairs (comparing models BI-ALL and BI-ALL-WT).",
        "If we restrict the semi-CRF to use only features similar to the ones used by the projection model, we still obtain performance much better than that of the projection model: comparing BI to the projection model, we see gains of 9.4 points for Bulgarian, and 4 points for Korean.",
        "This is due to the fact that the semi-CRF is able to relax the assumption of one-to-one correspondence between source and target entities, and can effectively combine information from multiple source and target taggers.",
        "We should note that the proposed method can only tag foreign sentences in English-foreign sentence pairs.",
        "The next step for this work is to train monolingual NE taggers for the foreign languages, which can work on text within or outside of Wikipedia.",
        "Preliminary results show performance of over 80 F-measure for such monolingual models."
