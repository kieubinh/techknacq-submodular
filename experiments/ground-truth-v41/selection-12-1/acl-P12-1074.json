        "A catchy, memorable and creative name is an important key to a successful business since the name provides the first image and defines the identity of the service to be promoted.",
        "A good name is able to state the area of competition and communicate the promise given to customers by evoking semantic associations.",
        "However, finding such a name is a challenging and time consuming activity, as only few words (in most cases only one or two) can be used to fulfill all these objectives at once.",
        "Besides, this task requires a good understanding of the service to be promoted, creativity and high linguistic skills to be able to play with words.",
        "Furthermore, since many new products and companies emerge every year, the naming style is continuously changing and creativity standards need to be adapted to rapidly changing requirements.",
        "The creation of a name is both an art and a science (Keller, 2003).",
        "Naming has a precise methodology and effective names do not come out of the blue.",
        "Although it might not be easy to perceive all the effort behind the naming process just based on the final output, both a training phase and a long process consisting of many iterations are certainly required for coming up with a good name.",
        "From a practical point of view, naming agencies and branding firms, together with automatic name generators, can be considered as two alternative services that facilitate the naming process.",
        "However, while the first type is generally expensive and processing can take rather long, the current automatic generators are rather na?",
        "?ve in the sense that they are based on straightforward combinations of random words.",
        "Furthermore, they do not take semantic reasoning into account.",
        "To overcome the shortcomings of these two alternative ways (i.e. naming agencies and na?",
        "?ve generators) that can be used for obtaining name suggestions, we propose a system which combines several linguistic resources and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate creative names, more specifically neologisms based on homophonic puns and metaphors.",
        "In this system, similarly to the previously mentioned generators, users are able to determine the category of the service to be promoted together with the features to be emphasized.",
        "Our improvement lies in the fact that instead of random generation, we take semantic, phonetic, lexical and morphological knowledge into consideration to automatize the naming process.",
        "Although various resources provide distinct tips for inventing creative names, no attempt has been made to combine all means of creativity that can be used during the naming process.",
        "Furthermore, in addition to the devices stated by copywriters, there",
        "might be other latent methods that these experts unconsciously use.",
        "Therefore, we consider the task of discovering and accumulating all crucial features of creativity to be essential before attempting to automatize the naming process.",
        "Accordingly, we create a gold standard of creative names and the corresponding creative devices that we collect from various sources.",

        "It should be noted that for some input",
        "class, MC) on the four annotation dimensions.",
        "combinations the system produced less than 20 neologisms.",
        "Accordingly, our dataset consists of a total number of 50 inputs and 943 neologisms.",
        "To have a concrete idea about the agreement between annotators, we calculated the majority class for each dimension.",
        "With 5 annotators, a majority class greater than or equal to 3 means that the absolute majority of the annotators agreed on the same decision.",
        "Table 3 shows the distribution of majority classes along the four dimensions of the annotation.",
        "For pleasantness (PLE) and humor (HUM), the absolute majority of the annotators (i.e. 3/5) agreed on the same decision in 100% of the cases, while for appropriateness (APP) the figure is only slightly lower.",
        "Concerning success, arguably the most subjective of the four dimensions, in 27% of the cases it is not possible to take a majority decision.",
        "Nevertheless, in almost 73% of the cases the absolute majority of the annotators agreed on the annotation of this dimension.",
        "Table 4 shows the micro and macro-average of the percentage of cases in which at least 3 annotators have labeled the ingredients as appropriate (APP), and the neologisms as pleasant (PLE), humorous (HUM) or successful (SUX).",
        "The system selects appropriate ingredients in approximately 60% of the cases, and outputs pleasant, English-sounding names in ?87% of the cases.",
        "Almost one name out of four is labeled as successful by the majority of the annotators, which we regard as a very positive result considering the difficulty of the task.",
        "Even though we do not explicitly try to inject humor in the neologisms, more than 15% of the generated names turn out to be witty or amusing.",
        "The system managed to generate at least one successful name for all 50 input categories and at least one witty name for 42.",
        "As expected, we found out that there is a very high correlation (91.56%) between the appropriateness of the",
        "four dimensions.",
        "ingredients and the success of the name.",
        "A successful name is also humorous in 42.67% of the cases, while 62.34% of the humorous names are labeled as successful.",
        "This finding confirms our intuition that amusing names have the potential to be very appealing to the customers.",
        "In more than 76% of the cases, a humorous name is the product of the combination of appropriate ingredients.",
        "In Table 2, we show a selection of successful and unsuccessful outputs generated for the category and the set of properties listed under the block of columns labeled as Input according to the majority of annotators (i.e. 3 or more).",
        "As an example of positive outcomes, we can focus on the columns under Successful output for the input target word restaurant.",
        "The model correctly selects the ingredients eat (a restaurant is UsedFor eating), pizza and pasta (which are found AtLocation restaurant) to generate an appropriate name.",
        "The three ?palatable?",
        "neologisms generated are eatalian (from the combination of eat and Italian), pastarant (pasta + restaurant) and peatza (pizza + eat).",
        "These three suggestions are amusing and have a nice ring to them.",
        "As a matter of fact, it turns out that the name Eatalian is actually used by at least one real Italian restaurant located in Los Angeles, CA3.",
        "For the same set of stimuli, the model also selects some ingredients which are not really related to the use-case, e.g., dust and hostess (both of which can be found AtLocation restaurant) and home (a synonym for plate, which can be found AtLocation restaurant, in the baseball jargon).",
        "With these ingredients, the model produces the suggestion dusta which sounds nice but has a negative connotation, and hometess which can hardly be associated to the input category.",
        "A rather common class of unsuccessful outputs include words that, by pure chance, happen to be already existing in English.",
        "In these cases, no actual neologism is generated.",
        "Sometimes, the generated",
        "words have rather unpleasant or irrelevant meanings, as in the case of bark for bar.",
        "Luckily enough, these kinds of outputs can easily be eliminated by filtering out all the output words which can already be found in an English dictionary or which are found to have a negative valence with state-of-the-art techniques (e.g. SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)).",
        "Another class of negative results includes neologisms generated from ingredients that the model cannot combine in a good English-sounding neologism (e.g. spocleang from sporting and clean for sunglasses or sasun from satin and sun for shampoo)."

        "In this paper, we have focused on the task of automatizing the naming process and described a computational approach to generate neologisms with homophonic puns based on phonetic similarity.",
        "This study is our first step towards the systematic emulation of the various creative devices involved in the naming process by means of computational methods.",
        "Due to the complexity of the problem, a unified model to handle all the creative devices at the same time seems outside the reach of the current state-of-the-art NLP techniques.",
        "Nevertheless, the resource that we collected, together with the initial implementation of this model should provide a good starting point for other researchers in the area.",
        "We believe that our contribution will motivate other research teams to invest more effort in trying to tackle the related research problems.",
        "As future work, we plan to improve the quality of the output by considering word sense disambiguation techniques to reduce the effect of inappropriate ingredients.",
        "We also want to extend the model to include multiword ingredients and to generate not only words but also short phrases.",
        "Then, we would like to focus on other classes of creative devices, such as affixation or rhyming.",
        "Lastly, we plan to make the system that we have developed publicly available and collect user feedback for further development and improvement."
