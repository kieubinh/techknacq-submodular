        "Identifying the degree of semantic similarity [SS] between two sentences is at the core of many NLP applications that focus on sentence level semantics such as Machine Translation (Kauchak and Barzi-lay, 2006), Summarization (Zhou et al., 2006), Text Coherence Detection (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005), etc.To date, almost all Sentence Similarity [SS] approaches work in the high-dimensional word space and rely mainly on word similarity.",
        "There are two main (not unrelated) disadvantages to word similarity based approaches: 1. lexical ambiguity as the pairwise word similarity ignores the semantic interaction between the word and its sentential context; 2. word co-occurrence information is not sufficiently exploited.",
        "Latent variable models, such as Latent Semantic Analysis [LSA] (Landauer et al., 1998), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis [PLSA] (Hofmann, 1999), Latent Dirichlet Allocation [LDA] (Blei et al., 2003) can solve the two issues naturally by mod-eling the semantics of words and sentences simultaneously in the low-dimensional latent space.",
        "However, attempts at addressing SS using LSA perform significantly below high dimensional word similarity based models (Mihalcea et al., 2006; O?Shea et al., 2008).",
        "We believe that the latent semantics approaches applied to date to the SS problem have not yielded positive results due to the deficient modeling of the sparsity in the semantic space.",
        "SS operates in a very limited contextual setting where the sentences are typically very short to derive robust latent semantics.",
        "Apart from the SS setting, robust modeling of the latent semantics of short sentences/texts is becoming a pressing need due to the pervasive presence of more bursty data sets such as Twitter feeds and SMS where short contexts are an inherent characteristic of the data.",
        "In this paper, we propose to model the missing words (words that are not in the sentence), a feature that is typically overlooked in the text modeling literature, to address the sparseness issue for the SS task.",
        "We define the missing words of a sentence as the whole vocabulary in a corpus minus the observed words in the sentence.",
        "Our intuition is since observed words in a sentence are too few to tell us what the sentence is about, missing words can be used to tell us what the sentence is not about.",
        "We assume that the semantic space of both the observed",
        "and missing words make up the complete semantics profile of a sentence.",
        "After analyzing the way traditional latent variable models (LSA, PLSA/LDA) handle missing words, we decide to model sentences using a weighted matrix factorization approach (Srebro and Jaakkola, 2003), which allows us to treat observed words and missing words differently.",
        "We handle missing words using a weighting scheme that distinguishes missing words from observed words yielding robust latent vectors for sentences.",
        "Since we use a feature that is already implied by the text itself, our approach is very general (similar to LSA/LDA) in that it can be applied to any format of short texts.",
        "In contrast, existing work on modeling short texts focuses on exploiting additional data, e.g., Ramage et al. (2010) model tweets using their metadata (author, hashtag, etc.).",
        "Moreover in this paper, we introduce a new evaluation framework for SS: Concept Definition Retrieval (CDR).",
        "Compared to existing data sets, the CDR data set alows for large scale tuning and testing of SS modules without further human annotation.",
        "2 Limitations of Topic Models and LSA for Modeling Sentences Usually latent variable models aim to find a latent semantic profile for a sentence that is most relevant to the observed words.",
        "By explicitly modeling missing words, we set another criterion to the latent semantics profile: it should not be related to the missing words in the sentence.",
        "However, missing words are not as informative as observed words, hence the need for a model that does a good job of modeling missing words at the right level of emphasis/impact is central to completing the semantic picture for a sentence.",
        "LSA and PLSA/LDA work on a word-sentence co-occurrence matrix.",
        "Given a corpus, the row entries of the matrix are the unique M words in the corpus, and theN columns are the sentence ids.",
        "The yielded M ?N co-occurrence matrix X comprises the TF-IDF values in each Xij cell, namely that TF-IDF value of word wi in sentence sj .",
        "For ease of exposition, we will illustrate the problem using a special case of the SS framework where the sentences are concept definitions in a dictionary such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (WN).",
        "Therefore, the sentence corresponding to the concept definition of bank#n#1 is a sparse vector in X containing the following observed words where Xij 6= 0: the 0.1, financial 5.5, institution 4, that 0.2, accept 2.1, deposit 3, and 0.1, channel 6, the 0.1, money 5, into 0.3, lend 3.5, activity 3 All the other words (girl, car,..., check, loan, business,...) in matrix X that do not occur in the concept definition are considered missing words for the concept entry bank#n#1, thereby their Xij = 0 .",
        "Topic models (PLSA/LDA) do not explicitly model missing words.",
        "PLSA assumes each document has a distribution over K topics P (zk|dj), and each topic has a distribution over all vocabularies P (wi|zk).",
        "Therefore, PLSA finds a topic distribution for each concept definition that maximizes the log likelihood of the corpus X (LDA has a similar form):",
        "In this formulation, missing words do not contribute to the estimation of sentence semantics, i.e., excluding missing words (Xij = 0) in equation 1 does not make a difference.",
        "However, empirical results show that given a small number of observed words, usually topic models can only find one topic (most evident topic) for a sentence, e.g., the concept definitions of bank#n#1 and stock#n#1 are assigned the financial topic only without any further discernability.",
        "This results in many sentences are assigned exactly the same semantics profile as long as they are pertaining/mentioned within the same domain/topic.",
        "The reason is topic models try to learn a 100- dimension latent vector (assume dimension K = 100) from very few data points (10 observed words on average).",
        "It would be desirable if topic models can exploit missing words (a lot more data than observed words) to render more nuanced latent semantics, so that pairs of sentences in the same domain can be differentiable.",
        "On the other hand, LSA explicitly models missing words but not at the right level of emphasis.",
        "LSA finds another matrix X?",
        "(latent vectors) with rank K to approximate X using Singular Vector Decomposition (X ?",
        "X?",
        "= UK?KV >K ), such that the Frobe",
        "nius norm of difference between the two matrices is minimized: ?",
        "(2) In effect, LSA allows missing and observed words to equally impact the objective function.",
        "Given the inherent short length of the sentences, LSA (equation 2) allows for much more potential influence from missing words rather than observed words (99.9% cells are 0 in X).",
        "Hence the contribution of the observed words is significantly diminished.",
        "Moreover, the true semantics of the concept definitions is actually related to some missing words, but such true semantics will not be favored by the objective function, since equation 2 allows for too strong an impact by X?ij = 0 for any missing word.",
        "Therefore the LSA model, in the context of short texts, is allowing missing words to have a significant ?uncontrolled?",
        "impact on the model."
