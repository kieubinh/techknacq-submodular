        "Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest.",
        "We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased ?",
        "the choice of words and sentence structure ?",
        "can affect this process.",
        "To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes.",
        "We find that there are significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions, even after controlling for situational and contextual factors.",
        "One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns.",
        "Another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts ?",
        "that is, more portable.",
        "We also show how the concept of ?memorable language?",
        "can be extended across domains.",
        "1 Hello.",
        "My name is Inigo Montoya.",
        "Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people's minds.",
        "An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question.",
        "Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38].",
        "There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to information on different topics [28, 36].",
        "Beyond all these factors, however, one's everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed ?",
        "the choice of words, the way it is phrased ?",
        "might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people's minds.",
        "Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, ?catchy,?",
        "or otherwise compelling.",
        "Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of ?successful?",
        "language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation.",
        "We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered ?",
        "highly-cited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extralinguistic contexts.",
        "Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or independent of these (obviously very crucial) factors?",
        "To investigate the question, one needs a way of control",
        "ling ?",
        "as much as possible ?",
        "for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays.",
        "The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question.",
        "There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition ?",
        "people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked ?",
        "and production ?",
        "people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15].",
        "One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16].",
        "Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): ?Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone.",
        "We hear them ... and store them away for future use?",
        "[10].",
        "None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on external human judgments.",
        "In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments ?",
        "perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used.",
        "Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most ?memorable?.",
        "To acquire memorability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a ?memorable quote?",
        "by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number of times it appears on the Web.",
        "Both of these serve as memorability metrics for our purposes.",
        "When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we compare them with quotes that are not assessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie.",
        "This enables us to control in a fairly fine-grained way for the confounding effects of context discussed above: we can observe differences that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting.",
        "In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDb-memorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen.",
        "This motivates a search for features intrinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorability.",
        "In fact, comments provided by the human subjects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren't tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily invoked for future (out of context) uses.",
        "We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data.",
        "The present work (ii): What distinguishes memorable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study.",
        "First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their non-memorable counterparts.",
        "Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-of-speech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire.",
        "Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns.",
        "We also identify a number of ways in which memorable quotes convey greater generality.",
        "In their patterns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and determiners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more ?free-standing,?",
        "containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text.",
        "Memorable quotes differ in other interesting aspects as well, such as sound distributions.",
        "Our analysis of memorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated.",
        "We provide evidence that such cross-domain properties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing.",
        "In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on memorable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes.",
        "This suggests that some of the principles underlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas.",
        "Roadmap ?2 lays the empirical foundations of our work: the design and creation of our movie-quotes dataset, which we make publicly available (?2.1), a pilot study with human subjects validating IMDb-based memorability labels (?2.2), and further study of incorporating search-engine counts (?2.3).",

        "To study the properties of memorable movie quotes, we need a source of movie lines and a designation of memorability.",

        "In the latter two cases, it can be hard to determine which particular portion is viewed as memorable (some involve a build-up to a punch line; others involve the follow-through after a well-phrased opening sentence), and so we focus in our comparisons on those memorable quotes that 1This extraction involved some edit-distance-based alignment, since the exact form of the line in the script can exhibit minor differences from the version typed into IMDb.",

        "Moreover, we also want to control for the fact that a quote's position in a movie can affect memorability: certain scenes produce more memorable dialogue, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, in aggregate memorable quotes also occur disproportionately near the beginnings and especially the ends of movies.",
        "In summary, then, for each M , we pick a contrasting (single-sentence) quote N from the same movie that is as close in the script as possible to M (either before or after it), subject to the conditions",

        "How an item's linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts, including evaluations of product reviews [9], political speeches [12], on-line posts [13], scientific papers [14], and retweeting of Twitter posts [36].",
