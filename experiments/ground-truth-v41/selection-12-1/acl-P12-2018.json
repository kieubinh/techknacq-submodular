        "Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are often used as baselines for other methods in text categorization and sentiment analysis research.",

        "We show that researchers have not paid sufficient attention to these model selection issues.",
        "Indeed, we show that the better variants often outperform recently published state-of-the-art methods on many datasets.",
        "We attempt to categorize which method, which variants and which features perform better under which circumstances.",
        "First, we make an important distinction between sentiment classification and topical text classification.",
        "We show that the usefulness of bigram features in bag of features sentiment classification has been underappreciated, perhaps because their usefulness is more of a mixed bag for topical text classification tasks.",
        "We then distinguish between short snippet sentiment tasks and longer reviews, showing that for the former, NB outperforms SVMs.",
        "Contrary to claims in the literature, we show that bag of features models are still strong performers on snippet sentiment classification tasks, with NB models generally outperforming the sophisticated, structure-sensitive models explored in recent work.",
        "Furthermore, by combining generative and discriminative classifiers, we present a simple model variant where an SVM is built over NB log-count ratios as feature values, and show that it is a strong and robust performer over all the presented tasks.",
        "Finally, we confirm the well-known result that MNB is normally better and more stable than multivariate Bernoulli NB, and the increasingly known result that binarized MNB is better than standard MNB.",
