        "Treebanks, sets of parsed sentences annotated with a sytactic structure, are an important resource in NLP.",
        "The manual construction of treebanks, where a human annotator selects a gold parse from all parses returned by a parser, is a tedious and error prone process.",
        "We present a system for simultaneous and accurate partial parse disambiguation of multiple languages.",
        "Using the preselected set of parses returned by the system, the treebanking process for multiple languages can be sped up.",
        "The system operates on an aligned parallel corpus.",
        "The languages of the parallel corpus are considered as mutual semantic tags: As the meaning of a sentence stays constant during translation, we are able to resolve ambiguities which exist in only one of the langauges by only accepting those interpretations which are licensed by the other language.",
        "In particular, we select one language as the target language, translate the other language's semantics for every parse into the target language and thus align maximally similar semantic representations.",
        "The parses with the most overlapping semantics are selected as preferred parses.",
        "As an example consider the English sentence They closed the shop at five, which has the following two interpretations due to PP attachment ambiguity:1",
        "(1) ?At five, they closed the shop?",
        "close(they, shop); at(close, 5) (2) ?The shop at five was closed by them?",
        "close(they, shop); at(shop, 5)",
        "The Japanese translation is also ambiguous, but in a completely different way: it has the possibility of a zero pronoun (we show the translated semantics).",
        "?At 5 o?clock, they closed the shop.",
        "?",
        "We show the semantic representation of the ambiguity with each sentence.",
        "Both languages are disambiguated by the other language as only the English interpretation (1) is supported in Japanese, and only the Japanese interpretation (3) leads to a grammatical English sentence."
