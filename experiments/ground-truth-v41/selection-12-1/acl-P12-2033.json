        "It can be used for abstractive summa-rization where extracted important sentences often need to be compressed and merged.",
        "For summarization of spontaneous speech, sentence compression is especially important, since unlike fluent and well-structured written text, spontaneous speech contains a lot of disfluencies and much redundancy.",

        "In this study we investigate sentence compression of spoken utterances in order to remove redundant or unnecessary words while trying to preserve the information in the original sentence.",

        "In text domain, (Knight and Marcu, 2000) applies noisy-channel model and decision tree approaches on this problem.",
        "(Galley and Mckeown, 2007) proposes to use a synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) based method to compress the sentence.",
        "(Cohn and La-pata, 2008) expands the operation set by including insertion, substitution and reordering, and incorporates grammar rules.",
        "In speech domain, (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) investigates sentence compression in broadcast news using an integer linear programming approach.",
        "There is only a few existing work in spontaneous speech domains.",
        "(Liu and Liu, 2010) mod-eled it as a sequence labeling problem using conditional random fields model.",
        "(Liu and Liu, 2009) compared the effect of different compression methods on a meeting summarization task, but did not evaluate sentence compression itself.",
        "We propose to use a two-step approach in this paper for sentence compression of spontaneous speech utterances.",
        "The contributions of our work are: ?",
        "Our proposed two-step approach allows us to incorporate features from local and global levels.",

        "results in better performance.",

        "The compression ratio of the best human reference is 63.64%.",
        "In the first step of our sentence compression approach (described below), for model training we need the reference labels for each word, which represents whether it is preserved or deleted in the compressed sentence.",
        "In (Liu and Liu, 2010), they used the labels from the annotators directly.",
        "In this work, we use a different way.",
        "For each sentence, we still use the best compression as the gold standard, but we realign the pair of the source sentence and the compressed sentence, instead of using the labels provided by annotators.",
        "This is because when there are repeated words, annotators sometimes randomly pick removed ones.",
        "However, we want to keep the patterns consistent for model training ?",
        "we always label the last appearance of the repeated words as ?preserved?, and the earlier ones as ?deleted?.",
        "Another difference in our processing of the corpus from the previous work is that when aligning the original and the compressed sentence, we keep filled pauses and incomplete words since they tend to appear together with disfluencies and thus provide useful information for compression."
