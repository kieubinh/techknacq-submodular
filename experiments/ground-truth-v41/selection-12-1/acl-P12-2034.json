        "These previous studies unveil interesting correlations between certain lexical items or categories with deception that may not be readily apparent to human judges.",
        "For instance, the work of Ott et al. (2011) in the hotel review domain results in very insightful observations that deceptive reviewers tend to use verbs and personal pronouns (e.g., ?I?, ?my?)",
        "more often, while truthful reviewers tend to use more of nouns, adjectives, prepositions.",
        "In parallel to these shallow lexical patterns, might there be deep syntactic structures that are lurking in deceptive writing?",
