        "Mapping instructions into automatically executable actions would enable the creation of natural language interfaces to many applications (Lau et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Orkin and Roy, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of navigation and manipulation of a virtual environment (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011).",
        "Current symbolic approaches to the problem are brittle to the natural language variation present in instructions and require intensive rule authoring to be fit for a new task (Dzikovska et al., 2008).",
        "Current statistical approaches require extensive manual annotations of the corpora used for training (MacMahon et al., 2006; Matuszek et al., 2010; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Rieser and Lemon, 2010).",
        "Manual annotation and rule authoring by natural language engineering experts are bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains.",
        "This paper proposes a fully automated approach to interpreting natural language instructions to complete a task in a virtual world based on unsupervised recordings of human-human interactions performing that task in that virtual world.",
        "Given unannotated corpora collected from humans following other humans?",
        "instructions, our system automatically segments the corpus into labeled training data for a classification algorithm.",
        "Our interpretation algorithm is based on the observation that similar instructions uttered in similar contexts should lead to similar actions being taken in the virtual world.",
        "Given a previously unseen instruction, our system outputs actions that can be directly executed in the virtual world, based on what humans did when given similar instructions in the past.",
        "2 Corpora situated in virtual worlds Our environment consists of six virtual worlds designed for the natural language generation shared task known as the GIVE Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), where a pair of partners must collaborate to solve a task in a 3D space (Figure 1).",
        "The ?instruction follower?",
        "(IF) can move around in the virtual world, but has no knowledge of the task.",
        "The ?instruction giver?",
        "(IG) types instructions to the IF in order to guide him to accomplish the task.",
        "Each corpus contains the IF's actions and position recorded every 200 milliseconds, as well as the IG's instructions with their timestamps.",
        "We used two corpora for our experiments.",
        "The Cm corpus (Gargett et al., 2010) contains instructions given by multiple people, consisting of 37 games spanning 2163 instructions over 8:17 hs.",
        "The",
        "consists of interconnecting hallways, rooms and objects Cs corpus (Benotti and Denis, 2011), gathered using a single IG, is composed of 63 games and 3417 instructions, and was recorded in a span of 6:09 hs.",
        "It took less than 15 hours to collect the corpora through the web and the subjects reported that the experiment was fun.",
        "While the environment is restricted, people describe the same route and the same objects in extremely different ways.",
        "Below are some examples of instructions from our corpus all given for the same route shown in Figure 1.",
        "1) out 2) walk down the passage 3) nowgo [sic] to the pink room 4) back to the room with the plant 5) Go through the door on the left 6) go through opening with yellow wall paper",
        "People describe routes using landmarks (4) or specific actions (2).",
        "They may describe the same object differently (5 vs 6).",
        "Instructions also differ in their scope (3 vs 1).",
        "Thus, even ignoring spelling and grammatical errors, navigation instructions contain considerable variation which makes interpreting them a challenging problem."

        "Our algorithm consists of two phases: annotation and interpretation.",
        "Annotation is performed only once and consists of automatically associating each IG instruction to an IF reaction.",
        "Interpretation is performed every time the system receives an instruction and consists of predicting an appropriate reaction given reactions observed in the corpus.",
        "Our method is based on the assumption that a reaction captures the semantics of the instruction that caused it.",
        "Therefore, if two utterances result in the same reaction, they are paraphrases of each other, and similar utterances should generate the same reaction.",

      "text": [
        "The key challenge in learning from massive amounts of easily-collected data is to automatically annotate an unannotated corpus.",
        "Our annotation method consists of two parts: first, segmenting a low-level interaction trace into utterances and corresponding reactions, and second, discretizing those reactions into canonical action sequences.",
        "Segmentation enables our algorithm to learn from traces of IFs interacting directly with a virtual world.",
        "Since the IF can move freely in the virtual world, his actions are a stream of continuous behavior.",
        "Segmentation divides these traces into reactions that follow from each utterance of the IG.",
        "Consider the following example starting at the situation shown in",
        "IG(1): go through the yellow opening IF(2): [walks out of the room] IF(3): [turns left at the intersection] IF(4): [enters the room with the sofa] IG(5): stop It is not clear whether the IF is doing ?3, 4?",
        "because he is reacting to 1 or because he is being proactive.",
        "While one could manually annotate this data to remove extraneous actions, our goal is to develop automated solutions that enable learning from massive amounts of data.",
        "We decided to approach this problem by experimenting with two alternative formal definitions: 1) a strict definition that considers the maximum reaction according to the IF behavior, and 2) a loose definition based on the empirical observation that, in situated interaction, most instructions are constrained by the current visually perceived affordances (Gibson, 1979; Stoia et al., 2006).",
        "We formally define behavior segmentation (Bhv) as follows.",
        "A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins",
        "right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered.",
        "In the example, instruction 1 corresponds to ?2, 3, 4?.",
        "We formally define visibility segmentation (Vis) as follows.",
        "A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered or right after the IF leaves the area visible at 360?",
        "from where uk was uttered.",
        "In the example, instruction 1's reaction would be limited to ?2?",
        "because the intersection is not visible from where the instruction was uttered.",
        "The Bhv and Vis methods define how to segment an interaction trace into utterances and their corresponding reactions.",
        "However, users frequently perform noisy behavior that is irrelevant to the goal of the task.",
        "For example, after hearing an instruction, an IF might go into the wrong room, realize the error, and leave the room.",
        "A reaction should not include such irrelevant actions.",
        "In addition, IFs may accomplish the same goal using different behaviors: two different IFs may interpret ?go to the pink room?",
        "by following different paths to the same destination.",
        "We would like to be able to generalize both reactions into one canonical reaction.",
        "As a result, our approach discretizes reactions into higher-level action sequences with less noise and less variation.",
        "Our discretization algorithm uses an automated planner and a planning representation of the task.",
        "This planning representation includes: (1) the task goal, (2) the actions which can be taken in the virtual world, and (3) the current state of the virtual world.",
        "Using the planning representation, the planner calculates an optimal path between the starting and ending states of the reaction, eliminating all unnecessary actions.",
        "While we use the classical planner FF (Hoffmann, 2003), our technique could also work with classical planning (Nau et al., 2004) or other techniques such as probabilistic planning (Bonet and Geffner, 2005).",
        "It is also not dependent on a particular discretization of the world in terms of actions.",
        "Now we are ready to define canonical reaction ck formally.",
        "Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when instruction uk was uttered, Sk+1 be the state of the world where the reaction ends (as defined by Bhv or Vis segmentation), and D be the planning domain representation of the virtual world.",
        "The canonical reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain."

        "Our second classification method employs a strategy in which we considered each group as a set of possible machine translations of our utterance, using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002) to select which group could be considered the best translation of our utterance.",
