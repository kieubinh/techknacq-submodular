        "Online debate platforms, like Debatepedia1, Twitter2 and many others, are becoming more and more popular on the Web.",

        "However, it may happen that the debates become rather complicated, with several arguments supporting and contradicting each others.",
        "Thus, it is difficult for potential participants to understand the way the debate is going on, i.e., which are the current accepted arguments in a debate.",
        "In this paper, we propose to support participants of online debates with a framework combining Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan et al., 2009) and abstract argumentation theory (Dung, 1995).",
        "In particular, TE is adopted to extract the abstract arguments from natural language debates and to provide the relations among these arguments; argumentation theory is then used to compute the set of accepted arguments among those obtained from the TE module,",
        "i.e., the arguments shared by the majority of the participants without being attacked by other accepted arguments.",
        "The originality of the proposed framework lies in the combination of two existing approaches with the goal of supporting participants in their interactions with online debates, by automatically detecting the arguments in natural language text, and identifying the accepted ones.",
