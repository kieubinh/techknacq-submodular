        "Syntactic analysis of search queries is important for a variety of tasks including better query refinement, improved matching and better ad targeting (Barr et al., 2008).",
        "However, search queries differ substantially from traditional forms of written language (e.g., no capitalization, few function words, fairly free word order, etc.",
        "), and are therefore difficult to process with natural language processing tools trained on standard corpora (Barr et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper we focus on part-of-speech (POS) tagging queries entered into commercial search engines and compare different strategies for learning from search logs.",
        "The search logs consist of user queries and relevant search results retrieved by a search engine.",
        "We use a supervised POS tagger to label the result snippets and then transfer the tags to the queries, producing a set of noisy labeled queries.",
        "These labeled queries are then added to the training data and the tagger is retrained.",
        "We evaluate different strategies for selecting which annotation to transfer and find that using the result that was clicked by the user gives comparable performance to using just the top result or to aggregating over the top-k results.",
        "The most closely related previous work is that of Bendersky et al. (2010, 2011).",
        "In their work, un-igram POS tag priors generated from a large corpus are blended with information from the top-50 results from a search engine at prediction time.",
        "Such an approach has the disadvantage that it necessitates access to a search engine at runtime and is computationally very expensive.",
        "We reimplement their method and show that our direct transfer approach is more effective, while being simpler to instrument: since we use information from the search engine only during training, we can train a standalone POS tagger that can be run without access to additional resources.",
        "We also perform an error analysis and find that most of the remaining errors are due to errors in POS tagging of the snippets."

        "The main intuition behind our work, Bendersky et al.",
        "(2010) and Ru?d et al. (2011), is that standard NLP annotation tools work better on snippets returned by a search engine than on user supplied queries.",
        "This is because snippets are typically well-formed English sentences, while queries are not.",
        "Our goal is to leverage this observation and use a supervised POS tagger trained on regular English sentences to generate annotations for a large set of queries that can be used for training a query-specific model.",
        "Perhaps the simplest approach ?",
        "but also a surprisingly powerful one ?",
        "is to POS tag some relevant snippets for",
        "a given query, and then to transfer the tags from the snippet tokens to matching query tokens.",
        "This ?direct?",
        "transfer idea is at the core of all our experiments.",
        "In this work, we provide a comparison of techniques for selecting snippets associated with the query, as well as an evaluation of methods for aligning the matching words in the query to those in the selected snippets.",
        "Specifically, for each query1 with a corresponding set of ?relevant snippets,?",
        "we first apply the baseline tagger to the query and all the snippets.",
        "We match any query terms in these snippets, and copy over the POS tag to the matching query term.",
        "Note that this can produce multiple labelings as the relevant snippet set can be very diverse and varies even for the same query.",
        "We choose the most frequent tagging as the canonical one and add it to our training set.",
        "We then train a query tagger on all our training data: the original human annotated English sentences and also the automatically generated query training set.",
        "The simplest way to match query tokens to snippet tokens is to allow a query token to match any snippet token.",
        "This can be problematic when we have queries that have a token repeated with different parts-of-speech such as in ?tie a tie.?",
        "To make a more precise matching we try a sequence of matching rules: First, exact match of the query n-gram.",
        "Then matching the terms in order, so the query ?tiea a tieb?",
        "matched to the snippet ?to tie1 a neck tie2?",
        "would match tiea:tie1 and tieb:tie2.",
        "Finally, we match as many query terms as possible.",
        "An early observation showed that when a query term occurs in the result URL, e.g., searching for ?irs mileage rate?",
        "results in the page irs.gov, the query term matching the URL domain name is usually a proper noun.",
        "Consequently we add this rule.",
        "In the context of search logs, a relevant snippet set can refer to the top k snippets (including the case where k = 1) or the snippet(s) associated with results clicked by users that issued the query.",
        "In our experiments we found that different strategies for selecting relevant snippets, such as selecting the snippets of the clicked results, using the top-10 results or using only the top result, perform similarly (see",

        "(t|w, s) as the indicator function for word w in the context of snippet s has tag t. They define the tagging of a word as",
        "We illustrate the difference between the two approaches in Figure 1.",
        "The numbered rows of the table correspond to three snippets (with non-query terms elided).",
        "The strategy that uses the clicks to select the tagging would count two examples of ?Budget/NNP Rent/NNP A/NNP Car/NNP?",
        "and one for each of two other taggings.",
        "Note that snippet 1 and the query get different taggings primarily due to orthographic variations.",

        "to its training set.",
        "The interpolation approach of Bendersky et al. (2010) would tag the query as ?budget/NNP rent/VB a/DET car/NN?.",
