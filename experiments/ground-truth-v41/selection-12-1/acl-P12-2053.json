        "Existing methods were designed for data from single domain, assuming that either view alone is sufficient to predict the target class accurately.",
        "However, this view-consistency assumption is largely violated in the setting of domain adaptation where training and test data are drawn from different distributions.",
        "Little research was done for multi-view domain adaptation.",
        "In this work, we present an Information-theoretical Multi-view Adaptation Model (IMAM) based on co-clustering framework (Dhillon et al., 2003) that combines the two learning paradigms to transfer class information across domains in multiple transformed feature spaces.",
        "IMAM exploits a multi-way-clustering-based classification scheme to simultaneously cluster documents, words and links into their respective clusters.",
        "In particular, the word and link clusterings can automatically associate the correlated features from different domains.",
        "Such correlations bridge the domain gap and enhance the consistency of views for clustering (i.e., classifying) the target data.",
