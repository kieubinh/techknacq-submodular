        ", respectively).",
        "Aspect-level review analysis may be alternative for addressing this issue as aspect-specific opinions may more clearly, explicitly, and completely describe the quality of a product from different properties.",
        "Our goal is to discover informative sentences that are consistent with the overall rating of a review, and simultaneously, to perform sentiment analysis at aspect level.",
        "Notice, that a review with a high rating (say, 4/5 stars) may contain both negative and positive opinions, and the same to a review with a very low rating (say, 1/2 star).",
        "From our point of view, each review has a set of sentences that are informative and coherent to its overall rating.",
        "To perform fine granular sentiment analysis, the first step is to discover such coherent content.",
        "Many information needs require the systems to perform fine granular sentiment analysis.",
        "Aspect-level sentiment analysis may be more useful for users to have a global picture of opinions on the product's properties.",
        "Furthermore, different users may have different preferences on different aspects of a product.",
        "Taking the reviews on mobile phones as an example, female users may focus more on the appearance while male users may lay more emphasis on the hardware configuration; younger users prefer to the app or game resources while older users may just pay attention to the basic function of calling or messaging.",
