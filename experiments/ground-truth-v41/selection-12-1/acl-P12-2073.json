      "text": [
        "When we type text using a keyboard, we generate many spelling errors, both typographical (caused by the keyboard layout and hand/finger movement) and cognitive (caused by phonetic or orthographic similarity) (Kukich, 1992).",
        "When the errors are caught during typing, they are corrected on the fly, but unnoticed errors will persist in the final text.",
        "Previous research on spelling correction has focused on the latter type (which we call uncorrected errors), presumably because the errors that are corrected on the spot (referred to here as corrected errors) are not recoded in the form of a text.",
        "However, studying corrected errors is important for at least three reasons.",
        "First, such data encapsulates the spelling mistake and correction by the author, in contrast to the case of uncorrected errors in which the intended correction is typically assigned by a third person (an annotator), or by an automatic method (Whitelaw et al., 2009; Aramaki et al., 2010)1.",
        "Secondly, data on corrected errors will enable us to build a spelling correction application that targets correction on the fly, which directly reduces the number of keystrokes in typing.",
        "This is crucial for languages that use transliteration-based text input methods, such as Chinese and Japanese, where a spelling error in the input Roman keystroke sequence will prevent",
        "the correct candidate words from appearing in the list of candidates in their native scripts, thereby preventing them from being entered altogether.",
        "Finally, we can collect a large amount of spelling errors and their corrections by logging keystrokes and extracting the pre-and post-correction strings from them.",
        "By learning the characteristics of corrected and uncorrected errors, we can expect to use the data for improving the correction of the errors that persisted in the final text as well.",
        "In this paper, we collect naturally occurring spelling error data that are corrected by the users online from keystroke logs, through the crowd-sourcing infrastructure of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk).",
        "As detailed in Section 3, we display images to the worker of MTurk, and collect the descriptions of these images, while logging their keystrokes including the usage of backspace keys, via a crowd-based text input service.",
        "We collected logs for two typologically different languages, English and Japanese.",
        "An example of a log along with the extracted pre-and post-correction strings is shown in Figure 1.",
        "We then performed two comparative analyses: corrected vs. uncorrected errors in English (Section 4.3), and English vs. Japanese corrected errors (Section 4.4).",
        "Finally, we remark on an additional cause of spelling errors observed in all the data we analyzed (Section 4.5)."

        "Studies on spelling error generation mechanisms are found in earlier work such as Cooper (1983).",
        "In particular, Grudin (1983) offers a detailed study of the errors generated in the transcription typing scenario, where the subjects are asked to transcribe a text without correcting the errors they make.",
        "In a more recent work, Aramaki et al. (2010) automatically extracted error-correction candidate pairs from Twitter data based on the assumption that these pairs",
        "fall within a small edit distance, and that the errors are not in the dictionary and substantially less frequent than the correctly spelled counterpart.",
        "They then studied the effect of five factors that cause errors by building a classifier that uses the features associated with these classes and running ablation experiments.",
        "They claim that finger movements cause the spelling errors to be generated, but the uncorrected errors are characterized by visual factors such as the visual similarity of confused letters.",
        "Their experiments however target only the persisted errors, and their claim is not based on the comparison of generated and persisted errors.",
        "Outside of English, Zheng et al. (2011) analyzed the keystroke log of a commercial text input system for Simplified Chinese, and compared the error patterns in Chinese with those in English.",
        "Their use of the keystroke log is different from ours in that they did not directly log the input in pinyin (Romanized Chinese by which native characters are input), but the input pinyin sequences are recovered from the Chinese words in the native script (hanzi) after the character conversion has already applied."

        "Using images as triggers for typing keeps the underlying motivation of keystroke collection hidden from the workers, simultaneously allowing language-independent data collection.",

        "In what follows, our discussion is based on the frequency ratio of particular error types, where the frequency ratio refers to the number of cases in spelling errors divided by the total number of cases in all data.",
        "For example, the frequency ratio of consonant deletion is calculated by dividing the number of missing consonants in errors by the total number of consonants.",
        "4.3 Corrected vs. uncorrected errors in English In this subsection, we compare corrected and uncorrected errors of English, trying to uncover what factors facilitate the error correction.",

        "Substitution mistakes are easy to catch, while Deletion mistakes tend to escape our attention.",
        "Zheng et al. (2011) reports that their pinyin correction errors are dominated by Deletion, which suggests that their log does in fact reflect the characteristics of corrected errors.",
        "Position of error within a word (Figure 5) In en keystroke, Deletion errors at the word-initial position are the most common, while Insertion and Substitution errors tend to occur both at the beginning and the end of a word.",
        "In contrast, in en common, all error types are more prone to occur word-medially.",
        "This means that errors at word edges are corrected more often than the word-internal errors, which can be attributed to cognitive effect known as the bathtub effect (Aitchison, 1994), which states that we memorize words at the periphery most effectively in English.",
        "Effect of character repetition (Figure 6) Deletion errors where characters are repeated, as in tomorow?tomorrow, is observed significantly more frequently than in a non-repeating context in en common, but no such difference is observed in en keystroke, showing that visually conspicuous errors tend to be corrected.",
        "ing Aramaki et al. (2010)5.",
        "Figure 4 shows that in en common, Substitution errors of visually similar characters (e.g., yoqa?yoga) are in fact very common, while in en keystroke, no such tendency is observed.",
        "Phonological similarity in Substitution errors (Figure 8) In en keystroke, there is no notable difference in consonant-to-consonant (C?C) and vowel-to-vowel (V?V) errors, but in en common, V?V errors are overwhelmingly more common, suggesting that C?C can easily be noticed (e.g., eazy?easy) while V?V errors (e.g., visable?visible) are not.",
        "This tendency is consistent with the previous work on the cognitive distinction between consonants and vowels in English: consonants carry more lexical information than vowels (Nespor et al., 2003), a claim also supported by distributional evidence (Tanaka-Ishii, 2008).",
        "It may also be attributed to the fact that English vowel quality is not always reflected by the on-thography in the straightforward maner.",
