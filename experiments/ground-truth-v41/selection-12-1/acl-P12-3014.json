        "Finding information in a large body of text is becoming increasingly more difficult.",
        "Standard search engines output a set of documents for a given query, but do not allow any exploration of the thematic structure in the retrieved information.",
        "Thus, the need for tools that allow to effectively sift through a target set of documents is becoming ever more important.",
        "Faceted search (Stoica and Hearst, 2007; Ka?ki, 2005) supports a better understanding of a target domain, by allowing exploration of data according to multiple views or facets.",
        "For example, given a set of documents on Nobel Prize laureates we might have different facets corresponding to the laureate's nationality, the year when the prize was awarded, the field in which it was awarded, etc.",
        "However, this type of exploration is still severely limited insofar that it only allows exploration by topic rather than content.",
        "Put differently, we can only explore according to what a document is about rather than what a document actually says.",
        "For instance, the facets for the query ?asthma?",
        "in the faceted search engine Yippy include the concepts allergy and children, but do not specify what are the exact relations between these concepts and the query (e.g., allergy causes asthma, and children suffer from asthma).",
        "Berant et al. (2010) proposed an exploration scheme that focuses on relations between concepts, which are derived from a graph describing textual entailment relations between propositions.",
        "In their setting a proposition consists of a predicate with two arguments that are possibly replaced by variables, such as ?X control asthma?.",
        "A graph that specifies an entailment relation ?X control asthma ?",
        "X affect asthma?",
        "can help a user, who is browsing documents dealing with substances that affect asthma, drill down and explore only substances that control asthma.",
        "This type of exploration can be viewed as an extension of faceted search, where the new facet concentrates on the actual statements expressed in the texts.",
        "In this paper we follow Berant et al's proposal, and present a novel entailment-based text exploration system, which we applied to the healthcare domain.",
        "A user of this system can explore the result space of her query, by drilling down/up from one proposition to another, according to a set of entailment relations described by an entailment graph.",
        "In Figure 1, for example, the user looks for ?things?",
        "that affect asthma.",

        "Hierarchical faceted meta-data (Stoica and Hearst, 2007), or faceted search, proposed more sophisticated exploration possibilities by providing multiple facets and a hierarchy per facet or dimension of the domain.",

        "In this work, we suggest proposition-based exploration as an extension to concept-based exploration.",
        "Our intuition is that text exploration can profit greatly from representing information not only at the level of individual concepts, but also at the propositional level, where the relations that link concepts to one another are represented effectively in a hierarchical entailment graph."
