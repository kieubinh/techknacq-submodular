        "Semantic relatedness is the task of quantifying the strength of the semantic connection between textual units, be they words, sentences, or documents.",
        "For instance, one may want to determine how semantically related are two words such as car and automobile, or two pieces of text such as I love animals and I own a pet.",
        "It is one of the main tasks explored in the field of natural language processing, as it lies at the core of a large number of applications such as information retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998), query reformulation (Metzler et al., 2007; Yih and Meek, 2007; Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Broder et al., 2008), image retrieval (Leong and Mihalcea, 2009; Goodrum, 2000), plagiarism detection (Hoad and Zobel, 2003; Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina, 1995; Broder et al., 1997; Heintze, 1996; Brin et al., 1995; Manber, 1994), information flow (Metzler et al., 2005), sponsored search (Broder et al., 2008), short answer grading (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009a; Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2002), and textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "The typical approach to semantic relatedness is to either measure the distance between the constituent words by using a knowledge base such as Word-Net or Roget (e.g., (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Lesk, 1986; Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003; Peder-sen et al., 2004)), or to calculate the similarity between the word distributions in very large corpora (e.g., (Landauer et al., 1991; Lin, 1998; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007)).",
        "With almost no exception, these methods have been applied on one language at a time ?",
        "English, most of the time, although measures of relatedness have also been explored on languages such as German (Zesch et al., 2007), Chinese (Li et al., 2005), Japanese (Kazama et al., 2010), and others.",
        "In this paper, we take a step further and explore a joint multilingual semantic relatedness metric, which aggregates semantic relatedness scores measured on several different languages.",
        "Specifically, in our method, in order to measure the relatedness of two textual units, we first determine their relatedness in multiple languages, and consequently infer a final relatedness score by averaging the scores calculated in the individual languages.",
        "Our hypothesis is that a multilingual representation can enrich the relatedness space and address relevant issues such as polysemy (i.e., find that two occurrences of the same word in language L1 represent two different meanings because of different translations in language L2) and synonymy (i.e., find that two words in language L1 are related because they have the same translation in language L2).",
        "We show that by measuring relatedness in a multilingual space, we are able to improve over a traditional relatedness measure that relies exclusively on a monolingual representation.",
        "Through experiments using several state-of-the-art measures of relatedness, applied on a multilingual space including English, Arabic, Spanish, and Romanian, we aim to answer the following research",
        "questions: (1) Does the task of semantic relatedness benefit from a multilingual representation, as compared to a monolingual one?",
        "(2) Does the translation quality affect the results?",
        "and (3) Do the findings hold for different relatedness datasets?",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we overview related work on word and text relatedness, and on multilingual natural language processing.",
        "We then briefly describe three corpus-based measures of relatedness, and present several word and text datasets that have been used in the past to evaluate relatedness.",
        "We then present evaluations and experiments addressing each of the three research questions, and discuss our findings."

        "Semantic relatedness.",
        "The approaches for semantic relatedness that have been considered to date can be grouped into knowledge-based and corpus-based.",
        "Knowledge-based methods derive a measure of relatedness by utilizing lexical resources and ontologies such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) to measure definitional overlap (Lesk, 1986), term distance within a graphical taxonomy (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), term depth in the taxonomy as a measure of specificity (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and others.",
        "The application of such measures to a language other than English requires the availability of the lexical resource in that language; furthermore, even though taxonomies such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) are available in a number of languages1, their coverage is still limited, and often times they are not publicly available.",
        "For these reasons, in multilingual settings, these measures often become untractable.",
        "On the other side, corpus-based measures such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1991), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), Second Order PMI (Islam and Inkpen, 2006), Hyperspace Analogues to Language (HAL) (Burgess et al., 1998) and distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) employ probabilistic approaches to decode the semantics of words.",
        "They consist of unsupervised methods that utilize the contextual information and patterns observed in raw text to build semantic profiles of words, and thus they can be easily transferred",
        "to a new language provided that a large corpus in that language is available.",
        "Multilingual natural language processing.",
        "Also relevant is the work done on multilingual text processing, which attempts to improve the performance of different natural language processing tasks by integrating information drawn from multiple languages.",
        "For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora.",
        "The model was found especially beneficial for languages where the training dataset was small, thus suggesting that this method may be particularly useful for languages with scarce resources.",
        "(Davidov and Rappoport, 2009) experiment with the use of multiple languages to enhance an existing lexicon.",
        "In their experiments, using three source languages and 45 intermediate languages, they find that the multilingual resources can lead to significant improvements in concept expansion.",
        "(Banea et al., 2010) explore the use of parallel multilingual corpora to improve subjectivity classification in a target language, finding that the use of multilingual representations for subjectivity analysis improves over the monolingual classifiers.",
        "Similarly, (Banea and Mihalcea, 2011) investigate the use of multilingual contexts for word sense disambiguation.",
        "By leveraging on the translations of the annotated contexts in multiple languages, a multilingual thematic space emerges that better disambiguates target words.",
        "Finally, there are two lines of work that explore semantic distances in a multilingual space.",
        "First, (Besanc?on and Rajman, 2002) examine the notion that the distances between document vectors within a language correlate with the distances between their corresponding vectors in a parallel corpus.",
        "These findings provide clues about the possibility of reliable semantic knowledge transfer across language boundaries.",
        "Second, (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2009) propose a framework to compute semantic relatedness between two words in different languages, by considering Wikipedia articles in multiple languages.",
        "The method differs from the one proposed here, as we aggregate relatedness over monolingual spaces rather than measuring cross-lingual relatedness, and we do not specifically use the inter-wiki links between Wikipedia pages."

        "Latent Semantic Analysis.",
        "In LSA (Landauer et al., 1991), term-context associations are captured by means of a dimensionality reduction operated by a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the term-by-context matrix T, where the matrix is induced from a large corpus.",
        "This reduction entails the abstraction of meaning by collapsing similar contexts and discounting noisy and irrelevant ones, hence transforming the real world term-context space into a word-latent-concept space which achieves a much deeper and concrete semantic representation of words.",
        "Salient Semantic Analysis.",
        "SSA (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011) incorporates a similar semantic abstraction and interpretation of words, by using salient concepts gathered from encyclopedic knowledge, where a concept is defined as an unambiguous word or phrase with a concrete meaning, which can afford an encyclopedic definition.",
        "The links available between Wikipedia articles, obtained either through manual annotation by the Wikipedia users or using an automatic annotation process, are regarded as clues or salient features within the text that help define and disambiguate its context.",

        "In this paper, we showed how a semantic relatedness measure computed in a multilingual space is able to acquire and leverage additional information from the multilingual representation, and thus be strengthened as more languages are taken into consideration.",
        "Our experiments seem to suggest that combinations of multiple languages supply additional information to derive a semantic relatedness between texts in an automatic framework.",
        "Since establishing semantic relatedness requires us to employ cognitive processes that are in large part independent of the language that we speak, it comes at no surprise that using relatedness clues originating from more than one language allows for a better identification of relationships between texts.",
        "While efficiency may be a concern, it is worth noting that the method is highly parallelizable, as the individual relatedness measures obtained before the aggregation step can be calculated in parallel.",
        "Notably, all the relatedness measures that we experimented with exhibited the same improvement trend.",
        "While this framework allows languages with scarce electronic resources, such as Romanian and Arabic, to obtain very large improvements in semantic relatedness as compared to the monolingual measures, improvements are also noticed for languages with richer resources such as English."
