        "Currently, the English Wikipedia alone has four million articles.",

        "connect it to 20 articles in 20 different languages.",
        "In the ideal case, a set of articles connected directly or indirectly via such links would all describe the same entity or concept.",
        "However, these links are produced either by polyglot editors or by automatic bots.",
        "Editors commonly make mistakes by linking articles that have conceptual drift, or by linking to a concept at a different level of granularity.",
        "For instance, if a corresponding article in one of the languages does not exist, a similar article or a more general article about the concept is sometimes linked instead.",
        "Various bots also add new interlingual links or attempt to correct existing ones.",
        "The downside of a bot is that an error in a translational link created by editors in Wikipedia for one language propagates to Wikipedias in other languages.",

        "This dataset is manually annotated in order to enable the evaluation of methods for translational link detection.",
        "Second, we describe an automatic model for correcting existing links and creating new links, with the aim of obtaining a more stable set of interlingual links.",
        "The model's parameters are estimated on the manually labeled dataset using a supervised machine learning approach.",
        "The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes Wikipedia and the relevant terminology.",
        "Section 3 introduces our method of identifying a candidate set of translational links based on distance heuristics, while Section 4 introduces the methodology for building a manually annotated dataset.",
