        "The RESULT relation holds between (1b-c) and (1d).",

        "Additional pragmatic information is encoded in these relations in terms of granularity.",
        "Granularity refers to the relative increases or decreases in the level of described detail.",
        "For example, moving from (1b) to (1c), we learn more information about the gate via the ELABORATION relation.",
        "Also, moving from (1b-c) to (1d) there is a consolidation of information associated with the RESULT relation.",
        "Through several supervised machine learning tasks, we investigate the degree to which granularity (as well as additional elements of discourse structure (e.g. tense, aspect, event)) serves as a viable organization and predictor of rhetorical relations in a range of written discourses.",

        "Section 2 reviews prior research on rhetorical relations, discourse structure, granularity and prediction.",
        "Section 3 discusses the analyzed data, the selection and annotation of features, and the construction of several machine learning tasks.",

        "Both CLAUSE and GRANULARITY are necessary.",
        "Relying only on CLAUSE achieves a 48.25% accuracy (J48) and relying only on GRANULARITY achieves 70.36% for all classifiers, but this higher accuracy is an artifact of the organization as evidenced by the f-score (.585).",
        "The relationship between CLAUSE and the rhetorical relations is straightforward.",
        "For example, the CONSEQUENCE relation is often an ?intersenten-tial?",
        "relation (if the aardvark fell in the puddle, then it got dirty), each of the 16 CONSEQUENCE relations are embedded.",
        "Similarly, 93% of all ELABORATION relations, which are temporally subordinating, are embedded.",
        "Clause types appear to be a viable source of co-varying information in rhetorical relation prediction in the tasks under discussion.",
        "The aspects of syntactic-semantic form and pragmatic function in the relationship between granularity and rhetorical relations is of central interest in this investigation.",
        "Asher and Lascarides represent discourses hierarchically through coordination and subordination of information which corresponds to changes in granularity.",
        "However, while the notion of granularity enters into the motivation and formulation of the SDRT inventory, it is not developed further.",
        "These results potentailly allow us to say something deeper about the structural organization of discourse as it relates to granularity.",
        "In particualr, while there is some probabilistic leverage in collapsing categories, it is not the case that arbitrary categorizations will perform similarly.",
        "This observation holds true even for theoretically informed categorizations.",
        "For example, organizing the SDRT inventory into coordinated and subordinated relations yields lower performance on relation prediction.",
        "Coordinated and subordinated can be predicted with 80% accuracy, but the prediction of the individual relations given the category performs only at 70%.",
        "Since the granularity-based organization presented here performs better, we suggest that the pragmatic function of the relation is more systematic than the syntactic-semantic form of the relation.",
        "Future research will focus on more data, different machine learning techniques (e.g. unsupervised learning) and automatization.",
        "Where clause, tense, aspect and event are readily automatable, rhetorical relations and granularity are less so.",
        "Automatically extracting such information from an annotated corpus such as the Penn Discourse Tree Bank is certainly feasible.",
        "However, the distribution of genres in this corpus is somewhat limited (i.e., predominately news text (Webber, 2009)) and calls into question the generalizeability of results to other modes of discourse.",
        "Overall, we have demonstrated that the inclusion of a granularity-based organization in the machine learning prediction of rhetorical relations increases performance by 37%, which is roughly 14% above previous reported results for a broader range of discourses and relations."
