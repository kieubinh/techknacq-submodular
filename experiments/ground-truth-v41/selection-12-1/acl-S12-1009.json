        "Corpus-based thesaurus construction has been an active research area (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran and Moens, 2002; Kilgarriff, 2003; Rychly and Kilgarriff, 2007).",
        "Typically, two statistical approaches for identifying semantic relationships between words were investigated: first-order, co-occurrence-based methods which assume that words that occur frequently together are topically related (Sch√ºtze and Pederson, 1997) and second-order, distributional similarity methods (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998; Gasperin et al. 2001; Weeds and Weir, 2003; Kotlerman et al., 2010), which suggest that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar (Harris, 1968).",
        "While most prior work focused on English, we are interested in applying these methods to MRL.",
        "Such languages, Hebrew in our case, are characterized by highly productive morphology which may produce as many as thousands of word forms for a given root form.",
        "Thesauri usually provide related terms for each entry term (denoted target term).",
        "Since both target and related terms correspond to word lemmas, statistics collection from the corpus would be most directly applied at the lemma level as well, using a morphological analyzer and tagger (Linden and Piitulainen, 2004; Peirsman et al., 2008; Rapp, 2009).",
        "However, due to the rich and challenging morphology of MRL, such tools often have limited performance.",
        "In our research, the accuracy of a state-of-the-art modern Hebrew tagger on a cross genre corpus was only about 60%.",
        "Considering such limited performance of morphological processing, we propose a schematic methodology for generating a co-occurrence based thesaurus in MRL.",
        "In particular, we propose and investigate three options for term representation, namely surface form, lemma and multiple lemmas, supplemented with clustering of term variants.",
        "While the default lemma representation is dependent on tagger performance, the two other representations avoid choosing the right lemma for each word occurrence.",
        "Instead, the multiple-lemma representation assumes that the right analysis will accumulate enough statistical prominence throughout the corpus, while the surface representation solves morphological disambiguation \"in retrospect\", by clustering term variants at the end of the extraction process.",
        "As the methodology provides a generic scheme for exploring the alternative representation levels, each corpus and language-specific tool set might yield a different optimal configuration."

        "Our methodology was applied for statistical measures of first order similarity (word co-occurrence).",
        "These statistics consider the number of times each candidate term co-occurs with the target term in the same document, relative to their total frequencies in the corpus.",
        "Common co-occurrence metrics are Dice coefficient (Smadja et al., 1996), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) and log-likelihood test (Dunning, 1993)."

        "Typically, a morphological analyzer produces all possible analyses for a given token in the corpus.",
        "Then, a Part Of Speech (POS) tagger selects the most probable analysis and solves morphology disambiguation.",
        "However, considering the poor performance of the POS tagger on our corpus, we distinguish between these two analysis levels.",
        "Consequently, we examined three levels of term representation: (i) Surface form (surface) (ii) Best lemma, as indentified by a POS tagger (best), and (iii) All possible lemmas, produced by a morphological analyzer (all)."

        "For each target term we retrieve all the documents in the corpus where the target term appears.",
        "Then, we define a set of candidate terms that consists of all the terms that appear in all these documents (this again for each of the three possible term representations).",
        "Next, a co-occurrence score between the target term and each of the candidates is calculated.",
        "Then, candidates are sorted, and the highest rated candidate terms are clustered into lemma-oriented clusters.",
        "Finally, we rank the clusters according to their members' co-occurrence scores and the highest rated clusters become related terms in the thesaurus.",
        "Figure 1 presents the algorithm's pseudo code.",
        "The notion rep(term) is used to describe the possible term representations and may be either surface, best or all.",

        "While, when rep(word)=best, the most probable lemma is assigned by the tagger (since there are numerous candidates for each target term we cannot resort the manual involvement for each of them).",
        "The two choices for rep(term) are independent, resulting in nine possible configurations of the algorithm for representing both the target term and the candidate terms.",
        "Thus, these 9 configurations cover the space of possibilities for term representation.",

        "Obviously, clustering is mostly needed for surface-level representation, in order to group all different inflections of the same lemma.",

        "The second measure considers the most probable lemma of the vertices' terms and checks whether these lemmas are equal.",
        "The probability of a lemma was defined as the sum of probabilities for all morphological analyses containing the lemma, using a morpho-lexical context-independent probabilities approximation (Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "The clustering was done by finding the connected components in our graph of terms using the JUNG1 implementation (WeakComponentVertexClusterer algorithm with default parameters).",
