        "A multiword expression (MWE) is a phrase or sequence of words which exhibits idiosyncratic behaviour (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2009).",
        "The nature of this idiosyncracy may be purely distributional ?",
        "such as hot and cold being more common than cold and hot ?",
        "but in this paper we study MWEs with idiosyncratic semantics.",
        "Specifically we are concerned with expressions such as jump the gun which are ambiguous between a literal interpretation of ?to leap over a firearm?, and an idiomatic interpretation of ?to act prematurely?.",
        "While MWEs are increasingly entering the mainstream of NLP, the accurate identification of MWEs remains elusive for current methods, particularly in the absence of MWE type-specialised training data.",
        "This paper builds on the work of Hashimoto et al. (2006) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) in exploring whether type-level MWE properties sourced from an idiom dictionary can boost the accuracy of crosstype MWE-token classification.",
        "That is, we attempt to determine whether token occurrences of ambiguous expressions such as Kim jumped the gun on this issue are idiomatic or literal, based on: (a) annotated instances for MWEs other than jump the gun (e.g. we may only have token-level annotations for kick the bucket and throw in the towel), and (b) dictionary-based information on the syntactic properties of the idiom in question.",
        "We find that constituent modifiability judgments extracted from the idiom dictionary are more predictive of the idiomaticity of tokens than other features of the idiom's constituents such as part of speech or lexeme.",
        "However, violations of the dictionary's modifiability rules have variable utility for machine learning classification, being suggestive of the literal class but not definitive.",
        "Finally, we present novel results illuminating the effectiveness of contextual semantic vectors at MWE-token classification."
