        "Recently, Erk et al. (2009) have shown that in cases of sense ambiguity, a graded notion of sense labeling may be most appropriate and help reduce the ambiguity.",

        "Although contexts can be constructed to elicit only one of these senses, in the example above, a graded annotation best matches human perception.",
        "Graded word sense (GWS) annotation offers significant advantages for sense annotation with a fine-grained sense inventory.",
        "However, creating a sufficiently large annotated corpus for training supervised GWS disambiguation models presents a significant challenge, i.e., the laborious task of gathering annotations for all combinations of a word's senses, along with variation in those senses applicabilities.",
        "To our knowledge, Erk et al. (2009) have provided the only data set with GWS annotations for 11 terms.",

        "Graded word sense annotation conveys multiple levels of information, both in which senses are present and their relative levels of applicability; and so, no single evaluation measure alone is appropriate for assessing GWS annotation capability.",
        "Therefore, we propose three objectives for the evaluating the sense",
        "labeling: (1) Detection of which senses are present, (2) Ranking senses according to applicability, and (3) Perception of the graded presence of each sense.",

        "Let peri(sj) refer to the perceived numeric applicability rating of sense sj in context i.",
        "Detection measures the ability to accurately identify which senses are applicable in a given context, independent of their applicability.",
        "While the most basic of the evaluations, systems that are highly accurate at multi-sense detection could be used for recognizing ambiguous contexts where multiple senses are applicable or for evaluating the granularity of sense ontologies by testing for correlations between senses in a multi-sense labeling.",
        "Detection is measured using the Jaccard Index between SiG and SiL for a given context i: S",

        "Perception measures the ability to equal human judgements on the levels of applicability for each sense in a context.",
        "Unlike ranking, this evaluation quantifies the difference in sense applicability.",
        "As a potential application, these differences can be used to quantify the contextual ambiguity.",
        "For example, the relative applicability differences can be used to distinguish between ambiguous contexts where multiple highly-applicable senses exist and unambiguous contexts where a single main sense exists but other senses are still minimally applicable.",
        "To quantify Perception, we compare sense label-ings using the cosine similarity.",
        "Each labeling is represented as a vector with a separate component for each sense, whose value is the applicability of that sense.",

        "The sense annotations are normalized to probability distributions, denotedG and L, and the divergence is computed as:",
        "where M is the average of the distributions G and L and DKL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence.",
        "While both approaches are similar in intent, we find that the cosine similarity better matches the expected difference in Perception for cases where two annotations use different numbers of senses.",
        "For example, the fourth test annotation in Fig. 1 has a JSS1 of 0.593, despite its significant differences in ordering and the omission of a sense.",
        "Indeed, in cases where the set of senses in a test annotation is completely disjoint from the set of gold standard senses, the JSS will be positive due to comparing the two distributions against their average; In contrast, the cosine similarity in such cases will be zero, which we argue better matches the expectation that such an annotation does not meet the Perception objective."

        "Indeed, only 12 of its 237 annotated instances received more than one sense label, revealing that the model's performance is mostly based on correctly identifying the primary sense in a context and not on identifying the less applicable senses.",
        "The UoY model shows a similar trend, with most instances being assigned a median of 2 senses.",
        "However, its sense representation is sufficiently dense to have the highest recall of any of the models.",

        "were assigned over 60 senses on average to each of their instances, with ?different?",
        "having an average of 238, while the remaining terms were assigned under two senses on average.",
        "Furthermore, the results also revealed two unexpected findings.",
        "First, the ASE baseline performed unexpectedly high in Perception, despite its assignment of uniform applicability to all senses.",
        "We hypothesize this is due to the majority of instances in the GWS dataset being labeled with most of a word's senses, as indicated by Table 1, which results in their",
        "perceptibilities becoming normalized to small values.",
        "Because the ASE solution has applicability ratings for all senses, normalization brings the ratings close to those of the gold standard solution, and furthermore, the difference in score between applicable and inapplicable senses become too small to significantly affect the resulting cosine similarity.",
        "As an alternate model, we reevaluated the baselines against the gold standard using the Jensen-Shannon divergence as proposed by Erk and McCarthy (2009).",
        "Again, ASE is still the highest performing baseline on Perception.",
        "The high performance for both evaluation measures suggests that an alternate measure may be better suited for quantifying the difference in solutions?",
        "GWS applicabilities.",
        "Second, performance was higher on the Perception task than on Ranking, the former of which was anticipated being more difficult.",
        "We attribute the lower Ranking performance to two factors.",
        "First, the GWS data contains main tied rank senses; however, ties in sense ranks after the mapping process are relatively rare, which reduces ?.",
        "Second, instances in the GWS often have senses within close applicability ranges.",
        "When scoring an induced annotation that swaps the applicability, the Perception is less affected by the small change in applicability magnitude, whereas Ranking is more affected due to the change in ordering."

        "Given the expense of creating annotated training corpora with sufficient examples of the graded senses, WSI offers significant promise for learning senses automatically while needing only a small amount GWS annotated data to learn the sense mapping for a WSD task.",

        "Our primary contribution is an end-to-end framework for mapping and evaluating induced GWS data.",
        "We first proposed three objectives for graded sense annotation along with corresponding evaluation measures that reliably convey the effectiveness given the nature of GWS annotations.",
        "Second, we proposed two new mapping procedures that use graded sense applicability for converting induced senses into a reference sense inventory.",

        "First, our study only considered three graph-based WSI models; future work is needed to assess the capabilities other WSI approaches, such as vector-based or Bayesian.",

        "Second, the proposed evaluation relies on a supervised mapping to the gold standard sense inventory, which has potential to lose information and incorrectly map new senses not in the gold standard.",
        "While unsupervised clustering evaluations such as the V-measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and paired Fscore (Artiles et al., 2009) are capable of evaluating without such a mapping, future work is needed to test extrinsic soft clustering evaluations such as BCubed (Amigo?",
        "et al, 2009) or develop analogous techniques that take into account graded class membership used in GWS annotations.",
        "Last, we note that our setup normalized the GWS ratings into probability distribution, which is standard in the SemEval evaluation setup.",
        "However, this normalization incorrectly transforms GWS annotations where no predominant sense was rated at the highest value, e.g., an annotation of only two senses rated as 3 on a scale of 1 to 5.",
        "While these perceptibilities may be left unnormalized, it is not clear how to compare the induced GWS annotations with such mid-interval values, or when the rating scale of the WSI system is potentially unbounded.",
