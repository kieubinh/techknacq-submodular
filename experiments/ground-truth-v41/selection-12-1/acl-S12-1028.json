        "One of the most fundamental aspects of meaning is the association between words and semantic categories, which allows us to understand that a ?cow?",
        "is an animal and a ?house?",
        "is a structure.",
        "We will use the term semantic lexicon to refer to a dictionary that associates words with semantic classes.",
        "Semantic dictionaries are useful for many NLP tasks, as evidenced by the widespread use of WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "However, off-the-shelf resources are not always sufficient for specialized domains, such as medicine, chemistry, or microelectronics.",
        "Furthermore, in virtually every domain, texts contain lexical variations that are often missing from dictionaries, such as acronyms, abbreviations, spelling variants, informal shorthand terms (e.g., ?abx?",
        "for ?antibiotics?",
        "), and composite terms (e.g., ?may-december?",
        "or ?virus/worm?).",
        "To address this problem, techniques have been developed to automate the construction of semantic lexicons from text corpora using bootstrapping methods (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Phillips and Riloff, 2002; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Ng, 2007; McIntosh and Curran, 2009; McIntosh, 2010), but accuracy is still far from perfect.",
        "Our research explores the use of ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of semantic lexicon induction.",
        "Our observation is that semantic class associations can be learned using several fundamentally different types of corpus analysis.",
        "Bootstrapping methods for semantic lexicon induction (e.g., (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; McIntosh and Curran, 2009)) collect corpus-wide statistics for individual words based on shared contextual patterns.",
        "In contrast, classifiers for semantic tagging (e.g., (Collins and Singer, 1999; Niu et al., 2003; Huang and Riloff, 2010)) label word instances and focus on the local context surrounding each instance.",
        "The difference between these approaches is that semantic taggers make decisions based on a single context and can assign different labels to different instances, whereas lexicon induction algorithms compile corpus statistics from multiple instances of a word and typically assign each word to a single semantic category.1 We also hypothesize that coreference resolution can be exploited to infer semantic 1This approach would be untenable for broad-coverage semantic knowledge acquisition, but within a specialized domain most words have a dominant word sense.",
        "Our experimental results support this assumption.",
        "class labels.",
        "Intuitively, if we know that two noun phrases are coreferent, then they probably belong to the same high-level semantic category (e.g., ?dog?",
        "and ?terrier?",
        "are both animals).",
        "In this paper, we present an ensemble-based framework for semantic lexicon induction.",
        "We incorporate a pattern-based bootstrapping method for lexicon induction, a contextual semantic tagger, and a new coreference-based method for lexicon induction.",
        "Our results show that coalescing the decisions produced by diverse methods produces a better dictionary than any individual method alone.",
        "A second contribution of this paper is an analysis of the effectiveness of dictionaries for semantic tagging.",
        "In principle, an NLP system should be able to assign different semantic labels to different senses of a word.",
        "But within a specialized domain, most words have a dominant sense and we argue that using domain-specific dictionaries for tagging may be equally, if not more, effective.",
        "We analyze the trade-offs between using an instance-based semantic tagger versus dictionary lookup on a collection of disease outbreak articles.",
        "Our results show that the induced dictionaries yield better performance than an instance-based semantic tagger, achieving higher accuracy with comparable levels of recall."

        "To improve the accuracy of induced lexicons, some research has incorporated negative information from human judgements (Vyas and Pantel, 2009), automatically discovered negative classes (McIntosh, 2010), and distributional similarity metrics to recognize concept drift (McIntosh and Curran, 2009).",
        "Phillips and Riloff (2002) used co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) to exploit three simple classifiers that each recognized a different type of syntactic structure.",
        "The research most closely related to ours is an ensemble-based method for automatic thesaurus construction (Curran, 2002).",
        "However, that goal was to acquire fine-grained semantic information that is more akin to synonymy (e.g., words similar to ?house?",
        "), whereas we associate words with high-level semantic classes (e.g., a ?house?",
        "is a transient structure).",
        "Semantic class tagging is closely related to named entity recognition (NER) (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1997; Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999; Fleischman and Hovy, 2002)).",
        "Some bootstrapping methods have been used for NER (e.g., (Collins and Singer, 1999; Niu et al., 2003) to learn from unannotated texts.",
        "However, most NER systems will not label nominal noun phrases (e.g., they will not identify ?the dentist?",
        "as a person) or recognize semantic classes that are not associated with proper named entities (e.g., symptoms).2 ACE mention detection systems (e.g., (ACE, 2007; ACE, 2008)) can label noun phrases that are associated with 5-7 semantic classes and are typically trained with supervised learning.",
        "Recently, (Huang and Riloff, 2010) developed a bootstrapping technique that induces a semantic tagger from unannotated texts.",
        "We use their system in our ensemble.",
        "There has also been work on extracting semantic class members from the Web (e.g., (Pas?ca, 2004; Et-zioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2009)).",
        "This line of research is fundamentally different from ours because these techniques benefit from the vast repository of information available on the Web and are therefore designed to harvest a wide swath of general-purpose semantic information.",

        "Our research combines three fundamentally different techniques into an ensemble-based bootstrapping framework for semantic lexicon induction: pattern-based dictionary induction, contextual semantic tagging, and coreference resolution.",
        "Our motivation for using an ensemble of different tech",
        "niques is driven by the observation that these methods exploit different types of information to infer semantic class knowledge.",
        "The coreference resolver uses features associated with coreference, such as syntactic constructions (e.g., appositives, predicate nominals), word overlap, semantic similarity, proximity, etc.",
        "The pattern-based lexicon induction algorithm uses corpus-wide statistics gathered from the contexts of all instances of a word and compares them with the contexts of known category members.",
        "The contextual semantic tagger uses local context windows around words and classifies each word instance independently from the others.",
        "Since each technique draws its conclusions from different types of information, they represent independent sources of evidence to confirm whether a word belongs to a semantic class.",
        "Our hypothesis is that, combining these different sources of evidence in an ensemble-based learning framework should produce better accuracy than using any one method alone.",
        "Based on this intuition, we create an ensemble-based bootstrapping framework that iteratively collects the hypotheses produced by each individual learner and selects the words that were hypothesized by at least 2 of the 3 learners.",
        "This approach produces a bootstrapping process with improved precision, both at the critical beginning stages of the bootstrapping process and during subsequent bootstrapping iterations."

        "In the following sections, we describe each of the component systems used in our ensemble.",
        "The first component of our ensemble is Basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), which identifies nouns belonging to a semantic class based on collective information over lexico-syntactic pattern contexts.",
        "The patterns are automatically generated using AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996).",
        "Basilisk begins with a small set of seed words for each semantic class and a collection of unannotated documents for the domain.",
        "In an iterative bootstrapping process, Basilisk identifies candidate nouns, ranks them based on its scoring criteria, selects the 5 most confident words for inclusion in the lexicon, and this process repeats using the new words as additional seeds in subsequent iterations.",
        "Semantic Tagger The second component in our ensemble is a contextual semantic tagger (Huang and Riloff, 2010).",
        "Like Basilisk, the semantic tagger also begins with seed nouns, trains itself on a large collection of unannotated documents using bootstrapping, and iteratively labels new instances.",
        "This tagger labels noun instances and does not produce a dictionary.",
        "To adapt it for our purposes, we ran the bootstrapping process over the training texts to induce a semantic classifier.",
        "We then applied the classifier to the same set of training documents and compiled a lexicon by collecting the set of nouns that were assigned to each semantic class.",
        "We ignored words that were assigned different labels in different contexts to avoid conflicts in the lexicons.",
        "We used the identical configuration described by (Huang and Riloff, 2010) that applies a 1.0 confidence threshold for semantic class assignment.",
        "The third component of our ensemble is a new method for semantic lexicon induction that exploits coreference resolution.",
        "Members of a coreference chain represent the same entity, so all references to the entity should belong to the same semantic class.",
        "For example, suppose ?Paris?",
        "and ?the city?",
        "are in the same coreference chain.",
        "If we know that city is a Fixed Location, then we can infer that Paris is also a Fixed Location.",
        "We induced lexicons from coreference chains using a similar bootstrapping framework that begins with seed nouns and unannotated texts.",
        "Let S denote a set of semantic classes and W denote a set of unknown words.",
        "For any s ?",
        "S and w ?",
        "W , let Ns,w denote the number of instances of s in the current lexicon3 that are coreferent with w in the text corpus.",

        "We hypothesize the semantic class of w,",
        "To ensure high precision for the induced lexicons, we use a threshold of 0.5.",
        "All words with a probability above this thresold are added to the lexicon, and the bootstrapping process repeats.",
        "Although the coreference chains remain the same throughout the process, the lexicon grows so more words in the chains have semantic class labels as bootstrapping progresses.",
        "Bootstrapping ends when fewer than 5 words are learned for each of the semantic classes.",
        "Many noun phrases are singletons (i.e., they are not coreferent with any other NPs), which limits the set of words that can be learned using coreference chains.",
        "Furthermore, coreference resolvers make mistakes, so the accuracy of the induced lexicons depends on the quality of the chains.",
