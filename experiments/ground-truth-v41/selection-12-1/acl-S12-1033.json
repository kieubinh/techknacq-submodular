        "We use language not just to convey facts, but also our emotions.",
        "Automatically identifying emotions expressed in text has a number of applications, including customer relation management (Bougie et al., 2003), determining popularity of products and governments (Mohammad and Yang, 2011), and improving human-computer interaction (Vela?squez, 1997; Ravaja et al., 2006).",
        "Twitter is an online social networking and mi-croblogging service where users post and read messages that are up to 140 characters long.",
        "The messages are called tweets.",
        "1 Email the author to obtain a copy of the hash-tagged tweets or the emotion lexicon: saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.",
        "Often a tweet may include one or more words immediately preceded with a hash symbol (#).",
        "These words are called hashtags.",
        "Hashtags serve many purposes, but most notably they are used to indicate the topic.",
        "Often these words add to the information in the tweet: for example, hashtags indicating the tone of the message or their internal emotions.",
        "From the perspective of one consuming tweets, hashtags play a role in search: Twitter allows people to search tweets not only through words in the tweets, but also through hashtagged words.",
        "Consider the tweet below: We are fighting for the 99% that have been left behind.",
        "#OWS #anger A number of people tweeting about the Occupy Wall Street movement added the hashtag #OWS to their tweets.",
        "This allowed people searching for tweets about the movement to access them simply by searching for the #OWS hashtag.",
        "In this particular instance, the tweeter (one who tweets) has also added an emotion-word hashtag #anger, possibly to convey that he or she is angry.",
        "Currently there are more than 200 million Twitter accounts, 180 thousand tweets posted every day, and 18 thousand Twitter search queries every second.",
        "Socio-linguistic researchers point out that Twitter is primarily a means for people to converse with other individuals, groups, and the world in general (Boyd et al., 2010).",
        "As tweets are freely accessible to all, the conversations can take on non-traditional forms such as discussions developing through many voices rather than just two interlocuters.",
        "For example, the use of Twitter and Facebook has been credited with",
        "providing momentum to the 2011 Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements (Skinner, 2011; Ray, 2011).",
        "Understanding how such conversations develop, how people influence one another through emotional expressions, and how news is shared to elicit certain emotional reactions, are just some of the compelling reasons to develop better models for the emotion analysis of social media.",
        "Supervised methods for emotion detection tend to perform better than unsupervised ones.",
        "They use ngram features such as unigrams and bigrams (individual words and two-word sequences) (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Mohammad, 2012b).",
        "However, these methods require labeled data where utterances are marked with the emotion they express.",
        "Manual annotation is time-intensive and costly.",
        "Thus only a small amount of such text exists.",
        "Further, supervised algorithms that rely on ngram features tend to classify accurately only if trained on data from the same domain as the target sentences (Mohammad, 2012b).",
        "Thus even the limited amount of existing emotion-labeled data is unsuitable for use in microblog analysis.",
        "In this paper, we show how we automatically created a large dataset of more than 20,000 emotion-labeled tweets using hashtags.",
        "We compiled labeled data for six emotions?joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise?argued to be the most basic (Ekman, 1992).",
        "We will refer to our dataset as the Twitter Emotion Corpus (TEC).",
        "We show through experiments that even though the tweets and hashtags cover a diverse array of topics and were generated by thousands of different individuals (possibly with very different educational and socio-economic backgrounds), the emotion annotations are consistent and match the intuitions of trained judges.",
        "We also show how we used the TEC to improve emotion detection in a domain very different from social media.",
        "Finally, we describe how we generated a large lexicon of ngrams and associated emotions from TEC.",
        "This emotion lexicon can be used in many applications, including highlighting words and phrases in a piece of text to quickly convey regions of affect.",
        "We show that the lexicon leads to significantly better results than that obtained using the manually crafted WordNet Affect lexicon in an emotion classification task."
