        "All human language samples, either written or spoken, contain some information in negated form.",

        "For example, while searching for the patients with diabetes, we should not include a patient who has a clinical report saying No symptoms of diabetes were observed.",
        "Thus, finding the negation and its scope is important in tasks where the negation and assertion information need to be treated differently.",
        "However, most of the systems developed for processing natural language data do not consider negations present in the sentences.",
        "Although various works (Morante et al., 2008; Morante and Daele-mans, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Councill et al., 2010; Apostolova et al., 2011) have dealt with the identification of negations and their scope in sentences, this is still a challenging task.",
        "The first task in *SEM 2012 Shared Task (Morante and Blanco, 2012) is concerned with finding the scope of negation.",
        "The task includes identifying: i) negation cues, ii) scope of negation, and iii) negated event for each negation present in the sentences.",
        "Negation cue is a word, part of a word, or a combination of words that carries the negation information.",
        "Scope of negation in a sentence is the longest group of words in the sentence that is influenced by the negation cue.",
        "Negated event is the shortest group of words that is actually affected by the negation cue.",
        "In Example (1) below, word no is a negation cue, the discontinuous word sequences ?I gave him?",
        "and ?sign of my occupation?",
        "are the scopes, and ?gave?",
        "is the negated event.",
        "(1) I [gave] him no sign of my occupation.",
        "In this paper, we propose a system to detect the scope of negation for the closed track of *SEM 2012 Shared Task.",
        "Our system uses a combination of a rule based approach, and a machine learning approach.",
        "We use a rule based approach to create a lexicon of all the negation words present in the training data.",
        "Then we use this lexicon to detect the negation cues present in the test data.",
        "We do a preliminary analysis of finding the scope of negation and the negated events by applying a machine learning approach, and using basic features created from the words, lemmas, and parts-of-speech (POS) tags of words in the sentences.",
        "The F-measure scores",
        "achieved by our system are about 85% for negation cue detection, 65% in full scope identification, 48% in negated event detection, and 39% in identifying full negation.",
        "Our error analysis shows that the use of lexicon is not very appropriate to detect the negation cues.",
