        "Detecting negation is important for many NLP tasks, as it may reverse the meaning of the text affected by it.",
        "In information extraction, for instance, it is obviously important to distinguish negated information from affirmative one (Kim and Park, 2006).",
        "It may also improve automatic indexing (Mutalik et al., 2001).",
        "In sentiment analysis, detecting and dealing with negation is critical, as it may change the polarity of a text (Wiegand et al., 2010).",
        "However, research on negation has mainly focused on the biomedical domain, and addressed the problem of detecting if a medical term is negated or not (Chapman et al., 2001), or the scope of different negation signals (Morante et al., 2008).",
        "During the last years, the importance of processing negation is gaining recognition by the NLP research community, as evidenced by the success of several initiatives such as the Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing workshop (NeSp-NLP 2010)1 or the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task2, which aimed at identifying hedges and their scope in natural language texts.",
        "In spite of this, most of the approaches proposed so far deal with negation in a superficial manner.",
        "This paper describes our contribution to the *SEM Shared Task 2012 on Resolving the Scope and Focus of Negation.",
        "As its name suggests, the task aims at detecting the scope and focus of negation, as a means of encouraging research in negation processing.",
        "In particular, we participate in Task 1: scope detection.",
        "For each negation in the text, the negation cue must be detected, and its scope marked.",
        "Moreover, the event or property that is negated must be recognized.",
        "A comprehensive description of the task may be found in (Morante and Blanco, 2012).",
        "For the sake of clarity, it is important to define what the organization of the task understands by negation cue, scope of negation and negated event.",
        "The words that express negation are called negation cues.",
        "Not and no are common examples of such cues.",
        "Scope is defined as the part of the meaning that is negated, and encloses all negated concepts.",
        "The negated event is the property that is",
        "negated by the cue.",
        "For instance, in the sentence: [Holmes] did not [say anything], the scope is enclosed in square brackets, the negation cue is underlined and the negated event is shown in bold.",
        "More details about the annotation of negation cues, scopes and negated events may be found in (Morante and Daelemans, 2012).",
        "The system presented to the shared task is an adaptation of the one published in (Carrillo de Albornoz et al., 2010), whose aim was to detect and process negation in opinionated text in order to improve polarity and intensity classification.",
        "When classifying sentiments and opinions it is important to deal with the presence of negations and their effect on the emotional meaning of the text affected by them.",
        "Consider the sentence (1) and (2).",
        "Sentence",
        "(1) expresses a positive opinion, whereas that in sentence (2) the negation word not reverses the polarity of such opinion.",
        "(1) I liked this hotel.",
        "(2) I didn't like this hotel.",
        "Our system has the main advantage of being simple and highly generic.",
        "Even though it was originally conceived for treating negations in opinionated texts, a few simple modifications have been sufficient to successfully address negation in a very different type of texts, such as Conan Doyle stories.",

        "Our previous work was focused on explicit negations (i.e., those introduced by negation tokens such as not, never).",
        "In contrast, in the present work we also consider what we call implicit negations, which includes affixal negation (i.,e., words with prefixes such as dis-, un- or suffixes such as -less; e.g., impatient or careless), inffixal negation (i.e., pointlessness, where the negation cue less is in the middle of the noun phrase).",
        "Note that we did not",
        "Explicit negation cues no not non nor nobody never nowhere ...",
        "Words with implicit negation cues unpleasant unnatural dislike impatient fearless hopeless illegal ... have into account these negation cues when ana-lyzing opinionated texts because these words themselves usually appear in affective lexicons with their corresponding polarity values (i.e., impatient, for instance, appears in SentiWordNet with a negative polarity value).",
        "In order to detect negation cues, we use a list of predefined negation signals, along with an automatic method for detecting new ones.",
        "The list has been extracted from different previous works (Councill et al., 2010; Morante, 2010).",
        "This list also includes the most frequent contracted forms (e.g., don't, didn't, etc.).",
        "The automated method, in turn, is intended for discovering in text new affixal negation cues.",
        "To this end, we first find in the text all words with prefixes dis-, a-, un-, in-, im-, non-, il-, ir- and the suffix less that present the appropriate part of speech.",
        "Since not all words with such affixes are negation cues, we use semantic information from WordNet concepts and relations to decide.",
        "In this way, we retrieve from WordNet the synset that correspond to each word, using WordNet::SenseRelate (Patward-han et al., 2005) to correctly disambiguate the meaning of the word according to its context, along with all its antonym synsets.",
        "We next check if, after removing the affix, the word exists in WordNet and belongs to any of the antonym synsets.",
        "If so, we consider the original word to be a negation cue (i.e., the word without the affix has the opposite meaning than the lexical item with the affix).",
        "Table 1 presents some examples of explicit negation cues and words with implicit negation cues.",
        "For space reasons, not all cues are shown.",
        "We also consider common spelling errors such as the omission of apostrophes (e.g., isnt or nt).",
        "They are not likely to be found in literary texts, but are quite frequent in user-generated content.",

        "This process may be seen in Figure 1, where the syntax tree for the sentence: [Watson did] not [solve the case] is shown.",
        "In this sentence, the method identifies the negation token not and assumes its scope to be all descendant leaf nodes of the common ancestor of the words not and solve (i.e., solve the case).",
