        "Negation Resolution (NR) is the task of determining, for a given sentence, which tokens are affected by a negation cue.",
        "The data set most prominently used for the development of systems for automatic NR is the BioScope Corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), a collection of clinical reports and papers in the biomedical domain annotated with negation and speculation cues and their scopes.",
        "The data sets released in conjunction with the 2012 shared task on NR hosted by The First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2012) are comprised of the following negation annotated stories of Conan Doyle (CD): a training set of 3644 sentences drawn from The Hound of the Baskervilles (CDT), a development set of 787 sentences taken from Wisteria Lodge (CDD; we will refer to the combination of CDT and CDD as CDTD), and a held-out test set of 1089 sentences from The Cardboard Box and The Red Circle (CDE).",
        "In these sets, the concept of negation scope extends on the one adopted in the BioScope corpus in several aspects: Negation cues are not part of the scope, morphological (affixal) cues are annotated and scopes can be discontinuous.",
        "Moreover, in-scope states or events are marked as negated if they are factual and presented as events that did not happen (Morante and Daele-mans, 2012).",
        "Examples (1) and (2) below are examples of affixal negation and discontinuous scope respectively: The cues are bold, the tokens contained within their scopes are underlined and the negated",
        "event is italicized.",
        "(1) Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him [.",
        ".",
        ". ]",
        "(2) If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could",
        "only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician: little more than a senior student.",
        "Example (2) has no negated events because the sentence is non-factual.",
        "The *SEM shared task thus comprises three subtasks: cue identification, scope resolution and event detection.",
        "It is furthermore divided into two separate tracks: one closed track, where only the data supplied by the organizers (word form, lemma, PoS-tag and syntactic constituent for each token) may be employed, and an open track, where participants may employ any additional tools or resources.",
        "Pragmatically speaking, a token can be either out of scope or assigned to one or more of the three remaining classes: negation cue, in scope and negated event.",
        "Additionally, in-scope tokens and negated events are paired to the cues they are negated by.",
        "Our system achieves this by remodeling the task as a sequence labeling task.",
        "With annotations converted to sequences of labels, we train a Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier with a range of different feature types, including features defined over dependency graphs.",
        "This article presents two submissions for the *SEM shared task, differing only with respect to how these dependency graphs were derived.",
        "For our open track submission, the dependency representations are produced by a state-of-the-art dependency parser, whereas the closed track submission employs dependencies derived from the constituent analyses supplied with the shared task data sets through a process of constituent-to-dependency conversion.",
        "In both systems, labeling of test data is performed in two stages.",
        "First, cues are detected using a token classifier,1 and secondly, scope and event resolution is achieved by post-processing the output of the sequence labeler.",
        "The two systems described in this paper have been developed using CDT for training and CDD for testing, and differ only with regard to the source of syntactic information.",
        "All reported scores are generated using an evaluation script provided by the task organizers.",
        "In addition to providing a full end-to-end evaluation, the script breaks down results with respect to identification of cues, events, scope tokens, and two variants of scope-level exact match; one requiring exact match also of cues and another only partial cue match.",
        "For our system these two scope-level scores are identical and so are not duplicated in our reporting.",
        "Additionally we chose not to optimize for the scope tokens measure, and hence this is also not reported as a development result.",
        "Note also that the official evaluation actually includes two different variants of the metrics mentioned above; a set of primary measures with precision computed as P=TP/(TP+FP) and a set of B measures where precision is rather computed as P=TP/SYS, where SYS is the total number of predictions made by the system.",
        "The reason why SYS is not identical with TP+FP is that partial matches are 1Note that the cue classifier applied in the current paper is the same as that used in the other shared task submission from the University of Oslo (Read et al., 2012), and the two system descriptions will therefore have much overlap on this particular point.",
        "For all other components the architectures of the two system are completely different, however.",
        "only counted as FNs (and not FPs) in order to avoid double penalties.",
        "We do not report the B measures for development testing as they were introduced for the final evaluation and hence were not considered in our system optimization.",
        "We note though, that the relative-ranking of participating systems for the primary and B measures is identical, and that the correlation between the paired lists of scores is nearly perfect (r=0.997).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, the cue classifier, its features and results are described in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 presents the system for scope and event resolution and details different features, the model-internal representation used for sequence-labeling, as well as the post-processing component.",
        "Error analyses for the cue, scope and event components are provided in the respective sections.",
        "Section 4 and 5 provide developmental and held-out results, respectively.",
        "Finally, we provide conclusions and some reflections regarding future work in Section 6."

        "In addition to these token-level features, the classifier we apply here includes some features specifically targeting morphological or affixal cues.",
        "The first such feature records character n-grams from both the beginning and end of the base that an affix attaches to (up to five positions).",

        "For the second feature type targeting affix cues we try to emulate the effect of a lexicon lookup of the remaining substring that an affix attaches to, checking its status as an independent base form and its part-of-speech.",
        "In order to take advantage of such information while staying within the confines of the closed track, we automatically generate a lexicon from the training data, counting the instances of each PoS tagged lemma in addition to n-grams of word-initial characters (again recording up to five positions).",
        "For a given match of an affix pattern, a feature will then record the counts from this lexicon for the substring it attaches to.",
        "The rationale for this feature is that the occurrence of a substring such as un in a token such as underlying should be considered more unlikely to be a cue given that the first part of the remaining string (e.g., derly) would be an unlikely way to begin a word.",
        "Note that, it is also possible for a negation cue to span multiple tokens, such as the (discontinuous) pair neither / nor or fixed expressions like on the contrary.",
        "There are, however, only 16 instances of such multiword cues (MWCs) in the entire CDTD.",

        "Tokens that end up being classified as cues are then matched against the affix patterns observed during training in order to correctly delimit the annotation of the cue.)",
