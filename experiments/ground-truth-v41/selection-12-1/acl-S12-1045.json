        "While automatic detection of negation expressions (i.e. cues) in free text has been a subject of research interest for quite some time (e.g. Chapman et al. (2001), Elkin et al. (2005) etc), automatic detection of full scope of negation is a relatively new topic (Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Councill et al., 2010).",
        "Detection of negation cues, their scope and corresponding negated events in free text could improve accuracy in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as extraction of factual information from text, sentiment analysis, etc (Jia et al., 2009; Councill et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we present a system that was developed for the participation in the Scope Detection task of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task1.",
        "The proposed system exploits phrasal and contextual clues apart from various token specific features.",
        "Exploitation of phrasal clues is not new for negation scope detection.",
        "But the way we encode this information (i.e. the features for phrasal clues) is novel and differs completely from the previous work (Councill et al., 2010; Morante and Daelemans, 2009).",
        "Moreover, the total number of features that we use is also comparatively lower.",
        "Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, automatic negated event/property identification has not been explored prior to the *SEM 2012 Shared Task.",
        "So, our proposed approach for this particular subtask is another contribution of this paper.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "First, we describe the scope detection task as well as the accompanying datasets in Section 2.",
        "Then in Section 3, we present how we approach the task.",
        "Following that, in Section 4, various empirical results and corresponding analyses are discussed.",
        "Finally, we summarize our work and discuss how the system can be further improved in Section 5."

        "In a recently published study, Morante (2010) listed a number of negation cues and argued that their total number are actually not exhaustive.",
        "We refrained from using the cues listed in that paper (instead we built a list automatically from the training data) since additional knowledge/resource outside the training data was not allowed for the closed track.",
        "But we speculate that usage of such list of expressions as well as an external dictionary of (positive) words can further boost the high performance that we already achieved.",
        "Since scope and negation event detection are dependent on the correct identification of cues, we have done separate evaluation on the development data using the gold cues (instead of predicting the cues first).",
        "As the results in Table 7 show, there is a considerable increment in the results for both scope and event detection if the correct annotation of cues are available.",
        "The general trend of errors that we have observed in scope detection is that the more distant a token is from the negation cue in the phrase structure tree (of the corresponding sentence) the harder it becomes for the classifier to predict whether the token should be included in the scope or not.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before.?",
        "of the development data, the negation cue ?not?",
        "has scope over the whole sentence.",
        "But the scope classifier fails to include the last 4 words in the scope.",
        "Perhaps syntactic dependency can provide complementary information in such cases.",
        "As for the negated event identification errors, the majority of the prediction errors (on the development data) occurred for verb and noun tokens which are mostly immediately preceded by the negation cue.",

        "Interestingly, according to the results provided by the organisers, our system performs better than all the systems of the open track except one (details of these results are described in (Morante and Blanco, 2012)).",
        "The features exploited by our system include phrasal and contextual clues as well as token specific information.",
        "Empirical results show that the system achieves very high precision for scope detection.",
        "The results also imply that the novel phrasal clue features exploited by our system improve identification of negated events significantly.",
        "We believe the system can be further improved in a number of ways.",
        "Firstly, this can be done by incorporating linguistic knowledge as described in Morante (2010).",
        "Secondly, we did not take into account whether a sentence is a factual statement or a question before negated event detection.",
        "We also did not check whether a predicted negated event is found inside the predicted scope of the corresponding negation cue.",
        "These verifications should increase the results more.",
        "Finally, previous work reported that usage of syntactic dependency information helps in scope detection (Councill et al., 2010).",
        "Hence, this could be another possible direction for improvement."
