        "This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 2 of SemEval?2012, Measuring the Degree of Relational Similarity (Jurgens et al., 2012).",
        "The goal of the task was to rank sets of word pairs according to the degree to which they represented an underlying category of semantic relation.",
        "A highly ranked pair would be considered a good or prototypical example of the relation.",
        "For example, given the relation Y functions as an X the pair weapon:knife (X:Y) would likely be considered more representative of that relation than would be tool:spoon.",
        "The task included word pairs from 10 different categories of relational similarity, each with a number of subcategories.",
        "In total the evaluation data consisted of 69 files, each containing a set of approximately 40 word pairs.",
        "While training examples were also provided, these were not used by the Duluth systems.",
        "The system?generated rankings were compared with gold standard data created via Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "The Duluth systems relied on the Gloss Vector measure of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) as implemented in Word-Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004)1.",
        "This quantifies the degree of semantic relatedness between two word senses.",
        "It does not, however, discover or indicate the nature of the relation between the words.",
        "When given two words as input (as was the case in this task), it measures the relatedness of all possible combinations of word senses associated with this pair and reports the highest resulting score.",
        "Note that throughout this paper we use word and word sense somewhat interchangeably.",
        "In general it may be assumed that the term word or examples of words refers to a word sense.",
        "A key characteristic of this task was that the word pairs in each of the 69 sets were scored assuming a particular specified underlying semantic relation.",
        "Given this, the limitation that the Gloss Vector measure does not discover the nature of relations was less of a concern, and led to the hypothesis that a word pair that was highly related would also be a prototypical example of the underlying category of semantic relation.",
        "Unfortunately the results from this task do not generally support this hypothesis, although for a few categories at least it appears to have some validity.",
        "This paper continues with a review of the Gloss Vector measure, and explains its connections to the Adapted Lesk measure.",
        "The paper then summarizes the results of the three Duluth systems in this task, and concludes with some discussion and analysis of where this method had both successes and failures."

      "text": [
        "Semantic relatedness is a more general notion than semantic similarity.",
        "We follow (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) and limit semantic similarity to those measures based on distances and perhaps depths in a hierarchy made up of is?a relations.",
        "For example, car and motorcycle are similar in that they are connected via an is?a relation with vehicle.",
        "Semantic similarity is most often applied to nouns, but can also be used with verbs.",
        "Two word senses can be related in many ways, including similarity.",
        "car and furnace might be considered related because they are both made of steel, and firefighter and hose might be considered related because one uses the other, but neither pair is likely to be considered similar.",
        "Measures of relatedness generally do not specify the nature of the relationship between two word senses, but rather indicate that they are related to a certain degree in some unspecified way.",
        "As a result, measures of relatedness tend to be symmetric, so A is related to B to the same degree that B is related to A.",
        "It should be noted that some of the relations in Task 2 were not symmetric, which was no doubt a complicating factor for the Duluth systems."

      "text": [
        "The Gloss Vector measure was originally developed in an effort to generalize and improve upon the Adapted Lesk measure (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).2 Both the Gloss Vector measure and the Adapted Lesk measure start with the idea of a su-pergloss.",
        "A supergloss is the definition (or gloss) of a word sense that is expanded by concatenating it with the glosses of other surrounding senses that are connected to it via some WordNet relation.",
        "For example, a supergloss for car might consist of the definition of car, the definition of car's hypernym (e.g., vehicle), and the definitions of the meronyms (part-of) of car (e.g., wheel, brake, bumper, etc.)",
        "Other relations as detailed later in this paper may also be used to expand a supergloss.",
        "In the Adapted Lesk measure, the relatedness between two word senses is a function of the number and length of their matching overlaps in their super-glosses.",
        "Consecutive words that match are scored 2WordNet::Similarity::lesk more highly than single words, and a higher score for a pair of words indicates a stronger relation.",
        "The Adapted Lesk measure was developed to overcome the fact that most dictionary definitions are relatively short, which was a concern noted by (Lesk, 1986) when he introduced the idea of using definition overlaps for word sense disambiguation.",
        "While the Adapted Lesk measure expands the size of the definitions, there are still difficulties.",
        "In particular, the matches between words in superglosses must be exact, so morphological variants (run versus ran), synonyms (gas versus petrol), and closely related words (tree versus shrub) won't be considered overlaps and will be treated the same as words with no apparent connection (e.g., goat and vase)."

        "The Gloss Vector measure3 is inspired by a 2nd order word sense discrimination approach (Schu?tze, 1998) which is in turn related to Latent Semantic Indexing or Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "The basic idea is to replace each word in a written context with a vector of co-occurring words as observed in some corpus.",
        "In this task, the contexts are definitions (and example text) from WordNet.",
        "A supergloss is formed exactly as described for Adapted Lesk, and then each word in the supergloss is replaced by a vector of co?occurring words.",
        "Then, all the vectors in the supergloss are averaged together to create a new high dimensional representation of that word sense.",
        "The semantic relatedness between two word senses is measured by taking the cosine between their two averaged vectors.",
        "The end result is that rather than finding overlaps in definitions based on exact matches, a word in a definition is matched to whatever degree its co-occurrences match with the co-occurrences of the words in the other supergloss.",
        "This results in a more subtle and fine grained measure of relatedness than Adapted Lesk.",
        "The three Duluth systems only differ in the relations used to create the superglosses, otherwise they are identical.",

        "stop list of about 200 common words were excluded as co-occurrences, as were words that occurred less than 5 times or more than 50 times in the WordNet corpus.",

        "WordNet's greatest strength lies in its hypernym tree for nouns, and that was most likely the basis for the success of the CLASS-INCLUSION and SIMILAR categories.",
        "While the success with CONTRAST may seem unrelated, in fact it may be that pairs of opposites are often quite similar, for example happy and sad are both emotions and are similar except for their polarity.",
        "A number of the relations used in Task 2 are not well represented in WordNet.",
        "For example, there was a CASE RELATION which could benefit from information about selectional restrictions or case frames that just isn't available in WordNet.",
        "The same is true of the CAUSE-PURPOSE relation as there is relatively little information about casual relations in WordNet.",
        "While there are part-of relations in WordNet (meronyms/holonyms), these did not prove to be common enough to be a significant benefit for the PART-WHOLE relations in the task.",
        "For many of the relations in the task the Gloss Vector measure was most likely relying primarily on hypernym and hyponym relations, which explains the bias towards categories that featured similarity-based relations.",
        "We are however optimistic that a Gloss Vector approach could be more successful given a richer set of relations from which to draw information for superglosses."
