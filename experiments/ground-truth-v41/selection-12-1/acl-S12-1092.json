        "The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task proposed at SemEval 2012 consists of examining the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences and assigning a score to quantify such similarity ranging from 0 (the two texts are about different topics) to 5 (the two texts are semantically equivalent).",
        "The complete description of the task, the datasets and the evaluation methodology adopted can be found in (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Typical approaches to measure semantic textual similarity exploit information at the lexical level.",
        "The proposed solutions range from calculating the overlap of common words between the two text segments (Salton et al., 1997) to the application of knowledge-based and corpus-based word similarity metrics to cope with the low recall achieved by on simple lexical matching (Mihalcea et al., 2006).",
        "Our participation in the STS task is inspired by previous work on paraphrase recognition, in which machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics are used to identify whether a pair of sentences are semantically equivalent or not (Finch and Hwang, 2005; Wan et al., 2006).",
        "Our approach to semantic textual similarity makes use of not only lexical information but also syntactic and semantic information.",
        "To this aim, our metrics are based on different natural language processing tools that provide syntactic and semantic annotation.",
        "These include shallow parsing, constituency parsing, dependency parsing, semantic roles labeling, discourse representation analyzer, and named entities recognition.",
        "In addition, we employed distributional and knowledge-based word similarity metrics in an attempt to improve the results given by the MT metrics.",
        "The computed scores are used as features to train a regression model in a supervised learning framework.",
        "Our best run model achieves 60.77% correlation with human judgements when evaluating the semantic similarity of texts from the entire test set and was ranked in the 20th position (out of 88 submitted runs) in the Mean ranking."

        "MT evaluation metrics are designed to assess whether the output of a MT system is semantically equivalent to a set of reference translations.",
        "The MT evaluation metrics described in this section, implemented in the Asiya Open Toolkit for Automatic Machine Translation (Meta-) Evaluation1 (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2010) are used to extract features at different linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic and semantic.",
        "For the syntactic and semantic levels, Asiya calculates similarity measures based on the linguistic elements provided by each kind of annotation.",
        "Linguistic elements are defined as ?the linguistic units, structures, or relationships?",
        "(Gime?nez, 2008) (e.g. dependency relations, discourse relations, named entities, part-of-speech tags, among others).",
        "(Gime?nez, 2008) defines two simple measures using the linguistic elements of a given linguistic level: overlapping and matching.",
        "Overlapping is a measure of the proportion of items inside the linguistic elements of a certain type shared by both texts.",
        "Matching is defined in the same way with the difference that the order between the items inside a linguistic element is taken into consideration.",
        "That is, the items of a linguistic element are concatenated in a single unit from left to right.",
        "At the lexical level we explored different n-gram and edit distance based metrics.",
        "The difference among them is in the way each algorithm calculates the lexical similarity, which yields to different results.",
        "We used the following n-gram-based metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Dod-dington, 2002), ROUGE (Lin and Och, 2004), GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "Besides those, we also used metrics based on edit distance.",
        "Such metrics calculate the number of edit operations (e.g. insertions, deletions, and substitutions) necessary to transform one text",
        "into the other (the lower the number of edit operations, the higher the similarity score).",
        "The edit-distance-based metrics used were: WER (Nie?",
        "en et al., 2000), PER (Tillmann et al., 1997), TER (Snover et al., 2006) and TER-Plus (Snover et al., 2009).",
        "The lexical metrics form a group of metrics that we hereafter call lex.",
        "The syntactic level was explored by running constituency parsing (cp), dependency parsing (dp), and shallow parsing (sp).",
        "Constituency trees were produced by the Max-Ent reranking parser (Char-niak, 2005).",
        "The constituency parse trees were exploited by using three different classes of metrics that were designed to calculate the similarities between the trees of two texts: overlapping in function of a given part-of-speech; matching in function of a given constituency type; and syntactic tree matching (STM) metric proposed by (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",
        "Dependency trees were obtained using MINI-PAR (Lin, 2003).",
        "Two types of metrics were used to calculate the similarity between two texts using dependency trees.",
        "In the first, different similarity measures were calculated taking into consideration three different perspectives: overlap of words that hang in the same level or in a deeper level of the dependency tree; overlap between words that hang directly from terminal nodes given a specified part-of-speech; and overlap between words that are ruled by non-terminal nodes given a specified grammatical relation (subject, object, relative clause, among others).",
        "The second type is an implementation of the headword chain matching introduced in (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",
        "The shallow syntax approach proposed by (Gime?nez, 2008) uses three different tools to explore the parts-of-speech, word lemmas and base phrases chunks, respectively: SVMTool (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2004), Freeling (Carreras et al., 2004) and Phreco (Carreras et al., 2005).",
        "In this type of metrics the idea is to measure the similarity between the two texts using parts-of-speech and chunk types.",
        "The following metrics were used: overlapping according to the part-of-speech; overlapping according to the chunk type; the accumulated NIST metric (Doddington, 2002) scores over different",
        "sequences (lemmas, parts-of-speech, base phrase chunks and chunk IOB labels).",
        "At the semantic level we aplored three different types of information, namely: discourse representations, named entities and semantic roles.",
        "Hereafter they are respectively referred to as dr, ne, and sr features.",
        "The discourse relations are automatically annotated using the C&C Tools (Clark and Curran, 2004).",
        "The following metrics using semantic tree representations were proposed by (Gime?nez, 2008).",
        "A metric similar to the STM in which semantic trees are used instead of constituency trees; the overlapping between discourse representation structures according to their type; and the morphosyntactic overlapping of discourse representation structures that share the same type.",
        "Named entities metrics are calculated by comparing the entities that appear in each text.",
        "The named entities were annotated using the BIOS package (Surdeanu et al., 2005).",
        "Two types of metrics were used: the overlapping between the named entities in each sentence according to their type and the matching between the named entities in function of their type.",
        "Semantic roles were automatically annotated using the SwiRL package (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005).",
        "The arguments and adjuncts annotated in each sentence are compared according to three different metrics: overlapping between the semantic roles according to their type; the matching between the semantic roles according to their type; and the overlapping of the roles without taking into consideration their lexical realization."

        "In order to incorporate world knowledge information about entities (persons, organizations, locations, among others) into our model we experimented with knowledge-based (thesaurus-based) word similarity metrics.",
        "Usually such approaches have a very limited coverage of concepts due to the reduced size of the available thesauri.",

        "Using the entity's URL it is possible to retrieve the Wordnet synsets related to the entity's entry in YAGO2 and explore different knowledge-based metrics to compute word similarity between entities.",
