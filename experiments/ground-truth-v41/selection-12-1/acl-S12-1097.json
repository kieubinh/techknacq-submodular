        "This paper describes the University of Sheffield's submission to SemEval-2012 Task 6: Semantic Text Similarity (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "The task is concerned with determining the degree of semantic equivalence between a pair of sentences.",
        "Measuring the similarity between sentences is an important problem that is relevant to many areas of language processing, including the identification of text reuse (Seo and Croft, 2008; Bendersky and Croft, 2009), textual entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004; Zanzotto et al., 2009), paraphrase detection (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004), Information Extraction/Question Answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005), Information Retrieval (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), short answer grading (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009), recommendation (Tintarev and Masthoff, 2006) and evaluation (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin, 2004).",
        "Many of the previous approaches to measuring the similarity between texts have relied purely on lexical matching techniques, for example (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Papineni et al., 2002; Lin, 2004).",
        "In these approaches the similarity of texts is computed as a function of the number of matching tokens, or sequences of tokens, they contain.",
        "However, this approach fails to identify similarities when the same meaning is conveyed using synonymous terms or phrases (for example, ?The dog sat on the mat?",
        "and ?The hound sat on the mat?)",
        "or when the meanings of the texts are similar but not identical (for example, ?The cat sat on the mat?",
        "and ?A dog sat on the chair?).",
        "Significant amounts of previous work on text similarity have focussed on comparing the meanings of texts longer than a single sentence, such as paragraphs or documents (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Seo and Croft, 2008; Bendersky and Croft, 2009).",
        "The size of these texts means that there is a reasonable amount of lexical items in each document that can be used to determine similarity and failing to identify connections between related terms may not be problematic.",
        "The situation is different for the problem of semantic text similarity where the texts are short (single sentences).",
        "There are fewer lexical items to match in this case, making it more important that connections between related terms are identified.",
        "One way in which this information has been incorporated in NLP systems has",
        "been to make use of WordNet to provide information about similarity between word meanings, and this approach has been shown to be useful for computing text similarity (Mihalcea and Corley, 2006; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009).",
        "This paper describes two approaches to the semantic text similarity problem that use WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) to provide information about relations between word meanings.",
        "The two approaches are based on commonly used techniques for computing semantic similarity based on lexical matching.",
        "The first is unsupervised while the other requires annotated data to train a learning algorithm.",
        "Results of the SemEval evaluation show that the supervised approach produces the best overall results and that using the information provided by WordNet leads to an improvement in performance.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "The next section describes the two approaches for computing semantic similarity between pairs of sentences that were developed.",
        "The system submitted for the task is described in Section 3 and its performance in the official evaluation in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 contains the conclusions and suggestions for future work."

        "Binary vectors are then created for each sentence.",
        "The similarity between sentences can be computed by comparing these vectors using the cosine metric.",

        "and ?hound?",
        "in the sentences ?The dog sat on the mat?",
        "and ?The hound sat on the mat?.",
        "To take account of these similarities WordNet-based similarity measures are used (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).",
        "Any terms that occur in only one of the sentences do not contribute to the similarity score since they will have a 0 value in the binary vector.",
        "Any words with a 0 value in one of the binary vectors are compared with all of the words in the other sentence and the similarity values computed.",
        "The highest similarity value is selected and use to replace the 0 value in that vector, see Figure 1.",
        "(If the similarity score is below the set threshold of 0.5 then the similarity value is not used and in these cases the 0 value remains unaltered.)",
        "This substitution of 0 values in the vectors ensures that similarity between words can be taken account of when computing sentence similar",
        "Various techniques were explored for determining the similarity values between words.",

        "The similarity between two sentences is computed using the cosine metric.",

        "duce the similarity score.",
        "This score is multiplied by 5 in order to generate a score in the range required for the task.",

        "Lesk (1986) chooses a synset by comparing its definition against the sentence and selecting the one with the highest number of words in common.",
        "Similarity measures WordNet-based similarity measures have been found to perform well when used in combination with text similarity measures (Mihalcea and Corley, 2006) and several of these were compared.",
        "Implementations of these measures from the NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) were used.",
        "Path Distance uses the length of the shortest path between two senses to determine the similarity between them.",
