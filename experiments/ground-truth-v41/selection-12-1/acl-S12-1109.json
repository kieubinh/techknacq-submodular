        "This paper describes the participation of Sagan, a TE and CLTE system, in the new task of Cross Lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchronization.",
        "The objective of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task (Dagan et al., 2006) is determining whether the meaning of a text fragment that we call hypothesis H can be inferred from another text fragment T. In this manner, we say that T entails H, if a person reading T would infer that H is most likely true.",
        "Thus, this definition assumes common human understanding of language and common background knowledge.",
        "In that context, Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment addresses textual entailment recognition in the challenging application scenario of content synchronization.",
        "Thus, CLTE constitutes a generalization of Textual Entailment task (also Monolingual Textual Entailment) , but envisioning a larger number of application areas in NLP, including question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, and document summarization, across different languages.",
        "Content synchronization could be used to keep consistence among documents written in different languages.",
        "For example, a CLTE system can be used in Wikipedia articles to inform lectors which information is absent or inconsistent in comparison to other page in a different language.",
        "This new task has to face more additional issues than monolingual TE.",
        "Among them, we emphasize the ambiguity, polysemy, and coverage of the resources.",
        "Another additional problem is the necessity for semantic inference across languages, and the limited availability of multilingual knowledge resources.",
        "The CLTE for content synchronization specifically consist on determining the entailment relationship between two text fragment T1 and T2 which are assumed belong a related topic.",
        "Four alternatives are possible in this relationship:",
        "- Bidirectional : It is a semantic equivalence between T1 and T2.",
        "- Forward : It is an unidirectional entailment from T1 to T2.",

        "The RTE challenge has mutated over the years, aiming at accomplishing more accurate and specific solutions; in 2009 the organizers proposed a pilot task, the Textual Entailment Search (Bentivogli et al. 2009), consisting in finding all the sentences in a set of documents that entail a given Hypothesis and since 2010 there is a Novelty Detection Task, which means that RTE systems are required to judge whether the information contained in each H is novel with respect to (i.e., not entailed by) the information contained in the corpus.",

        "As mentioned before, the goal of the RTE task (Bentivogli et al. 2009) is determining whether the meaning of a hypothesis H can be inferred from a text T. The main difference with STS is that STS consists in determining how similar two text fragments are, in a range from 5 (total semantic equivalence) to 0 (no relation).",
        "Thus, STS mainly differs from TE and Paraphrasing in that the classification is graded instead of binary and also STS assumes bidirectional equivalence but in TE the equivalence is only directional.",
