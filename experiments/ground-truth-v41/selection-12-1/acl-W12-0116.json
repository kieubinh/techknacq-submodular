        "In the recent years, machine translation (MT) has achieved significant improvement in terms of translation quality (Koehn, 2010).",
        "Both data-driven approaches (e.g., statistical MT (SMT)) and knowledge-based (e.g., rule-based MT (RBMT)) have achieved comparable results shown in the evaluation campaigns (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).",
        "However, according to the human evaluation, the final outputs of the MT systems are still far from satisfactory.",
        "Fortunately, recent error analysis shows that the two trends of the MT approaches tend to be complementary to each other, in terms of the types of the errors they made (Thurmair, 2005; Chen et al., 2009).",
        "Roughly speaking, RBMT systems often have missing lexicon and thus lack of robustness, while handling linguistic phenomena requiring syntactic information better.",
        "SMT systems, on the contrary, are in general more robust, but sometimes output ungrammatical sentences.",
        "In fact, instead of competing with each other, there is also a line of research trying to combine the advantages of the two sides using a hybrid framework.",
        "Although many systems can be put under the umbrella of ?hybrid?",
        "systems, there are various ways to do the combination/integration.",
        "Thurmair (2009) summarized several different architectures of hybrid systems using SMT and RBMT systems.",
        "Some widely used ones are: 1) using an SMT to post-edit the outputs of an RBMT; 2) selecting the best translations from several hypotheses coming from different SMT/RBMT systems; and 3) selecting the best segments (phrases or words) from different hypotheses.",
        "For the language pair Bulgarian-English, there has not been much study on it, mainly due to the lack of resources, including corpora, preprocessors, etc.",
        "There was a system published by Koehn et al. (2009), which was trained and tested on the European Union law data, but not on other domains like news.",
        "They reported a very high BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) on the Bulgarian-English translation direction (61.3), which inspired us to further investigate this direction.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the Bulgarian-to-English translation and mainly explore the approach of annotating the SMT baseline with linguistic features derived from the preprocessing and hand-crafted grammars.",
        "There are three motivations behind our approach: 1) the SMT baseline trained on a decent amount of parallel corpora outputs surprisingly good results, in terms of both statistical evaluation metrics and preliminary manual evaluation; 2) the augmented model gives",
        "us more space for experimenting with different linguistic features without losing the ?basic?",
        "robustness; 3) the MT system can profit from continued advances in the development of the deep grammars thereby opening up further integration possibilities.",
        "The rest of the paper will be organized as follows: Section 2 presents our work on cleaning the corpora and Section 3 briefly describes the preprocessing of the data.",
        "Section 4 introduces our factor-based SMT model which allows us to incorporate various linguistic features into an SMT baseline, among which those features coming from the MRS are described in Section 5 in detail.",
        "We show our experiments in Section 6 as well as both automatic and manual evaluation of the results.",
        "Section 7 briefly mentions some related work and then we summarize this paper in Section 8."

        "Our work is also enlightened by another line of research, transfer-based MT models, which are seemingly different but actually very close.",
        "In this section, before we mention some previous work in this research direction, we firstly introduce the background of the development of the deep HPSG grammars.",
        "The MRSes are usually delivered together with the HPSG analyses of the text.",
        "There already",
        "exist quite extensive implemented formal HPSG grammars for English (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000), German (Mu?ller and Kasper, 2000), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel and Bender, 2002).",
        "HPSG is the underlying theory of the international initiative LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002).",
        "At the moment, precise and linguistically motivated grammars, customized on the base of the Grammar Matrix, have been or are being developed for Norwegian, French, Korean, Italian, Modern Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, etc.",
        "There also exists a first version of the Bulgarian Resource Grammar - BURGER.",
        "In the research reported here, we use the linguistic modeled knowledge from the existing English and Bulgarian grammars.",
        "Since the Bulgarian grammar has limited coverage on news data, dependency parsing has been performed instead.",
        "Then, mapping rules have been defined for the construction of RMRSes.",
        "However, the MRS representation is still quite close to the syntactic level, which is not fully language independent.",
        "This requires a transfer at the MRS level, if we want to do translation from the source language to the target language.",
        "The transfer is usually implemented in the form of rewriting rules.",
        "For instance, in the Norwegian LO-GON project (Oepen et al., 2004), the transfer rules were handwritten (Bond et al., 2005; Oepen et al., 2007), which included a large amount of manual work.",
        "Graham and van Genabith (2008) and Graham et al. (2009) explored the automatic rule induction approach in a transfer-based MT setting involving two lexical functional grammars (LFGs), which was still restricted by the performance of both the parser and the generator.",
        "Lack of robustness for target side generation is one of the main issues, when various ill-formed or fragmented structures come out after transfer.",
        "Oepen et al. (2007) use their generator to generate text fragments instead of full sentences, in order to increase the robustness.",
        "We want to make use of the grammar resources while keeping the robustness, therefore, we experiment with another way of transfer involving information derived from the grammars.",
        "In our approach, we take an SMT system as our ?backbone?",
        "which robustly delivers some translation for any given input.",
        "Then, we augment SMT with deep linguistic knowledge.",
        "In general, what we are doing is still along the lines of previous work utilizing deep grammars, but we build a more ?light-weighted?",
        "transfer model."

        "2) We would like to add factors on the target language side (English) as well.",
