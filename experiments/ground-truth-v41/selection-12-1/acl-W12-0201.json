        "The LINGVIS and UNCLH (Visualization of Linguistic Patterns & Uncovering Language History from Multilingual Resources) were originally conceived of as two separate workshops.",
        "Due to perceived similarities in content, the two workshops were combined and organized jointly.",
        "The overal aim of the joint workshop was to explore how methods developed in computational linguistics, statistics and computer science can help linguists in exploring various language phenomena.",
        "The workshop focused particularly on two topics: 1) visualization of linguistic patterns (LINGVIS); 2) usage of multilingual resources in computational historical linguistics (UNCLH)."

        "The overall goal of the first half of the workshop was to bring together researchers working within the emerging subfield of computational linguistics ?",
        "using methods established within Computer Science in the fields of Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics in conjunction with methodology and analyses from theoretical and computational linguistics.",
        "Despite the fact that statistical methods for language analysis have proliferated in the last two decades, computational linguistics has so far only marginally availed itself of techniques from InfoVis and Visual Analytics (e.g., Honkela et al.",
        "(1995); Neumann et al. (2007); Collins et al.",
        "(2009); Collins (2010); Mayer et al. (2010a); Mayer et al. (2010b); Rohrdantz et al. (2011)).",
        "The need to integrate methods from InfoVis and Visual Analytics arises particularly with respect to situations in which the amount of data to be analyzed is huge and the interactions between relevant features are complex.",
        "Both of these situations hold for much of current (computational) linguistic analysis.",
        "The usual methods of statistical analysis do not allow for quick and easy grasp and interpretation of the patterns discovered through statistical processing and an integration of innovative visualization techniques has become imperative.",
        "The overall aim of the first half of the workshop was thus to draw attention to this need and to the newly emerging type of work that is beginning to respond to the need.",
        "The workshop succeeded in bringing together researchers interesting in combining techniques and methodology from theoretical and computational linguistics with InfoVis and Visual Analytics.",
        "Three of the papers in the workshop focused on the investigation and visualization of lexical semantics.",
        "Rohrdantz et al. present a diachronic study of fairly recently coined derivational suffixes (-gate, -geddon, -athon) as used in newspaper corpora across several languages.",
        "Their analysis is able to pinpoint systematic differences in contextual use as well as some first clues as to how and why certain new coinages spread better than others.",
        "Heylen et al. point out that methods such as those used in Rohrdantz et al., while producing interesting results, are essentially black boxes for the researchers ?",
        "it is not clear exactly what is being calculated.",
        "Their paper presents some first steps towards making the black box more transparent.",
        "In particular, they take a close look at individual tokens and their semantic use with respect to Dutch synsets.",
        "Crucially, they anticipate an interactive visualization that will allow linguistically informed lexicogra",
        "phers to work with the available data and patterns.",
        "A slightly different take on synset relations is presented by Lohk et al., who use visualization methods to help identify errors in WordNets across different languages.",
        "Understanding differences and relatedness between languages or types of a language is the subject of another three papers.",
        "Littauer et al. use data from the WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures; Dryer and Haspelmath (2011)) to model language relatedness via heat maps.",
        "They overcome two difficulties: one is the sparseness of the WALS data; another is that WALS does not directly contain information about possible effects of language contact.",
        "Littauer et al. attempt to model the latter by taking geographical information about languages into account (neighboring languages and their structure).",
        "A different kind of language relatedness is investigated by Yan-nakoudakis et al., who look at learner corpora and develop tools that allow an assessment of learner competence with respect to various linguistic features found in the corpora.",
        "The number of relevant features is large and many of them are interdependent or interact.",
        "Thus, the amount and complexity of the data present a classic case of complex data sets that are virtually impossible to analyze well without the application of visualization methods.",
        "Finally, Lyding et al. take academic texts and investigate the use of modality across academic registers and across time in order to identify whether the academic language used in different subfields (or adjacent fields) of an academic field has an effect on the language use of that field."

        "The second half of the workshop focused on the usage of multilingual resources in computational historical linguistics.",
        "In the past 20 years, the application of quantitative methods in historical linguistics has received increasing attention among linguists (Dunn et al., 2005; Heggarty et al., 2010; McMahon and McMahon, 2006), computational linguists (Kondrak, 2001; Hall and Klein, 2010) and evolutionary anthropologists (Gray and Atkinson, 2003).",
        "Due to the application of these quantitative methods, the field of historical linguistics is undergoing a renaissance.",
        "One of the main problems that researchers face is the limited amount of suitable comparative data, often falling back on relatively restricted ?Swadesh type?",
        "wordlists.",
        "One solution is to use synchronic data, like dictionaries or texts, which are available for many languages.",
        "For example, in Kondrak (2001), vocabularies of four Algonquian languages were used in the task of automatic cognate identification.",
        "Another solution employed by Snyder et al. (2010) is to apply a non-parametric Bayesian framework to two non-parallel texts in the task of text deciphering.",
        "Although very promising, these approaches have so far only received modest attention.",
        "Thus, many questions and challenges in the automatization of language resources in computational historical linguistics remain open and ripe for investigation.",
        "In dialectological studies, there is a long tradition, starting with Se?guy (1971), in which language varieties are grouped together on the basis of their similarity with respect to certain properties.",
        "Later work in this area has incorporated methods of string alignment for a quantitative comparison of individual words to obtain an average measure of the similarity of languages.",
        "This line of research became known as dialectome-try.",
        "Unlike traditional dialectology which is based on the analysis of individual items, dialectometry shifts focus on the aggregate level of differences.",
        "Most of the work done so far in dialectometry is based on the carefully selected wordlists and problems with the limited amount of suitable data (i.e. computer readable and comparable across dialects) are also present in this field.",
        "This workshop brings together researchers interested in computational approaches that uncover sound correspondences and sound changes, automatic identification of cognates across languages and language comparison based both on wordlists and parallel texts.",
        "First, Wettig et al. investigate the sound correspondences in cognate sets in a sample of Uralic languages.",
        "Then, List's contribution to the volume introduces a novel method for automatic cognate detection in multilingual wordlists which combines various previous approaches for string comparison.",
        "The paper by Mayer & Cysouw presents a first step to use parallel texts for a quantitative comparison of languages.",
        "The papers by Scherrer and Prokic?",
        "et al.",
        "both are in the spirit of the dialectometric line of research.",
        "Further, Ja?ger reports on quantifying language similarity via phonetic alignment of core vocabulary items.",
        "Finally, some of the pa",
        "pers presented in this workshop deal with further topics in quantitative language comparison, like the application of phylogenetic methods in creole research in the paper by Daval-Markussen & Bakker, and the study of the evolution of the Australian kinship terms reported on in the paper by McConvell & Dousset.",

        "A Visual Analysis) present a quantitative cross-linguistic investigation of the lexical semantic content expressed by three suffixes originating in English: -gate, -geddon and -athon.",
        "Using data from newspapers, they look at the distribution and lexical semantic usage of these morphemes across several languages and also across time, with a time-depth of 20 years for English.",
        "Using techniques from InfoVis and Visual Analytics is crucial for the analysis as the occurrence of these suffixes in the available corpora is comparatively rare and it is only by dint of processing and visualizing huge amounts of data that a clear pattern can begin to emerge.",
        "Kris Heylen, Dirk Speelman and Dirk Geer-aerts (?Looking at Word Meaning.",
        "An Interactive Visualization of Semantic Vector Spaces for Dutch synsets?)",
        "focus on the pervasive use of Semantic Vector Spaces (SVS) in statistical NLP as a standard technique for the automatic mod-eling of lexical semantics.",
        "They take on the fact that while the method appears to work fairly well (though they criticize the standardly available evaluation measures via some created gold standard), it is in fact quite unclear how it captures word meaning.",
        "That is, the standard technology can be seen as a black box.",
        "In order to find a way of providing some transparency to the method, they explore the way an SVS structures the individual occurrences of words with respect to the occurrences of 476 Dutch nouns.",
        "These were grouped into 214 synsets in previous work.",
        "This paper looks at a token-by-token similarity matrix in conjunction with a visualization that uses the Google Chart Tools and compares the results with previous work, especially in light of different uses in different versions of Dutch.",

        "use visualization methods to compare two existing Word-Nets (English and Estonian) in order to identify errors and semantic inconsistencies that are a result of the manual coding.",
        "Their method opens up a potentially interesting way of automatically checking for inconsistencies and errors not only at a fairly basic and surface level, but by working with the lexical semantic classification of the words in question.",
        "way of visualizing relationships between languages.",
        "The paper is based on data extracted from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), which is the most complete set of typological and digitized data available to date, but which presents two challenges: 1) it actually has very low coverage both in terms of languages represented and in terms of feature description for each language; 2) areal effects are not coded for.",
        "While the authors find a way to overcome the first challenge, the paper's real contribution lies in proposing a method for overcoming the second challenge.",
        "In particular, the typological data is filtered by geographical proximity and then displayed by means of heat maps, which reflect the strength of similarity between languages for different linguistic features.",
        "Thus, the data should allow one to be able to ascertain areal typological effects via a single integrated visualization.",
        "with visualization tools.",
        "Learner corpora are interesting because their analysis requires a good understanding of a complex set of interacting linguistic features across corpora with different distributional patterns (since each corpus potentially diverges from the standard form of the language by a different set of features).",
        "The paper",
        "presents a visual user interface which supports the investigation of a set of linguistic features discriminating between pass and fail exam scripts.",
        "The system displays directed graphs to model interactions between features and supports exploratory search over a set of learner texts.",
        "A very useful result for SLA is the proposal of a new method for empirically quantifying the linguistic abilities that characterize different levels of language learning.",
        "methods for visualizing diachronic language changes in academic writing.",
        "In particular, they look at the use of modality across different academic subfields and investigate whether adjacent subfields affect the use of language in a given academic subfield.",

        "sketches a number of the author's research projects on diachronic linguistics.",
        "He first discusses computational techniques for implementing several steps of the comparative method.",
        "These techniques include algorithms that deal with a wide range of problems: pairwise and multiple string alignment, calculation of phonetic similarity between two strings, automatic extraction of recurrent sound correspondences, quantification of semantic similarity between two words, identification of sets of cognates and building of phylogenetic trees.",
        "In the second part, Kondrak sketches several NLP projects that directly benefitted from his research on diachronic linguistics: statistical machine translation, word alignment, identification of confusable drug names, transliteration, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, letter-phoneme alignment and mapping of annotations.",
        "Thomas Mayer and Michael Cysouw (?Language Comparison through Sparse Multilingual Word Alignment?)",
        "present a novel approach on how to calculate similarities among languages with the help of massively parallel texts.",
        "Instead of comparing languages pairwise they suggest a simultaneous analysis of languages with respect to their co-occurrence statistics for individual words on the sentence level.",
        "These statistics are then used to group words into clusters which are considered to be partial (or ?sparse?)",
        "alignments.",
        "These alignments then serve as the basis for the similarity count where languages are taken to be more similar the more words they share in the various alignments, regardless of the actual form of the words.",
