        "It is well-known that parts of a compound can begin to lead an additional life as derivational suffixes, or even as standalone items.",
        "A famous example is burger, which is now used to denote a food-item (e.g., burger, cheese burger, veggie burger) and is originally from the word Hamburger, which designates a person from the German city of Hamburg.",
        "These morphemes are generally known as cranberry morphemes (because of the prolific use of cran).",
        "Some other examples are -(o)nomics, -(o)mat or (o)rama.",
        "While it is well-known that this morphological process exists, it is less clear what conditions trigger it and how the coinage ?catches?",
        "on to become a regular part of a language.",
        "Given the current availability of huge amounts of digital data, we decided to investigate whether we could gain an insight into the use and spread of some of these morphemes via quantitative methods, thereby confirming our intuitions.",
        "Furthermore, we decided to focus not just on the use of the cranberry morphemes in their language of origin, but also on their use and spread in other languages.",
        "In particular, we want to model the contexts in which these suffixes are used to coin new words and how these neologisms transport to other languages.",
        "We chose to look at the following three morphemes: -gate, -geddon and -athon because they tend to be used in ?newsworthy?",
        "contexts and are therefore likely to appear in newswire and newspaper corpora, which are available to us in large amounts.",
        "This paper describes work in progress, where we visually analyze the lexical semantics and use of the three suffixes -gate, -geddon and -athon.",
        "We were able to add some time-depth to our investigation via an analysis of the New York Times corpus from 1987?2007.",
        "This means that while we cannot pinpoint the first occurrence and further spread of the morpheme uses, we can gain some idea as to their historical development.",
        "Given that the amount of data we analyze is huge, we use methods from Visual Analytics in order to make the vast amount of information generated from the computational models easily accessible to the human eye and mind.",
        "We proceed as follows: After a review of related work in Section 2, we describe our study in Section 3 and discuss the visual analysis in Section 4.",

        "Work by Lu?deling and Evert (2005) on the German non-medical suffix -itis is closest to this paper; however, the type of the morpheme investigated is different and their focus is mainly on productivity.",
        "We concentrate more on the lexical semantic content of the suffixes, look at them across languages in bigger corpora to investigate their distribution and use and provide a layer of visual analysis.",
        "One question we asked ourselves is whether we could predict from the context the likelihood of the suffixes -gate, -geddon and -athon and whether one can identify the lexical semantic content of the suffixes more precisely.",
        "This task can be formulated as a topic modeling problem for which we chose to employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "It has recently been used to perform word sense induction from small word contexts (e.g. Brody (2009)) and has also proven successful when detecting changes in word meanings over time on small word contexts in diachronic corpora (Rohrdantz et al., 2011).",
        "We applied an optimized topic model and combined the statistical results with methods from Visual Analytics.",
        "Visual Analytics is based on the tight coupling of algorithms for automatic data analysis and interactive visual components (Thomas and Cook, 2005; Keim et al., 2010).",
        "The idea is to exploit human perceptive abilities to support the detection of interesting patterns (see Card et al. (1999) for details).",
        "Examples for visualizations used previously to investigate linguistic questions are Mayer et al. (2010a) on vowel harmony, Mayer et al. (2010b) on consonant patterns, Honkela et al. (1995) on syntactic categories, Rohrdantz et al. (2011) on lexical semantics across time.",
        "We also used visualizations to look at cross-linguistic use and productivity of the suffixes.",
        "Prominent theoretical work on the productivity of morphemes has been done by Baayen (1992) and Plag (1999), most computational approaches have worked on English due to the availability of large enough corpora (Nishimoto, 2004).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no large-scale quantitative study has been performed which takes into account both the diachronic as well as the cross-linguistic dimension of the development."
