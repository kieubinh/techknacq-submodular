        "This paper presents a novel way of visualising relationships between languages.",
        "Relationships between languages can be understood with respect to linguistic features of the languages, their geographical proximity, and their status with respect to historical development.",
        "The visualisations presented in this paper are part of a new attempt to bring together these three perspectives into a single image.",
        "One line of recent work brings computational methods to bear on the formation and use of large typological databases, often using sophisticated statistical techniques to discover relations between languages (Cysouw, 2011; Daume?",
        "III and Campbell, 2007; Daume?",
        "III, 2009, among others), and another line of work uses typological data in natural language processing (Georgi et al., 2010; Lewis and Xia, 2008, for example).",
        "The task of visually presenting the resulting data in this way has been only infrequently addressed.",
        "We are aware of some similar work (Mayer et al., 2010; Rohrdantz et al., 2010) in visualising differences in linguistic typology, phylogeny (Multitree, 2009), and geographical variation (Wieling et al., 2011).",
        "Here, we present our method for addressing the visualisation gap, bringing together phylogeny, typology, and geography by using data from the World Atlas of Language Structures (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011) to develop heat maps that can visually show the interconnected relationships between languages and language families.",
        "The main envisioned application of our visualisations is in the area of linguistic typology.",
        "Typology has been used to derive implications about possible languages, and about the ordering of the human mind.",
        "Different theorists have taken different views on the relationship between typology and the universality of languages.",
        "For example, Greenberg (1963), a foundational work, identified a number of cross-linguistic typological properties and implications and aimed to present them as truly universal ?",
        "relevant for all languages.",
        "In a similar vein, typological universals have been employed as evidence in a generative story regarding language learning (Chomsky, 2000).",
        "Taking a different perspective, Dunn et al. (2011) argued that a language's typology relies upon the previous generations?",
        "language more than on any biological, environmental or cognitive constraints, and that there are pathways which",
        "are generally followed in language change based on the previous parent language.",
        "What these arguments have in common is a reliance on a view of linguistic typology that is potentially restricted in its scope, due to insufficient access to broad-scale empirical data, covering many features of many languages of the world.",
        "The most comprehensive computational resource for linguistic typology currently available is the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS).1 WALS is a large database of details of structural properties of several thousand languages (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011).",
        "The properties were collected from descriptive sources by the project's 55 authors.",
        "However, of the 2,678 languages and 192 features in WALS, only 16% of the possible data points are actually specified?the data are sparse, and the sparsity of the data naturally makes it difficult to perform reliable statistical analysis.",
        "One way to work around this limitation is to seek meaningful visualisations of the data in WALS, instead of simply relying on raw numbers.",
        "This is our approach.",
        "In this paper, we first discuss in more detail the source data and the types of information extracted, followed by a discussion of some difficulties presented by the available data and our approaches for addressing those difficulties.",
        "Finally, we present a sample of the resulting visualisations."

        "The visualisations described here bring together three types of information: linguistic features, geographical distance, and phylogenetic distance.",

        "At the time of writing, WALS contains information for 2,678 languages.",
        "The linguistic features covered in WALS range from phonetic and phonological features, over some lexical and morphological features, to syntactic structures, word",
        "order tendencies, and other structural phenomena.",
        "A total of 192 features are represented, grouped in 144 different chapters, with each chapter addressing a set of related features.",
        "Ignoring the fact that a language having certain features will cancel out the possibility (or diminish the probability) of others, only 15.8% of WALS is described fully.",
        "In other words, if we consider WALS to be a 2,678x192 grid, fewer than 16% of the grid's squares contain feature values.",
        "The coverage of features/chapters varies dramatically across languages, with an average of 28 feature values per language.",
        "The most populated feature has data for 1,519 languages.",
        "Because of the extreme sparsity of the data, we restricted our treatment to only languages with values for 30% or more of the available features?372 languages, with a total of 36k feature values."

        "The WALS phylogenetic hierarchies do not take into account language contact.",

      "heading": "2.3 Geographic distance",
      "text": [
        "Geographic distance is an important aspect of typological study because neighbouring languages often come to share linguistic features, even in the absence of genetic relationship between the languages.",
        "Each language in WALS is associated with a geographical coordinate representing a central point for the main population of speakers of that language.",
        "We use these data to determine geographic distance between any two languages, using the haversine formula for orthodromic distance.2 A crucial aspect of our visualisations is that we produce them only for sets of languages within a reasonable geographic proximity 2This measure is inexact, especially over long distances, due to the imperfect topography and non-spherical shape of the earth, but it is computationally simple and is accurate enough for our present purposes.",
        "and with sufficient feature coverage in WALS.",
        "For this study, we used two approaches to clustering languages according to geographic distance.",
        "First, we chose an arbitrary radius in order to create a decision boundary for clustering neighbouring languages.",
        "For each language, that language's location is fixed as the centroid of the cluster and every language within the given radius is examined.",
        "We found that a radius of 500 kilometres provides a sufficient number of examples even after cleaning low-coverage languages from the WALS data.",
        "The second approach selected an arbitrary lower bound for the number of languages in the geographic area under consideration.",
        "If a sufficient percentage (enough to graph) of the total number of languages in the area remained after cleaning the WALS data, we took this as a useful area and did mapping for that area.",
        "This number is clearly under-representative of the amount of contact languages, as only half of the world's languages are present in WALS with any degree of coverage.",
        "This proxy was not as good as the radius method at choosing specific, useful examples for the n-nearest neighbours, as the languages chosen were often quite distant from one another."

        "To present the visualisation, we first centred the source language in the map.",
        "This decision was made in order to reduce the effect of one of the primary issues with using distance on a two dimensional graph; distance between two non-source languages is not shown, meaning that one could be to the north and another to the south.",

        "both feature coverage and selection of salient features for representation, reducing the number of graphs produced to 6 with geographic focus and 8 with phylogenetic focus.",
        "One topic for future work is to explore other ways of working with and expanding the available data in order to access even more useful visualisations.",
        "In addition, it would be very interesting to apply this visualisation method to data from other sources, for example, data from multiple related dialects.",
        "In such cases, coverage is likely to be better, and the languages in question will have been selected already for their relatedness, thus avoiding some of the data-filtering issues that arise.",
