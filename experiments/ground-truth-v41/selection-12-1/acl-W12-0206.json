        "The emerging picture then is that there is a link between these richer nominal structures that include more than one modifier and the omission of the article.",
        "Two questions arise: (i) why these richer nominals should associate with article omission and (ii) why only singular nouns are implicated in this feature.",
        "Article omission errors are typical of learners coming from L1s lacking an article system (Robertson, 2000; Ionin and Montrul, 2010; Hawkins and Buttery, 2010).",

        "The exception is Greek which has articles but uses bare nominals in predicative structures.",
        "However, a more systematic pattern is revealed when relations with MD errors are considered (using the Feature?Error relations and Errors by decreasing frequency components for different L1s).",
        "As shown in Table 3, there is a sharp contrast between L1s with articles (French, German, Spanish and Greek) and those without (Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Chinese), which further supports our hypothesis.",
        "A further question is why only the singular article is implicated in this feature.",

        "One of the main advantages of using visualisation techniques over command-line database search tools is that SLA researchers can start developing and testing hypotheses without the need to learn a query syntax first.",

        "There were dozens of meetings over a period of seven months, and the feedback on early interfaces was incorporated in the version described here.",
        "After the prototype reached a satisfactory level of stability, the final version overall felt enjoyable and inviting, as well as allowed her to form hypotheses and draw on different types of evidence in order to substantiate it (Alexopoulou et al., 2012).",
        "Future work will include the development, testing and evaluation of the UI with a wider range of users, as well as be directed towards investigation and evaluation of different visualisation techniques of machine learned or extracted features that support hypothesis formation about learner grammars."
