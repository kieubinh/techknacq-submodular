        "During the last two decades there has been an increasing interest in automatic approaches to historical linguistics, which is reflected in the large amount of literature on phylogenetic reconstruction (e.g. Ringe et al., 2002; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Brown et al., 2008), statistical aspects of genetic relationship (e.g. Baxter and Manaster Ramer, 2000; Kessler, 2001; Mortarino, 2009), and phonetic alignment (e.g. Kondrak, 2002; Proki?",
        "et al, 2009; List, forthcoming).",
        "While the supporters of these new automatic methods would certainly agree that their greatest advantage lies in the increase of repeatability and objectivity, it is interesting to note that the most crucial part of the analysis, namely the identification of cognates in lexicostatistical datasets, is still almost exclusively carried out manually.",
        "That this may be problematic was recently shown in a comparison of two large lexicostatistical datasets produced by different scholarly teams where differences in item translation and cognate judgments led to topological differences of 30% and more (Geisler and List, forthcoming).",
        "Unfortunately, automatic approaches to cognate detection still lack the precision of trained linguists?",
        "judgments.",
        "Furthermore, most of the methods that have been proposed so far only deal with bilingual as opposed to multilingual wordlists.",
        "The LexStat method, which will be presented in the following, is a convenient tool which not only closely renders the most important aspects of manual approaches but also yields transparent decisions that can be directly compared with the results achieved by the traditional methods."

        "In historical linguistics, cognacy is traditionally determined within the framework of the comparative method (Trask, 2000, 64-67).",
        "The final goal of this method is the reconstruction of proto-languages, yet the basis of the reconstruction itself rests on the identification of cognate words or morphemes within genetically related languages.",
        "Within the comparative method, cognates in a given set of language varieties are identified by applying a recursive procedure.",
        "First an initial list of putative cognate sets is created by comparing semantically and phonetically similar words from the languages to be investigated.",
        "In most of the literature dealing with the comparative method, the question of which words are most suitable for the initial compilation of cognate lists is not explicitly addressed, yet it seems obvious that the com-paranda should belong to the basic vocabulary of the languages.",
        "Based on this cognate list, an ini",
        "tial list of putative sound correspondences (correspondence list) is created.",
        "Sound correspondences are determined by aligning the cognate words and searching for sound pairs which repeatedly occur in similar positions of the presumed cognate words.",
        "After these initial steps have been made, the cognate list and the correspondence list are modified by 1. adding and deleting cognate sets from the cognate list depending on whether or not they are consistent with the correspondence list, and 2. adding and deleting sound correspondences from the correspondence list, depending on whether or not they find support in the cognate list.",
        "These steps are repeated until the results seem satisfying enough such that no further modifications, neither of the cognate list, nor of the correspondence list, seem to be necessary.",
        "The specific strength of the comparativemethod lies in the similarity measure which is applied for the identification of cognates: Sequence similarity is determined on the basis of systematic sound correspondences (Trask, 2000, 336) as opposed to similarity based on surface resemblances of phonetic segments.",
        "Thus, comparing English token [t?",
        "?k?n] and German Zeichen [?a??",
        "?n] ?sign?, the words do not really sound similar, yet their cognacy is assumed by the comparative method, since their phonetic segments can be shown to correspond regularly within other cognates of both languages.1 Lass (1997, 130) calls this notion of similarity genotypic as opposed to a pheno-typic notion of similarity, yet the most crucial aspect of correspondence-based similarity is that it is language-specific: Genotypic similarity is never defined in general terms but always with respect to the language systems which are being compared.",
        "Correspondence relations can therefore only be established for individual languages, they can never be taken as general statements.",
        "This may seem to be a weakness, yet it turns out that the genotypic similarity notion is one of the most crucial strengths of the comparative method: Not 1Compare, for example, English weak [wi?k] vs. German weich [va??]",
        "?soft?",
        "for the correspondence of [k] with [?",
        "], and English tongue [t??]",
        "vs. German Zunge [????]",
        "?tongue?",
        "for the correspondence of [t] with [?].",
        "only does it allow us to dive deeper in the history of languages in cases where phonetic change has corrupted the former identity of cognates to such an extent that no sufficient surface similarity is left, it also makes it easier to distinguish borrowed from commonly inherited items, since the former usually come along with a greater degree of phenotypic similarity."

        "In contrast to the language-specific notion of similarity that serves as the basis for cognate detection within the framework of the comparative method, most automatic methods seek to determine cognacy on the basis of surface similarity by calculating the phonetic distance or similarity between phonetic sequences (words, morphemes).",
        "The most popular distance measures are based on the paradigm of sequence alignment.",
        "In alignment analyses two ormore sequences are arranged in a matrix in such a way that all corresponding segments appear in the same column, while empty cells of the matrix, resulting from non-corresponding segments, are filled with gap symbols (Gusfield, 1997, 216).",
        "Table 1 gives an example for the alignment of German Tochter [t?xt?r] ?daughter?",
        "and English daughter [d?",
        "?t?r]: Here, all corresponding segments are inserted in the same columns, while the velar fricative [x] of the German sequence which does not have a corresponding segment in the English word is represented by a gap symbol.",

        "x t ?",
        "r English d ??",
        "- t ?",
        "r",
        "In order to retrieve a distance or a similarity score from such an alignment analysis, the matched residue pairs, i.e. the segments which appear in the same column of the alignment, are compared and given a specific score depending on their similarity.",
        "How the phonetic segments are scored depends on the respective scoring function which is the core of all alignment analyses.",
        "Thus, the scoring function underlying the edit distance only distinguishes identical from non-identical segments, while the scoring function used in the ALINE algorithm of Kondrak (2002) assigns individual similarity scores for the matching of phonetic segments based on phonetic features.",
        "Using alignment analyses, cognacy can be determined by converting the distance or similarity scores to normalized distance scores and assuming cognacy for distances beyond a certain threshold.",
        "The normalized edit distance (NED) of two sequencesA andB is usually calculated by dividing the edit distance by the length of the smallest sequence.",
        "The normalized distance score of algorithms which yield similarities (such as the ALINE algorithm) can be calculated by the formula of Downey et al. (2008):",
        "where SA and SB are the similarity scores of the sequences aligned with themselves, and SAB is the similarity score of the alignment of both sequences.",
        "For the alignment given in Table 1, the normalized edit distance is 0.6, and the ALINE distance is 0.25.",
        "A certain drawback of most of the common alignment methods is that their scoring function defines segment similarity on the basis of phenotypic criteria.",
        "The similarity of phonetic segments is determined on the basis of their phonetic features and not on the basis of the probability that their segments occur in a correspondence relation in genetically related languages.",
        "An alternative way to calculate phonetic similarity which comes closer to a genotypic notion of similarity is to compare phonetic sequences with respect to their sound classes.",
        "The concept of sound classes goes back to Dolgopolsky (1964).",
        "The original idea was ?to divide sounds into such groups, that changes within the boundary of the groups are more probable than transitions from one group into another?",
        "(Burlak and Starostin, 2005, 272)2.",
        "In his original study, Dolgopolsky proposed ten fundamental sound classes, based on an empirical analysis of sound-correspondence frequencies in a sample of 400 languages.",
        "Cognacy between two words is determined by comparing the first two consonants of both words.",
        "If the sound classes are identical, the words are judged to be cognate.",
        "Otherwise no cognacy is assumed.",
        "Thus, given the words German Tochter [t?xt?r] ?daughter?",
        "and English daughter [d?",
        "?t?r], the sound class representation of both sequences will be TKTR and",
        "TTR, respectively.",
        "Since the first two consonants of both words do not match regarding their sound classes, the words are judged to be non-cognate.",
        "In recent studies, sound classes have also been used as an internal representation format for pairwise and multiple alignment analyses.",
        "The method for sound-class alignment (SCA, cf.",
        "List, forthcoming) combines the idea of sound classes with traditional alignment algorithms.",
        "In contrast to the original proposal by Dolgopolsky, SCA employs an extended sound-class model which also represents tones and vowels along with a refined scoring scheme that defines specific transition probabilities between sound classes.",
        "The benefits of the SCA distance compared to NED can be demonstrated by comparing the distance scores the methods yield for the comparison of the same data.",
        "Figure 1 contrasts the scores of NED with SCA distance for the alignment of 658 cognate and 658 non-cognate word pairs between English and German (see Sup.",
        "Mat.",
        "A).",
        "As can be seen from the figure, the scores for NED do not show a very sharp distinction between cognate and non-cognate words.",

        "threshold of 0.8 that minimizes the number of false positive and false negative decisions there are still 13% of incorrect decisions.",
        "The SCA scores, on the other hand, show a sharper distinction between scores for cognates and non-cognates.",
        "With a threshold of 0.5 the percentage of incorrect decisions decreases to 8%.",

        "In order to compare the output of LexStat with other methods, three additional analyses of the datasets were carried out: The first two analyses were based on the calculation of SCA and NED distances of all language entries.",
        "Based on these scores all words were clustered into cognate sets using the flat cluster variant of UPGMA with a threshold of 0.4 for SCA distances and a threshold of 0.7 for NED, since these both turned out to yield the best results for these approaches.",
        "The third analysis was based on the above-mentioned approach by Turchin et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Since in this approach all decisions re",
        "garding cognacy are either positive or negative, no specific cluster algorithm had to be applied.",
        "The results of the tests are summarized in Table 8.",
        "As can be seen from the table, LexStat outperforms the other methods in almost all respects, the only exception being the proportion of identical negative decisions (PIND).",
        "Since non-identical negative decisions point to false positives, this shows that ?",
        "for the given settings of LexStat ?",
        "the method of Turchin et al. (2010) performs best at avoiding false positive cognate judgments, but it fails to detect many cognates correctly identified by LexStat.6 Figure 2 gives the separate PID scores for all datasets, showing that LexStat's good performance is prevalent throughout all datasets.",
        "The fact that all methods perform badly on the PIE dataset may point to problems resulting from the size of the wordlists: if the dataset is too small and the genetic distance of the languages too large, one may simply lack the evidence to prove cognacy without doubt.",
        "by lowering the threshold for sequence clustering.",
        "Using a threshold of 0.5 will yield a PIND score of 0.96, yet the PID score will lower down to 0.82.",
        "The LexStat method was designed to distinguish systematic from non-systematic similarities.",
        "The method should therefore produce less false positive cognate judgments resulting from chance resemblances and borrowings than the other methods.",
        "In the KSL dataset borrowings are marked along with their sources.",
        "Out of a total of 5600 word pairs, 72 exhibit a loan relation, and 83 are phonetically similar (with an NED score less then 0.6) but unrelated.",
        "Table 9 lists the number and the percentage of false positives resulting from undetected borrowings or chance resemblances for the different methods (see also Sup.",
        "Mat.",
        "D).",
        "While LexStat outperforms the other methods regarding the detection of chance resemblances, it is not particularly good at handling borrowings.",
        "LexStat cannot per se deal with borrowings, but only with language-specific as opposed to language-independent similarities.",
        "In order to handle borrowings, other methods (such as, e.g., the one by Nelson-Sathi et al., 2011) have to be applied."

        "In this paper, a new method for automatic cognate detection in multilingual wordlists has been presented.",
        "The method differs from other approaches in so far as it employs language-specific scoring schemes which are derived with the help of improved methods for automatic alignment analyses.",
        "The test of the method on a large dataset of wordlists taken from different language families shows that it is consistent regardless of the languages being analyzed and outperforms previous approaches.",
        "In contrast to the black box character of many automatic analyses which only yield total scores for the comparison of wordlists, the method yields transparent decisions which can be directly compared with the traditional results of the comparative method.",
        "Apart from the basic ideas of the procedure, which surely are in need of enhancement through reevaluation and modification, the most striking limit of the method lies in the data: If the wordlists are too short, certain cases of cognacy are simply impossible to be detected."
