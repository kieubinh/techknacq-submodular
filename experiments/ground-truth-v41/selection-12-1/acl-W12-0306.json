        "This paper focuses on computer writing tools used during the production of documents, be they letters, newsletters, policies, guidelines, releases or annual reports, in a professional setting, what we call professional writing (Beaudet, 1998).",
        "The importance of professional writing in private and public organisations is undeniable as written documents serve as communication between employees, support in decision making and organisational memory.",
        "Computer tools can be used in a variety of writing situations, such as learning how to write in schools (Kuhn et al., 2009), learning a second language (Milton and Cheng, 2010), and helping people with cognitive, visual or motor disabilities (Majaranta and Kari-Jouko, 2002).",
        "However, our knowledge and understanding of computer tools used by professional writers are somewhat limited.",
        "Which tools are used by professional writers?",
        "Are these tools meeting their needs?",
        "Do writers know what these tools can do?",
        "Kavanagh (1999) is one of the few authors who investigated such questions.",
        "In his detailed analysis of Microsoft Word, he demonstrated that the text processor mostly meets formatting and editing needs, and that it cannot, by far, support every step of the professional writing process.",
        "Kavanagh's research was quite a revelation at the time.",
        "However, many years have passed, and we have seen few studies on that subject since then.",
        "Writers have seen their profession evolve over the last 20 years.",
        "First, the massive use of personal computers has transformed writing practices as writers now have to cope with machines (computers, printers, scanners) and computer tools (text processors, search engines, electronic messaging systems, electronic dictionaries, spelling checkers, and collaborative platforms), whose number increases each year.",
        "Surely, this computer revolution has simplified professional writers?",
        "work as computer tools can help render more efficient document formatting, proofreading, collaborative writing, and content reusing, to name just a few examples.",
        "In that perspective, computer tools should help professional writers produce more documents.",
        "However, the number of documents that need to be produced in today's society, especially in the service sector (Nakbi, 2002), is such that productivity's expectations towards writers are",
        "great.",
        "And, as we will discuss in this paper, computer tools are not always well-adapted to professional writing.",
        "Also, the webification of human knowledge is creating new expectations in professional writers?",
        "skills.",
        "While only a few years ago, documents written according to printing standards were scanned and published on the web as images, an increasing number of documents are now produced according to hypertext standards.",
        "Therefore, professional writers have to master new specialised skills, for example in hypertext information organisation, document design, and computer science (Kavanagh, 2006).",
        "The goal of this paper is twofold.",
        "First, it reports on an exploratory study on computer tools used for the production of written documents in the workplace (see Section 2).",
        "This research consisted in asking questions to professional writers during a focus group.",
        "We will present a summary of those discussions and analyse professional writers?",
        "needs in terms of computer writing tools.",
        "Second, the paper describes and analyses LinguisTech, a reference web site for language professionals that was launched in Canada in September, 2011 (see Section 3).",
        "This preliminary evaluation will allow us to determine if this new platform actually meets professional writers?",

        "process in a professional setting (Clerc, 2000) Although this model is in general suited for the purpose of our research, we needed to make some adjustments.",
        "First, since none of the participants seem to be using computer tools during the assignment analysis (in fact, no one brought this step up during the discussion), we excluded this step from our analysis.",
        "Second, ?Information research?",
        "was renamed ?Information research and processing?, which better represents the fact that writers have to process (even summarily) the information during the research in order to evaluate information relevance.",
        "Third, we added the document transmission task but, instead of creating a new distinct step, we included it in the last one of the model.",

        "Information Research and Processing Morizio (2006) defines information research as an operation consisting of matching an information need and a document.",
        "In the context of our study, the professional writer formulates an information need after receiving an assignment from his superior or customer.",
        "As expected, most of the documents consulted by our professional writers are in electronic format: files either saved on a drive or available on a network (intranet or internet).",
        "Professional writers seem to take advantage of what the web has to offer, consulting newspapers, annual reports, web pages and social networks.",
        "Although the content of some of these web documents may be questioned (the content of a blog for example), they are still considered as ?interesting?",
        "sources, which indicates the professional writers?",
        "interest and adaptability towards new forms of electronic information.",
        "However, the participants criticised the immensity of the web, which keeps growing day after day.",
        "If we add the fact that many documents found on the web are duplicated, and that the same document can be found in different format (HTML, PDF), this can really slow down the information gathering because the writer has to verify if it is in fact the same document.",
        "They do not blame the web for offering too much information, but they wish that this information be better organised and easier to find.",
        "As we said earlier, professional writers summarily analyse documents during the information gathering, and they save relevant documents in personal folders.",
        "We identified two strategies used by writers to process the information at this stage of the writing project2.",
        "One of these strategies consists in searching for information within documents using the search engine available in conventional operating systems.",

        "?",
        "Having copied many versions of a same document in different folders, processing the results can be a lot of work because",
        "the operating system considers copies of the same document as distinct documents.",
        "?",
        "Still according to the participants of our study, search engines from conventional operating systems produce a lot of noise.",
        "Those remarks are not original, but they suggest that professional writers know which computer tools, or which aspects of a particular tool, can slow down their productivity.",
        "Conventional operating systems are ubiquitous in organisations and are relatively user-friendly, so we can easily understand why our participants use them to track documents, but it appears that they are not optimal for professional writers, for whom information research and processing can be impressive in terms of workload.",
        "Of course, all writers may not classify their documents in folders astutely, a step that would allow for more specific searches afterwards in individual folders.",
        "Second, some writers may not use the advanced functions of the search engine correctly.",
        "It would be interesting in further research to study writers?",

        "needs.",
        "Could more specialised tools improve their effectiveness, or at least their satisfaction?",
        "The participants described a second strategy for processing information, which consists in copying and pasting parts of a source document (web page, email, PDF document, etc.)",
        "in a text file.",
        "More specifically, they create a thematic file in which they paste relevant parts of web documents, making sure that they note the source.",
        "As we know from other computational linguistics related research such as automatic summarisation by sentence extraction, this operation causes considerable information loss, making it difficult to interpret the information correctly when writing.",
        "In fact, the participants admitted that they often have to go back to the original document in order to understand the parts they had copied.",
        "In other words, professional writers need a better strategy to process textual electronic information.",
        "The copy-and-paste method is also problematic for at least one other aspect: the manipulation of the target document.",
        "Professional writers of our study explained having problems organising the parts they copy in the target document, especially when those files contain a considerable amount of pages.",
        "Therefore, we understand why some writers chose to create a home-made database (using Excel or Access) in which they record the name of the documents they consulted and the topic(s) associated to those documents.",

        "In the second part of the paper, we briefly described LinguisTech, a new platform for language professionals launched last September in Canada.",

        "However, according to our preliminary evaluation, LinguisTech would be even more adapted to today's professional writing if it offered more effective information and document management systems, specialised writing tools, and training material on collaborative platforms."
