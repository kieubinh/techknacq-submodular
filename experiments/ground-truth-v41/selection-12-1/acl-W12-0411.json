        "The postulated existence of the human stylome has been thoroughly studied with encouraging results.",
        "The term stylome, which is currently not in any English dictionaries, was recently defined as a linguistic fingerprint which can be measured, is largely unconscious, and is constant (van Halteren et al., 2005).",
        "Closely related to the problem of authorship attribution lies the pastiche detection problem, where the fundamental question is: Can the human stylome be faked in order to trick authorship attribution methods?",
        "There are situations where certain authors or journalists have tried to pass their own work as written by someone else.",
        "A similar application is in forensics, where an impersonator is writing letters or messages and signing with someone else's name, especially online.",
        "It is important to note that sometimes pastiches are not intended to deceive, but simply as an exercise in mimicking another's style.",
        "Even in this case, the best confirmation that the author of the pastiche can get is if he manages to fool an authorship attribution algorithm, even if the ground truth is known and there is no real question about it.",
        "Marcus (1989) identifies the following four situation in which text authorship is disputed: ?",
        "A text attributed to one author seems non-homogeneous, lacking unity, which raises the suspicion that there may be more than one author.",
        "If the text was originally attributed to one author, one must establish which fragments, if any, do not belong to him, and who are their real authors.",
        "?",
        "A text is anonymous.",
        "If the author of a text is unknown, then based on the location, time frame and cultural context, we can conjecture who the author may be and test this hypothesis.",
        "?",
        "If based on certain circumstances, arising from literature history, the paternity is disputed between two possibilities, A and B, we have to decide if A is preferred to B, or the other way around.",
        "?",
        "Based on literary history information, a text seems to be the result of the collaboration of two authors, an ulterior analysis should establish, for each of the two authors, their corresponding text fragments.",
        "We situate ourselves in a case similar to the third, but instead of having to choose between two authors, we are asking whether a group of texts were indeed written by the claimed author or by someone else.",
        "Ideally, we would take samples authored by every possible impersonator and run a",
        "multi-class classifier in order to estimate the probability that the disputed work is written by them or by the asserted author.",
        "Such a method can give results if we know who the impersonator can be, but most of the time that information is not available, or the number of possible impersonators is intractabally large.",
        "In the case of only one impersonator, the problem can simply be stated as authorship attribution with a positive or a negative answer.",
        "However, when there are a number of people separately writing pastiches of one victim's style, the extra information can prove beneficial in an unsupervised learning sense.",
        "In this paper we analyze the structure induced by the Rank Distance metric using frequencies of stopwords as features, previously applied for authorship attribution, on such a sample space.",
        "The assumption is that trying to fake someone else's stylome will induce some consistent bias so that new impersonators can be caught using features from other pastiche authors.",
        "2 The successors of Mateiu Caragiale Mateiu Caragiale, one of the most important Romanian novelists, died in 1936, at the age of 51, leaving behind an unfinished novel, Sub pecetea tainei.",
        "Some decades later, in the 70?s, a rumor agitated the Romanian literary world: it seemed that the ending of the novel had been found.",
        "A few human experts agreed that the manuscript is in concordance with Mateiu's style, and in the next months almost everybody talked about the huge finding.",
        "However, it was suspicious that the writer who claimed the discovery, Radu Al-bala, was considered by the critics to be one of the closest stylistic followers of Mateiu Caragiale.",
        "When the discussions regarding the mysterious finding reached a critical mass, Albala publically put a stop to them, by admitting that he himself had written the ending as a challenge - he wanted to see how well he could deceive the public into thinking the text in question was written by Mateiu himself.",
        "Other authors attempted to write different endings to the novel, but without claiming Caragiale's paternity, like Albala did.",
        "Around the same time, Eugen Ba?lan also set to continue the unfinished novel, as a stylistic exercise.",
        "He addressed a separate storyline than Albala?s.",
        "Later, Alexandru George also attempted to finish the novel, claiming that his ending is the best.",
        "Unfortunately there is only one copy of George's work, and we couldn't obtain it for this study.",
        "In 2008, Ion Iovan published the so-called Last Notes of Mateiu Caragiale, composed of sections written from Iovan's voice, and another section in the style of a personal diary describing the life of Mateiu Caragiale, suggesting that this is really Caragiale's diary.",
        "This was further strengthened by the fact that a lot of phrases from the diary were copied word for word from Mateiu Cara-giale's novels, therefore pushing the style towards Caragiale?s.",
        "However, this was completely a work of fiction, the diary having been admittedly imagined and written by Iovan.",
        "Another noteworthy case is the author S?tefan Agopian.",
        "He never attempted to continue Mateiu Caragiale's novel, but critics consider him one of his closest stylistic successors.",
        "Even though not really a pastiche, we considered worth investigating how such a successor relates to the impersonators."

        "The Mendenhall plot, showing frequency versus word length, does not give an objective criterion to attribute authorship, but as an easy to calculate statistic, it can motivate further research on a specific attribution problem.",
        "A further critique to Mendenhall's method is that different distributions of word length are not necessary caused by individual stylome but rather by the genre or the theme of the work.",

        "The fact that a specific function word has the rank 2 (is the second most frequent word) in one text and has the rank 4 (is the fourth most frequent word) in another text can be more directly relevant than the fact that the respective word appears 349 times in the first text and only 299 times in the second.",

        "However, in real situations, the problem of tying arises, when two or more objects claim the same rank (are ranked equally).",
        "For example, two or more function words can have the same frequency in a text and any ordering of them would be arbitrary.",
        "The Rank distance allocates to tied objects a number which is the average of the ranks the tied objects share.",
