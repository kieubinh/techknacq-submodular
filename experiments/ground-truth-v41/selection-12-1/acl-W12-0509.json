        "This article describes the collaborative work on applying the newly proposed ISO standard for dialogue act annotation to the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) Corpus, as part of our ongoing effort to promote interoperability of standardized linguistic annotations with the ultimate goal of developing shared and open language resources.",
        "Dialogue acts (DA) play a key role in the interpretation of the communicative behaviour of dialogue participants and offer valuable insight into the design of human-machine dialogue systems (Bunt et al., 2010).",
        "More recently, the emerging ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) standard for dialogue act annotation defines dialogue acts as the ?communicative activity of a participant in dialogue interpreted as having a certain communicative function and semantic content, and possibly also having certain functional dependence relations, rhetorical relations and feedback dependence relations?",
        "(p. 3).",
        "The semantic content specifies the objects, relations, events, etc.",
        "that the dialogue act is about; the communicative function can be viewed as a specification of the way an addressee uses the semantic content to update his or her information state when he or she understands the corresponding stretch of dialogue.",
        "Continuing efforts have been made to identify and classify the dialogue acts expressed in dialogue utterances taking into account the empirically proven multifunctionality of utterances, i.e., the fact that utterances often express more than one dialogue act (see Bunt, 2009 and 2011).",
        "In other words, an utterance in dialogue typically serves several functions.",
        "See Example",
        "(1) taken from the SWBD-DA Corpus (sw_0097_3798.utt).",
        "(1) A: Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh,",
        "funding for AIDS research?",
        "Do you?",
        "B: Well, uh, uh, that's something I?ve thought a lot about.",
        "With the first utterance, Speaker A performs two dialogue acts: he (a) assigns the next turn to the participant Michael, and (b) formulates an open question.",
        "Speaker B, in his response, (a) accepts the turn, (b) stalls for time, and (c) answers the question by making a statement.",
        "Our concern in this paper is to explore the applicability of the new ISO Standard to the existing Switchboard corpus with joint efforts of automatic and manual mapping.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we shall first describe the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) Corpus and its annotation scheme (i.e. SWBD-DAMSL).",
        "We shall then describe the new ISO Standard and explain our mapping of SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO DIS 24617-2 DA tag set.",
        "In addition, machine learning techniques are employed for automatic DA classification on the basis of lexical features to evaluate the application of the new ISO DA scheme using authentic transcribed speech.",
        "We shall then introduce the user interface designed for manual mapping and explain the annotation guidelines.",
        "Finally, the paper will conclude with discussions and suggestions for future work.",
        "contains 1,155 5-minute conversations2, orthographically transcribed in about 1.5 million word tokens.",
        "It should be noted that the minimal unit of utterances for DA annotation in the SWBD Corpus is the so called ?slash unit?",
        "(Meteer and Taylor, 1995), defined as ?maximally a sentence but can be smaller unit?",
        "(p. 16), and ?slash-units below the sentence level correspond to those parts of the narrative which are not sentential but which the annotator interprets as complete?",
        "(p. 16).",
        "See Table 1 for the basic statistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus.",
        "Altogether, the corpus comprises 223,606 slash-units and each is annotated for its communicative function according to a set of dialogue acts specified in the SWBD-DAMSL scheme (Jurafsky et al., 1997) and assigned a DA tag.",
        "See Example (2) taken from sw_0002_4330.utt, where qy is the DA tag for yes/no questions.",
        "(2) qy A.1 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } does the company you work for test for drugs?",
        "/ A total of 303 different DA tags are identified throughout the corpus, which is different from the total number of 220 tags mentioned in Jurafsky et al. (1997: 3).",
        "To ensure enough instances for the different DA tags, we also conflated the DA tags together with their secondary carat-dimensions, and yet we did not use the seven special groupings by Jurafsky et al. (1997) as we kept them as separate DA types (see Section 4 for further explanations).",
        "In the end, the 303 tags were clustered into 60 different individual communicative functions.",
        "See Table 2 for the basic statistics of the 60 DA clusters.",
        "According to Table 2, we observe that the 60 DA clusters range from 780,570 word tokens for the top-ranking statement-non-opinion to only 4 word 2 Past studies (e.g. Stolcke et al., 2000; Jurafsky et al., 1997; Jurafsky et al., 1998a; Jurafsky et al., 1998b) have been focused on only 1115 conversations in the SWBD-DA Corpus as the training set.",
        "As there is no clear description which 40 conversations have been used as the testing set or for future use, we use all the 1155 conversations.",
        "tokens for you?re-welcome.",
        "In Table 2, the Token % column lists the relative importance of DA types measured as the proportion of the word tokens in the SWBD-DA corpus as whole.",
        "It can be observed that, as yet another example to illustrate the uneven use of DA types, statement-opinion accounts for 21.04% of the total number of word tokens in the corpus.",
        "see that the top 10 DA types alone account for 93.38% of the whole corpus, suggesting again the uneven occurrence of DA types in the corpus and hence the disproportional use of communication functions in conversational discourse.",
        "It is particularly worth mentioning that segment-(multi-utterance) is not really a DA type indicating communicative function and yet it is the third most frequent DA tag in SWBD-DAMSL.",
        "As a matter of fact, the SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme contains quite a number of such non-communicative DA tags, such as abandoned, and quoted-material."

        "It will be particularly interesting to find out whether the emerging ISO DA annotation standard will produce better automatic prediction accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate the performance of automatic DA classification in the two DA annotation schemes by employing the unigrams as the feature set.",
        "Two classification tasks were then identified according to the two DA annotation schemes.",
        "Task 1 is to automatically classify the DA types in the SWBD-DAMSL.",
        "Based on the observations mentioned above, it was decided to use the top 15 DA types to investigate the distribution of word types in order to ascertain the lexical characteristics of DAs.",
        "Furthermore, since segment-(multi-utterance), abandoned, and quoted-material do not relate to dialogue acts per se, these three were replaced with rhetorical-questions, open-question and affirmative-non-yes-answers.",
        "We thus derive Table 6 below, showing that the revised list of top 15 DA types account for 85.13% of the SWBD corpus.",
        "The DA types are arranged according to Token% in descending order.",
        "Next, accordingly, task 2 is to classify the top 15 ISO DAs based on the results from the automatic mapping.",
        "It should be pointed out that only one layer of annotation in the ISO DA tags is considered in order to make the result comparable to that from SWBD-DAMSL, and the dimension of task is the priority when it comes to multilayer annotations.",
        "The Na?ve Bayes Multinomial classifier was employed, which is available from Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, known as Weka (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "10-fold cross validation was performed and the",
        "results evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-score (F1).",
        "Table 8 presents the results for classification task 1.",
        "As can be noted, the weighted average F-score is 69.2%.",
        "To be more specific, acknowledge-(backchannel) achieves the best F-score of 0.888, followed by statement-non-opinion with an F-score of 0.792.",
        "Surprisingly, the action-directive has the highest precision of 100%, but has the second lowest recall of over 0.7%.",
        "It can also be noted that the last four types of DAs cannot be classified with the F-score of 0%.",
        "The DAs are arranged according to F-score in descending order.",
        "As can be noted, the weighted average F-score is 83.1%, over 10% higher than task 1.",
        "To be more specific, Inform achieves the best F-score of 0.93, followed by Answer with an F-score of 0.775.",
        "The DA InitialGoodbye has the highest precision, of about 97%, whereas Inform has the highest recall of over 98%.",
        "Similar to the results obtained in Task 1, the last four types of DAs in Task 2 also cannot be classified with the F-score of 0%.",
        "Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, when the data size for each DA type is taken into consideration, Task 2 may be more challenging than Task 1 in that 6 out of the 15 SWBD-ISO DA types has a total number of word tokens fewer than 4,000 whereas all the 15 SWBD-DAMSL DA types has a total number of over 4,000.",
        "Therefore, the much higher average F-score suggests that the application of ISO standard DA scheme could lead to better classification performance, suggesting that the ISO DA standard represents a better option for automatic DA classification.",
        "To sum up, with a comparable version of the SWBD-DA Corpus, results from the automatic DA classification tasks show that the ISO DA annotation scheme produces better automatic prediction accuracy, which encourages the completion of the manual mapping."
