        "The explosion of social media in recent years has led to the need for NLP tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers that are robust enough to handle data that is becoming increasingly ?noisy.?",
        "Unfortunately, many NLP systems fail at out-of-domain data and struggle with the informal style of social text.",
        "With spelling errors, abbreviations, uncommon acronyms, and excessive use of slang, systems that are designed for traditional corpora such as news articles may perform poorly when given difficult input such as a Twitter feed (Ritter et al., 2010).",
        "Recognizing the limitations of existing systems, Gimpel et al. (2011) develop a POS tagger specifically for Twitter, by creating a training corpus as well as devising a tag set that includes parts of speech that are uniquely found in online language, such as emoticons (smilies).",
        "This is an important step forward, but a POS tagger tailored to Twitter cannot tackle the social Web as a whole.",
        "Other online communities have their own styles, slang, memes, and other idiosyncrasies, so a system trained for one community may not apply to others.",
        "For example, the 140-character limit of Twitter encourages abbreviations and word-dropping that may not be found in less restrictive venues.",
        "The first-person subject is often assumed in ?status messages?",
        "that one finds in Twitter and Face-book, so the pronominal subject can be dropped, even in English (Weir, 2012), leading to messages like ?Went out?",
        "instead of ?I went out.?",
        "Not only does Twitter follow these unusual grammatical patterns, but many messages contain ?hash-tags?",
        "which could be considered their own syntactic class not found in other data sources.",
        "For these reasons, POS parameters learned from Twitter data will not necessarily fit other social data.",
        "In general, concerns about the limitations of domain-dependent models have motivated the use of sophisticated unsupervised methods.",
        "Interest in unsupervised POS induction has been revived in recent years after Bayesian HMMs are shown to increase accuracy by up to 14 percentage points over basic maximum-likelihood estimation (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "Despite falling well short of the accuracy obtained with supervised taggers, unsupervised approaches are preferred in situations where there is no access to",
        "large quantities of training data in a specific domain, which is increasingly common with Web data.",
        "We therefore hope to continue improving accuracy with unsupervised approaches by introducing semantics as an additional source of information for this task.",
        "The ambiguities of language are amplified through social media, where new words or spellings of words are routinely invented.",
        "For example, ?ow?",
        "on Twitter can be a shorthand for ?how,?",
        "in addition to its more traditional use as an expression of pain (ouch).",
        "While POS assignment is inherently a problem of syntactic disambiguation, we hypothesize that the underlying semantic content can aid the disambiguation task.",
        "If we know that the overall content of a message is about police, then the word ?cop?",
        "is likely to be a noun, whereas if the context is about shopping, this could be slang for acquiring or stealing (verb).",
        "The HMM approach will often be able to tag these occurrences appropriately given the context, but in many cases the syntactic context may be limited or misleading due to the noisy nature of the data.",
        "Thus, we believe that semantic context will offer additional evidence toward making an accurate prediction.",
        "Following this intuition, this paper presents a semantically and syntactically coherent Bayesian model that uncovers POS-specific subtopics within general semantic topics, as in latent Dirich-let alocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), which we call part-of-speech LDA, or POSLDA.",
        "The resulting posterior distributions will reflect specialized topics such as ?verbs about dining?",
        "or ?nouns about politics?.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we also present the first experiments with unsupervised tagging for a social media corpus.",
        "In this work, we focus on Twitter because the labeled corpus by Gimpel et al. (2011) allows us to quantitatively evaluate our approach.",
        "We demonstrate the model's utility as a predictive language model by its low perplexity on held-out test data as compared to several related topic models, and most importantly, we show that this model achieves statistically significant and consistent improvements in unsupervised POS tagging accuracy over a Bayesian HMM.",
        "These results support our hypothesis that semantic information can directly improve the quality of POS induction, and our experiments present an in-depth exploration of this task on informal social text.",
        "The next section discusses related work, which is followed by a description of our model, POSLDA.",
        "We then present POS tagging results on the Twitter POS dataset (Gimpel et al., 2011).",
        "Section 5 describes further experiments on the POSLDA model and section 6 includes a discussion on the results and why POSLDA can do better on POS tagging than a vanilla Bayesian HMM.",
        "Finally, section 7 concludes with a discussion on future work."

        "A final point worth mentioning is that, unlike LDA, we do not perform stopword removal.",
        "Instead, the POSLDA model has pushed stopwords to their own function classes (rather than content) freeing us from having to perform pre-or post-processing steps to ensure interpretable topics.",
        "The top words in four of these topic-independent function classes, learned from the Twitter POS dataset, are shown in Table 4.3 These function word distributions are even more cohesive than the content word distributions, showing that the standard stopwords have been accounted for as we expect in their respective function classes.",

        "learning this sort of information improves our ability to perform unsupervised POS tagging.",

        "This phenomenon likely plays an important role in the accuracy improvements that we observe.",

        "a topic model consistent across the axes of both semantic and syntactic meanings.",
        "Using this model to perform unsupervised POS tagging results in consistent and statistically significant increases in POS tagging accuracy and decreases in variation of information when performing POS clustering.",
        "These improvements are demonstrated on a novel release of data from the microblogging social network site Twitter.",
        "This type of dataset is of particular interest because unsupervised POS tagging will likely be most important in specialized idiosyncratic domains with atypical features and small amounts of labelled training data.",
        "Crucially, we showed that even with the inconsistent and at times strange use of grammar, slang, and acronyms, the syntactic portion of the model demonstrably improves not only the predictive ability of the model in terms of perplexity, but also the accuracy in unsupervised POS tagging.",
        "This is important because in general tweets are far from being representative of ?proper?",
        "grammar.",
        "Nevertheless, there clearly exists some adherence to syntactic structure as the use of the HMM within our model improves word prediction and POS tagging.",
        "This work represents the first ?",
        "to our knowledge ?",
        "application of latent thematic information to the unsupervised POS tagging task.4 However, due to the encouraging results, there are a number of future research directions that present themselves from this work.",
        "One immediate task is to extend POSLDA to a nonparametric Bayesian model.",
        "Section 4.2 shows how varying the number of topics K in the model can affect the tagging accuracy by up to a full percentage point.",
        "A nonparametric version of the model would free us from having to perform the initial model selection step to get the best accuracy.",
        "Another avenue for future work is to infuse more structure into the model such as word morphology.",
        "4There has been some work done to include semantic information collected separately in a supervised POS tagging approach (Toutanova and Johnson, 2008)."
