        "Twitter is one of the most popular micro-blogging web services.",
        "It was founded in 2006, and allows users to post short messages up to 140 characters of text, called ?tweets?.",
        "Following the definition in Boyd and Ellison (2007), Twitter is a social network site, but is shares some features with blogs.",
        "Zhao and Rosson (2009) highlights the fact that people use twitter for a variety of social purposes like keeping in touch with friends and colleagues, raising the visibility of their interests, gathering useful information, seeking for help and relaxing.",
        "They also report that the way people use Twitter can be grouped in three broad classes: people updating personal life activities, people doing real-time information and people following other people's RSS feeds, which is a way to keep informed about personal intersts.",
        "According to Boyd et al. (2010), there are many features that affect practices and conversations in Twitter.",
        "First of all, connections in Twitter are directed rather than mutual: users follow other users?",
        "feeds and are followed by other users.",
        "Public messages can be addressed to specific users with the symbol @.",
        "According to Honeycutt and Herring (2009) this is used to reply to, to cite or to include someone in a conversation.",
        "Messages can be marked and categorized using the ?hashtag?",
        "symbol #, that works as an aggregator of posts having something in common.",
        "Another important feature is that posts can be shared and propagated using the ?retweet?",
        "option.",
        "Boyd et al. (2010) emphasize the fact that retweeting a post is a means of participating in a diffuse conversation.",
        "Moreover, posts can be marked as favorites and users can be included into lists.",
        "Those practices enhance the visibility of the posts or the users.",
        "In recent years the interest towards Twitter raised in the scientific community, especially in Information Retrieval.",
        "For example Pak and Paroubek (2010) developed a sentiment analysis classifier from Twitter data, Finin et al. (2010) performed Named Entity Recognition on Twitter using crowd-sourcing services such as Mechanical Turk1 and CrowdFlower2, and Zhao et al. (2011) proposed a ranking algorithm for extracting topic keyphrases from tweets.",
        "Of course also in the personality recog",
        "nition field there is a great interest towards the analysis of Twitter.",
        "For example Quercia et al. (2011) analyzed the correlations between personality traits and the behaviour of four types of users: listeners, popular, hi-read and influential.",
        "In this paper, we describe a personality recognition tool we developed in order to annotate data from Twitter and we analyze how emotional stability affects interactions in Twitter.",
        "In the next section, given an overview of personality recognition and emotional stability, we will describe our personality recognition system in detail and we present the dataset we collected from Twitter.",
        "In the last two sections we report and discuss the results of the experiment and we provide some provisional conclusions."

        "Among all the 5 traits, emotional stability plays a crucial role in social networks.",
        "Studying offline social networks, Kanfer and Tanaka (1993) report that secure (high emotional stability) subjects had more people interacting with them.",
