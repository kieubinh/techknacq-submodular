        "The problem of unsupervised part-of-speech induction has received considerable attention in computational linguistics (for a recent comparison of several influential models, see Christodoulopoulos, Goldwater & Steedman, 2010).",
        "A common approach is to estimate the parameters of a generative model given the natural language data, with the model usually a variant of a Hidden Markov Model (e.g. Goldwater & Griffiths, 2007; Berg-Kirkpatrick, C?t?, De Nero & Klein, 2010; Moon, Erk & Baldridge, 2010).",
        "These models are often evaluated on corpora of formal, written English, such as the Penn Treebank, rather than on natural, spoken language, and typically the aim of these studies is to improve the state-of-the-art of POS induction using various techniques from machine learning, with an implicit focus on devising techniques that can be used in practical applications.",
        "In the current paper, on the other hand, our focus is on part-of-speech induction mechanisms that children might use when learning their first language.",
        "Hence, we are interested in models that are motivated by psychological considerations, rather than by a more abstract mathematical or statistical grounding.",
        "In language acquisition research, a typical approach to part-of-speech induction is to make use of clustering.",
        "We will review this work and argue for the particular utility of two-mode clustering or co-clustering approaches, before presenting two novel co-clustering techniques and evaluating their performance in part-of-speech tagging on a corpus of child-directed English."

        "to part-of-speech induction in language acquisition research Single-mode clustering approaches Clustering algorithms operate on a two-dimensional matrix where the rows and columns in this context represent words and the linguistic contexts in which they appear, taken from a corpus of natural language, and the cells of the matrix contain frequency counts of how often a word occurs in a particular context.",
        "It has often been proposed that children might make use of information about the contextual distribution of usage of words to induce the parts-of-speech of their native language (e.g. Maratsos & Chalkley, 1980), and work by, e.g., Redington, Chater & Finch (1998) and Clark (2000), showed that parts-of-speech can indeed be induced by",
        "clustering together words that are used in similar contexts in a corpus.",
        "Clustering word types together does not take into account the fact that the part-of-speech of a word type may change depending on the context in which it is used.",
        "One of the most influential models in part-of-speech induction in language acquisition, the Frequent Frames model of Mintz (2003), addresses this issue by forming clusters of the contextual frames in which words are used, rather than the words themselves.",
        "The idea is that the contexts define the part-of-speech, rather than the words themselves.",
        "This model attains high, but not perfect results in part-of-speech tagging for English child-directed speech; part of the reason is that even frames are sometimes ambiguous in the parts-of-speech that they can accommodate, and Erkelens (2008) has shown that this problem is more pronounced when the Frequent Frames approach is applied to Dutch material.",
        "In general, however the set of frame contexts is chosen, the problem of contextual ambiguity is likely to present itself.",
        "Hence, an approach is needed in which both words and contexts can be associated with multiple categories.",
        "Techniques of co-clustering, also called biclustering or two-mode clustering, (see Madeira & Oliveira, 2004, Van Mechelen et al., 2004, for reviews), represent one such approach.",
        "Co-clustering approaches Single-mode clustering forms clusters of elements in one dimension of the matrix (either rows or columns) by grouping together elements on the basis of similar co-occurrence with elements of the other dimension.",
        "Co-clustering techniques, on the other hand, form clusters on the basis of similarity between rows and similarity between columns simultaneously.",
        "Co-clustering is therefore able to assign row and column elements to the same clusters.",
        "We can distinguish between row-column clustering methods which assign each row and each column to a particular cluster, and data clustering methods which assign each individual non-empty cell of the matrix to a cluster.",
        "Some co-clustering methods allow for overlapping clusters, i.e. in row-column methods by allowing rows and columns to belong to more than one cluster, or in data clustering methods by allowing cells in the matrix to belong to more than one cluster.",
        "Co-clustering algorithms have been shown to be useful in many applications, notably in the analysis of gene expression data (Madeira & Oliveira, 2004).",
        "There are good reasons to prefer a co-clustering approach over a single-mode categorization approach in part-of-speech induction.",
        "In natural language, including child-directed speech, there are many cases where a word appears in a context that does not specify the part-of-speech exactly, but allows several possibilities, while at the same time, the word is also ambiguous in its part-of-speech.",
        "Co-clustering is able to deal with part-of-speech ambiguity at the level of word and frame simultaneously.",
        "For example, a common frame in child-directed speech in English is ?That's X.?, where the word that fills the X slot could be a noun (?That's ice-cream.?)",
        "or an adjective (?That's pretty.?).",
        "Simultaneously, the word ?mean?",
        "can be used as either a verb or an adjective (the nominal usage is rare in child-directed speech).",
        "A single-mode clustering algorithm that aims to assign a part-of-speech to the word ?mean?",
        "in ?That's mean?",
        "will be unable to decide between the allowed parts-of-speech for the frame, if frames were clustered, and between the allowed parts-of-speech for the words, if words were clustered.",
        "However, a co-clustering approach that assigned ?That's X?",
        "to both the categories noun and adjective, and ?mean?",
        "to the categories verb and adjective, would be able to deduce that the only category that the word and the frame have in common is adjective, and therefore that this is the correct category.",
        "In this way, co-clustering is better able to deal with linguistic ambiguity.",
        "Even apart from its practical utility in part-of-speech induction, co-clustering is broadly compatible with a psychological outlook that conceives of part-of-speech development in terms of associative learning (see e.g. Shanks, 1995).",
        "Under this view, parts-of-speech are mental categories that are formed by repeated exposure to words used in context, in combination with whatever semantic construal the language-learning child places on the utterances she hears.",
        "Only a few studies have applied co-clustering to part-of-speech induction with child-directed language (but see Freitag, 2004, for part-of-speech induction with co-clustering on adult-directed language in the Penn Treebank).",
        "The pioneering work in this regard was the EMILE system of Adriaans and colleagues (Adriaans, 1992), which formed co-clusters of word-context combinations as a step in the process of inducing",
        "rules for a categorial grammar.",
        "While the grammars formed in this way perform well, EMILE typically produces large, overlapping categories which do not correspond to the parts-of-speech of English (Adriaans, 1999).",
        "Hence, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of EMILE's part-of-speech tagging against a gold standard.",
        "Leibbrandt & Powers (2008) applied co-clustering to a corpus of English child-directed speech, yielding accuracy comparable to that obtained by the Frequent Frames model of Mintz (2003).",
        "This approach was also able to outperform Frequent Frames in tagging child-directed data in Dutch (Leibbrandt & Powers, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we extend the work of Leibbrandt & Powers (2008, 2010) by describing and evaluating a novel co-clustering technique for part-of-speech induction.",
        "In Section 2 we present the Conflict-Driven Co-Clustering algorithm, and in Section 3 we evaluate its performance in part-of-speech tagging of a corpus of child-directed speech.",
        "We show that the algorithm delivers performance comparable to that of both the Frequent Frames model of Mintz (2003) and the co-clustering work by Leibbrandt & Powers (2008, 2010), and is more robust than the earlier work in automatically discovering the main English open classes of noun, verb and adjective, discarding smaller and less-easily interpretable categories.",
        "In Section 4 we consider reasons for these results and point to future directions for this work."

        "From this starting point, the CDCC algorithm iteratively adds frames and clusters to the clusters, until all of the co-occurrence data is accounted for.",
        "We make the assumption that there exist a number of parts-of-speech in the target language, and that a particular word used in a particular frame context belongs to only one part-of-speech1.",
        "We also assume that the word type is a cue to the part-of-speech, and that the same is true of the frame type.",
        "Finally, each word type and frame type is presumed to have the potential to be associated with more than one part-of-speech.",
        "Suppose, then, that we (in this case, the co-clustering algorithm, but also, potentially, a child learning the target language) already have some notion of the parts-of-speech to which a particular frame type f ?belongs?, and the parts-of-speech to which a word type w belongs.",
        "Then when we encounter an instance (i.e. a token) of the word type w used in the context of the frame type f, and wish to assign a part-of-speech to this instance, the only viable candidates (based on our knowledge at the time) are those parts-of-speech that both w and f have in common.",

        "While this would remove all conflicts, it is clearly not a useful basis for part-of-speech tagging, and violates our sense that not every word or context can belong to every part-of-speech.",
        "A better approach might be to start with a very sparse pair of initial matrices for W and F, which greatly under-determine the co-occurrence matrix D, and then add cluster memberships to individual frames and words (changing 0s to 1s in F and W) if adding them would help to solve conflicts.",
        "We still need to decide which cluster memberships to add, and a useful principle might be to add memberships parsimoniously, i.e. to try to minimize the number of new memberships added to F and W. The CDCC algorithm takes a greedy approach to this problem.",
        "On each iteration, it simply adds the single cluster membership (word or frame) that would resolve the largest number of conflicts existing at that time.",
        "The set of remaining conflicts is then recalculated, and the cluster membership that again resolves the greatest number of conflicts is added, with the process being repeated until all conflicts have been resolved.",
        "The only remaining point to specify is how the algorithm gets started, i.e. how the W and F matrices are initialized.",
        "It would be desirable to begin with just a small number of ?ground truths?, i.e. a small number of category memberships, for only a few frames and words, that are well-established in advance.",
        "The rest of the values in the membership matrices are then bootstrapped from this starting point by referring to the co-occurrence matrix.",
        "The initial values with which W and F are ?seeded?",
        "can come from any source: for instance, they may be the result of a process of semantic category formation (e.g. Macnamara, 1982; Pinker, 1984), so that words that refer to physical objects are flagged as belonging to one category, and words for actions marked as belonging to another category (bear in mind that this does not preclude these words from later also being assigned to other categories).",
        "This process might also be extended to frames that reliably contain words referring to objects, actions, physical properties, etc.",
        "In computational work on language acquisition, proxies for these categories might be obtained from lists of early-acquired words, possibly in combination with norms on word imageability.",
        "In less acquisition-oriented work, seeds may be obtained from manually annotated examples, so that this becomes a semi-supervised approach to part-of-speech tagging.",
        "In the experiment reported here, we decided to obtain our seed information entirely from the same word-frame co-occurrence matrix D used later to expand the W and F matrices, and we did so along the same lines as followed by Leibbrandt & Powers (2008, 2010).",
        "Consequently, our results are prone to some of the shortcomings of the earlier work, as",
        "discussed later.",

        "Because of several well-known shortcomings of precision and recall (e.g.",
        "Powers, 2003; Rosenberg & Hirschberg, 2007), we also report the Informedness measure (Powers, 2003), which corresponds to the probability that the predictions made by the algorithm are informed, in the sense of making correct use of information.",

        "For a supervised classification problem, with a table of arbitrary dimensions m?m, Informedness is calculated for the 2?2 contingency table of each category in turn, and the Informedness values for all categories are combined in a weighted sum, where the weight for each category is the proportion of word tokens assigned to that category by the algorithm (i.e. the algorithm's bias to assign instances to the category).",

        "We have not yet said much about the number of clusters formed by the co-clustering algorithms.",
        "This number could conceivably be influenced by the number of clusters formed by the initial one-way clustering algorithm, which is often (as it was in our experiment) a parameter under control of the experimenter.",
        "However, the number of parts-of-speech produced by a part-of-speech induction algorithm should be relatively immune to manipulations of algorithmic parameters.",
        "A related issue is that the parts-of-speech produced by clustering approaches are often unsatisfactory from a linguistic point of view, as they don't correspond exactly to the expected parts-of-speech of the target language (see also Schütze, 1995).",
        "We regard it as desirable for a part-of-speech induction method to account for at least the main open-class parts-of-speech of English (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), and to be able to produce these without undue coercion.",
        "Therefore, it is of interest to consider how the number of parts-of-speech produced by the co-clustering algorithms is affected by the number of clusters in the original one-way clustering from which they start.",
        "These results are shown in",
        "speech produced by LP08 versus CDCC when started off with varying numbers of hard clusters",
        "in the range 3 to 18.",
        "For each algorithm, the table shows (under Any) the number of distinct parts-of-speech (clusters) to which at least one word-frame occurrence was assigned during the categorization reported above, and also (under 1%) the number of parts-of-speech such that at least one percent of the total number of word-frame combinations were assigned to that part-of-speech.",
        "The results under Any show that, as",
        "categorization for three co-clustering algorithms, for varying K = number of clusters produced in initial one-way clustering.",
        "Any = number of parts-of-speech that account for at least one frame-word instance; 1% = number of parts-of-speech that account for at least 1% of instances.",
        "the number of initial clusters grew, so too did the number of clusters that were used at least once during categorization, so that the algorithms were rather badly prone to proliferation of parts-of-speech when started with a large number of initial clusters, although CDCC was more conservative than LP08, and managed to discard many of the original clusters.",
        "However, the results for 1% are more encouraging.",
        "Both algorithms, even when started with several candidate clusters in the one-way clustering, managed to eliminate the minor clusters to some extent, and redistribute their members into the larger parts-of-speech.",
        "It is particularly noteworthy that for CDCC, only three clusters were used for more than 1% of all instances.",
        "Inspection of the details of categorization showed that the CDCC algorithm managed to discover three clusters that seemed to correspond closely to the three major English parts-of-speech of Noun, Verb and Adjective.",
        "These categories appeared to be such a salient feature of the data for CDCC that they were able to ?self-organize?",
        "during runs of the algorithm from various one-way clustering starting points.",
        "This robust induction of the main English parts-of-speech is a striking advantage of CDCC over LP08.",
        "It may be argued that the number of classes produced by the algorithm are too few to provide a basis for part-of-speech induction.",
        "To some extent this is a consequence of the seeding algorithm chosen.",
        "The frames used by Leibbrandt & Powers (2008, 2010) tended to support mostly open-class word fillers; nouns, verbs and adjectives made up respectively 52%, 25% and 10% of the total number of tokens that served as fillers in their frames, for a total of 87%.",
        "Arguably, this may be seen as desirable: for a child learning a language, knowledge of the open classes is more useful for learning novel words than knowledge of the closed classes.",
        "On the other hand, the lack of a category of adverbs may be regarded as a shortcoming of the original work by Leibbrandt & Powers.",
        "Nevertheless, the CDCC algorithm was able to robustly identify the main classes represented in the co-occurrence matrix."

        "The CDCC algorithm has been shown to achieve similar categorization performance to some earlier models of part-of-speech induction.",
        "The most striking advantage has been that CDCC is able to ?hone in?",
        "on the three main parts-of-speech.",
        "We suggest that this is due to the conservative nature of conflict resolution: by tallying the strength of evidence for a particular category in terms of the number of votes it receives, weaker categories are not able to cast sufficient numbers of votes to change word or frame allocations.",
        "Importantly, this means that in subsequent iterations, when conflicts are recalculated and votes cast once more, allocations of particular words or frames to these minor categories are more likely to be swamped by the additional allocations previously added to the major categories, so that the initially stronger categories become stronger as the algorithm executes while the weaker categories all but disappear.",
        "This is an important feature of the algorithm, because the original clustering step from which both CDCC and Leibbrandt & Powers (2008) begin is unconstrained in the number of clusters it produces; this is a parameter of the system, but it is a relatively unimportant one in the case of CDCC because the algorithm self-organizes around the major categories.",
        "While the CDCC algorithm performs similarly to other established work while taking a radically different approach, several issues remain to be investigated.",
        "One of the potential strengths of CDCC is that it treats category membership in a discrete or symbolic way, rather than graded, as in Leibbrandt & Powers (2008).",
        "It remains to be seen whether such a treatment provides specific benefits in resolving ambiguity when dealing with words or frames that can belong to multiple categories.",
        "CDCC has been formulated here as combining distributional information about the word type and the frame type in order to produce a part-of-speech allocation.",
        "However, the algorithm can be viewed more generally as a method to combine or fuse more than one source of information together, and hence can be applied to distributional, phonological, semantic or any other forms of linguistic information.",
        "As it has been formulated here as a batch process, the CDCC algorithm can be regarded as addressing only the computational level of the problem of part-of-speech induction in language acquisition.",
        "Additional work would be required to attempt to address the algorithmic or implementational levels by turning the algorithm into a fully incremental learner (e.g., Parisien, Fazly & Stevenson, 2008; Chrupala & Alishahi, 2010).",
        "A simple variant of the CDCC algorithm could be one that simply processes the corpus in order, and in the case of a conflict between word and frame, stores the occurrence as evidence that the membership of either the word or frame should be altered, and in what way.",
        "When the accumulated evidence for a specific change of membership exceeds a threshold (e.g. when a certain number of votes have been cast to add membership of a particular cluster to a word or frame), the membership is added.",
        "It would remain to be determined empirically whether this iterative variant is still able to exhibit the same categorization performance and the property of robustness shown above for the batch CDCC algorithm."
