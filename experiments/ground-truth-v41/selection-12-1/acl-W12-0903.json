        "The most convincing models of human grammar acquisition to date are supervised, in the sense that they learn from pairs of strings and meaning representations (Siskind, 1996; Villavicencio, 2002; Villavicencio, 2011; Buttery, 2004; Buttery, 2006; Kwiatkowski et al., 2012).",
        "Although the principles by which such models learn are quite general, the datasets they have been applied to have unavoidably been somewhat target-language-specific, and are also limited to discourse-external world-state-related content, contrary to the observations of (Tomasello, 2001) concerning the central role of common ground and grounding in interpersonal interaction.",
        "I?ll review the state of the art in the light of these limitations on the datasets, and try to make some suggestions about how we might obtain more realistic and challenging artificial and natural datasets using both automatic and human labeling methods."
