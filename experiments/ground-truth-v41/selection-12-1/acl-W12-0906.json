        "Annotated corpora of child language data are valuable resources for language acquisition studies, for instance, providing the basis for developmental comparisons and evaluation of different hypotheses.",
        "For computational investigations annotated corpora can serve as an approximation to the linguistic environment to which a child is exposed, as discussed by Wintner (2010).",
        "Recently there has been a growing number of initiatives for annotating children's data for a number of languages, with for instance, part-of-speech (PoS) and syntactic information (Sagae et al., 2010; Buttery and Korhonen, 2007; Yang, 2010) and some of these are available as part of CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "For resource rich languages like English these annotations can be further extended with detailed information, for instance, from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) about synonymy, from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981) about age of acquisition, imagery, concreteness and familiarity among others.",
        "However, for many other languages one of the challenges is in annotating corpora in a context where resources and tools are less abundant and many are still under development.",
        "In this paper we describe one such initiative, for annotating the raw Portuguese corpora available in the CHILDES database with (psycho)linguistic and distributional information (?2) .",
        "It also describes a modular searching environment for these corpora that allows complex and flexible searches that combine different levels of annotation, and that can be easily extended (?3).",
        "We finish with some conclusions and future work."

        "This parser has a high accuracy: 99% for part-of-speech and 96-97%.",
        "The parser also has a named entity recognizer (Bick, 2003) and provides some semantic information for nouns, verbs and adjectives (e.g. organization, date, place, etc).",
        "The annotations process consisted of the following steps:",
        "1. automatic preprocessing for dealing with incomplete words and removing transcription notes; 2. tagging and parsing with PALAVRAS parser; 3. annotation of verbs and nouns with psy",
        "cholinguistic information like age of acquisition and concreteness from (Cameirao and Vicente, 2010).",
        "For enabling age related analysis, the sentences were subsequently divided according to the child's age reported in each corpus, and annotated with frequency information collected considering separately each type of annotation per age."

        "It is possible to examine, for instance, the usage of a particular word and its evolution according to grammatical class per age.",
        "The environment provides two modes for queries: an expert mode, where database queries can be dynamically specified selecting the relevant fields, and a guided mode which contains predefined query components and a set of filters that users can combine in the queries.",
        "The results are available both as a file containing the relevant annotated sentences for further processing, or in a graphical form.",
        "The latter shows a chart of frequency per age, which can be displayed in terms of absolute or relative values.",
        "The guided mode provides an iterative way for query construction where the user selects a relevant field (e.g. age of acquisition) at a time and adds it to the query until all desired fields have been added, when the resulting query is saved.",
        "The user can repeat this process to create combined queries and at the end of the process can chose the form for outputting the result (graphic or file)."

        "Therefore this initiative not only produced an integrated and rich annotation schema so far lacking for these corpora, but also provided a modular environment for structuring and searching them through a more user friendly interface.",
