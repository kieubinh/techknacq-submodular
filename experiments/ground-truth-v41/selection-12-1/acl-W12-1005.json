        "Until quite recently, most critical edition1 projects produced printed books, even though the production of these volumes has been supported by computers since the 1960s, e.g., for concordancing, collation, and statistical analyses, as well as for bibliography management, text editing, and typesetting (see, e.g., Froger (1970)).",
        "Modern edition projects increasingly aim to produce digital editions that offer linking, dynamic display of alternative readings, or the integration of related images (in particular facsimiles of original documents), audio, or video.",
        "However, the new target medium does not just offer new possibilities, but it also demands sometimes fundamental changes in the editorial process.",
        "One affected area is indexing.",
        "In printed books, the manually constructed back-of-the-book index is the only way for readers to access the contents in a non-linear fashion.",
        "A good index is not merely a list of words occurring in the text, but it specifies 1In a narrow sense, a critical edition is a scholarly edition that tries to recover the most authentic version of a historical text from extant sources.",
        "We use the term loosely to include other types of scholarly editions, in particular diplomatic editions.",
        "concepts and introduces synonyms and, through cross-references, related terms.",
        "The possibility to perform full-text searches on digital texts therefore does not render manually constructed indices obsolete, but complements them (see Savoy (2005) for an evaluation in a comparable scenario).",
        "For editions of historical texts, a manually constructed index is indispensable, as spelling variation, meaning shifts, and multilingualism make full-text retrieval difficult for both laypersons and experts.",
        "In book form, collective editions of shorter texts, such as letters, treaties, or charters, form one monolithic entity.",
        "The electronic medium allows for direct linking and repurposing of individual parts (or content objects) of a collection in new contexts, so the individual edited text is much more independent than it was in a printed volume.",
        "This has direct implications for the construction of indices: Traditionally, an index for a book is compiled when it is completed; thus, when selecting keywords, the indexer does not consider individual texts in isolation, but rather within the specific context set by the book.",
        "An indexer may thus choose one particular term for describing a concept over another one because it occurs verbatim in the majority of texts; or an indexer may choose to leave out certain possible index terms because they are self-evident in the context of the book, e.g., the index to an edition of letters is unlikely to contain the index term letter.",
        "In a digital edition, in contrast, index terms should be rather thought of as metadata assigned to individual content objects to enable retrieval and reuse in different contexts.",
        "For example, if an edition of a letter is included in a thematic collection containing various types of documents, it should have the metadata information letter, as this may be a distinguishing feature in this collection.",
        "It also means that a collection may contain items",
        "annotated by different editors, in contrast to back-of-the-book indices, which are typically created by a single indexer.",
        "In order to ensure interoperability of index terms, a controlled vocabulary should be used.",
        "We define a controlled vocabulary in accordance with ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 (ANSI/NISO, 2005) as a set of canonical terms that are managed by an authority according to certain rules; for multiple terms referring to the same concept, a preferred term (i.e., descriptor) is defined, and a term representing various concepts is made unambiguous.",
        "A controlled vocabulary may have defined types of relationships between terms such as in a taxonomy (hierarchy), thesaurus (hierarchy, equivalence, association), or ontology (specific types of relationships like ?is produced by?).",
        "Construction of controlled vocabularies is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.",
        "Since it requires deep semantic understanding, it cannot be fully automated.",
        "However, we noted in our experiments that some stages of building a controlled vocabulary (see Shearer (2004) for a nine-step procedure to build a thesaurus) can be partially automated.",
        "In particular, we propose to harvest the information contained in subject indices from earlier or related works.",
        "This paper describes ongoing work along these lines towards a controlled vocabulary for the Collection of Swiss Law Sources, a large-scale critical edition of historical texts.",
        "The vocabulary is intended to support editors in finding meaningful and agreed-upon descriptors and to facilitate retrieval of documents by both experts and laypersons.",
        "We expect that for our purposes a post-coordinate vocabulary2 will be most useful, but the exact type and structure of the vocabulary will be defined at a later stage.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are (1) to raise awareness for existing manually created information resources, which are potentially valuable for many tasks related to the processing of historical texts, and (2) to describe exploratory work towards using one type of resource, namely indices, for creating a controlled vocabulary.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work; Section 3 gives an overview of the Collection and its subject indices; Section 4 describes the extraction of index terms and their 2See ANSI/NISO (2005) for a definition of postcoordina-tion.",

        "The Collection is an ongoing project; future additions to the Collection will be created as digital editions.",
        "Instead of compiling a book, each source considered for addition to the Collection will be stored in a TEI-encoded XML document; virtual volumes, e.g., on a certain topic, place, or period, can then be created by selecting a subset of these documents.",

        "In addition, each document will need to be assigned a set of descriptors.",

        "DS21 contains volumes from ten cantons representing most linguistic and geographic regions of Switzerland and spans 1078 years.",
        "We therefore believe DS21 to be a good sample of the types of documents contained in the Collection, and we therefore expect high-frequency index terms to be good candidates for inclusion in the controlled vocabulary.",

        "The former is illustrated by the fact that the second most frequent term in our list of index terms after Erbrecht is B?cker ?baker?, which does not appear in the list of HRG keywords.",
        "While professional roles related to legal duties like Notar ?notary?",
        "or Landvogt ?bailiff?, as well as religious roles like Papst ?pope?",
        "or Kleriker ?clergyman?",
        "are also HRG headwords, terminology related to crafts and trades?like Gerber ?tanner?",
        "or Schuhmacher ?shoemaker?",
        "?is rare.",
        "However, from a legal perspective, the terms in the intersection between the Collection and the HRG are indeed highly relevant.",
        "We also noted that high-frequency index terms from the Collection are in fact more likely to appear in the list of HRG headwords than low-frequency terms.",
        "As expected, Erbrecht ?inheritance law?, the most frequent term in our list of index terms also occurs in the list of HRG headwords.",
        "A third of the terms appearing three times or more (306 terms) are also covered by the HRG (102 headwords), in contrast to an overlap of less than 7% for the terms occurring only once in the indices of the Collection.",
        "The index terms that occur more than once in our indices (i.e., 18% of our 4881 base form terms) account for over 46% of the terms in the intersection with the HRG headwords."

        "In this paper, we have described ongoing work on the extraction of index terms from back-of-the-book subject indices in order to build a controlled vocabulary for the Collection of Swiss Law Sources.",
        "We have used base form reduction for term conflation and decompounding for discovering potential hierarchical relations.",
        "We have found that index terms that are also HRG headwords are likely to be highly relevant; the terms in the intersection between our index terms and the HRG headwords will therefore be reviewed by the editors of the Collection to verify whether they are a good foundation for a controlled vocabulary.",
        "At this point, we have only examined index terms in modern language.",
        "However, the majority (85%) of modern word forms appears only once; this means that the bulk of the concepts contained in the indices must be represented by historical-language index terms.",
        "For the construction of a controlled vocabulary it is thus necessary to also consider these terms.",
        "While there are only 6370 modern word forms (5160 unique terms) in the subject indices, we have extracted 41,099 historical word forms (28,860 unique terms).",
        "The reduction of about 30% for historical versus about 20% for modern terms indicates that historical index terms are more evenly spread across the analyzed volumes.",
        "The percentage of historical index terms occurring only once is only slightly lower than for modern terms (80% vs. 85%); however, the historical terms exhibit a high degree of spelling variation.",
        "We therefore expect that many terms are spelling variants that can be conflated.",
        "We are currently working on methods for clustering different historical spellings of related terms."
