        "From its formation as an academic discipline in the second half of the 20th century onwards, one of the main concerns of feminist theory has been to show how social and institutional (man-made) factors have shaped what we are sometimes inclined to see as ?normal?",
        "or ?natural?",

        "This state of affairs delineates a desideratum for feminist philosophy: giving more evidence of the cultural factors which instill gendered behaviour and associations in humans.",
        "While a lot of the cultural information concerning gender is visual (cinema, magazine covers, advertisement, etc), and the ways to initiating people into specific codes of gendered behavior can be non-verbal, the content of our notions of gender are vastly represented in text.",

        "Multiplicative and phrasal model, after filtering woman/women only occurs 384 times in our corpus, so the vector obtained through the phrasal model suffers from some data sparsity problems.6 In particular, overall infrequent events are given high weights by our algorithm, resulting in a relatively high number of surnames being present in the produced vector.",
        "Despite this issue, a number of observations can be made, which agree with both our linguistic and philosophical expectations.",
        "We first considered to what extent the phrasal and multiplicative models emphasised the characteristics already present in their components?distributions.",
        "We found that the top contexts for the phrasal distribution of black woman only overlap 17 times with the top contexts of woman and 9 times with the top contexts for black.",
        "The multiplicative model produces an overlap of only 12 items with woman but 64 with",

        "In contrast, the composition of the constituents via the multiplicative model returns a distribution fairly close to the distribution of those constituents.",
        "We looked next at the characteristic contexts that were particular to each representation.",
        "We found that the phrasal model vector presents 73 terms which are absent from the top contexts for black and woman.",
        "In contrast, none of the terms in the top contexts of the multiplied vector is specific to the composed phrase: all of them are either highly characteristic of black or woman (e.g. racial, African-American and breast, dress).8 This indicates that the salient contexts for the phrase are very different from the associations commonly made with its constituents.",
        "Finally, we observed that the vector obtained through the phrasal model only overlaps 8 times with the composed one.",
        "The shared words are racial, white, whites, African-American, racism, breast, slaves and slavery.",
        "Again, we can conclude from this that the two representations capture very different aspect of meaning, although they both retrieve some high-level associations with the concept of race and race-related history.",
        "8Because our system does not perform any sense disambiguation, we return contexts such as pepper for black pepper, hole for black hole, etc.",
        "From the point of view of intersectionality, our results confirm the basic claim of the theory: there are cases where the discourse on individuals belonging to two different social groups is radically different than the discourse pertaining to those social groups taken separately.",
        "In addition, the data supports further arguments made by intersectionality researchers.",
        "In particular, comparing the distributions for woman, black woman and Asian woman9 shows that colour or ethnicity has a crucial impact on how women are represented.",
        "Looking at woman, the word rape appears at position 12, but it appears much further down the list in black woman and not at all in Asian woman.",
        "At the same time the word nursing is only associated with black women while pornography hits position number 3, shortly followed by exotic and passive when we look at Asian woman.",
        "These three words do not occur in the top contexts for woman or black woman.",
        "This indicates that we are getting results concerning sexuality which depend on ?ethnical?",
        "connotation: white women are shown as victims of abuse (rape), black women as responsible for nursing, and Asian women represented as passive and objects of pornography.",
        "Just looking at this data (and there would be a lot more to analyse) we can find a connection with what the latest historical research working with intersectionality has brought to light: historians have shown that the historical discourse on prostitution has increased and reinforced racist stereotypes and prejudices.",
        "Whyte (2012) shows, (looking at the ?white slavery?",
        "panic of the early twentieth century which is a key point in the history of prostitution) that the construction of the white, innocent victim of prostitution is central to the creation of the myth of the ?white slavery?",
        "in many ways and that it has shaped the construction and understanding of contemporary human trafficking.",
        "The broader history of slavery (particularly in the North American context) forms the backdrop for ?writing out?",
        "women of colour as victims of sexual violence.",
        "This is appropriately illustrated by our data.",
        "9Due to space constraints, we are not showing the distribution of Asian woman."

        "This paper sought to demonstrate that linguistic representations of the type used in distributional semantics may provide useful data to humanities researchers who analyse discursive trends.",
        "We presented a case study involving two subfields of philosophy: gender theory and intersectionality.",
        "We hope to have shown that a) distributional data is a useful representation of social phenomena which have been described by theorists and social scientists but never linguistically observed on a large scale b) this data lends itself to a fine-grained analysis of such phenomena, as exemplified by the discussions in ?5 and ?6.",
        "Further, we have highlighted that the philosophical theory of intersectionality can be illustrated, at least for some concepts, via a quantitative analysis of the output of different distributional models.",
        "We suggest that this observation should be investigated further from the point of view of computational linguistics: there may be some aspect of meaning which is not expressed by those distributional compositional models that do not take phrasal distributions into account (i.e. additive, multiplicative, circular convolution models).",
        "A natural extension of this work would be to design experiments focusing on particular types of discourse and corpora, and pursue conceptual analysis at the diachronic level.",
        "This presupposes the existence of digitalised corpora which may not be available at this point in time.",
        "Efforts should therefore be made to acquire the needed data.",
        "We leave this as future work."
