        "There has been much effort in enriching text corpora with linguistic information, such as parts-of-speech (Francis and Ku?era, 1982) and syntactic structures (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The past decade has seen the development of Chinese corpora, mostly for Modern Chinese (McEnery & Xiao, 2004; Xue et al., 2005), but also a few for pre-modern, or ?classical?, Chinese (Wei et al.",
        "97; Huang et al. 2006; Hu & McLaughlin 2007).",
        "One common design issue for any corpus of Chinese, whether modern or classical, is word segmentation.",
        "Yet, no segmentation standard has emerged in the computational linguistics research community.",
        "Hence, two adjacent characters X1X2 may be considered a single word in one corpus, but treated as two distinct words X1 and X2 in another 1; furthermore, the part-of-speech (POS) tag assigned to X1X2 in the first corpus may differ from the tag for X1 and the tag for X2 in the second.",
        "These inconsistencies have made it difficult to compare, combine or exploit Chinese corpora.",
        "This paper addresses this problem by proposing a new method for word segmentation and POS tagging for Chinese and applying it on a corpus of classical Chinese poems."

      "heading": "2 Research Objective",
      "text": [
        "A Chinese character may either function as a word by itself, or combine with its neighbor(s) to form a multi-character word.",
        "Since the goal of part-of-speech (POS) tagging is to assign one tag to each word, a prerequisite step is word segmentation, i.e., drawing word boundaries within a string of Chinese characters.",
        "The general test for ?wordhood?",
        "is whether ?the meaning of the whole is compositional of its parts?",
        "; in other words, X1X2 forms one word when the meaning of the characters X1X2 does not equal to the meaning of X1 plus the meaning of X2 (Feng, 1998).",
        "Consider the string ??",
        "sha men ?Buddhist monk?.",
        "As a transliteration from Sanskrit, it bears no semantic relation with its constituent characters ?",
        "sha ?sand?",
        "and ?",
        "men ?door?.",
        "The two characters therefore form one word.",
        "From the point of view of corpus development, word segmentation has two consequences.",
        "First, it defines the smallest unit for POS analysis.",
        "It would be meaningless to analyze the POS of the individual characters as, 1 This phenomenon can be compared with what is often known as multiword expressions (Sag et al., 2002) in other languages.",
        "say, ?/NN and ?/NN (see Table 1 for the list of POS tags used in this paper).",
        "Instead, the two characters sha and men together should be assigned one POS tag, ??/NN.",
        "Second, word segmentation sets boundaries for automatic word retrieval.",
        "A simple string search for ?sha men?",
        "on a non-segmented corpus might yield spurious matches, where sha is the last character of the preceding word, and men is the first character of the following one.",
        "In a word study on ?",
        "?",
        "ben jue ?original enlightenment?",
        "(Lancaster, 2010), based on a non-segmented corpus of the Chinese Buddhist Canon, the author needed to manually examine each of the 763 occurrences of the string ben jue in order to determine which of them are in fact the word in question, rather than accidental collocations of the two characters.",
        "Word boundaries resulting from word segmentation would have removed these ambiguities, expedited the search and enabled this kind of word studies to be performed on much larger scales.",
        "There is not yet a scholarly consensus on a precise definition of ?wordhood?",
        "in Classical Chinese (Feng, 1998).",
        "Inevitably, then, treatment of word segmentation varies widely from corpus to corpus.",
        "Some did not perform word segmentation (Huang et al. 2006); others adopted their own principles (Wei et al. 1997; Hu & McLaughlin 2007).",
        "The lack of standardization not only hinders corpus interoperability, but also makes it difficult for any single corpus to cater to users with different assumptions about wordhood or different research objectives.",
        "What is regarded as one word for a user may be two words in the eyes of another.",
        "Consider two alternative analyses of the string ??",
        "huang he ?Yellow River?",
        "in two research tasks.",
        "For retrieval of geographical references in a text, it should ideally be tagged as one single proper noun, ??",
        "/NR; to study parallelisms in poetry, however, it is better to be tagged as two separate words, ?",
        "/JJ huang ?yellow?",
        "followed by ?/NN he ?river?, in order not to obscure the crucial POS sequence ?adjective-noun?",
        "that signals parallelism in a couplet.",
        "To settle on any particular word segmentation criterion, then, is to risk omitting useful information.",
        "We are not qualified to lay down any definitive criterion for word segmentation; rather, we advocate a theory-neutral approach through nested POS tags: characters are analyzed individually whenever possible, but annotated with hierarchical tags to recognize possible word boundaries."

        "We have a described a novel method of word segmentation and POS tagging, tailored for the classical Chinese language, and designed to support interoperability between corpora.",

        "The corpus aspires to contribute to two areas of scholarly enquiry.",
        "First, it is expected to facilitate classical Chinese word studies by automating word retrieval (e.g., (Lancaster, 2010)), and will support investigations in other areas of classical Chinese philology, such as semantic and metaphorical coherence (Zhu & Cui, 2010), by supplying syntactic evidence.",
        "Second, it is intended to serve as training data for automatic POS taggers, to automate the analysis of the vast and growing digital collections of classical Chinese texts."
