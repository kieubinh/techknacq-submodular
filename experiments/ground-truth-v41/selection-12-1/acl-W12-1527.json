      "text": [
        "So far, there has been little success in Natural Language Generation in coming up with general models of the content selection process.",
        "Most of the researchers in the field agree that this lack of success is because the knowledge and context (communicative goals, user profile, discourse history, query, etc) needed for this task depend on the application domain.",
        "This often led in the past to template-or graph-based combined content selection and discourse structuring approaches operating on idiosyncratically encoded small sets of input data.",
        "Furthermore, in many NLG-applications, target texts and sometimes even empirical data are not available, which makes it difficult to employ empirical approaches to knowledge elicitation.",
        "Nonetheless, during the last decade, there has been a steady flow of new work on content selection that employed Machine learning (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Duboue and McKeown, 2003; Jordan and Walker, 2005; Kelly et al., 2009), heuristic search (O?Donnell et al., 2001; Demir et al., 2010; Mellish and Pan, 2008), or a combination thereof (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2011).",
        "All of these strategies can deal with large volumes of data.",
        "On the other side, there is a clear tendency in NLG towards the use of resources encoded in terms of standard Semantic Web representation formats such as OWL and RDF, e.g., (Wilcock and Jokinen, 2003; Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004; Mellish and Pan, 2008; Power and Third, 2010; Bouayad-Agha et al., 2011; Dannells et al., 2012), to name but a few.",
        "However, although most of these works make a good attempt at realisation, the problem of content determination from Semantic Web data is relatively untouched.",
        "For these reasons, we believe that the time has come to bring together researchers working on (or interested in working on) content selection to participate in a challenge for this task using standard freely available web data as input.",
        "The availability of open modular multi-domain multi-billion triple data and of open ontological resources (Bizer et al., 2009) presented in a standard knowledge representation formalism make semantic web data a natural choice for such a challenge.",
        "As will be presented below, this initial challenge presents a relatively simple content selection task with no user model and a straightforward communicative goal so that people are encouraged to take part and motivated to stay on for later challenges, in which the task will be successively enhanced from gained experience.",
        "A content determination challenge would be a chance to (i) directly compare the performance of",
        "different types of content selection strategies; (ii) contribute towards developing a standard ?off-the-shelf?",
        "content selection module; and (iii) contribute towards a standard interface between text planning and linguistic generation.",
        "To get the widest reception possible, the challenge will be open to any approach, be it template-, rule-or heuristic-based, or empirical.",
        "Furthermore, it will be advertised in the Semantic Web Community to get contributors from other horizons, see, e.g., (Dai et al., 2010).",
        "In what follows, we briefly outline the idea and plan for the execution of the challenge.",
        "In Section 2, we outline a description of the task.",
        "In Section 3, the data and domain that will be used are presented.",
        "Section 4 describes how this data is to be prepared for the task, and Section 5 how it will be released to the participants.",
        "In Section 6, we sketch the evaluation including the preparation of the evaluation dataset.",
        "Section 7 gives a proposed schedule for each of the tasks involved in organizing the challenge.",
        "Finally, in Section 8, we provide short biographies of the members of the organization team, focusing on their experience in the proposed task."

        "The participants are also free to consider the semantics defined by the data sources in their approach, rely on additional resources like ontologies from other sources, or disregard the semantics completely.",
        "The implemented system should output its results in a predefined standard format that can be used for automatic evaluation.",
        "It could be that the RDF data does not contain everything that would ideally be included in such an article, but that is ignored here.",

        "All pairs should contain enough RDF-triples and text to make the pair interesting for the content selection task.",
