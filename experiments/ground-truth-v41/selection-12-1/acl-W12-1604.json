      "text": [
        "Because dialog is interactive, interlocutors are constantly engaged in a process of predicting and monitoring the effects of their utterances.",
        "Typically, a speaker produces an utterance with a specific communicative goal in mind?e.g., that the hearer will perform an action or adopt a certain belief?, and chooses one particular utterance because they predict that it will achieve this communicative goal.",
        "They will then monitor the hearer's reactions and infer from their observations whether the prediction actually came true.",
        "If they recognize that the hearer misunderstood the utterance, they may repair the problem by diagnosing what caused the misunderstanding and giving the hearer feedback.",
        "In a task-oriented dialog in which the hearer must perform a part of the task, feedback is especially important to inform the hearer when they made a mistake in the task.",
        "Ideally, the speaker should even detect when the hearer is about to make a mistake, and use feedback to keep them from making the mistake at all.",
        "Many implemented dialog systems include a component for monitoring and repair.",
        "For instance, Traum (1994) presents a model for monitoring the grounding status of utterances in the TRAINS system; Young et al. (1994) show how the student's utterances in a dialog system can be used to uncover mistaken assumptions about their mental state; and Paek and Horvitz (1999) discuss an automated helpdesk system that can track grounding under uncertainty.",
        "However, most of these systems rely on the user's verbal utterances as their primary source of information; monitoring thus presupposes an (error-prone) language understanding module.",
        "In the context of situated communication, where the speaker and hearer share a physical (or virtual) environment, one type of observation that can potentially give us a very direct handle on the hearer's understanding of an utterance is eye gaze.",
        "Eyetracking studies in psycholinguistics have shown that when listeners hear a referring expression, they tend to rapidly attend to the object in a scene to which they resolve this expression (Tanenhaus et al., 1995; Al-lopenna et al., 1998).",
        "For utterances that involve references to objects in the current environment, one can therefore ask whether eyetracking can be used to reliably judge the communicative success of the utterance.",
        "This would be of practical interest for implemented dialog systems once eyetracking becomes a mainstream technology; and even today, a system that reliably monitors communicative success using eyetracking could serve as a testbed for exploring monitoring and repair strategies.",
        "In this paper, we present an interactive natural-language generation (NLG) system that uses eye",
        "tracking to monitor communicative success.",
        "Our system gives real-time instructions that are designed to help the user perform a treasure-hunt task in the virtual 3D environments of the recent Challenges on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE; Koller et al. (2010)).",
        "It monitors how the user resolves referring expressions (REs) by mapping the user's gaze to objects in the virtual environment.",
        "The system takes gaze to the intended referent as evidence of successful understanding, and gives the user positive feedback; by contrast, gaze to other objects triggers negative feedback.",
        "Crucially, this feedback comes before the user interacts with the object in the virtual environment, keeping the user from making mistakes before they happen.",
        "We evaluate our system against one baseline that gives no feedback, and another that bases its feedback on monitoring the user's movements and their field of view.",
        "We find that the eyetracking-based system outperforms both on referential success, and that users interacting with it show significantly fewer signs of confusion about how to complete their task.",
        "This demonstrates that eyetracking can serve as a reliable source of evidence in monitoring communicative success.",
        "The system is, to our knowledge, the first dialog or NLG system that uses the hearer's gaze to monitor understanding of REs.",
        "Plan of the paper.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first discuss related work in Section 2.",
        "We then describe our approach as well as the baselines in Section 3, set up the evaluation in Section 4 and present the results in Section 5.",

        "Dialog systems model a process of grounding, in which they decide to what extent the user has understood the utterance and the communicative goal has been reached.",
        "Observing the user behavior to monitor the state of understanding is a key component in this process.",
        "A full solution may require plan recognition or abductive or epistemic reasoning (see e.g. Young et al. (1994), Hirst et al. (1994)); in practice, many systems use more streamlined (Traum, 1994) or statistical methods (Paek and Horvitz, 1999).",
        "Most dialog systems focus on the verbal interaction of the system and user, and the user's utterances are therefore the primary source of evidence in the monitoring process.",
        "Some incremental dialog systems can monitor the user's verbal reactions to the system's utterances in real time, and continuously update the grounding state while the system utterance is still in progress (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Buss and Schlangen, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the generation side of a dialog system?the user is the hearer?and on monitoring the user's extralinguistic reactions, in particular their gaze.",
        "Tanenhaus et al. (1995) and Al-lopenna et al. (1998) showed that subjects in psycholinguistic experiments who hear an RE visually attend to the object to which they resolve the RE.",
        "The ?visual world?",
        "experimental paradigm exploits this by presenting objects on a computer screen and using an eyetracker to monitor the subject's gaze.",
        "This research uses gaze only as an experimental tool and not as part of an interactive dialog system, and the visual worlds are usually limited to static 2D scenes.",
        "Also, such setups cannot account for the reciprocal nature of dialog and the consequences that hearer gaze has for the speaker's monitoring process.",
        "In the context of situated dialog systems, previous studies have employed robots and virtual agents as speakers to explore how and when speaker gaze helps human hearers to ground referring expressions (Foster, 2007).",
        "For instance, Staudte and Crocker (2011) show that an agent can make it easier for the (human) hearer to resolve a system-generated RE by looking at the intended referent, using head and eye movements.",
        "Conversely, the performance of a system for resolving human-produced REs can be improved by taking the (human) speaker's gaze into account (Iida et al., 2011).",
        "Gaze has also been used to track the general dynamics of a dialog, such as turn taking (Jokinen et al., in press).",
        "Here we are interested in monitoring the hearer's gaze in order to determine whether they have understood an RE.",
        "To our knowledge, there has been no research on this; in particular, not in dynamic 3D environments.",
        "The closest earlier work of which we are aware comes from the context of the GIVE Challenge, a shared task for interactive, situated natural language generation systems.",

        "Even though these measures only partly provide statistically significant results, they help to draw a clearer picture of how the eyetracking-based feedback affects performance.",
        "Because the three virtual environments were of different complexity, we normalized the number of actions, distance, and duration by dividing the value for a given interaction by the minimum value for all interactions of the same virtual environment.",

        "The only measure deviating from this trend is movement speed, i.e., the speed at which users reacted to the systems?",
        "instructions to press certain buttons.",
        "For all successful scenes (without confusion), we computed the speed by dividing the GIVE distance (including turning distance) between the target referent and the user's location at the time of the instruction containing the first-mention RE by the time (in seconds) between hearing the instruction and pressing the target.",

        "The results in Section 5 demonstrate the usefulness of eyetracking as a foundation for monitoring and feedback.",
        "Compared to the no-feedback system, the eyetracking-based system achieved a significantly lower confusion rate and a significantly higher RE success rate, especially on hard instances.",
        "The difference increases further if we discount scenes in which the user had to ask for help, thus forcing the system to give feedback anyway.",
        "In other words, eyetracking provides reliable and direct access to the hearer's reference resolution process.",
        "Real-time dialog systems can use gaze information to monitor the success of REs and generate feedback before the user actually makes a mistake.",
        "Monitoring and feedback could also be achieved without using eyetracking.",
        "To explore this alternative, we compared eyetracking against a movement-based system.",
        "We found that the former outperformed the latter on hearer confusion and (at least numerically) on referential success, while not performing worse on other measures.",
        "This means that the improvement comes not merely from the fact that feedback was given; it is also important when and where feedback is given.",
        "The crucial weakness of the movement-based system is that it gave feedback for hard instances much more rarely than the eyetracking system.",
        "Increasing recall by lowering the system's confidence threshold would introduce fresh errors.",
        "Further improvements must therefore come at the cost of a more complex monitoring system, both conceptually and in terms of implementation effort.",
        "From this perspective, eyetracking offers good performance at low implementation cost.",
        "One result that seems to go against the trend is that users of the eyetracking system moved significantly more slowly on their way to a target.",
        "We see two possible explanations for this.",
        "First, it may be that users needed some time to listen to the feedback, or were encouraged by it to look at more objects.",
        "A second explanation is that this is not really a difference in the quality of the systems?",
        "behavior, but a difference in the populations over which the mean speed was computed: The speed was only averaged over scenes in which the users resolved the RE correctly, and the eyetracking system achieved communicative success in many cases in which the others did not?presumably complex scenes in which the user had to work harder to find the correct button.",
        "This issue bears more careful analysis.",
        "Finally, the eyetracking-based system could be improved further in many ways.",
        "On the one hand, it suffers from the fact that all objects in the 3D environment shift on the screen when the user turns or moves.",
        "The user's eyes will typically follow the object they are currently inspecting, but lag behind until the screen comes to a stop again.",
        "One topic for future work would be to remove noise of this kind from the eyetracker signal.",
        "On the other hand, the negative feedback our system gave (?no, not that one?)",
        "was quite unspecific.",
        "More specific feedback (?no, the BLUE button?)",
        "might further improve the system's performance."

      "text": [
        "We described an interactive NLG system that uses eyetracking to monitor the communicative success of the REs it generates.",
        "The communication is situated in a virtual 3D environment in which the user can move freely, and our system automatically maps eyetracking screen coordinates to objects in the environment.",
        "A task-based evaluation found that the eyetracking-based system outperforms both a no-feedback system and a system whose feedback is based on the user's movements in the virtual environment, along with their field of view.",
        "Eyetracking is currently widely available in research institutions, which should make our system easy to reimplement in other situated domains.",
        "We anticipate that eyetracking may become mainstream technology in the not-too-distant future.",
        "But even in a purely research context, we believe that the directness with which eyetracking allows us to observe the hearer's interpretation process may be useful as a testbed for efficient theories of grounding.",
