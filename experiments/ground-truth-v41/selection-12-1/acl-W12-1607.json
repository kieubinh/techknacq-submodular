        "Part-of-speech tagging is performed on individual words in sequences, while parse trees represent language at the sentence level.",
        "Individual tasks can be performed at the lexical, sentence, or document level, or even to arbitrary length spans of text (Wiebe et al., 2005), while rhetorical patterns are annotated in a treelike structure across sentences or paragraphs.",
        "In dialogue, the most common unit of analysis is the utterance, usually through dialogue acts.",
        "Here, too, the issue of granularity and specificity of tags has been a persistent issue, along with the integration of larger discourse structure.",
        "Both theory-driven and empirical work has argued for a collapsing of annotations into fewer categories, based on either marking the dominant function of a given turn (Popescu-Belis, 2008) or identifying a single construct of interest and annotating only as necessary to distinguish that construct.",
        "We take the latter approach in this work, predicting conversation structure particularly as it relates to information sharing and authority in dialogue.",
        "We use systemic functional linguistics?",
        "Negotiation annotation scheme (Mayfield and Rose?, 2011) to identify utterances as either giving or receiving information.",
        "This annotation scheme is of particular interest because in addition to sentence-level annotation, well-defined sequences of interaction are incorporated into the annotation process.",
        "This sequential structure has been shown to be useful in secondary analysis of annotated data (Mayfield et al., 2012a), as well as providing structure which improves the accuracy of automated annotations.",
        "This research introduces a model to predict information sharing tags and Negotiation sequence structure jointly with thread disentanglement.",
        "We show that performance can be improved using integer linear programming to enforce constraints on sequence structure.",
        "Structuring and annotation of conversation is available quickly and with comparatively little effort compared to manual annotation.",
        "Moreover, all of our results in this paper were obtained using data a real-world, chat-based internet community, with a mix of long-time expert and first-time",
        "novice users, showing that the model is robust to the challenges of messy data in natural environments.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, we review relevant work in annotation at the levels of utterance, sequence, and thread, and applications of each.",
        "We then introduce the domain of our data and the framework we use for annotation of conversation structure.",
        "In Section 4 we define a supervised, on-line machine learning model which performs this annotation and structuring across granularities.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate this model and show that it approaches or matches human reliability on all tasks.",

        "Research on multi-party conversation structure is widely varied, due to the multifunctional nature of language.",
        "These structures have been used in diverse fields such as computer-supported collaborative work (O?Neill and Martin, 2003), dialogue systems (Bohus and Horvitz, 2011), and research on meetings (Renals et al., 2012).",
        "Much work in annotation has been inspired by speech act theory and dialogue acts (Traum, 1994; Shriberg et al., 2004), which operate primarily on the granularity of individual utterances.",
        "A challenge of tagging is the issue of specificity of tags, as previous work has shown that most utterances have multiple functions (Bunt, 2011).",
        "General tagsets have attempted to capture multi-functionality through independent dimensions which produce potentially millions of possible annotations, though in practice the number of variations remains in the hundreds (Jurafsky et al., 1998).",
        "Situated work has jointly modelled speech act and domain-specific topics (Laws et al., 2012).",
        "Additional structure inspired by linguistics, such as adjacency pairs (Schegloff, 2007) or dialogue games (Carlson, 1983), has been used to build discourse relations between turns.",
        "This additional structure has been shown to improve performance of automated analysis (Poesio and Mikheev, 1998).",
        "Identification of this fine-grained structure of an interaction has been studied in prior work, with applications in agreement detection (Galley et al., 2004), addressee detection (op den Akker and Traum, 2009), and real-world applications, such as customer service conversations (Kim et al., 2010).",
        "Higher-order structure has also been explored in dialogue, from complex graph-like relations (Wolf and Gibson, 2005) to simpler segmentation-based approaches (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "Utterance level-tagging can take into account nearby structure, e.g. forward-looking and backward-looking functions in DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997), while dialogue management systems in intelligent agents often have a plan unfolding over a whole dialogue (Ferguson and Allen, 1998).",
        "In recent years, threading and maintaining of multiple ?floors?",
        "has grown in popularity (Elsner and Charniak, 2010), especially in text-based media.",
        "This level of analysis is designed with the goal of separating out sub-conversations which are independently coherent.",
        "There is a common ground emerging in the thread detection literature on best practices for automated prediction.",
        "Early work viewed the problem as a time series analysis task (Bingham et al., 2003).",
        "Treating thread detection as a clustering problem, with lines representing instances, was given great attention in Shen et al. (2006).",
        "Subsequent researchers have treated the thread detection task as based in discourse coherence, and have pursued topic modelling (Adams, 2008) or entity reference grids (Elsner and Charniak, 2011) to define that concept of coherence.",
        "Other work integrates local discourse structure with the topic-based threads of discourse.",
        "Ai et al. (2007) utilizes information state, a dialogue management component which loosely parallels thread structure, to improve dialogue act tagging.",
        "In the context of Twitter conversations, Ritter et al. (2010) suggests using dialogue act tags as a middle layer towards conversation reconstruction.",
        "Low-level structure between utterances has also been used as a foundation for modelling larger-level sociological phenomena between speakers in a dialogue, for instance, identifying leadership (Strzalkowski et al., 2011) and rapport between providers and patients in support groups (Ogura et al., 2008).",
        "These works have all pointed to the utility of incorporating sentence-level annotations, low-level interaction structure, and overarching themes into a unified system.",

        "Our thread disentanglement performance matches our baselines, and",
        "is in line with heuristic-based assignments from Elsner and Charniak (2010).",
        "In sequence clustering, we observe improvement across all metrics.",
        "The Constrained model achieves a higher f-score than all other models (p < 0.0001).",
        "We determine through a two-tailed confidence interval that sequence clustering performance is statistically indistinguishable from human annotation (p < 0.05).",
        "Error analysis suggests that the constraints are too punishing on the most constrained labels, K2 and f. The differences in performance between constrained and unconstrained models is largely due to higher recall for both K1 and o move prediction, while recall for K2 and f moves lowered slightly.",
        "One possibility for future work may include compensating for this by artificially inflating the likelihood of highly-constrained Negotiation labels.",
        "Additionally, we see that the most common mistakes involve distinguishing between K1 and f moves.",
        "While many f moves are obviously non-content-bearing (?Wow, what fun!?",
        "), others, especially those based in humor, may look grammatical and contentful (?We?ve got to stop meeting this way.?).",
        "Better detection of humor and a more well-defined definition of what information is being shared will improve this aspect of the model.",
        "Overall, these errors do not limit the efficacy of the model for enabling future analysis."

        "This work has presented a unified machine learning model for annotating information sharing acts on a sentence-by-sentence granularity; grouping sequences of sentences based on functional structure; and then grouping those sequences into topic-based threads.",
        "The model performs at a high accuracy, approaching human agreement at the sentence and thread level.",
        "Thread-level accuracy matched but did not exceed simpler baselines, suggesting that this model could benefit from a more elaborate representation of coherence and topic.",
        "At the level of sequences, the model performs statistically the same as human annotation.",
        "The automatic annotation and structuring of dialogue that this model performs is a vital preprocessing task to organize and structure conversational data in numerous domains.",
        "Our model allows researchers to abstract away from vocabulary-based approaches, instead working with interaction-level units of analysis.",
        "This is especially important in the context of interdisciplinary research, where other representations may be overly specialized towards one task, and vocabulary may differ for spurious reasons across populations and cultures.",
        "Our evaluation was performed on a noisy, real-world chatroom corpus, and still performed very accurately.",
        "Coherent interfacing between granularities of analysis is always a challenge.",
        "Segmentation, tokenization, and overlapping or inconsistent structured output are nontrivial problems.",
        "By incorporating sentence-level annotation, discourse-level sequence structure, and topical thread disentanglement into a single model, we have shown one way to reduce or eliminate this interfacing burden and allow greater structural awareness in real-world systems.",
        "Future work will improve this model's accuracy further, test its generality in new domains such as spoken multi-party interactions, and evaluate its usefulness in imposing structure for secondary analysis."
