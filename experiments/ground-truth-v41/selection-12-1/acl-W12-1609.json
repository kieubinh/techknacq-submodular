        "In recent years statistical dialogue systems have gained significant attention due to their potential to be more robust to speech recognition errors.",
        "However, these systems must also be robust to changes in user behaviour caused by cognitive loading.",
        "In this paper, a statistical dialogue system providing restaurant information is evaluated in a set-up where the subjects used a driving simulator whilst talking to the system.",
        "The influences of cognitive loading were investigated and some clear differences in behaviour were discovered.",
        "In particular, it was found that users chose to respond to different system questions and use different speaking styles, which indicate the need for an incremental dialogue approach."

        "A spoken dialogue system enables a user to obtain information while using their hands to perform some other task, which in many cases is the user's primary task.",
        "A typical example is an in-car spoken dialogue system where the spoken interaction is secondary to the main task of driving the car (Weng et al., 2004).",
        "This domain is particularly challenging since it involves dealing with the errors caused by the varying noise levels and changes in user behaviour caused by the cognitive load.",
        "A statistical approach to dialogue modelling has been proposed as a means of automatically optimising dialogue policies.",
        "In particular, the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for dialogue provides a representation of varying levels of uncertainty of the user input, yielding more robust dialogue policies (Williams and Young, 2007; Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010).",
        "Another thread of research deals with speech interfaces for in-car applications, see (Baron and Green, 2006) for a review.",
        "Past research has investigated the extent to which speaking is cognitively less demanding than typing (Gartner et al., 2001; Tsimhoni et al., 2004; Kun et al., 2007).",
        "In addition, considerable research has examined how driving safety is influenced by a dialogue system (Lai et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2008).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, little work has been done to investigate the effect of the cognitive load when interacting with a real conversational spoken dialogue system.",
        "The work presented in (Mishra et al., 2004) suggests that the user speech is more disfluent when the user is performing another task.",
        "However, this work is based on a Wizard of Oz framework, where a human provides the system's responses.",
        "Also, a push-to-talk button was used for every utterance which will have affected the natural flow of the dialogue.",
        "It is important to know if the change of cognitive load has an effect on the speaking style and whether the system can alter its behaviour to accommodate for this.",
        "In this paper we try to answer these questions by examining dialogues where users drove a car simulator and talked to an open-microphone fully automated spoken dialogue system at the same time.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of the dialogue system used and section 3 describes the evaluation set-up.",
        "The analysis of the results is given in Section 4.",

        "The user speaks to the system, and the acoustic signal is converted by the speech recogniser into a set of sentence hypotheses, which represents a probability distribution over all possible things that the user might have said.",
        "The sentence hypotheses are converted into an N-best list of dialogue acts by a semantic decoder.",
        "Since the dialogue state cannot be directly observed it maintains a probability distribution over all states, which is called the belief state.",
        "The belief state is updated at every user turn using Bayesian inference treating the input dialogue acts as evidence.",
        "Based on belief state, the optimal system act is selected using a policy and which is trained automatically using reinforcement learning.",
        "The abstract system dialogue act is converted to an appropriate utterance by a natural language generator and then converted to speech by an HMM-based speech synthesiser.",

        "We then examine the number of contradictions on a turn-to-turn basis.",

        "an expensive restaurant the latter turn is clearly a contradiction.",
        "The percentage of contradicting turns is less than 1% and the difference between the scenarios is not statistically significant.",
        "This suggests that while users tend to forget the task they are given when they are driving, they still act rationally despite the increase in the cognitive load.",
        "The next analysis concerns the user obedience, i.e. the extent to which subjects answer the system questions.",
        "We grouped the system questions in two classes.",

        "What part of town are you looking for?",

        "Still, it is interesting to see that when driving the subjects appear to be more obedient to the system confirmations than when they are just talking.",
        "When the system makes a confirmation, the user can answer with simple yes or no, whereas when the system requests the value of a particular slot, the user needs to think more to provide an answer.",
        "The number of barge-ins, the number of filler words and the average speech intensity vary considerably among the subjects.",
        "Therefore, we average these statistics per user and examine the number of users for which the particular measure is greater for the scenario where they talked to the system and drove the simulator at the same time.",
        "The results",

        "There are several important observations arising from this study.",
        "Firstly, dialogues with cognitively loaded users tend to be less successful.",
        "This suggests that the system should alter its behaviour to match user behaviour and alleviate the cognitive load in order to maintain the level of performance.",
        "This necessitates rapid on-line adaptation of dialogue policies.",
        "The second observation is that cognitively loaded users tend to respond to some types of system questions more than others.",
        "This indicates that the user model within a POMDP dialogue system should be conditioned on a measure of cognitive load.",
        "Finally, this study has found that users barge-in and use filler words significantly more often when they are cognitively loaded.",
        "This suggests the need for a much richer turn-taking model which allows the system to use back-channels and barge-in when the user hesitates.",
        "An obvious candidate is the incremental approach (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009; DeVault et al., 2009) which allows the system to process partial user inputs, back-channels, predict short term user input and interrupt the user during hesitations.",
        "While incremental dialogue is a growing area of study, it has not so far been examined in the context of dialogue for secondary tasks.",
        "We signpost this as an important area for future work."
