        "When two speakers are talking to each other, they try to adapt to their dialogue partner and synchronize their verbal behaviours.",
        "The adaptation may occur at different levels: lexical (Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Brennan and Clark, 1996), syntactic (Reitter et al., 2006), acoustic (Ward and Litman, 2007), articulation (Bard et al., 2000), comprehension (Lev-elt and Kelter, 1982), etc.",
        "Moreover, synchronization of dialogue partners at one level may cause the adaptation process at any other level (Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Cleland and Pickering, 2003).",
        "In this paper we analyse to what degree dialogue partners with different verbal intelligence and levels of acquaintance may adapt to each other during a conversation.",
        "Verbal intelligence (VI) is ?the ability to analyse information and to solve problems using language-based reasoning?",
        "(Logsdon, 2012).",
        "The ability to find suitable words and expressions may be a great help in accomplishing such goals as persuasions, encouragements, explanations, influence, etc.",
        "Moreover, there exists a dependency between an individual's verbal intelligence level and his or her success in life (Buzan, 2002).",
        "The first hypothesis we check in this paper is that both lower and higher verbal intelligence speakers are able to adapt to their dialogue partners; however, this adaptation is reflected by different linguistic features.",
        "The second hypothesis we check in this work is that when higher and lower verbal intelligence speakers are talking to a stranger, the former ones adapt better to their dialogue partner than the latter ones.",
        "This investigation may be helpful for improving the user-friendliness of spoken language dialogue systems.",
        "Systems which automatically adapt to users?",
        "language styles and change their dialogue strategies may help users to feel free and comfortable when interacting with them."
