        "Discourse structure has been shown to have an important role in many natural language applications, such as text summarization (Marcu, 2000; Louis et al., 2010), information presentation (Bateman et al., 2001), question answering (Sun and Chai, 2007), and dialogue generation (Hernault et al., 2008).",
        "To produce such kinds of discourse structure, several attempts have been made to build discourse parsers in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), one of the most widely used theories of text structure.",
        "In the RST framework, a text is first divided into several elementary discourse units (EDUs).",
        "Each EDU may be a simple sentence or a clause in a complex sentence.",
        "Consecutive EDUs are then put in relation with each other to build a discourse tree.",
        "The quality of the discourse segmenter contributes a significant part to the overall accuracy of every discourse parsing system.",
        "If a text is wrongly segmented, no discourse parsing algorithm can build a correct discourse tree.",
        "Existing discourse segmenters usually exploit lexical and syntactic features to label each word in a sentence with one of two labels, boundary or no-boundary.",
        "The limitation of this approach is that it only focuses on the boundaries of EDUs.",
        "It cannot capture features that describe whole EDUs.",
        "Recently, discriminative reranking has been used successfully in some NLP tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, and statistical parsing (Collins and Koo, 2005; Kudo et al., 2005; Huang, 2008; Fraser et al., 2009).",
        "The advantage of the reranking method is that it can exploit the output of a base model to learn.",
        "Based on that output, we can extract long-distance non-local features to rerank.",
        "In this paper, we present a reranking model for the discourse segmentation task.",
        "We show how to use subtree features, features extracted from whole EDUs, to rerank outputs of a base model.",
        "Experimental results on RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) (Carlson et al., 2002) show that our model out",

        "Given a syntactic parse tree t, their algorithm inserts a discourse boundary after each word w for which P (boundary|w, t) > 0.5.",
        "Another statistical discourse segmenter using artificial neural networks is presented in Subba and Di Eugenio (2007).",
        "Like Soricut and Marcu (2003), they formulate the discourse segmentation task as a binary classification problem of deciding whether a word is the boundary or no-boundary of EDUs.",
        "Their segmenter exploits a multilayer perceptron model with back-propagation algorithm and is also trained on RST-DT.",

        "The splitting tree between two consecutive EDUs, from word u to word w and from word r to word v, is a subtree which is similar to a bound tree, but contains two paths from the root of the parse tree to w and r. Hence, a splitting tree between two consecutive EDUs is a bound tree that only covers two words: the last word of the first EDU and the first word of the second EDU.",
