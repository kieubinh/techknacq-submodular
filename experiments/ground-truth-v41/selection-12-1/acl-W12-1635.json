        "A dialogue system (DS) and its users have asymmetric knowledge.",
        "The DS has access to knowledge the user is not privy to, and the user has intentions that the DS attempts to recognize.",
        "When the user's intentions are difficult for her to specify fully, the user and DS must collaborate to formulate the intention.",
        "The thesis of this work is that a DS can assess the specificity of its knowledge with respect to the user intentions it is designed to address.",
        "Our principal result is that, for a DS that queries a relational database, measures of the ambiguity of database attributes can be used both to assess the scope of the DS's task and to guide its dialogue strategy.",
        "To demonstrate our thesis, we have developed a semantic specificity metric applicable to any DS that queries a relational database.",
        "This metric measures the degree to which one or more attributes can uniquely specify an item in the database.",
        "Attributes whose values are more often ambiguous have lower semantic specificity.",

        "To compare the specificity of TITLE and AUTHOR, we calculated query return size, the number of distinct books in the Heiskell database returned by each possible attribute value.",
        "Table 1 tallies how many attribute values have the same query return size.",
        "TITLE partitions the books into 10 subsets, where the two most ambiguous TITLE values, Collected Stories and Sanctuary, each return 10 distinct books.",
        "AUTHOR produces 89 subsets; its most ambiguous value, Louis L?Amour, returns 184 distinct books.",
        "Clearly, TITLE has higher specificity than AUTHOR.",
        "After a survey of related work, this paper defines a semantic specificity metric that is a weighted sum of",
