        "Recently computer-driven conversational characters or virtual humans have started finding real-life applications ranging from education to health services and museums (Traum et al., 2005; Swartout et al., 2006; Kenny et al., 2009; Jan et al., 2009; Swartout et al., 2010).",
        "As proliferation of these systems increases, there is a growing demand for the design and construction of virtual humans to be made more efficient and accessible to people without extensive linguistics and computer science backgrounds, such as writers, designers, and educators.",
        "We are specifically interested in making the language processing and dialogue management components in a virtual human easier for such potential authors to develop.",
        "Some system building steps that can be challenging for such authors include annotating the meaning of user and system utterances in a semantic formalism, developing a formal representation of information state, and writing detailed rules that govern dialogue management.",
        "We are generally interested in the extent to which these various authoring steps are necessary in order to achieve specific levels of system performance.",
        "In this paper, we present a case study analysis of the performance of two alternative architectures for a specific virtual human.",
        "The two architectures, which have been developed and evaluated in prior work (DeVault et al., 2011b; DeVault et al., 2011a), differ substantially in their semantic annotation and policy authoring requirements.",
        "We describe these architectures and our evaluation corpus in Section 2.",
        "We focus our new analysis specifically on how the overall performance of one of the architectures, which uses a natural language understanding (NLU) module and hand-authored rules for the dialogue policy, depends on the performance of the NLU module.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our finding that, depending on the attainable level of NLU accuracy, this modular approach may or may not perform better than a simpler direct classification design that omits a separate NLU module and has a lower annotation and rule authoring burden.",
        "In Section 4, we present an initial exploration of whether a hybrid architecture may be able to combine these approaches?",

        "We then count the proportion of the correct SAs among all the SAs produced across all 19 dialogues, and use this measure of weak accuracy to score dialogue policies.",

      "text": [
        "We consider two existing baseline systems in our experiments here.",
        "The first system (Rules-NLU-SA) consists of a statistical NLU module that maps a user utterance to a single user SA label, and a rule-based dialogue policy hand-crafted by one of the authors.",
        "The NLU uses a maximum-entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) to classify utterances as one of the user SAs using shallow text features.",
        "Training this model requires a corpus of user utterances that have been semantically annotated with the appropriate SA.",
        "We developed our rule-based policy by manually writing the simple rules needed to implement Amani's dialogue policy.",
        "Given a user SA label At for turn t, the rules for determining Amani's response Rt take one of three forms:",
        "The first rule form specifies that a given user SA should always lead to a given system response.",
        "The second and third rule forms enable the system's response to depend on the user having previously performed (or not performed) a specific SA.",
        "One the system developers, who is also a computational linguist, created the current set of 42 rules in about 2 hours.",
        "There are 30 rules of form (a), 6 rules of form (b), and 6 rules of form (c).",
        "The second baseline system (RM-Text) is a statistical classifier that selects system SAs by analyzing shallow features of the user utterances and system responses.",
        "We use the Relevance Model (RM) approach pioneered by Lavrenko et al. (2002) for cross-lingual information retrieval and adapted to question-answering by Leuski et al. (2006).",
        "This method does not require semantic annotation or rule authoring; instead, the necessary training data is defined by linking user utterances directly to the appropriate system responses (Leuski and Traum, 2010).",
        "Table 1 summarizes the performance for the baseline systems (DeVault et al., 2011a).",
        "The NLU module accuracy is approximately 53%, and the weak accuracy of .58 for the corresponding system (Rules-NLU-SA) is relatively low when compared to the RM system at .71.",
        "For comparison we provide a third data point: for Rules-G-SA, we assume that our NLU is 100% accurate and always returns the correct (?gold?)",
        "SA label.",
        "We then run the rule-based dialogue policy on those labels.",
        "The third column (Rules-G-SA) shows the resulting weak accuracy value, .79, which is comparable to the weak accuracy score achieved by the human referees (DeVault et al., 2011b).",
        "We conducted two experiments.",
        "In the first, we studied the effect of NLU accuracy on the performance of the Rules-NLU-SA system.",
        "One of our goals was to find how accurate the NLU would have to be for the Rules-NLU-SA system to outperform RM-Text.",
        "To investigate this, we simulated NLU performance at different accuracy levels by repeatedly sampling to create a mixture of the SAs from the trained NLU classifier and from the correct (gold) set of SAs.",
        "Specifically, we set a fixed value p ranging from 0 to 1 and then iterate over all dialogue turns in the held out dialogue, selecting the the correct SA label with probability p or the trained NLU module's output with probability 1 ?",
        "p. Using the sampled set of SA labels, we compute the resulting simulated NLU accuracy, run the Rules dialogue policy, and record the weak accuracy result.",
        "We repeat the process 25 times for each value of p. We let p range from 0 to 1 in increments of .05 to explore a range of simulated accuracy levels.",
        "Figure 1 shows simulated NLU accuracy and the corresponding dialogue policy weak accuracy as a point in two dimensions.",
        "The points form a cloud with a clear linear trend that starts at approximately 53% NLU accuracy where it intersects with the Rules-NLU-SA system performance and then goes up to the Rules-G performance at 100% NLU accuracy.",
        "The correlation is strong with R2 = 0.97.1 The existence of a mostly linear relationship comports with the fact that most of the policy rules (30 of 42), as described in Section 2.3, are of form (a).",
        "For such rules, each individual correct NLU speech act translates directly into a single correct system response, with no dependence on the system having understood previous user utterances correctly.",
        "In contrast, selecting system responses that comply with rules in forms (b) and (c) generally requires correct understanding of multiple user utterances.",
        "Such rules create a nonlinear relationship between policy performance and NLU accuracy, but these rules are relatively few in number for Amani.",
        "The estimated linear trend line (in purple) crosses the RM-Text system performance at approximately 82% NLU accuracy.",
        "This result suggests that our NLU component would need to improve from its current accuracy of 53% to approximately 82% accuracy for the Rules-NLU-SA system to outperform the RM-Text classifier.",
        "This represents a very substantial increase in NLU accuracy that, in practice, could be expected to require a significant effort involving utterance data collection, semantic annotation, and optimization of machine learning for NLU."
