        "These acts play a key role in achieving fluent conversations.",
        "Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of how these acts interact with speaker behaviors in shaping conversations might offer key insights into the design of technologies such as computer-mediated communication systems and embodied conversational agents.",
        "In this paper, we explore how a regression-based approach might offer such insights into mod-eling predictive relationships between speaker behaviors and addressee backchannels in a storytelling scenario.",

        "In these roles, while speakers produce the majority of the conversational content, addressees play a major role in facilitating speakership by performing backchannels?verbal and nonverbal acts such as ?uh huh?",

        "The design of conversational technologies such as computer-mediated communication systems will have to facilitate the use of backchannel mechanisms to help their users achieve efficient conversations.",
        "Similarly, embodied conversational agents will have to use these mechanisms to achieve efficient interactions with their users.",
        "However, these developments require a deeper understanding of backchannel behavior and models of the relationship between backchannel acts and speaker behaviors.",
        "Research across many communities including discourse processes, dialog systems, and human-computer interaction has explored the use of backchannels in conversations and sought to model the relationships between backchannel acts and other conversational processes using techniques that range from contingency analyses (Truong et al., 2011) to model training (Morency et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we propose a complementary, regression-based approach to untangle the predictive relationships between speaker behaviors and addressee backchannels.",
        "This approach provides us with an understanding of what speaker behaviors are significant predictors of addressee backchannels and of the relative contributions of each behavior in these predictions.",
        "The resulting models inform us of what speaker behaviors are important to support in interactive systems and communication technologies to facilitate addressee backchannels and complement finer-granulated analyses of specific backchannel mechanisms.",
        "We contextualize our exploration in a storytelling scenario, which requires addressees to rely on and frequently use backchannels to participate in the discourse while maintaining consistency in conversational roles, using a multimodal data corpus collected from 24 dyads.",

        "Future work should include complementary modeling techniques to build finer-granulated models of backchannel mechanisms.",
        "Although participants in each conversation were explicitly assigned to one of the roles of speaker and addressee, we did not specifically tell addressees not to speak, which led to a greater amount of variability in their participation in the conversation, some offering up their opinions or asking questions throughout the speaker's story and others limiting their behaviors to a small number of backchannels.",
        "While this variability enabled more natural conversations, this lack of control might have limited the power of our statistical models.",
        "In this paper, we focused on a set of high-level predictors that allow for real-time capture and interpretation, ignoring underlying conversational mechanisms such as repair, which might also serve as significant predictors of backchannels.",
        "The relationships between these mechanisms and backchannel behavior would be a fruitful area of exploration for future research.",
        "Finally, the generalizability of our results suffers from the limited extent of the conversational context and participation structure of our experimental setup.",
        "Future work should seek to extend this exploration to a broader set of conversational settings, such as interview and discussion scenarios, and participation structures, such as multi-party conversations."

        "Backchannels are essential behaviors for achieving fluent and effective conversations.",
        "Gaining a deeper understanding of how these behaviors shape conversations might offer key insights into the design of technologies such as computer-mediated communication systems and embodied conversational agents.",
        "In an exploratory study, we used a stepwise regression approach to model the relationships between various types of addressee backchannels and speaker behaviors in a storytelling scenario.",
        "We found that gaze significantly predicted all types of backchannel behaviors including verbal, nonverbal, and bimodal backchannels.",
        "Our results also showed that speech, speaker nods, and pitch variability predicted some types of backchannel behaviors.",
        "While these results have some limitations due to our methodological choices, they suggest directions for future work and offer preliminary insights toward a deeper understanding of backchannel behaviors and how interactive systems and communication technologies might be designed to support these behaviors."
