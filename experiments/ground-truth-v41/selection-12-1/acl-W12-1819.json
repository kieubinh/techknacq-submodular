        "For years, research has been focused on enabling Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) to behave more adaptively to the user's expectations and needs.",
        "Mo?ller et al. (2009) presented a taxonomy for quality of human-machine interaction, i.e., Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE).",
        "For QoE, several aspects are identified.",
        "They contribute to good user experience, e.g., interaction quality, usability and acceptability.",
        "These aspects can be combined to the term User Satisfaction (US), describing the degree by which the user is satisfied with the system's performance.",
        "The dialogue community has been investigating this aspect for years.",
        "Most prominently is the PARADISE framework by Walker et al. (2000) which maps objective performance metrics of an SDS to subjective user ratings.",
        "Recent work mostly discusses how to evaluate Spoken Dialogue Systems.",
        "However, the issue of how this information can be useful for improving dialogue performance remains hardly addressed.",
        "Hence, we focus on exploring techniques for incorporating dialogue quality information into the Dialogue Manager (DM).",
        "This is accompanied by the problem of defining characteristics of a suitable dialogue quality metric.",
        "In Section 2, we present related work both on measuring dialogue quality and on approaches for incorporating user state information into the DM.",
        "In Section 3, requirements for a quality metric are presented along with a suitable example.",
        "Section 4 presents our ongoing and future work on incorporating quality measures into dialogue strategies.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes this work."

        "Engelbrecht et al. (2009) predicted User Satisfaction on a five-point scale at any point within the dialogue using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).",
        "Evaluation was based on labels the users applied themselves during a Wizard-of-Oz experiment.",
        "To guarantee for comparable conditions, the dialogue flow was controlled by predefined scenarios creating transcripts with equal length for each scenario.",
        "Further work based on HMMs was presented by Higashinaka et al. (2010).",
        "The HMM was trained on US rated at each exchange.",
        "These exchange ratings were derived from ratings for the whole dialogue.",
        "The authors compare their approach with HMMs trained on manually annotated exchanges achieving a better performance for the latter.",
        "In order to predict US, Hara et al. (2010) created n-gram models from dialogue acts (DA).",
        "Based on dialogues from real users interacting with a music retrieval system, overall ratings for the whole dialogue have been labeled on a five point scale after the interaction.",
        "An accuracy (i.e., rate of correctly predicted ratings) of 34% by a 3-gram model was the best performance which could be achieved.",
        "Dealing with true User Satisfaction, Schmitt et al. presented their work about statistical classification methods for automatic recognition of US (Schmitt et al., 2011b).",
        "The data was collected in a lab study where the users themselves had to rate the conversation during the ongoing dialogue.",
        "Labels were applied on a scale from 1 to 5.",
        "Performing automatic classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), they achieved an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 49.2 (i.e., average rate of correctly predicted ratings, compensated for unbalanced data).",
        "An approach for affective dialogue modeling based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) was presented by Bui et al. (2007).",
        "Adding stress to the dialogue state enables the dialogue manager to adapt to the user.",
        "To make belief-update tractable, the authors introduced Dynamic Decision Networks as means for reducing complexity.",
        "Pittermann et al. (2007) presented another approach for adaptive dialogue management.",
        "The authors incorporated emotions by modeling the dialogue in a semi-stochastic way.",
        "Thus, an emotional dialogue model was created as a combination of a probabilistic emotional model and probabilistic dialogue model defining the current dialogue state."

        "consistent labeling process, ?",

        "The performance of a Spoken Dialogue System may be evaluated either on the dialogue level or on the exchange level.",
        "As dialogue management is performed after each system-user exchange, dynamic adaption of the dialogue strategy to the dialogue performance requires exchange-level performance measures.",
        "Therefor, Dialogue-level approaches are of no use.",
        "Furthermore, previous presented methods for exchange-level quality measuring could not achieve satisfying accuracy in predicting dialogue quality (Engelbrecht et al., 2009; Higashinaka et al., 2010).",
        "Features serving as input variables for a classification algorithm must be automatically derivable from the dialogue system modules.",
        "This is important because other features, e.g., manually annotated dialogue acts (Higashinaka et al., 2010; Hara et al., 2010), produce high costs and are also not available immediately during runtime in order to use them as additional input to the Dialogue Manager.",
        "Furthermore, for creating a general quality metric, features have to be domain-independent, i.e., not depending on the task domain of the dialogue system.",
        "Another important issue is the consistency of the labels.",
        "Labels applied by the users themselves are subject to large fluctuations among the different users (Lindgaard and Dudek, 2003).",
        "As this results in inconsistent labels, which do not suffice for creating a generally valid quality model, ratings applied by expert raters yield more consistent labels.",
        "The experts are asked to estimate the user's satisfaction following previously established rating guidelines.",
        "Furthermore, expert labelers are also not prone to be influenced by certain aspects of the SDS, which are not of interest in this context, e.g., the character of the synthesized voice.",
        "Therefore, they create less biased labels."
