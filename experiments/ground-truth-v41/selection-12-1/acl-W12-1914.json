        "Unsupervised induction of word categories has been approached from three broad perspectives.",
        "First, it is of interest to cognitive scientists who model syntactic category acquisition by children (Redington et al. 1998, Mintz 2003, Parisien et al. 2008, Chrupa?a and Alishahi 2010), where the primary concern is matching human performance patterns and satisfying cognitively motivated constraints such as incremental learning.",
        "Second, learning categories has been cast as unsupervised part-of-speech tagging task (recent work includes Ravi and Knight (2009), Lee et al. (2010), Lamar et al. (2010), Christodoulopoulos et al. (2011)), and primarily motivated as useful for tagging under-resourced languages.",
        "Finally, learning categories has also been researched from the point of view of feature learning, where the induced categories provide an intermediate level of representation, abstracting away and generalizing over word form features in an NLP application (Brown et al. 1992, Miller et al. 2004, Lin and Wu 2009, Turian et al. 2010, Chrupala 2011, Ta?ckstro?m et al. 2012).",
        "The main difference from the part-of-speech setting is that the focus is on evaluating the performance of the learned categories in real tasks rather than on measuring how closely they match gold part-of-speech tags.",
        "Some researchers have used both approaches to evaluation.",
        "This difference in evaluation methodology also naturally leads to differing constraints on the nature of the induced representations.",
        "For part-of-speech tagging what is needed is a mapping from word tokens to a small set of discrete, atomic labels.",
        "For feature learning, there are is no such limitation, and other types of representations have been used, such as low-dimensional continuous vectors learned by neural network language models as in Bengio et al. (2006), Mnih and Hinton (2009), or distributions over word classes learned using Latent Dirichlet Allocation as in Chrupala (2011).",
        "In this paper we propose a simple method of mapping distributions over word classes to a set of discrete labels by hierarchically clustering word class distributions using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a distance metric.",
        "This allows us to effectively use the algorithm of Chrupala (2011) and similar ones in settings where using distributions directly is not possible or desirable.",
        "Equivalently, our approach can be seen as a generic method to convert a soft clustering to hard clustering while conserving much of the information encoded in the original soft cluster assignments.",
        "We evaluate this method on the unsupervised part-of-speech tagging task on ten datasets",
        "in nine languages as part of the shared task at the NAACL-HLT 2012 Workshop on Inducing Linguistic Structure."

      "text": [
        "We use the probabilistic soft word-class model proposed by Chrupala (2011), which is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).",
        "LDA was introduced by Blei et al. (2003) and applied to modeling the topic structure in document collections.",
        "It is a generative, probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model which induces a set of latent variables, which correspond to the topics.",
        "The topics themselves are multinomial distributions over words.",
        "The generative structure of the LDA model is the following:",
        "Chrupala (2011) interprets the LDA model in terms of word classes as follows: K is the number of classes, D is the number of unique word types, Nd is the number of context features (such as right or left neighbor) associated with word type d, znd is the class of word type d in the nthd context, and wnd is the nth d context feature of word type d. Hy-perparameters ?",
        "and ?",
        "control the sparseness of the vectors ?d and ?k.",
        "Inference in LDA in general can be performed using either variational EM or Gibbs sampling.",
        "Here we use a collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate two sets of parameters: the ?d parameters correspond to word class probability distributions given a word type while the ?k correspond to feature distributions given a word class.",
        "In the current paper we focus on ?d which we use to represent a word type d as a distribution over word classes.",
        "Soft word classes are more expressive than hard categories.",
        "They make it easy and efficient to express shared ambiguities: Chrupala (2011) gives an example of words used as either first names or surnames, where this shared ambiguity is reflected in the similarity of their word class distributions.",
        "Another important property of soft word classes is that they make it easy to express graded similarity between words types.",
        "With hard classes, a pair of words either belong to the same class or to different classes, i.e. similarity is a binary indicator.",
        "With soft word classes, we can use standard measures of similarity between probability distributions to judge how similar words are to each other.",
        "We take advantage of this feature to build a hierarchical clustering of word types."

        "The question then arises how to map a probability distribution over word classes corresponding to each word type in the soft word class setting to a discrete label.",
        "The most obvious method would be to simply output the highest scoring word class, but this has the disadvantage of discarding much of the information present in the soft labeling.",
        "What we do instead is to create a hierarchical clustering of word types using the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the word-class distributions as a distance function.",
        "JS divergence is an information-theoretic measure of dissimilarity between two probability distributions (Lin 1991).",
        "It is defined as follows:",
        "Unlike KL divergence, JS divergence is symmetric and is defined for any pair of discrete probability distributions over the same domain.",
        "We use a simple agglomerative clustering algorithm to build a tree hierarchy over the word class distributions corresponding to word types (see Algorithm 1).",
        "We start with a set of leaf nodes, one for each of D word types, containing the unnormalized word-class probabilities for the corresponding word type: i.e. the co-occurrence counts of word-type and word-class, n(z, d), output by the Gibbs sampler.",
        "We then merge that pair of nodes (P,Q) whose JS divergence is the smallest, remove these two nodes from the set, and add the new merged node with two branches.",
        "We proceed in this fashion until we obtain a single root node.",
        "When merging two nodes we sum their co-occurrence count tables: thus the nodes always contain unnormalized probabilities which are normalized only when computing JS scores.",
        "Algorithm 1 Bottom-up clustering of word types",
        "The algorithm is simple but not very efficient: if implemented carefully it can be at best quadratic in the number of word types.",
        "However, in practice it is unnecessary to run it on more than a few hundred word types which can be done very quickly.",
        "In the experiments reported on below we build the tree based only on the 1000 most frequent words.",

        "and the distributions associated with the current context features (?).",
        "Since preliminary experiments with token-level tagging were not successful, here we focus exclusively on type-level tagging.",
