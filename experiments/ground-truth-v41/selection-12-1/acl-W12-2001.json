        "The role of a tutor in a Socratic dialogue is to scaffold the material and present questions that ultimately lead the student to an ?A-ha!?",
        "moment.",
        "Numerous studies have illustrated the effectiveness of Socratic-style tutoring (VanLehn et al., 2007; Rose et al., 2001; Collins and Stevens, 1982); consequently recreating the behav-ior on a computer has long been a goal of research in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS).",
        "Recent successes have shown the efficacy of conversational ITS (Graesser et al., 2005; Litman and Silliman, 2004; Ward et al., 2011b), however these systems are still not as effective as human tutors, and much improvement is needed before they can truly claim to be Socratic.",
        "Furthermore, development and tuning of tutorial dialogue behavior requires significant human effort.",
        "While our overarching goal is to improve ITS by automatically learning tutorial dialogue strategies directly from expert tutor behavior, we focus on the crucial subtask of selecting follow-up questions.",
        "Although asking questions is only a subset of the overall tutoring process, it is still a complex process that requires understanding of the dialogue state, the student's ability, and the learning goals.",
        "This work frames question selection as a task of scoring and ranking candidate questions for a specific point in the tutorial dialogue.",
        "Since dialogue is a dynamic process with multiple correct possibilities, we do not restrict ourselves only to the moves and questions found in a corpus of transcripts.",
        "Instead we posit ?What if we had a fully automatic question generation system??",
        "and subsequently use candidate questions hand-authored for each dialogue context.",
        "To explore the mechanisms involved in ranking follow-up questions against one other, we pair these questions with judgments of quality from expert human tutors and extract surface form and dialogue-based features to train machine learning classification models to rank the appropriateness of questions for specific points in a dialogue.",
        "Our results show promise with our best question",
        "ranking models exhibiting performance on par with expert human tutors.",
        "Furthermore these experiments demonstrate the utility and importance of rich dialogue move annotation for modeling decision making in conversation and tutoring."

        "Learning tutorial dialogue policies from corpora is a growing area of research in natural language processing and intelligent tutoring systems.",
        "Past studies have made use of hidden Markov models (Boyer et al., 2009a) and reinforcement learning (Chi et al., 2010; Chi et al., 2009; Chi et al., 2008) to discover tutoring strategies.",
        "However, these approaches are typically optimized to maximize learning gains, and are not necessarily focused on replicating human tutor behavior.",
        "Other work has explored specific factors in questioning such as when to ask ?why?",
        "questions (Rose et al., 2003), provide hints (Tsovaltzi and Matheson, 2001), or insert discourse markers (Kim et al., 2000).",
        "There is also an expanding body of work that applies ranking algorithms toward the task of question generation (QG) using approaches such as over-generation-and-ranking (Heilman and Smith, 2010), language model ranking (Yao, 2010), and heuristics-based ranking (Agarwal and Mannem, 2011).",
        "While the focus of these efforts centers on issues of grammaticality, fluency, and content selection for automatic creation of standalone questions, we move to the higher level task of choosing context appropriate questions.",
        "Our work merges aspects of these QG approaches with the sentence planning tradition from natural language generation (Walker et al., 2001; Rambow et al., 2001).",
        "In sentence planning the goal is to select lexico-structural resources that encode communicative action.",
        "Rather than selecting representations, we use them directly as part of the feature space for learning functions to rank the questions?",
        "actual surface form realization.",
        "To our knowledge there has been no research in ranking the quality and suitability of questions within a tutorial dialogue context.",
        "Because questioning tactics depend heavily on the curriculum and choice of pedagogy, we ground our investigations within the context of the My Science Tutor (MyST) intelligent tutoring system (Ward et al., 2011b), a conversational virtual tutor designed to improve science learning and understanding for students in grades 3-5 (ages 8-11).",
        "Students using MyST investigate and discuss science through natural spoken dialogues and multimedia interactions with a virtual tutor named Marni.",
        "The MyST dialogue design and tutoring style is based on a pedagogy called Questioning the Author (QtA) (Beck et al., 1996) which emphasizes open-ended questions and keying in on student language to promote self-explanation of concepts, and its curriculum is based on the Full Option Science System (FOSS) 1 a proven system for inquiry based learning."

        "During a session tutors were responsible for accepting, overriding, and/or authoring system actions.",
        "Tutor wizards were also responsible for setting the current dialogue frame to indicate which of the learning goals was currently in focus.",
        "Students talked to MyST via microphone while MyST communicates using Text-to-Speech (TTS) in the WoZ setting.",
        "A typical MyST session revolves around a single FOSS lesson and lasts approximately 15 minutes.",
        "To obtain a dialogue transcript, tutor moves are taken directly from the system logfile, while student speech is manually transcribed from audio.",

        "To address this need we use the Dialogue Schema Unifying Speech and Semantics (DISCUSS) (Becker et al.,",
        "2011), a multidimensional dialogue move taxonomy that captures both the pragmatic and semantic interpretation of an utterance.",
        "Instead of using one label, a DISCUSS move is a tuple composed of three dimensions: Dialogue Act, Rhetorical Form, Predicate Type.",
        "Together these labels account for the action, function, and content of an utterance.",
        "This scheme draws from past work in task-oriented dialogue acts (Bunt, 2009; Core and Allen, 1997), tutorial act taxonomies (Pilkington, 1999; Tsovaltzi and Karagjosova, 2004; Buckley and Wolska, 2008; Boyer et al., 2009b) discourse relations (Mann and Thompson, 1986) and question taxonomies (Graesser and Person, 1994; Nielsen et al., 2008).",

        "Though the DISCUSS dialogue act layer seeks to replicate the learnings from other well-established taxonomies like DIT++ (Bunt, 2009) or DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997) wherever possible, the QtA style of pedagogy driving our tutoring sessions dictated the addition of two tutorial specific acts: marking and revoicing.",
        "A mark act highlights key words from the student's speech to draw attention to a particular term or concept.",
        "Like with marking, revoicing keys in on student language, but instead of highlighting specific words, a revoice act will summarize or refine the student's language to bring clarity to a concept.",
        "Rhetorical Form (22 tags): Although the dialogue act is useful for identifying the speaker's intent, it gives no indication of how the speaker is advancing the conversation.",

        "and ?Which one is the battery??.",
        "They would both be labeled with Ask dialogue acts, but they elicit two very different kinds of responses.",
        "The former, which elicits some form of description, would be labeled with a Describe rhetorical form, while the latter is seeking to Identify an object.",
