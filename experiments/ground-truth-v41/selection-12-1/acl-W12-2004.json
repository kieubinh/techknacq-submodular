        "Automated assessment (hereafter AA) systems of English learner text assign grades based on textual features which attempt to balance evidence of writing competence against evidence of performance errors.",
        "Previous work has mostly treated AA as a supervised text classification or regression task.",
        "A number of techniques have been investigated, including cosine similarity of feature vectors (Attali and Burstein, 2006), often combined with dimensionality reduction techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 2003), and generative machine learning models (Rudner and Liang, 2002) as well as discriminative ones (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).",
        "As multiple factors influence the linguistic quality of texts, such systems exploit features that correspond to different properties of texts, such as grammar, style, vocabulary usage, topic similarity, and discourse coherence and cohesion.",
        "Cohesion refers to the use of explicit linguistic cohesive devices (e.g., anaphora, lexical semantic relatedness, discourse markers, etc.)",
        "within a text that can signal primarily suprasentential discourse relations between textual units (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "Cohesion is not the only mechanism of discourse coherence, which may also be inferred from meaning without presence of explicit linguistic cues.",
        "Coherence can be assessed locally in terms of transitions between adjacent clauses, parentheticals, and other textual units capable of standing in discourse relations, or more globally in terms of the overall topical coherence of text passages.",
        "There is a large body of work that has investigated a number of different coherence models on news texts (e.g., Lin et al. (2011), Elsner and Char-niak (2008), and Soricut and Marcu (2006)).",
        "Recently, Pitler et al. (2010) presented a detailed survey of current techniques in coherence analysis of extractive summaries.",
        "To date, however, few attempts have been made to develop new methods and validate existing ones for automatic evaluation of discourse coherence and cohesion in the noisy domain of learner texts, where spelling and grammatical errors are common.",
        "Coherence quality is typically present in marking criteria for evaluating learner texts, and it is iden",
        "tified by examiners as a determinant of the overall score.",
        "Thus we expect that adding a coherence metric to the feature set of an AA system would better reflect the evaluation performed by examiners and improve performance.",
        "The goal of the experiments presented in this paper is to measure the effect a number of (previously-developed and new) coherence models have on performance when combined with an AA system that achieves competitive results, but does not use discourse coherence features.",
        "Our contribution is threefold: 1) we present the first systematic analysis of several methods for assessing discourse coherence in the framework of AA of learner free-text responses, 2) we identify new discourse features that serve as proxies for the level of (in)coherence in texts and outperform previously developed techniques, and 3) we improve the best results reported by Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) on the publically available ?English as a Second or Other Language?",

(2011); AA is treated as a rank preference supervised learning problem and ranking Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Joachims, 2002) are used to explicitly model the grade relationships between scripts.",
        "This system uses a number of different linguistic features that achieve good performance on the AA task.",
        "However, these features only focus on lexical and grammatical properties, as well as errors within individual sentences, ignoring discourse coherence, which is also present in marking criteria for evaluating learner texts, as well as a strong indicator of a writer's understanding of a language.",
