        "The nature of factual information used in an essay has not so far been addressed, to our knowledge; yet a misleading premise, insufficient factual basis, or an example that flies in the face of the reader's knowledge clearly detract from an essay's quality.",

        "We propose a definition of fact, and an opera-tionalization thereof.",
        "We find that the proposed measure has positive medium-strength correlation with essay grade, which remains significant after the impact of essay length is factored out.",
        "In order to quantify which aspects of the measure drive the observed correlations, we gradually relax the measurement procedure, down to a simple and robust proxy measure.",
        "Surprisingly, we find that the correlations do not change throughout the relaxation process.",

        "2 What is a Fact?",
        "To help articulate the notion of fact, we use the following definition from a seminal text in argumentation theory: ?...",
        "in the context of argumentation, the notion of fact is uniquely characterized by the idea that is held of agreements of a certain type relating to certain data, those which refer to an objective reality, and, in Poincare's words, designate essentially ?what is common to several thinking beings, and could be common to all?",
        "(Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, 67).",
        "Factuality is thus a matter of selecting certain kinds of data and securing a certain type of agreement over those data.",
        "Of the different statements that refer to objective reality, the term facts is used to ?designate ob",
        "jects of precise, limited agreement?",
        "(Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, 69).",
        "These are contrasted with presumptions ?",
        "statements connected to what is normal and likely (ibid.).",
        "We suggest that the distinctions in the scope of the required agreement can be related to the referential device used in a statement: If the reference is more rigid (Kripke, 1980), that is, less prone to change in time and to indeterminacy of the boundaries, the scope of the necessary agreement is likely to be more precise and limited.",
        "With proper names prototypically being the most rigid designators, we will focus our efforts on statements about named entities.1 Perhaps the simplest model of the universal audience is an encyclopedia ?",
        "a body of knowledge that is verified by experts, and is, therefore, ?common to several thinking beings, and could be common to all?",
        "by virtue of the authority of the experts and the wide availability of the resource.",
        "However, many facts known to various groups of people that could be known to all are absent from any encyclo-pedia.",
        "The knowledge contained in the WWW at large, reaching not only statements explicitly contributed to an encyclopedia but also those made by people on their blogs ?",
        "is perhaps as close as it gets to a working model of the universal audience.",
        "Recent developments in Open Information Extraction make it possible to tap into this vast knowledge resource.",

        "We also investigated which of the components of the fact-use measure were responsible for the observed correlations.",
        "Specifically, we considered (a) the number instances of fact-use that were verified against a database of human-produced assertions, filtered for controversy and excessive diversity; (b) the number of instances of fact-use that were verified against the database, without subsequent filtering; (c) the number of instances of fact-use identified in an essay (without checking against the database); (d) the number of named entities used in an essay (without constructing queries around the entity).",
        "These steps correspond to a gradual relaxation of the full fact-checking procedure all the way to a proxy measure that counts the number of named entities.",
        "We observed similar correlations throughout the relaxation procedure.",
        "We therefore conclude that the number of named entities is the driving force behind the correlations, with no observed effect of the query construction and verification procedures.7 This result could be explained by two factors.",
        "First, a manual check of 500 queries showed that factual mistakes are rare ?",
        "only 2% of the queries corresponded to factually incorrect statements.",
        "Furthermore, mistakes were often accompanied by the 7While the trend is in the direction of an increase in Pearson correlations from (a) to (d), the differences are not statistically significant.",
        "test-taker's use of additional facts about the same entity which were correct; this might alleviate the impact of a mistake in the eyes of a grader.",
        "Second, the query verification procedure applied to only about 35% of the queries ?",
        "those for which at least one match was found in the database, that is, 65% of the queries could not be assessed using the database of 2 bln extractions.",
        "The verification procedure is thus much less robust than the procedure for detecting named entities, which performs at above >80% recall and precision."

        "Our results suggest that essays on a general topic written by adults for a high-stakes exam contain few incorrect facts, so the potential for a full fact-checking system to improve correlations with grades beyond merely detecting the potential for a factual statement using a named entity recognizer is not large.",
        "While a measure based on the number of ?verified?",
        "facts found in an essay demonstrated a significant correlation with human scores beyond the contribution of essay length, a simpler measure based only on the number of named entities in the essay demonstrated a similar relationship with human scores.",
        "Given the similarity in the two features?",
        "empirical usefulness, it would seem that the feature that counts the number of named entities in an essay is a better candidate, due to its simplicity and robustness.",
        "However, there is another perspective from which a feature based only on the number of named entities in an essay may be less suitable for use in scoring: the perspective of construct validity, the degree to which a test (or, in this case, a scoring system) actually measures what it purports to.",
        "As mentioned above, the number of named entities in an essay is, at best, a proxy measure,8 roughly indicative of the referencing of factual statements in support of an argument within an essay.",
        "Because the measure itself is not directly sensitive to how named entities are used in the essay, though, even entities with no connection to the essay topic would tend to contribute to the score, and the measure is therefore vulnerable to manipulation by test-takers.",
        "8For a discussion of proxes vs trins in essay grading, see (Page and Petersen, 1995).",
        "An obvious strategy to exploit this scoring mechanism would be to simply include more named entities in an essay, either interspersing them randomly throughout the text, or including them in long lists of examples to illustrate a single point.",
        "Such a blatant approach could potentially be detected by the use of a filter or advisory (Higgins et al., 2006; Landauer et al., 2003) designed to identify anomalous writing strategies.",
        "However, there could be more subtle approaches to exploiting such a feature.",
        "For example, it is possible that test-takers might be inclined to increase their use of named entities by adducing more facts in support of an argument, and would go beyond the comfort zone of their actual factual knowledge, thus making more factual mistakes.",
        "Test gaming strategies have been recognized as a threat to automated scoring systems for some time (Powers et al., 2001), and there is evidence based on test takers?",
        "own self-reported behavior that this threat is real (Powers, 2011).",
        "This is one major reason why large-scale operational testing programs (such as GRE or TOEFL) use automated essay scoring only in combination with human ratings.",
        "In sum, the degree to which a linguistic feature is predictive of human essay scores is not the only criterion for evaluation; the washback effects of using the feature (on writing be-havior and on instruction) must also be considered.",
        "The second finding of this study is that the effectiveness of fact-checking for essay assessment is compromised by the limited coverage of the wealth of factual statements made by essay writers, with only 35% of queries garnering any hits at all in a large general-purpose database of assertions.",
        "It is possible, however, that OpenIE technology can be used to collect more focused repositories on specific topics, such as the history of the American Civil War, which could be used to assess responses to tasks related to that particular subject matter.",
        "This is one of the directions of our future research."
