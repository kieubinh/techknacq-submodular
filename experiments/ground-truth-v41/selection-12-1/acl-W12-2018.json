        "Students provide their responses to tutor's requests by typing or speaking their responses.",
        "Therefore, in dialogue-based tutoring systems understanding students?",
        "natural language input becomes a crucial step towards building an accurate student model, i.e. assessing the student's level of understanding, which in turn is important for optimum feedback and scaffolding and ultimately impacts the tutoring's effectiveness at inducing learning gains on the student user.",
        "We adopt a semantic similarity approach to assess students?",
        "natural language input in intelligent tutoring systems.",
        "The semantic similarity approach to language understanding derives the meaning of a target text, e.g. a student sentence, by comparing it with another text whose meaning is known.",
        "If the target text is semantically similar to the known-meaning text then we know the target's meaning as well.",
        "Semantic similarity is one of the two major approaches to language understanding, a central topic in Artificial Intelligence.",
        "The alternative approach is full understanding.",
        "The full understanding approach is not scalable due to prohibitive costs to encode world and domain knowledge which are needed for full understanding of natural language.",
        "To illustrate the problem of assessing natural language student input in dialogue-based tutoring systems using a semantic similarity approach, we consider the example below from experiments with AutoTutor (Graesser et al., 2005), a dialogue-based tutoring system.",
        "Expert Answer: The force of the earth's gravity, being vertically down, has no effect on the object's horizontal velocity Student Input: The horizontal component of motion is not affected by vertical forces In this example, the student input, also called contribution, is highly similar to the correct expert answer, called expectation, allowing us to conclude that the student contribution is correct.",
        "A correct response typically triggers positive feedback from the tutor.",
        "The expert answer could also be an",
        "anticipated wrong answer, usually called a misconception.",
        "A student contribution similar to a misconception would trigger a misconception correction strategy.",
        "We model the problem of assessing natural language student input in tutoring systems as a paraphrase identification problem (Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "The student input assessment problem has been also modeled as a textual entailment task in the past (Rus & Graesser, 2006).",
        "Our novel method to assess a student contribution against an expert-generated answer relies on the compositionality principle and the sailor assignment algorithm that was proposed to solve the assignment problem, a well-known combinatorial optimization problem.",
        "The sailor assignment algorithm optimally assigns sailors to ships based on the fitness of the sailors?",
        "skills to the ships?",
        "needs [7, 8].",
        "In our case, we would like to optimally match words in the student input (the sailors) to words in the expert-generated answer (the ships) based on how well the words in student input (the sailors) fit the words in the expert answer (the ships).",
        "The fitness between the words is nothing else but their similarity according to some metric of word similarity.",
        "We use the WordNet word-to-word similarity metrics (Pedersen et al., 2004) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 2007).",
        "The methods proposed so far that rely on the principle of compositionality to compute the semantic similarity of longer texts have been primarily greedy methods (Corley & Mihalcea, 2005; Lintean & Rus, 2012).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, nobody proposed an optimal solution based on the principle of compositionality and word-to-word similarity metrics for the student input assessment problem.",
        "It is important to note that the optimal method proposed here is generally applicable to compute the similarity of any texts.",
        "We provide experimental results on two datasets provided to us by researchers developing two world-class dialogue-based tutoring systems: AutoTutor (Graesser et al., 2005) and iSTART (McNamara et al., 2004).",
        "Background It is beyond the scope of this work to offer an exhaustive overview of methods proposed so far to handle the task of assessing natural language student input in intelligent tutoring systems.",
        "We only describe next methods that are most relevant to our work.",
        "Assessing student's contributions in dialogue-based tutoring systems has been approached either as a paraphrase identification task (Graesser et al., 2005), i.e. the task was to assess how similar student contributions were to expert-generated answers, or as an entailment task (Rus & Graesser, 2006), in which case the task was to assess whether student contributions were entailed by expert-generated answers.",
        "The expert answers were assumed to be true.",
        "If a correct expert answer entailed a student contribution then the contribution was deemed to be true as well.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Landauer et al., 2007) has been used to evaluate student contributions during the dialog between the student by Graesser and colleagues (2005).",
        "In LSA the meaning of a word is represented by a reduced-dimensionality vector derived by applying an algebraic method, called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to a term-by-document matrix built from a large collection of documents.",
        "A typical dimensionality of an LSA vector is 300- 500 dimensions.",
        "To compute the similarity of two words the cosine of the word's corresponding LSA vector is computed, i.e. the normalized dot-product.",
        "A typical extension of LSA-based word similarity to computing the similarity of two sentences (or even larger texts) is to use vector algebra to generate a single vector for each of the sentences (by adding up the individual words?",
        "LSA vectors) and then compute the cosine between the resulting sentence vectors.",
        "Another approach proposed so far to compute similarities between individual words in the two sentences, greedily selects for each word its best match, and then sums the individual word-to-word similarities in order to compute the overall similarity score for the two sentences (Lintean & Rus, 2012).",
        "We do report results with LSA using the latter approach for comparison purposes.",
        "Another reason is that only the latter approach allows the application of the optimum matching method.",
        "Extending word-to-word similarity measures to sentence level and beyond has drawn increasing interest in the last decade or so in the Natural Language Processing community.",
        "The interest has been driven primarily by the creation of standardized data sets and corresponding shared",
        "task evaluation campaigns (STECs) for the major text-to-text semantic relations of entailment (RTE; Recognizing Textual Entailment corpus by Dagan, Glickman, & Magnini, 2005), paraphrase (MSR; Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus by Dolan, Quirk, and Brockett, 2004), and more recently for elaboration (ULPC; User Language Paraphrase Challenge by McCarthy & McNamara, 2008).",

        "), we can extend the word-to-word similarity metrics to compute the similarity of longer texts, e.g. of sentences.",
        "In our work, we use a set of WordNet-based similarity metrics as well as LSA.",
        "We used the following similarity measures implemented in the WordNet::Similarity package and described in (Pedersen et al., 2004): LCH (Leacock and Chodorow), RES (Resnik), JCN (Jiang and Conrath), LIN (Lin), PATH, and WUP (Wu and Palmer).",
        "Some measures, e.g.",
        "PATH, are path-based, i.e. use paths of lexico-semantic relations between concepts in WordNet, while some others are gloss-based, that is, they use the text of the gloss or the definition of a concept in WordNet as the source of meaning for the underlying concept.",
        "One challenge with the WordNet word-to-word relatedness measures is that they cannot be directly applied to larger texts such as sentences.",
        "They must be extended to larger texts, which we did as described later.",
        "Another challenge with the WordNet word-to-word similarity metrics is the fact that texts express meaning using words and not concepts.",
        "To be able to use the word-to-word related measures we must map words in sentences to concepts in WordNet.",
        "Thus, we are faced with a word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem.",
        "It is beyond the scope of our investigation to fully solve the WSD problem, one of the hardest in the area of Natural Language Processing.",
        "Instead, we addressed the issue in two ways: (1) mapped the words in the student contribution and expert answer onto the concepts corresponding to their most frequent sense, which is sense #1 in WordNet, and (2) map the words onto all the concepts corresponding to all the senses and then take the maximum of the relatedness scores for each pair of senses.",

        "The maximum similarity score between words in T1 and any word in T2 is greedily retained regardless of the best matching scores of the other words in T1.",
        "The greedily-obtained scores are added up using a simple or weighted sum which can then be normalized in different ways, e.g. by dividing to the longest text or to the average length of the two texts.",

        "In this paper, we do a simple non-weighted sum, i.e. all the words are equally-weighted with a weight of 1.",

        "To illustrate the difference between the two methods, we use the two sentence fragments shown in Figure 1.",
        "A greedy method would pair motion with motion (similarity score of 1.00) as that is the maximum similarity between motion and any word in the opposite sentence and acceleration is paired with speed (similarity score of 0.69) for a total score of 1.69 (before normalization).",
