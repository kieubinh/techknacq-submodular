        "The task of detecting and correcting writing errors made by learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) has recently become a focus of research.",
        "The majority of previous papers in this area have presented machine learning methods with models being trained on well-formed native English text (Eeg-Olofsson and Knutsson, 2003; De Felice and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2003; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Tetreault et al., 2010).",
        "However, some recent approaches have explored ways of using annotated non-native text either by incorporating error-tagged data into the training process (Gamon, 2010; Han et al., 2010), or by using native language-specific error statistics (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011).",
        "Both approaches show improvements over the models trained solely on well-formed native text.",
        "Training a model on error-tagged non-native text is expensive, as it requires large amounts of manually-annotated data, not currently publically available.",
        "In contrast, using native language-specific error statistics to adapt a model to a writer's first or native language (L1) is less restricted by the amount of training data.",
        "Rozovskaya and Roth (2010b; 2010c) show that adapting error corrections to the writer's L1 and incorporating artificial errors, in a way that mimics the typical error rates and confusion patterns of non-native text, improves both precision and recall compared to classifiers trained on native data only.",
        "The approach proposed in Rozovskaya and Roth (2011) uses L1-specific error correction patterns as a distribution on priors over the corrections, incorporating the appropriate priors into a generic Na?",
        "?ve Bayes (NB) model.",
        "This approach is both cheaper to implement, since it does not require a separate classifier to be trained for every L1, and more effective, since the priors condition on the writer's L1 as well as on the possible confusion sets.",
        "Some extant approaches have achieved good results on error detection.",
        "However, error correction is much harder and on this task precision remains",
        "low.",
        "This is a disadvantage for applications such as self-tutoring or writing assistance, which require feedback to the user.",
        "A high proportion of error-ful suggestions is likely to further confuse learners and/or non-native writers rather than improve their writing or assist learning.",
        "Instead a system which maximizes precision over recall returning accurate suggestions for a small proportion of errors is likely to be more helpful (Nagata and Nakatani, 2010).",
        "In section 2 we describe the data used for training and testing the systems we developed.",
        "In section 3 we describe the preprocessing of the ESL text undertaken to provide a source of features for the classifiers.",
        "We also discuss the feature types that we exploit in our classifiers.",
        "In section 4 we describe and report results for a high precision system which makes no attempt to generalize from training data.",
        "In section 5 we describe our approach to adapting multiclass NB classifiers to characteristic errors and L1s.",
        "We also report the performance of some of these NB classifiers on the training and test data.",
        "In section 6 we report the official results of all our submitted runs on the test data and also on the HOO training data, cross-validated where appropriate.",
        "Finally, we briefly discuss our main results, further work, and lessons learnt."

        "The Cambridge Learner Corpus1 (CLC) is a large corpus of learner English.",
        "It has been developed by Cambridge University Press in collaboration with Cambridge Assessment, and contains examination scripts written by learners of English from 86 L1 backgrounds.",
        "The scripts have been produced by language learners taking Cambridge Assessment's ESL examinations.",
        "The linguistic errors committed by the learners have been manually annotated using a taxonomy of 86 error types (Nicholls, 2003).",
        "Each error has been manually identified and tagged with an appropriate code, specifying the error type, and a suggested correction.",

        "The current version of the CLC contains about 20M words of error-annotated scripts from a wide variety of examinations.",
        "The HOO training and test datasets are drawn from the CLC.",
        "The training dataset is a reformatted 1000-script subset of a publically-available subset of CLC scripts produced by learners sitting the First Certficate in English (FCE) examination.3 This examination assesses English at an upper-intermediate level, so many learners sitting this exam still manifest a number of errors motivated by the conventions of their L1s.",
        "The CLC-FCE subcorpus was extracted, anonymized, and made available as a set of XML files by Yannakoudakis et al. (2011).4 The HOO training dataset contains scripts from FCE examinations undertaken in the years 2000 and 2001 written by speakers of 16 L1s.",
        "These scripts can be divided into two broad L1 typological groups, Asian (Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese) and European (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, Greek, Russian, Polish).",
        "The latter can be further subdivided into Slavic (Russian, Polish) and Romance.",
        "In turn, the Romance languages differ in typological relatedness with, for example, Portuguese and Spanish being closer than Spanish and French.",
        "Error coding which is not relevant to preposition or determiner errors has been removed from the training data so that only six error type annotations are retained for training: incorrect, missing or unnecessary determiners (RD, MD, UD) and prepositions (RT, MT, UT).",
        "One consequence of this reformatting is that the contexts of these errors often contain further errors of different types that are no longer coded.",
        "The idea is that errors should be considered in their natural habitat, and that correcting and copy-editing the surrounding text would create an artificial task.",
        "On the other hand, not correcting anything makes it difficult in some cases and nigh impossible in others to determine whether a given determiner or preposition is correct or not.",
        "The error-coding in the CLC in such cases (provided the writer's intent is deemed recoverable) depends not only on the original text, but also on the correction of nearby errors.",
        "Certain errors even appear as a direct result of correcting others: for instance, the phrase to sleep in tents has been corrected to to sleep in a tent in the CLC; this ends up as a ?correction?",
        "to to sleep in a tents in the HOO dataset.",
        "This issue is difficult to avoid given that the potential solutions are all labour-intensive (explicit indication of dependencies between error annotations, completely separate error annotation for different types of errors, or manual removal of spurious errors after extraction of the types of error under consideration), and we mention it here mainly to explain the origin of some surprising annotations in the dataset.",

        "The HOO test set consists of 100 responses to individual prompts from FCE examinations set between 1993 and 2009, also drawn from the CLC.",
        "As a side effect of removing the test data from the full CLC, we have discovered that the distribution of L1s, examination years and exam prompts is different from the training data.",
        "There are 27 L1s exemplified, a superset of the 16 seen in the HOO training data; about half are Romance, and the rest are widely distributed with Asian and Slavic languages less well represented than in the training data.",

        "The features used in our experiments are mainly motivated by the fact that lexical and grammatical features have been shown in previous work to be effective for error detection and correction.",
        "We believe RASP is an appropriate tool to use with ESL text because the PoS tagger deploys a well-developed unknown word handling mechanism, which makes it relatively robust to noisy input such as misspellings, and because the parser deploys a hand-coded grammar which indicates ungrammaticality of sentences and markedness of constructions and is encoded entirely in terms of PoS tag sequences.",

        "The results presented below are calculated using the evaluation tool provided by the organizers, implementing the scheme specified in the HOO shared task.",
        "The results on the test set, presented in Tables 7?9 are from the final official run after correction of errors in the annotation and score calculation scripts.",
        "The test set results for NB classifiers (Runs 1?",

        "Use of additional training data (Runs 6 and 7) improves recall, but does not improve precision.",
        "Adaptation to the input preposition improves precision as compared to the unadapted classifier for prepositions (Run 4), whereas training on the determiner-specific subsets improves precision for determiners (Run 3).",
        "However, generally these results are worse than the results of the similar classifiers on the training data subsets.",
        "We calculated the upper bound recall for our classifiers on the test data.",
        "The upper bound recall on the test data is 93.20 for recognition, and 86.39 for correction, given our confusion sets for both determiners and prepositions.",
        "However, the actual upper bound recall is 71.82, with upper bound recall on determiners at 71.74 and on prepositions at 71.90, because 65 out of 230 determiner errors, and 68 out of 243 preposition errors are not considered by our classifiers, primarily because when the parser fails to find a full analysis, the grammatical context is often not recovered accurately enough to identify missing input positions or relevant GRs.",
        "This is an inherent weakness of using only parser-extracted features from noisy and often ungrammatical input.",
        "Taking this into account, some models (Runs 1, 2, 6 and 7) achieved quite high recall.",
        "We suspect the considerable drop in precision is explained by the differences in the training and test data.",
        "The training set contains answers from learners of a smaller group of L1s from one examination year to a much more restricted set of prompts.",
        "The well-known weaknesses of generative NB classifiers may prevent effective exploitation of the additional information in the full CLC over the HOO training data.",
        "Experimentation with count weighting schemes and optimized interpolation of adapted priors may well be beneficial (Rennie et al., 2003)."
