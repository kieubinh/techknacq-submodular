        "There are numerous issues involved in defining what constitutes hate speech, which need to be resolved in order to annotate a corpus and develop a consistent language model.",
        "First, merely mentioning, or even praising, an organization associated with hate crimes does not by itself constitute hate speech.",
        "The name ?Ku Klux Klan?",
        "by itself is not hateful, as it may appear in historical articles, legal documents, or other legitimate communication.",
        "Even an endorsement of the organization does not constitute a verbal attack on another group.",
        "While one may hypothesize that such endorsements are made by authors who would also be comfortable with hateful language, by themselves, we do not consider these statements to be hate speech.",
        "For the same reason, an author's excessive pride in his own race or group doesn't constitute hate speech.",
        "While such boasting may seem offensive and likely to co-occur with hateful language, a disparagement of others is required to satisfy the definition.",
        "For example, the following sentence does not constitute hate speech, even though it uses the word ?Aryan?.",
        "And then Aryan pride will be true because humility will come easily to Aryans who will all by then have tasted death.",
        "On the other hand, we believe that unnecessary labeling of an individual as belonging to a group often should be categorized as hate speech.",
        "In the following example, hate is conveyed when the author unnecessarily modifies bankers and workers with ?jew?",
        "and ?white.?",
        "The next new item is a bumper sticker that reads: ?Jew Bankers Get Bailouts, White Workers Get Jewed!?",
        "These are only 10 cents each and require a minimum of a $5.00 order Unnecessarily calling attention to the race or ethnicity of an individual appears to be a way for an author to invoke a well known, disparaging stereotype.",
        "While disparaging terms and racial epithets when used with the intent to harm always constitute hateful language, there are some contexts in which such terms are acceptable.",
        "For example, such words might be acceptable in a discussion of the words themselves.",
        "For example: Kike is a word often used when trying to offend a jew.",
        "Sometimes such words are used by a speaker who belongs to the targeted group, and these may be hard to classify without that knowledge.",
        "For example: Shit still happenin and no one is hearin about it, but niggas livin it everyday.",
        "African American authors appear to use the ?N?",
        "word with a particular variant spelling, replacing ?er?",
        "with ?a?, to indicate group solidarity (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2011).",
        "Such uses must be distinguished from hate speech mentions.",
        "For our purposes, if the identity of the speaker cannot be ascertained, and if no orthographic or other contextual cues are present, such terms are categorized as hateful."
