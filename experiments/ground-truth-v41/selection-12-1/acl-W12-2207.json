        "Readability studies date back to the 1920's and have already spawned probably more than a hundred papers with research on the development of efficient methods to match readers and texts relative to their reading difficulty.",
        "During this period of time, several methodological trends have appeared in succession (reviewed in Klare (1963; 1984), DuBay (2004)).",
        "We can group these trends in three major approaches: the ?classic studies?, the ?structurocognitivist paradigm?",
        "and the ?AI readability?, a term suggested by Franc?ois (2011a).",
        "The classic period started right after the seminal work of Vogel and Washburne (1928) and Gray and Leary (1935) and is characterized by an ideal of simplicity.",
        "The models (readability formulas) proposed to predict text difficulty for a given population are kept simple, using multiple linear regression with two, or sometimes, three predictors.",
        "The predictors are simple surface features, such as the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence.",
        "The Flesch (1948) and Dale and Chall (1948) formulas are probably the best-known examples of this period.",
        "With the rise of cognitivism in psychological sciences in the 70's and 80?s, new dimensions of texts are highlighted such as coherence, cohesion, and other discourse aspects.",
        "This led some scholars (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979; Redish and Selzer, 1985) to adopt a critical attitude to classic readability formulas which could only take into account superficial features, ignoring other important aspects contributing to text difficulty.",
        "Kintsch and Vipond (1979) and Kemper (1983), among others, suggested new features for readability, based on those newly discovered text dimensions.",
        "However, despite the fact that the proposed models made use of more sophisticated features, they failed to outperform the classic formulas.",
        "It is probably not coincidental that after these attempts readability research efforts declined in the 90s.",
        "More recently, however, the development of efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems and the success of machine learning methods led to",
        "a resurgence of interest in readability as it became clear that these developments could impact the design and performance of readability measures.",
        "Several studies (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Feng et al., 2010) have used NLP-enabled feature extraction and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and have reported significant gains in performance, suggesting that the AI approach might be superior to previous attempts.",
        "Going beyond reports of performance which are often hard to compare due to a lack of a common gold standard, we are interested in investigating AI approaches more closely with the aim of understanding the reasons behind the reported superiority over classic formulas.",
        "AI readability systems use NLP for richer feature extraction and a machine learning algorithm.",
        "Given that the classic formulas are also statistical, is performance boosted because of the addition of NLP-enabled feature extraction or by better machine learning algorithms?",
        "In this paper, we report initial findings of three experiments designed to explore this question.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews previous findings in the field and the challenge of providing a uniform explanation for these findings.",
        "Section 3 gives a brief overview of prior work on French readability, which is the context of our experiments (evaluating the readability of French texts).",
        "Because there is no prior work comparing classic formulas with AI readablity measures for French, we first report the results of this comparison in Section 3.",
        "Then, we proceed with the results of three experiments (2-4), comparing the contributions of the AI enabled features with features used in classic formulas, different machine learning algorithms and the interactions of features with algorithms.",

        "Several readability studies in the past decade have reported a performance gain when using NLP-enabled features, language models, and machine learning algorithms to evaluate the reading difficulty of a variety of texts (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2010).",
        "A first explanation for this superiority would be related to the new predictors used in recent models.",
        "Classic formulas relied mostly on surface lexical and syntactic variables such as the average number of words per sentence, the average number of letters per word, the proportion of given POS tags in the text or the proportion of out-of-simple-vocabulary words.",
        "In the AI paradigm, several new features have been added, including language models, parse tree-based predictors, probability of discourse relations, estimates of text coherence, etc.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that these new features capture a wider range of readability factors thus bringing into the models more and, possibly, better information.",
        "However, the evidence from comparative studies is not consistent on this question.",
        "In several cases, AI models include features central to classic formulas which, when isolated, appear to be the stronger predictors in the models.",
        "An exception to this trend is the work of Pitler and Nenkova (2008) who reported non-significant correlation for the mean number of words per sentence (r = 0.1637, p = 0.3874) and the mean number of characters per word (r = ?0.0859, p = 0.6519).",
        "In their study, though, they used text quality rather than text difficulty as the dependent variable.",
        "The data consisted solely of text from the Wall Street Journal which is ?intended for an educated adult audience?",
        "text labelled for degrees of reading fluency.",
        "Feng et al. (2010) compared a set of similar variables and observed that language models performed better than classic formula features but classic formula features outperformed those based on parsing information.",
        "Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005) found that the classic type-token ratio or number of words not in the 3000- words Dale list appeared to perform better than their language model on a corpus from readers, but were poorer predictors on web-extracted texts.",
        "In languages other than English, Franc?ois (2011b) surveyed a wide range of features for French and reports that the feature that uses a limited vocabulary list (just like in some classic formulas) has a stronger correlation with reading difficulty that a un-igram model and the best performing syntactic feature was the average number of words per sentences.",
        "Aluisio et al. (2010), also, found that the best corre",
        "late with difficulty was the average number of words per sentence.",
        "All in all, while there is sufficient evidence that the AI paradigm outperforms the classis formulas, classic features have often been shown to make the single strongest predictors.",
        "An alternative explanation could be that, by comparison to the simpler statistical analyses that determined the coefficients of the classic formulas, machine learning algorithms, such as support machine vector (SVM) or logistic regression are more sophisticated and better able to learn the regularities in training data, thus building more accurate models.",
        "Work in this direction has been of smaller scale but already reporting inconsistent results.",
        "Heilman et al. (2008) considered the performance of linear regression, ordinal and multinomial logistic regression, and found the latter to be more efficient.",
        "However, Kate et al. (2010) obtained contradictory findings, showing that regression-based algorithms perform better, especially when regression trees are used for bagging.",
        "For French, Franc?ois (2011b) found that SVMs were more efficient than linear regression, ordinal and multinomial logistic regression, boosting, and bagging.",
        "Finally, it is quite possible that there are interactions between types of features and types of statistical algorithms and these interactions are primarily responsible for the better performance.",
        "In what follows, we present the results of three studies (experiments 2-4), comparing the contributions of the AI enabled features with features used in classic formulas, different machine learning algorithms and the interactions of features with algorithms.",
        "As mentioned earlier, all the studies have been done on French data, consisting of text extracted from levelled FFL textbooks (French as Foreign Language).",

        "FFL-specific formulas are optimized for English-speaking learners of French while our dataset is agnostic to the native language of the learners.",
        "The computation of the Kandel and Moles (1958) formula requires a syllabification system for French.",
        "Due to unavailability of such a system for French, we adopted a hybrid syllabification method.",
        "For words included in Lexique (New et al., 2004), we used the gold syllabification included in the dictionary.",
        "For all other words, we generated API phonetic representations with espeak 1, and then applied the syllabification tool used for Lexique3 (Pallier, 1999).",
        "The accuracy of this process exceeded 98%.",

        "The difficulty levels are defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001) as follows: A1 (Breakthrough); A2 (Waystage); B1 (Threshold); B2 (Vantage); C1 (Effective Operational Proficiency) and C2 (Mastery).",
        "The test corpus includes 68 texts per level, for a total of 408 documents (see Table 1).",

        "We tried three approaches to achieve this task.",

        "(-20 to 10).",
        "Collapsing the ?difficult?",

        "categories into one, we were able to roughly match this scale with the A1-C2 scale.",
        "The second method was similar, except that those levels were mapped on the values from the original Flesch scale instead of the one adapted for French.",
        "The third approach was to estimate normal distribution parameters ?j and ?j for each level j for the Kandel and Moles?",
        "formula output scores obtained on our corpus.",
        "The class membership of a given observation i was then computed as follows: arg",
        "Since the parameters were trained on the same corpus used for the evaluation, this computation should yield optimal class membership thresholds for our data.",
        "Given the limitations of all three approaches, it is not surprising that accuracy scores were very low: 9% for the first and 12% for the second, which is worse than random (16.6%).",
        "The third approach gave a much improved accuracy score, 33%, but still quite low.",
        "The problem is that, in a continuous formula, predictions that are very close to the actual will be classified as errors if they fall on the wrong side of the cut off threshold.",
        "These results are, in any case, clearly inferior to the AI formula based on SVM, which classified correctly 49% of the texts.",
        "A more suitable evaluation measure for a continuous formula would be to compute the multiple correlation (R).",
