        "Early primary children's literature poses some interesting challenges for automated readability assessment: for example, teachers often use fine-grained reading leveling systems for determining appropriate books for children to read (many current systems approach readability assessment at a coarser whole grade level).",
        "In previous work (Ma et al., 2012), we suggested that the fine-grained assessment task can be approached using a ranking methodology, and incorporating features that correspond to the visual layout of the page improves performance.",
        "However, the previous methodology for using ?found?",
        "text (e.g., scanning in a book from the library) requires human annotation of the text regions and correction of the OCR text.",
        "In this work, we ask whether the annotation process can be automated, and also experiment with richer syntactic features found in the literature that can be automatically derived from either the human-corrected or raw OCR text.",
        "We find that automated visual and text feature extraction work reasonably well and can allow for scaling to larger datasets, but that in our particular experiments the use of syntactic features adds little to the performance of the system, contrary to previous findings."

        "Knowing the reading level of a children's book is an important task in the educational setting.",
        "Teachers want to have leveling for books in the school library; parents are trying to select appropriate books for their children; writers need guidance while writing for different literacy needs (e.g. text simplification)?reading level assessment is required in a variety of contexts.",
        "The history of assessing readability using simple arithmetic metrics dates back to the 1920s when Thorndike (1921) has measured difficulty of texts by tabulating words according to the frequency of their use in general literature.",
        "Most of the traditional readability formulas were also based on countable features of text, such as syllable counts (Flesch, 1948).",
        "More advanced machine learning techniques such as classification and regression have been applied to the task of reading level prediction (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Feng et al., 2010); such works are described in further detail in the next Section 2.",
        "In recent work (Ma et al., 2012), we approached the problem of fine-grained leveling of books, demonstrating that a ranking approach to predicting reading level outperforms both classification and regression approaches in that domain.",
        "A further finding was that visually-oriented features that consider the visual layout of the page (e.g. number of text lines per annotated text region, text region area compared to the whole page area and font size etc.)",
        "play an important role in predicting the reading levels of children's books in which pictures and textual layout dominate the book content over text.",
        "However, the data preparation process in our previous study involves human intervention?we ask human annotators to draw rectangle markups around text region over pages.",
        "Moreover, we only use a very shallow surface level text-based feature set to",
        "compare with the visually-oriented features.",
        "Hence in this paper, we assess the effect of using completely automated annotation processing within the same framework.",
        "We are interested in exploring how much performance will change by completely eliminating manual intervention.",
        "At the same time, we have also extended our previous feature set by introducing a richer set of automatically derived text-based features, proposed by Feng et al. (2010), which capture deeper syntactic complexities of the text.",
        "Unlike our previous work, the major goal of this paper is not trying to compare different machine learning techniques used in readability assessment task, but rather to compare the performance differences between with and without human labor involved within our previous proposed system framework.",
        "We begin the paper with the description of related work in Section 2, followed by detailed explanation regarding data preparation and automatic annotations in Section 3.",
        "The extended features will be covered in Section 4, followed by experimental analysis in Section 5, in which we will compare the results between human annotations and automatic annotations.",
