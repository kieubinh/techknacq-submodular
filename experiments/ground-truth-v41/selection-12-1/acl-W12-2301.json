        "Although DAs are historically related to MSA, there are many phonological, morphological and lexical differences between them.",
        "Unlike MSA, DAs have no standard orthographies or language academies.",
        "Furthermore, different DAs, such as Egyptian Arabic (henceforth, EGY), Levantine Arabic or Moroccan Arabic have important differences among them similar to those seen among Romance languages (Erwin, 1963; Cowell, 1964; Abdel-Massih et al., 1979; Holes, 2004).",
        "Most tools and resources developed for natural language processing (NLP) of Arabic are designed for MSA.",
        "Such resources are quite limited when it comes to processing DA, e.g., a state-of-the-art MSA morphological analyzer has been reported to only have 60% coverage of Levantine Arabic verb forms (Habash and Rambow, 2006).",
        "Most efforts to address this gap have been lacking.",
        "Some have taken a quick-and-dirty approach to model shallow morphology in DA by extending MSA tools, resulting in linguistically inaccurate models (Abo Bakr et al., 2008; Salloum and Habash, 2011).",
        "Others have attempted to build linguistically accurate models that are lacking in coverage (at the lexical or inflectional levels) or focusing on representations that are not readily usable for NLP text processing, e.g., phonological lexicons (Kilany et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper we present the Columbia Arabic Language and dIalect Morphological Analyzer (CALIMA) for EGY.1 We built this tool by extending an existing resource for EGY, the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lexicon (ECAL) (Kilany et al., 2002).",

        "Altantawy et al. (2011) characterize the various approaches explored for Arabic and Semitic computational morphology as being on a continuum with two poles: on one end, very abstract and linguistically rich representations and morphological rules are used to derive surface forms; while on the other end, simple and shallow techniques focus on efficient search in a space of precompiled (tabulated) solutions.",
        "The first type is typically implemented using finite-state technology and can be at many different degrees of sophistication and detail (Beesley et al., 1989; Kiraz, 2000; Habash and Rambow, 2006).",
        "The second type is typically implemented using hash-tables with a simple search algorithm.",
        "Examples include the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004), its Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA) (Graff et al., 2009) incarnation, and their generation-oriented extension, ALMOR (Habash, 2007).",
        "These systems do not represent the morphemic, phonological and orthographic rules directly, and instead compile their effect into the lexicon itself, which consists of three tables for prefixes, stems and suffixes and their compatibilities.",
        "A prefix or suffix in this approach is a string consisting of all the word's prefixes and suffixes, respectively, as a single unit (including null affix sequences).",

        "The second camp is interested in modeling DA directly.",
        "However, the attempts at doing so are lacking in coverage in one dimension or another.",
        "The earliest effort on EGY that we know of is the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lexicon (ECAL) (Kilany et al., 2002).",
        "It was developed as part of the CALLHOME Egyptian Arabic (CHE) corpus (Gadalla et al., 1997) which contains 140 telephone conversations and their transcripts.",
        "The lexicon lists all of the words appearing in the CHE corpus and provides phonological, orthographic and morphological information for them.",
        "This is an important resource; however, it is lacking in many ways: the orthographic forms are undiacritized, no morpheme segmentations are provided, and the lexicon has only some 66K fully inflected forms and as such lacks general morphological coverage.",

        "Although this approach has a lot of potential, in practice, it is closer to the first camp in its results since they used MSA lexicons as a base.",
