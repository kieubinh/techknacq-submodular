        "The Semitic languages, especially Arabic, are linguistically interesting for a number of reasons, and are attracting more and more attention for both linguistic and socio-political reasons.",
        "One of the aspects of Arabic that makes it particularly interesting to linguists, namely the morphological complexity, is at once both appealing and the source of potential practical problems.",
        "It is appealing to linguists, for whom it offers interesting challenges in their descriptive frameworks, but for builders of NLP applications, it represents a significant challenge.",
        "In this paper, we are particularly interested in the derivational aspects of the morphology, whereby verb stems are derived from triliteral roots in well defined formal ways, and with varying degrees of regularity in the meanings of those derived forms.",
        "Another aspect of the Arabic language that makes it both interesting and challenging is the fact that it is not actually a single language.",
        "There are many varieties of Arabic, with rather different status.",
        "Classical Arabic (CA) is the language of the Koran, and the historical ancestor of the other varieties.",
        "Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the modern version of CA and is, broadly speaking, the universal (i.e. not regional) standard variety of Arabic.",
        "Until recently, CA and MSA were the only varieties that were written ?",
        "other, regional, varieties were only spoken.",
        "The situation is rapidly changing, with electronic communication increasingly involving written versions of the regional varieties.",
        "Even in traditional written forms, such as news reports, the vocabulary used in different geographical regions is different.",
        "For example, Khoja (2001) found that the percentage of out of vocabulary items in news reports from Egypt and Qatar was around double that found in Saudi news reports, Saudi Arabic being much closer to MSA than the other two regional varieties.",
        "Ways in which the present approach may assist in this problem will be discussed later.",
        "The approach we describe here depends on a hierarchically organised lexicon, based on the DATR lexical representation language (Evans and Gazdar, 1996).",
        "The PolyLex lexical framework (Cahill and Gazdar, 1999) was developed originally with languages like English, German and Dutch in mind, but has been shown to lend itself to the description of Arabic templatic morphology (Cahill, 2007, 2010).",
        "The inheritance of information by default in this framework is fundamental to the approach we describe.",
        "The problem to which we seek a solution is not one unique to Arabic.",
        "Any NLP system which wants to",
        "process naturally occurring text will always have to deal to some degree with the problem of unknown or out of vocabulary (OOV) items.",
        "Whether these items are neologisms, errors or names, they need to be handled in some way.",
        "Solutions to this particular problem are unlikely to have a large statistical impact on the success rates of the processing applications, but that does not mean that they are not worth finding.",
        "While it is undoubtedly the case that many applications will work perfectly well with a word recognition rate of, say, 95%, supported by statistical approaches which provide syntactic information, there are other applications for which full semantic interpretation is desirable, if not necessary.",
        "It is such applications that the current paper addresses.",
        "We are only addressing a part of the problem, as this approach does not help recognise names or errors.",
        "The particular approach described in this paper is based on the observation that a native speaker who encounters a word they have not seen before may, if that word is related to others that they do know, be able to make an educated guess at not only the syntactic category, but also the meaning of that word.",
        "To a large degree, that guesswork involves the specific context that the word occurs in, but native speakers will also have more abstract structural knowledge about their language which allows them to make guesses about words on the basis of their internal structure.",
        "For example, if an English speaker knows the word ?confuse?",
        "and hears the word ?confuser?, even though they have most likely never before come across the latter, they will be able to at least guess that it means ?someone/thing that confuses?.",
        "Of course, with derivation the meaning relationship is not always transparent.",
        "So a person encountering the word ?decider?",
        "for the first time may be surprised to find that it does not mean ?one who decides?",
        "but rather a deciding match/game etc..",
        "Such issues and other limitations of this approach will be discussed later."

        "The work by Habash and Rambow, for example, employs a form of morphological expansion to handle OOV items, but only makes use of the inflectional morphology of Arabic, not the derivational morphology as in the current approach.",
        "Other approaches to morphological analysis in Arabic include methods to deal with OOV items.",
        "For example, Beesley and Karttunen (2003), describe a two-level approach which includes a general method for guessing OOV words which could certainly apply to some degree to Arabic, but it would not be able to take into account the linguistic (specifically semantic) information which is at the heart of the present approach."

        "Therefore, aspects of these languages that were shared could be inherited by default by each language.",
        "In addition to the aspects of inter-and intra-language default inheritance, the other aspect of the PolyLex framework which contributes to the unknown word processing proposed here is the use of phonological structures, specifically syllables, to define morphological structures and relationships.",
