        "The latest discoveries on diseases and their diagnosis/treatment are mostly disseminated in the form of scientific publications.",

        "An important first step for any disease-related information extraction task in the biomedical literature is the disease mention recognition task.",
        "However, despite the strong interest, there has not been enough work done on disease name identification, perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate corpora.",
        "Towards this aim, we created a large-scale disease corpus consisting of 6900 disease mentions in 793 PubMed citations, derived from an earlier corpus.",

        "Identification of biomedical entities has been an active area of research in recent years (Rinaldi et al., 2011, Smith et al., 2008, Yeh et al., 2005).",
        "Automatic systems, both lexically-based and machine learning-based, have been built to identify medically relevant concepts and/or their relationships.",
        "Biomedical entity recognition research covers not only gene/protein mention recognition (Tanabe et al., 2005, Campos et al., 2012), but also other medically relevant concepts such as disease names, chemical/drug names, treatments, procedures etc.",
        "Systems capable of achieving high performance on these tasks are highly desirable as entity recognition precedes all other information extraction and text mining tasks.",
        "Disease information is sought very frequently in biomedical search engines.",
        "Previous PubMed log usage analysis (Islamaj Dogan et al., 2009) has shown that disease is the most frequent non-bibliographic information requested from PubMed users.",
        "Furthermore, disease information was often found to be queried together with Chemical/Drug or Gene/Protein information.",
        "Automatic recognition of disease mentions therefore, is essential not only for improving retrieval of relevant documents, but also for extraction of associations between diseases and genes or between diseases and drugs.",
        "However, prior research shows that automatic disease recognition is a challenging task due to variations and ambiguities in disease names (Leaman et al., 2009, Chowdhury and Lavelli 2010).",
        "Lexically-based systems of disease name recognition, generally refer to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Burgun and Bodenreider",
        "2008).",
        "UMLS is a comprehensive resource of medically relevant concepts and relationships and METAMAP(Aronson and Lang 2010) is an example of a natural language processing (NLP) system that provides reliable mapping of the text of a biomedical document to UMLS concepts and their semantic types.",
        "Machine learning systems, on the other hand, have been employed in order to benefit from the flexibility they allow over the rule-based and other statistical systems.",
        "However, machine learning systems are strongly dependent on the data available for their training; therefore a comprehensive corpus of examples representing as many variations as possible of the entity of interest is highly favorable.",
        "To our best knowledge, there is one corpus of disease mentions in MEDLINE citations developed by Leaman et al., 2009.",
        "This corpus, AZDC corpus, was inspired by the work of Jimeno et al., 2008 and its overall characteristics are given in Table 1.",
        "This corpus has been the study of at least two different groups in building automatic systems for disease name recognition in biomedical literature (Leaman et al., 2009, Chowdhury and Lavelli, 2010).",
        "They both reported F-scores around 80% in 10-fold cross-validation experiments.",
        "One common encountered difficulty in this domain is the fact that ?disease?",
        "as a category has a very loose definition, and covers a wide range of concepts.",
        "?Disease?",
        "is a broadly-used term that refers to any condition that causes pain, suffering, distress, dysfunction, social problems, and/or death.",
        "In UMLS, the ?disease?",
        "concept is covered by twelve different semantic types as shown in Table 2.",
        "The disease definition issue has been discussed extensively in other studies (Neveol et al., 2009, Neveol and Lu 2012).",
        "Disease mentions are also heavily abbreviated in biomedical literature (Yeganova et al., 2010).",
        "These abbreviations are not always standard; the same abbreviated form may represent different defining strings in different documents.",
        "It is therefore, unclear whether these ambiguities could be resolved by an abbreviation lookup list from UMLS Me-tathesaurus and other available databases.",
        "In this study, we present our efforts in improving the AZDC corpus by building a richer, broader and more complete disease name corpus.",
        "The NCBI corpus reflects a more representative view of what constitutes a disease name as it combines the decisions of twelve annotators.",
        "It also provides four different categories of disease mentions.",
        "Our work was motivated by the following observations: ?",
        "The need of a pool of experts: The AZDC corpus is the work of one annotator.",
        "While in terms of consistency this is generally a good thing, a pool of annotators guarantees a more representative view of the entity to be annotated and an agreement between annotators is preferred for categories with loose definitions such as ?disease?.",
        "Moreover, this would ensure that there would be fewer missed annotations within the corpus.",
        "?",
        "The need of annotating all sentences in a document: The AZDC corpus has disease mention annotations of selected sentences in a collection of PubMed abstracts.",
        "In order to be able to perform higher level text mining tasks that explore relationships between diseases and other types of information such as genes or drugs, the disease name annotation has to include all sentences, as opposed to selected ones.",
        "Our work is also related to other corpus annotation projects in the biomedical domain (Grouin et al., 2011, Tanabe at al., 2005, Thompson et al., 2009, Neveol at al., 2009, Chapman et al., 2012).",
        "These studies generally agree on the need of multiple experienced annotators for the project, the need of detailed annotation guidelines, and the need of large scale high-quality annotation corpora.",

        "disease mentions in the most common sense of the word, and is particularly relevant for biomedical information retrieval tasks that involve diseases.",
        "Annotations were performed for all sentences in a document, facilitating the future applications of complex information retrieval tasks connecting diseases to treatments, causes or other types of information.",
        "Annotation guidelines were designed with the goal of allowing flexible matching to UMLS concepts, while retaining true meaning of the tagged concept.",
        "A more detailed definition on what constitutes a disease name, accompanied with additional annotation rules, could help resolve some existing inconsistencies.",
        "The current corpus is reviewed several times by several annotators and describes a refined scale of annotation categories.",
        "It allows the separate definition and annotation of Composite mentions, Modifiers and distinguishes between Disease Class mentions versus Specific Diseases.",
        "The corpus is available for download1."
