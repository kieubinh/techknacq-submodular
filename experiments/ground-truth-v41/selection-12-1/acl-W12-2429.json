        "The average KL divergence scores in the table are roughly similar with the exception of the much lower score obtained for the gold-standard and uniform bias for the MSH-WSD corpus (0.0406).",
        "This is due to the fact that the MSH-WSD corpus was designed to have roughly the same number of examples for each sense, making the sense distribution close to uniform (Jimeno-Yepes et al., 2011).",
        "This is evident from the MFS scores for the MSH-WSD corpus which are always close to 50%.",
        "This also provides as explanation of why performance using automatically generated examples on the MSH-WSD corpus only improves by a small amount when the gold standard bias is used (see Table 1).",
        "The gold standard bias simply does not provide much additional information to the WSD system.",
        "The situation is different in the NLM-WSD corpus, where the MFS score is much higher.",
        "In this case the additional information available in the gold standard sense distribution is useful for the WSD system and leads to a large improvement in performance.",
        "In addition, this analysis demonstrates why performance does not improve when the bias generated from the MBR is used.",
        "The distributions which are obtained are different from the gold standard and are therefore mislead the WSD system rather than providing useful information.",
        "The difference between these distributions would be expected for",
        "the MSH-WSD corpus, since it contains roughly the same number of examples for each possible sense and does not attempt to represent the relative frequency of the different senses.",
        "However, it is surprising to observe a similar difference for the NLM-WSD corpus, which does not have this constraint.",
        "The difference suggests the information about CUIs in the MBR, which is generated automatically, has some limitations.",
        "Table 4 shows a similar analysis for the MSH-WSD corpus when abbreviations and terms are considered separately and supports this analysis.",
        "The figures in this table show that the gold standard and uniform distributions are very similar for both abbreviations and terms, which explains the similar results for UB and GSB in Table 2.",
        "However, the gold standard distribution is different from the one obtained from the MBR.",
        "The drop in performance of MMB compared with GBS in Table 2 is a consequence of this."
