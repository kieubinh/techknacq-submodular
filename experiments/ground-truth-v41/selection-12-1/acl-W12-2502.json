        "Although there are many reasons why some poems are included in prestigious anthologies and others are never read, such as a poet's fame, we assume that the main distinction between poems in well-known anthologies and poems submitted by amateurs to online forums is that expert editors perceive poems in the former category as more aesthetically pleasing.",
        "Given this assumption, we believe that the kind of comparison we propose should be the first step towards understanding how certain textual features might evoke aesthetic sensations more than others.",

        "A positive value for a coefficient increases the likelihood of a poem being written by a professional.",

        "A negative value for a coefficient decreases the likelihood of a poem being written by a professional.",

        "If the deeper meaning of a poem is conveyed through imagery, abstract words are no longer needed to reference concepts and experiences explicitly.",
        "Moreover, amateur poets use significantly more words concerned with generalizations, as shown in Table 6.",
        "While amateur poets embrace the human impulse to generalize, the skilled poet must learn to extract and report unique details that single out each experience from the rest.",
        "Overall, our results suggest that professional poets are more likely to show, while amateur poets have a tendency to tell.",
        "This difference marks the most significant distinction between contemporary professional and amateur poetry in our analysis and may be an essential aspect of craft and poetic beauty."

        "Categorizing poetry as professional or amateur is a rather coarse measure of quality.",
        "In order to identify defining features of more fine-grained levels of poetic skill, future work could compare award-winning poetry with poems written by less prestigious but also professionally trained poets.",
        "Experimenting with different databases and lexicons for affect and imagery could also be helpful, such as word-emotion associations (Mohammad & Turney, 2011) and imageability ratings (Coltheart, 1981).",
        "In addition, more sophisticated methods that consider sense ambiguities and meaning compositionality in affective words (Socher et al., 2011) should be applied to help enhance and improve upon our current analyses.",
        "While our approach reveals interesting patterns that shed light on elements of poetic sophistication, conclusions from the analysis need to be tested using controlled experiments.",
        "For example, does modifying a professional poem to include less concrete words make people perceive it as less beautiful?",
        "Investigating these questions using psychology experiments could help identify causal relationships between linguistic elements and sensations of poetic beauty.",
        "In summary, our framework provides a novel way to discover potential features of poetic beauty that can then be experimentally tested and confirmed.",
        "By applying both stylistic and content analyses to the quantitative assessment of contemporary poetry, we were able to examine poetic craft on a representative set of poems and reveal potential elements of skill and sophistication in modern poetry."
