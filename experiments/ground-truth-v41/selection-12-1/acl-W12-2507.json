        "Mark Twain famously said that ?the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.?",
        "Twain's quote is also about the importance of quotes.",
        "A great quote can come in handy when you are looking to inspire people, make them laugh or persuade people to believe in a particular point of view.",
        "Quotes are emblems that serve to remind us of philosophical or political stand-points, world views, perspectives that comfort or entertain us.",
        "Famous quotes such as ?Cogito ergo sum?",
        "(Descartes) and ?God is dead?",
        "(Nietzsche) occur millions of times on the Internet.",
        "The importance of quotes has motivated publishing houses to create and publish large collections of quotes.",
        "In this process, the editor typically spends years reading philosophy books, literature, and interviews to find good quotes, but this process is both expensive and cumbersome.",
        "In this paper, we consider the possibility of automatically learning what is a good quote, and what is not."

        "While there seems to have been no previous work on identifying quotes, the task is very similar to widely studied tasks such as topic classification, polarity classification, (lexical sample) word sense disambiguation (WSD) and authorship attribution.",
        "In most of these applications, texts are represented as bags-of-words, i.e. a text is represented as a vector x = ?x1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", xN ?",
        "where each xi encodes the presence and possibly the frequency of an n-gram.",
        "It is common to exclude stop words or closed class items such as pronouns and adpositions from the set of n-grams when constructing the bags-of-words.",
        "Sometimes lemmatization or word clustering is also used to avoid data sparsity.",
        "Topic classification is the classic problem in text classification of distinguishing articles on a particular topic from other articles on other topics, say sports from international politics and letters to the editor.",
        "Several resources exist for evaluating topic classifiers such as Reuters 20 Newsgroups.",
        "Common baselines are Naive Bayes, logistic regression, or SVM classifiers trained on bag-of-words representations of n-grams with stop words removed.",
        "While newspaper articles typically consist of tens or hundreds of sentences, famous quotes typically consist of one or two sentences, and it is interesting to compare quotation mining to work on applying topic classification techniques to short texts or sentences (Cohen et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005; Khoo et al., 2006).",
        "Cohen et al. (2003) and Khoo et al.",
        "(2006) classify sentences in email wrt.",
        "their role in discourse.",
        "Khoo et al. (2006) argue that extending a bag-of-words representation with frequency counts is meaningless in small text and restrict themselves to binary representations.",
        "They show empirically that excluding stop words and lemmatization",
        "both lead to impoverished results.",
        "We also observe that stop words are extremely useful for quotation mining.",
        "Polarity classification is the task of determining whether an opinionated text about a particular topic, say a user review of a product, is positive or negative.",
        "Polarity classification is different from quotation mining in that there is a small set of strong predictors of polarity (pivot features) (Wang et al., 2005; Blitzer et al., 2007), e.g. the polarity words listed in subjectivity lexica, including opinionated adjectives such as good or awful.",
        "The meaning of polarity words is context-sensitive, however, so context is extremely important when modeling polarity.",
        "Some quotes are expressions of opinion, and there has been some previous research on polarity classification in direct quotations (not famous quotes).",
        "Balahur et al. (2009) present work on polarity classification of newspaper quotations, for example.",
        "They use an SVM classifier on a bag-of-words representation of direct quotes in the news, but using only words taken from subjectivity lexica as features.",
        "Drury et al.",
        "(2011) present a strategy for polarity classification of direct quotations from financial news.",
        "They use a Naive Bayes classifier on a bag-of-words models of unigrams, but learn group-specific models for analysts and CEOs.",
        "WSD.",
        "The lexical sample task in WSD is the task of determining the meaning of a specific target word in context.",
        "Mooney (1996) argues that Naive Bayes classification and perceptron classifiers are particularly fit for lexical sample word sense disambiguation problems, because they combine weighted evidence from all features rather than select a subset of features for early discrimination.",
        "This of course also holds for logistic regression and SVMs.",
        "Whether a sentence is a good quotation or not also depends on many aspects of the sentence, and experiments on held-out data comparing Naive Bayes with decision tree-based learning algorithms, also mentioned in Sect.",
        "5, clearly demonstrated that early discrimination based on single features is a bad idea.",
        "In this respect, quotation mining is more similar to lexical sample WSD than to topic and polarity classification where there is a small set of pivot features.",
        "Authorship attribution is the task of determining which of a given set of authors wrote a particular text.",
        "One of the insights from authorship attribution",
        "is that stop words are important when you want to learn stylistic differences.",
        "Stylistic differences can be identified from the distribution of closed class words (Arun et al., 2009).",
        "As already mentioned, we observe the same holds for quotation mining.",
        "In conclusion, early-discrimination learning algorithms do not seem motivated for applications such as mining quotes where pivot features are hard to choose a priori.",
        "Furthermore, we hypothesize that it is better not to exclude stop words.",
        "Quotation mining can thus in our view be thought of as an application that is similar to sentence classification in that famous quotes are relatively small, and similar to authorship attribution in that style is an important predictor of whether a sentence is a famous quote."

        "Finally, logistic regression is less sensitive to parameter tuning than SVMs, so to avoid expensive parameter optimization we settled for logistic regression.",

        "To test the importance of stop words, we did experiments where stop words had been removed from the texts in advance.",
