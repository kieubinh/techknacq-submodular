        "We study then three ways of projecting summaries to a different language: projection through sentence alignment in the case of parallel corpora, simple summary translation and summarizing machine translated articles.",

        "Evaluation of automatically produced summaries in different languages is a challenging problem for the summarization community, because human efforts are multiplied to create model summaries for each language.",
        "Unavailability of parallel corpora suitable for news summarization adds even another annotation load because documents need to be translated to other languages.",
        "At the last TAC?11 campaign, six research groups spent a lot of work on creating evaluation resources in seven languages (Giannakopoulos et al., 2012).",
        "Thus compared to the monolingual evaluation, which requires writing model summaries and evaluating outputs of each system by hand, in the multilingual setting we need to obtain translations of all documents into the target language, write model summaries and evaluate the peer summaries for all the languages.",
        "In the last fifteen years, research on Machine Translation (MT) has made great strides allowing human beings to understand documents written in various languages.",
        "Nowadays, on-line services such as Google Translate and Bing Translator1 can translate text into more than 50 languages showing that MT is not a pipe-dream.",
        "In this paper we investigate how machine translation can be plugged in to evaluate quality of summarization systems, which would reduce annotation efforts.",
        "We also discuss projecting summaries to different languages with the aim to reinforce the evaluation procedure (e.g. obtaining additional peers for comparison in different language or studying their language-independence).",
        "This paper is structured as follows: after discussing the related work in section 2, we give a short overview of the TAC?11 multilingual pilot task (section 3).",
        "We compare average model and system manual scores and we also study ROUGE correlation to the manual scores.",

        "translation quality for language pairs used later in this study.",
        "Then we move on to the problem of projecting summaries to different languages in section 5.",
        "We discuss three approaches: projecting summary through sentence alignment in a parallel corpus, translating a summary, and summarizing translated source texts.",
        "Then, we try to answer the question whether using translated models produces similar system rankings as when using original models (section 6), accompanied by a discussion of discriminative power difference and cross-language model comparison."
