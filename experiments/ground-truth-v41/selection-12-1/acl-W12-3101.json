        "The value of machine translation depends on its utility to human users, either directly through their use of it, or indirectly through downstream tasks such as cross-lingual information extraction or retrieval.",
        "It is therefore essential to assess machine translation systems according to this utility, but there is a widespread perception that direct human assessment is costly, unreproducible, and difficult to interpret.",
        "Automatic metrics that predict human utility have therefore attracted substantial attention since they are at least cheap and reproducible given identical data conditions, though they are frequently and correctly criticized for low interpretability and correlation with true utility.",
        "Their use (and abuse) remains contentious.",
        "The organizers of the annual Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) have taken a strong stance in this debate, asserting the primacy of human evaluation.",
        "Every annual report of their findings since 2007 has included a variant of the following statement: It is our contention that automatic measures are an imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality.",
        "Therefore, we define the manual evaluation to be primary, and use the human judgments to validate automatic metrics.",
        "(Callison-Burch et al., 2011) The workshop's human evaluation component has been gradually refined over several years, and as a consequence it has produced a fantastic collection of publicly available data consisting primarily of pairwise judgements of translation systems made by human assessors across a wide variety of languages and tasks.",
        "Despite superb effort in the collection of these assessments, less attention has been focused on the final product derived from them: a totally-ordered ranking of translation systems participating in each task.",
        "Many of the official workshop results depend crucially on this ranking, including the evaluation of both machine translation systems and automatic metrics.",
        "Considering the enormous costs and consequences of the ranking, it is important to ask: is the method of constructing it accurate?",
        "The number of possible rankings is combinatorially large?",
        "with at least ten systems (accounting for more than",
        "half the cases we analyzed) there are over three million possible rankings, and with at least twenty (occurring a few times), there are over 1018 possible rankings.",
        "Exceptional care is therefore required in producing the rankings.",
        "Bojar et al. (2011) observed a number of discrepancies in the ranking of English-Czech systems from the 2010 workshop, making these questions ever more pressing.",
        "We extend their analysis in several ways.",
        "1.",
        "We show, through a logical extension of their reasoning about flaws in the evaluation, that the final ranking can be naturally cast as an instance of the minimal feedback arc set problem, a well-known NP-Hard problem.",
        "2.",
        "We analyze 25 tasks that were evaluated using pairwise assessments from human annotators in 2010 and 2011.",
        "3.",
        "We produce new rankings for each of the tasks, which are in some cases surprisingly different from the published rankings.",
        "4.",
        "We identify a new set of concerns about sources of error and uncertainty in the data.",
        "2 Human Assessment as Pairwise Ranking",
        "The workshop has conducted a variety of different manual evaluation tasks over the last several years, but its mainstay has been the relative ranking task.",
        "Assessors are presented with a source sentence followed by up to five translations, and are asked to rank the translations from best to worst, with ties allowed.",
        "Since it is usually infeasible to collect individual judgements for all sentences for all pairs of systems on each task, consecutive sequences of three sentences were randomly sampled from the test data, with each sentence in each sequence presented to the same annotator.",
        "Some samples were presented multiple times to the same assessor or to multiple assessors in order to measure intra-and inter-annotator agreement rates.",
        "Since there are often more than five systems participating in the campaign, the candidate translations are likewise sampled from a pool consisting of the machine translations and a human reference translation, which is included for quality",
        "a single sentence from the WMT 2010 German-English campaign.",
        "control purposes.",
        "It is important to note that the algorithm used to compute the published final rankings included all of this data, including comparisons against the reference and the redundant assessments used to compute inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The raw data obtained from this process is a large set of assessments.",
        "Each assessment consists of a list of up to five systems (including the reference), and a partial or total ordering of the list.",
        "The relative ranking of each pair of systems contained in the list is then taken to be their pairwise ranking.",
        "Hence a single assessment of five systems yields ten implicit pairwise rankings, as illustrated in Figure 1."

        "Given these pairwise rankings, the question now becomes: how do we decide on a total ordering of the systems?",
        "In the WMT evaluation, this total ordering has two critical functions: it is published as the official ranking of the participating systems; and it is used as the ground truth against which automatic evaluation metrics are graded, using Spear-man's rank correlation coefficient (without ties) as the measure of accuracy.",
        "Choosing a total order is non-trivial: there are N !",
        "possible orderings of N systems.",
        "Even with relatively small N of the workshop, this number can grow extremely large (over 1025 in the worst case of 25 systems).",
        "The method used to generate the published rankings is simple.",
        "For each system A among the set S of ranked systems (which includes the reference),",
        "compute the number of times that A is ranked better than or equivalent to any system B ?",
        "S, and then divide by the total number of comparisons involving A, yielding the following statistic for system A, which we call WMT-OFFICAL.",
        "The systems are ranked according to this statistic, with higher scores resulting in a better rank.",
        "Bojar et al. (2011) raise many concerns about this method for ranking the systems.",
        "While we refer the reader to their paper for a detailed analysis, we focus on two issues here: ?",
        "Since ties are rewarded, systems may be unduly rewarded for merely being similar to others, rather than clearly better.",
        "This is of particular concern since there is often a cohort of very similar systems in the pool, such as those based on very similar techniques.",
        "?",
        "Since the reference is overwhelmingly favored by the assessors, those systems that are more frequently compared against the reference in the random sample will be unfairly penalized.",
        "These observations suggest that the statistic should be changed to reward only outright wins in pairwise comparisons, and to lessen the number of comparisons to the reference.",
        "While they do not recommend a specific sampling rate for comparisons against the reference, the logical conclusion of their reasoning is that it should not be sampled at all.",
        "This yields the following statistic similar to one reported in the appendices of the WMT proceedings, which we call HEURISTIC 2.",
        "(2) However, the analysis by Bojar et al. (2011) goes further and suggests disregarding the effect of ties altogether by removing them from the denominator.",
        "This yields their final recommended statistic, which we call BOJAR.",
        "Superficially, this appears to be an improvement.",
        "However, we observe in the rankings that two anonymized commercial systems, denoted ON-LINEA and ONLINEB, consistently appear at or near the top of the rankings in all tasks.",
        "It is natural to wonder: even if we leave out the reference from comparisons, couldn't a system still be penalized simply by being compared against ONLINEA and ONLINEB more frequently than its competitors?",
        "On the other hand, couldn't a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors?",
        "There are many possible decisions that we could make, each leading to a different ranking.",
        "However, there is a more fundamental problem: each of these heuristic scores is based on statistics aggregated over completely incomparable sets of data.",
        "Any total ordering of the systems must make a decision between every pair of systems.",
        "When that ranking is computed using scores computed with any of Equations 1 through 3, we aggregate over completely different sets of sentences, rates of comparison with other systems, and even annotators!",
        "Deriving statistical conclusions from such comparisons is at best suspect.",
        "If we want to rank A and B relative to each other, it would be more reliable to aggregate over the same set of sentences, same rates of comparison, and the same annotators.",
        "Fortunately, we have this data in abundance: it is the collection of pairwise judgements that we started with."
