        "To realize its full potential, however, MT is now in the need of semantic-aware techniques, capable of complementing frequency counts with meaning representations.",
        "In order to integrate semantics more deeply into MT technology, in this paper we focus on the evaluation dimension.",
        "Restricting our investigation to some of the more pressing issues emerging from this area of research, we provide two main contributions.",
        "1.",
        "An automatic evaluation method that avoids the use of reference translations.",
        "Most current metrics are based on comparisons between automatic translations and human references, and reward lexical similarity at the n-gram level (e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover et al., 2006)).",
        "Due to the variability of natural languages in terms of possible ways to express the same meaning, reliable lexical similarity metrics depend on the availability of multiple hand-crafted (costly) realizations of the same source sentence in the target language.",
        "Our approach aims to avoid this bottleneck by adapting cross-lingual semantic inference capabilities and judging a translation only given the source sentence.",
        "2.",
        "A method for evaluating translation adequacy.",
        "Most current solutions do not consistently reward translation adequacy (semantic equivalence between source sentence and target translation).",
        "The scarce integration of semantic information in MT, specifically at the multilingual level, led to MT systems that are ?illiterate?",
        "in terms of semantics and meaning.",
        "Moreover, current metrics are often difficult to interpret.",
        "In contrast, our method targets the adequacy dimension, producing easily interpretable results (e.g. judgements in a 4-point scale).",
        "Our approach builds on recent advances in cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) recognition, which provides a natural framework to address MT adequacy evaluation.",
        "In particular, we approach the problem as an application of CLTE where bi",
        "directional entailment between source and target is considered as evidence of translation adequacy.",
        "Besides avoiding the use of references, the proposed solution differs from most previous methods which typically rely on surface-level features, often extracted from the source or the target sentence taken in isolation.",
        "Although some of these features might correlate well with adequacy, they capture semantic equivalence only indirectly, and at the level of a probabilistic prediction.",
        "Focusing on a combination of surface, syntactic and semantic features, extracted from both source and target (e.g. ?source-target length ratio?, ?dependency relations in common?",
        "), our approach leads to informed adequacy judgements derived from the actual observation of a translation given the source sentence."

        "More similar to our approach, (Pado?",
        "et al, 2009) proposed semantic adequacy metrics that exploit feature representations motivated by Textual Entailment (TE).",
        "Both metrics, however, highly depend on the availability of multiple reference translations.",
        "Early attempts to avoid reference translations addressed quality estimation (QE) by means of large numbers of source, target, and system-dependent features to discriminate between ?good?",

        "Good results in QE have been achieved by adding linguistic information such as shallow parsing, POS tags (Xiong et al., 2010), or dependency relations (Bach et al., 2011; Avramidis et al., 2011) as features.",
        "However, in general these approaches do not distinguish between fluency (i.e. syntactic correctness of the output translation) and adequacy, and mostly rely on fluency-oriented features (e.g. ?number of punctuation marks?).",
        "As a result, a simple surface form variation is given the same importance of a content word variation that changes the meaning of the sentence.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, only (Specia et al., 2011) proposed an approach to frame MT evaluation as an adequacy estimation problem.",
        "However, their method still includes many features which are not focused on adequacy, and often look either at the source or at the target in isolation (see for instance ?source complexity?",
        "and ?target fluency?",

The main motivation in approaching adequacy evaluation using CLTE is that an adequate translation and the source text should convey the same meaning.",

        "ing or altering part of the meaning conveyed by the source sentence (i.e. having more, or different information in one of the two sides) will change the entailment direction and, consequently, the adequacy judgement.",
        "Framed in this way, CLTE-based adequacy evaluation methods can be designed to distinguish meaning-preserving variations from true divergence, regardless of reference translations.",
        "Similarly to many monolingual TE approaches, CLTE solutions proposed so far adopt supervised learning methods, with features that measure to what extent the hypotheses can be mapped into the texts.",
        "The underlying assumption is that the probability of entailment is proportional to the number of words in H that can be mapped to words in T (Mehdad et al., 2011).",
        "Such mapping can be carried out at different word representation levels (e.g. tokens, lemmas, stems), possibly with the support of lexical knowledge in order to cross the language barrier between T and H (e.g. dictionaries, phrase tables).",
        "Under the same assumption, since in the adequacy evaluation framework the entailment relation should hold in both directions, the mapping is performed both from the source to the target and vice-versa, building on features extracted from both sentences.",
        "Moreover, to improve over previous CLTE methods and boost MT adequacy evaluation performance, we explore the joint contribution of a number of lexical, syntactic and semantic features (Mehdad et al., 2012).",
        "Concerning the features used, it's worth observing that the cost of implementing our approach (in terms of required resources and linguistic processors), and the need of reference translations are intrinsically different bottlenecks for MT.",

        "Moreover, our phrase matching algorithm integrates matches from overlapping n-grams of different size and nature (tokens, lemmas and stems) which current MT decoding algorithms cannot explore for complexity reasons.",
        "Dependency Relation (DR) matching features target the increase of CLTE precision by adding syntactic constraints to the matching process.",
        "These features capture similarities between dependency relations, combining syntactic and lexical levels.",
        "We define a dependency relation as a triple that connects pairs of words through a grammatical relation.",
        "In a valid match, while the relation has to be the same, the connected words can be either the same, or semantically equivalent terms in the two languages.",

        "SPTs offer three main advantages: i) semantic tags allow to match tokens that do not occur in the original parallel corpora used to extract the phrase table, ii) SPT entries are often short generalizations of longer original phrases, so the matching process can benefit from the increased probability of mapping higher order n-grams (i.e. those providing more contextual information), and iii) their smaller size has positive impact on system's efficiency, due to the considerable search space reduction."

        "Within such framework, this paper makes two main contributions.",
        "First, in contrast with most current metrics based on the comparison between automatic translations and multiple references, we avoid the bottleneck represented by the manual creation of such references.",
        "Second, beyond current approaches biased towards fluency or general quality judgements, we tried to isolate the adequacy dimension of the problem, exploring the potential of adequacy-oriented features extracted from the observation of source and target.",
        "To achieve our objectives, we successfully extended previous CLTE methods with a variety of linguistically motivated features.",
        "Altogether, such features led to reliable judgements that show high correlation with human evaluation.",
        "Coherent results on different datasets and classification schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for different applications.",
        "Future works will address both the improvement of our adequacy evaluation method and its integration in SMT for optimization purposes.",
        "On one hand, we plan to explore new features capturing other semantic dimensions.",
        "A possible direction is to consider topic modelling techniques to measure the relatedness of source and target.",
        "Another interesting direction is to investigate the use of Wikipedia entity linking tools to support the mapping between source and target terms.",
        "On the other hand, we plan to explore the integration of our model as an error criterion in SMT system training."
