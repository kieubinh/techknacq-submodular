        "All of the syntactic labeling schemes show an improvement over the Hiero model.",
        "Indeed, they all fall in the range of approximately 27?28 BLEU.",
        "We can see that the 1-best derivation CCG model performs slightly better than the phrase structure model, and the CCG parse chart model performs a little better than that.",
        "SAMT has the highest BLEU score.",
        "The models with a larger number of rules perform better; this supports our assertion that we shouldn't throw away too many rules.",
        "When it comes to translation time, the three smaller models (Hiero, phrase structure syntax, and CCG 1-best derivations) are significantly faster than the two larger ones.",
        "However, even though the CCG parse chart model is almost 34 the size of SAMT in terms of number of rules, it doesn't take 34 of the 5LDC2009T13 time.",
        "In fact, it takes only half the time of the SAMT model, thanks to the smaller rule label set."

        "Finding an appropriate mechanism to inform phrase-based translation models and their hierarchical variants with linguistic syntax is a difficult problem that has attracted intense interest, with a variety of promising approaches including unsupervised clustering (Zollmann and Vogel, 2011), merging (Hanneman et al., 2011), and selection (Mylonakis and Sima?an, 2011) of labels derived from phrase-structure parse trees very much like those used by our baseline systems.",
        "What we find particularly attractive about CCG is that it naturally assigns linguistically-motivated labels to most spans of a sentence using a reasonably concise label set, possibility obviating the need for further refinement.",
        "Indeed, the analytical flexibility of CCG has motivated its increasing use in MT, from applications in language modeling (Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007) to more recent proposals to incorporate it into phrase-based (Mehay, 2010) and hierarchical translation systems (Auli, 2009).",
        "Our new model builds on these past efforts, representing a more fully instantiated model of CCG-based translation.",
        "We have shown that the label scheme allows us to keep many more translation rules than labels based on phrase structure syntax, extracting almost as many rules as the SAMT model, but keeping the label set an order of magnitude smaller, which leads to more efficient translation.",
        "This simply scratches the surface of possible uses of CCG in translation.",
        "In future work, we plan to move from a formally context-free to a formally CCG-based model of translation, implementing combinatorial rules such as application, composition, and type-raising."
