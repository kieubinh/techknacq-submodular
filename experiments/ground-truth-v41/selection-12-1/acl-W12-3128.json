        "Chiang's hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation model utilizes synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) for translation derivation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) and has been widely adopted in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Typically, such models define two types of translation rules: hierarchical (translation) rules which consist of both terminals and non-terminals, and glue (grammar) rules which combine translated phrases in a monotone fashion.",
        "However, due to lack of linguistic knowledge, Chiang's HPB model contains only one type of non-terminal symbol X , often making it difficult to select the most appropriate translation rules.1 One important research question is therefore how to refine the non-terminal category X using linguistically motivated information: Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) (SAMT) e.g. use (partial) syntactic categories derived from CFG trees while Zollmann and Vogel (2011) use word tags, generated by either POS analysis or unsupervised word class induction.",
        "Almaghout et al. (2011) employ CCGbased supertags.",
        "Mylonakis and Sima?an (2011) use linguistic information of various granularities such as Phrase-Pair, Constituent, Concatenation of Constituents, and Partial Constituents, where applicable.",
        "By contrast, and inspired by previous work in parsing (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2003), our Head-Driven HPB (HD-HPB) model is based on the intuition that linguistic heads provide important information about a constituent or distributionally defined fragment, as in HPB.",
        "We identify heads using linguistically motivated dependency parsing, and use head information to refine X.",
        "Furthermore, Chiang's HPB model suffers from limited phrase reordering by combining translated",
        "in Chiang's model.",
        "phrases in a monotonic way with glue rules.",
        "In addition, once a glue rule is adopted, it requires all rules above it to be glue rules.",
        "For example, given a Chinese-English sentence pair (?",
        "?/zuotian1 ?",
        "?/chuxi2 ?",
        "?/huiyi3, Attended2 a3 meeting3 yesterday1), a correct translation is impossible via HPB derivations in Figure 1.",
        "For the derivation in Figure 1(a), swap reordering in the glue rule (i.e., S1 ?",
        "?S2X2, X2S2?)",
        "is disallowed and, even if such a swap reordering is available, it lacks useful information for rule selection.",
        "For the derivation in Figure 1(b), the combination of two non-terminals (i.e., X2 ?",
        "?X3X4, X3X4?)",
        "is disallowed to form a new non-terminal which in turn is a sub-phrase of a hierarchical rule.",
        "These limitations prevent traditional HPB systems from even considering some reasonable derivations.",
        "To tackle the problem of glue rules, He (2010) extended the HPB model by using bracketing transduction grammar (Wu, 1996) instead of the monotone glue rules, and trained an extra classifier for glue rules to predict reorderings of neighboring phrases.",
        "By contrast, our HD-HPB model refines the non-terminal symbol X with syntactic head information and provides flexible reordering rules, including swap, which can mix freely with hierarchical translation rules for better interleaving of translation and reordering in translation derivations.",
        "Different from the soft constraint modeling adopted in (Chan et al., 2007; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Shen et al., 2009; He et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2011), our approach encodes syntactic information in translation rules.",
        "However, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive, as we could also include a set of syntax-driven features into our translation model.",
        "Our approach maintains the advantages of Chiang's HPB model while at the same time incorporating head information and flexible reordering in a derivation in a natural way.",
        "Experiments on Chinese-English translation using four NIST MT test sets show that our HD-HPB model significantly outperforms Chiang's HPB as well as a SAMT-style refined version of HPB.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) in our HD-HPB translation model.",
        "Section 3 presents our model and features, followed by the decoding algorithm in Section 4.",

        "Like Chiang (2005) and Chiang (2007), our HD-HPB translation model adopts a synchronous context free grammar, a rewriting system which generates source and target side string pairs simultaneously using a context-free grammar.",
        "In particular, each synchronous rule rewrites a non-terminal into a pair of strings, s and t, where s (or t) contains terminals and non-terminals from the source (or target) language and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-terminal symbols on both sides.",
        "A good and informative inventory of non-terminal symbols is always important, especially for a successful SCFG-based translation model.",
        "Instead of collapsing all non-terminals in the source language into a single symbol X as in Chiang (2007), ideally non-terminals should capture important information of the word sequences they cover to be able to properly discriminate between similar and different word sequences during translation.",
        "This motivates our approach to provide syntax-enriched non-terminal symbols.",
        "Given a word sequence f ij from position i to position j, we refine the non-terminal symbol X to reflect some of the internal syntactic structure of",
        "Chinese sentence.",
        "Here, each Chinese word is attached with its POS tag and Pinyin.",
        "the word sequence covered by X .",
        "A correct translation rule selection therefore not only maps terminals into terminals, but is both constrained and guided by syntactic information in the non-terminals.",
        "At the same time, it is not clear whether an ?ideal?",
        "approach that captures a full syntactic analysis of the string fragment covered by a non-terminal is feasible: the diversity of syntactic structures could make training impossible and lead to serious data sparseness issues.",
        "As a compromise, given a word sequence f ij , we first find heads and then concatenate the POS tags of these heads as f ij's non-terminal symbol.2 Our approach is guided by the intuition that linguistic heads provide important information about a constituent or distributionally defined fragment, as in HPB.",
        "Specifically, we adopt dependency structure to derive heads, which are defined as: Definition 1.",
        "For word sequence f ij , word fk (i ?",
        "k ?",
        "j) is regarded as a head if it is dominated by a word outside of this sequence.",
        "Note that this definition (i) allows for a word sequence to have one or more heads (largely due to the fact that a word sequence is not necessarily linguistically constrained) and (ii) ensures that heads are always the highest heads in the sequence from a dependency structure perspective.",
        "For example, the word sequence ouzhou baguo lianming in Figure 2 has two heads (i.e., baguo and lianming, ouzhou is not a head of this sequence since its headword baguo falls within this sequence) and the non-terminal corresponding to the sequence is thus labeled as NNAD.",
        "It is worth noting that in this paper we only refine non-terminal X on the source side to head-informed ones, while still usingX on the target side.",
        "2Note that instead of POS tags, it is also possible to use other types of syntactic information associated with heads to refine non-terminal symbols (Section 5.5.2).",

        "NRRs Examining translation output shows that on average each sentence employs 16.6/5.2 HD-HRs/NRRs in our HD-HPB model, compared to 15.9/3.6 hierarchical rules/glue rules in Chiang's model, providing further indication of the importance of NRRs in translation.",
        "In order to separate out the individual contributions of the novel HD-HRs and NRRs, we carry out an additional experiment (HD-HR+Glue) using HD-HRs with monotonic glue rules only (adjusted to refined rule labels, but effectively switching off the extra reordering power of full NRRs) both on the small and the large datasets, with interesting results: Table 3 (HD-HR+Glue) shows that for the small training set most of the improvement of our full HD-HPB model comes from the NRRs, as RR+Glue performs on the same level as Chiang's original and Moses HPB (the differences are not statistically significant), perhaps indicating sparseness for the refined HD-HRs given the small training set.",
        "Table 5 shows that for the large training set, HD-HRs come into their own: on average more than half of the improvement over HPB (Chiang and Moses) comes from the refined HD-HRs, the rest from NRRs.",
        "It is not surprising that compared to the others HD-HR+Glue takes much less time in decoding.",
        "This is due to the fact that 1) compared to HPB, the refined translation rule patterns on the source side have fewer entries in phrase table; 2) compared to HD-HPB, HD-HR+Glue switches off the extra reordering of NRRs.",
        "The decoding time for HD-HPB and HD-HR+Glue suggests that NRRs are more than doubling the time required to decode.",
        "Examining initial phrases extracted from the large size training data shows that there are 63K types of refined non-terminals with respect to 33 types of POS tags.",
        "Considering the sparseness in translation rules caused by this comparatively detained POS tag set, we carry out an experiment with a reduced set of non-terminal types by using a less granular POS tag set (C-HPB).",
        "Moreover, due to the fact that concatenation of POS tags of heads mostly captures internal structure of a text span, it is interesting to examine the effect of other syntactic labels, in particular dependency labels, to try to better capture the impact of the external context on the text span.",
        "To this end, we replace the POS tag of head with its incoming dependency label (DL-HPB), or the combination of (the original fine-grained) POS tag and its dependency label (POS-DL-HPB).",
        "For C-HPB we use the coarse POS tag set obtained by grouping the 33 types of Chinese POS tags into 11 types following Xia (2000).",
        "For example, we generalize all verbal tags (e.g., VA, VC, VE, and VV ) and all nominal tags (e.g., NR, NT, and NN) into Verb and Noun, respectively.",
        "We use the dependency labels in Penn2Malt which defines 9 types of dependency labels for Chinese, including AMOD, DEP, NMOD, P, PMOD, ROOT, SBAR, VC, and VMOD.7 Table 6 shows the results trained on large data.",
        "Although the number of non-terminal types decreased sharply from 63K to 3K, using the coarse POS tag set in C-HPB surprisingly lowers the performance with 1.1 BLEU scores on average (e.g., 33.75 vs. 34.86), indicating that grouping POS tags using simple linguistic rules is inappropriate for HD-HPB.",
        "We still believe that this initial negative finding should be supplemented by future work on groupping POS tags using machine learning techniques considering contextual information.",
        "Table 6 also shows that replacing POS tags of heads with their dependency labels (DL-HPB) substantially lowers the average performance from 34.86 on BLEU score to 32.54, probably due to the very coarse granularity of the dependency labels used.",
        "In addition, replacing non-terminal label with more refined tags (e.g., combination of original POS tag and dependency label) also lowers translation performance (POS-DL-HPB).",
        "Further experiments with more fine-grained dependency labels are required.",
        "translation model with a complete dependency structure on the source side and a moderate average improvement of 0.46 BLEU over the HPB baseline.",
        "By contrast, in our HD-HPB approach, dependency information is used to identify heads in the strings covered by non-terminals in HD-HR rules, and to refine non-terminal labels accordingly, with an average improvement of 1.91 in BLEU over the HPB baseline (when trained on the large data).",
        "This raises the question whether and to what extent complete (un-labeled) dependency information between the string and the heads in head-labeled non-terminal parts of the source side of SCFGs in HD-HPB can further improve results.",
        "Given the source side of a translation rule (either HD-HR or NRR), say Ps ?",
        "s1 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "sm (where each si is either a terminal or a head POS in a refined non-terminal), in a further set of experiments we keep the full unlabeled dependency relations between s1 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "sm so as to capture contextual syntactic information in translation rules.",
        "For example, on the source side of Figure 3 (b) where VV-NR maps into words zhichi and meiguo while NN maps into word celie, we keep the full unlabeled dependency relations among words {zhichi, meiguo, dui, yi, celie}.",
        "HD-DEP-HPB (Table 6) augments translation rules in HD-HPB with full dependency relations on the source side.",
        "This further boosts the performance by 0.35 BLEU scores on average over HD-HPB and outperforms the HPB baseline by 2.26 BLEU scores on average.",
        "We carried out a manual error analysis comparing the outputs of our HD-HPB system with those of Chiang's (both trained on the large data).",
        "We observe that improved BLEU score often correspond to better topological ordering of phrases in the hierarchical structure of the source side, with a direct impact on which words in a source sentence should be translated first, and which later.",
        "As ungrammatical translations are often due to inappropriate topological orderings of phrases in the hierarchical structure, guiding the translation through appropriate topological ordering should improve translation quality.",
        "To give an example, consider the following input sentence from the 04 NIST MT test data and its two",
        "more high technology equipment ?",
        "HD-HPB: chinese delegation went to the united states to buy more us high - tech equipment Figure 4 demonstrates the topological orderings in the two hierarchical structures.",
        "In addition to dis-fluency and some grammar errors (e.g., a main verb is missing), the basic HPB system also makes mistakes in reordering (e.g., ?",
        "?4 ???",
        "?5 ?",
        "?6 translated as dollar purchase of more).",
        "The poor translation quality, unsurprisingly, is caused by inappropriate topological ordering (Figure 4(a)).",
        "By comparison, the topological ordering reflected in the hierarchical structure of our HD-HPB model better respects syntactic structure (Figure 4(b)).",
        "Let",
        "from word i to word j on the source side.",
        "us refer to the HD-HPB hierarchical structure on the source side as translation parse tree and to the treebank-based parser derived tree as syntactic parse tree from which we obtain unlabeled dependency structure.",
        "Examining the translation parse trees of our HD-HPB model shows that phrases with 1/2/3/4 heads account for 64.9%/23.1%/8.8%/3.2%, respectively.",
        "Compared to 37.9% of the phrases in the translation parse trees of the HPB model, 43.2% of the phrases of our HD-HPB model correspond to a linguistically motivated constituent in the syntactic parse tree with exactly the same text span.",
        "In sum, therefore, instead of simply enforcing hard linguistic constraints imposed by a full syntactic parse structure, our model opts for a successful mix of linguistically motivated and combinatorial (matching sub-phrases in HPB) constraints."

        "In this paper, we present a head-driven hierarchical phrase-based translation model, which adopts head information (derived through unlabeled dependency analysis) in the definition of non-terminals to better differentiate among translation rules.",
        "In addition, improved and better integrated reordering rules allow better reordering between consecutive non-terminals through exploration of a larger search space in the derivation.",
        "Our model maintains the strengths of Chiang's HPB model while at the same time it addresses the over-generation problem caused by using a uniform non-terminal symbol.",
        "Experimental results on Chinese-English translation across a wide range of training and test sets demonstrate significant and consistent improvements of our HD-HPB model over Chiang's HPB model as well as over a source side version of the SAMT-style model.",
        "Currently, we only consider head information in a word sequence.",
        "In the future work, we will exploit more syntactic and semantic information to systematically and automatically define the inventory of non-terminals (in source and target).",
        "For example, for a non-terminal symbol VV, we believe it will benefit translation if we use fine-grained dependency labels (subject, object etc.)",
        "used to link it to its governing head elsewhere in the translation rule."
