        "Extracting phrases from large amounts of noisy word-aligned training data for statistical machine translation (SMT) generally has the disadvantage of producing many unnecessary phrases (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "These can include poor quality phrases, composite phrases that are concatenations of shorter ones, or phrases that are assigned very low probabilities, so that they have no realistic chance when competing against higher scoring phrase pairs.",
        "The goal of this work is two-fold: (i) investigating forced alignment training as a phrase table pruning method for large-scale commercial SMT systems and (ii) proposing several extensions to the training procedure to deal with practical issues and stimulate further research.",
        "Generative phrase translation models have the inherent problem of over-fitting to the training data (Koehn et al., 2003; DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "(Wuebker et al., 2010) introduce a leave-one-out procedure which is shown to counteract over-fitting effects.",
        "The authors report significant improvements on the German-English Europarl data with the additional benefit of a severely reduced phrase table size.",
        "This paper investigates its impact on a number of commercial large-scale systems and presents several extensions.",
        "The first extension is to deal with the highly noisy training data, which is automatically crawled and sentence aligned.",
        "The noise and the baseline pruning of the phrase table lead to low success rates when aligning the source sentence with the target sentence.",
        "We introduce on-demand word deletions, insertions, and backoff phrases to increase the success rate so that we can cover essentially the entire training data.",
        "Secondly, phrase table pruning makes out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues even more pronounced.",
        "To avoid an increased OOV rate, we retrieve single-word translations from the baseline phrase table.",
        "Lastly, we propose two global scaling",
        "factors to allow fine-tuning of the phrase counts in an attempt to re-estimate the translation probabilities and a modification of absolute discounting that can be applied to fractional counts.",
        "Our main contribution is applying forced-alignment on the training data to prune the phrase table.",
        "The rationale behind this is that by decoding the training data, we can identify the phrases that are actually used by the decoder.",
        "Further, we present preliminary experiments on re-estimating the channel models in the phrase table based on counts extracted from the force-aligned data.",
        "This work is organized as follows.",
        "We discuss related work in Section 2, describe our decoder and training procedure in Section 3 and the experiments in Section 4.",
