        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems represent knowledge sources in the form of features, and rely on parameters, or weights, on each feature, to score alternative translations.",
        "As in all statistical models, these parameters need to be learned from the data.",
        "In recent years, there has been a growing trend of moving away from discriminative training using batch log-linear optimization, with Minimum-Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003) being the principle method, to online linear optimization (Chiang et al., 2008; Watanabe et al., 2007; Arun and Koehn, 2007).",
        "The major motivation for this has been that while MERT is able to efficiently optimize a small number of parameters directly toward an external evaluation metric, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), it has been shown that its performance can be erratic, and it is unable to scale to a large set of features (Foster and Kuhn, 2009; Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "Furthermore, it is designed for batch learning, which may be prohibitive or undesirable in certain scenarios, for instance if we have a large tuning set.",
        "One or both of these limitations have led to recent introduction of alternative optimization strategies, such as minimum-risk (Smith and Eis-ner, 2006), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), Structured SVM (Cherry and Foster, 2012), and RAM-PION (Gimpel and Smith, 2012), which are batch learners, and online large-margin structured learning (Chiang et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2007; Watanabe, 2012).",
        "A popular method of large-margin optimization is the margin-infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer et al., 2006), which has been shown to perform well for machine translation, as well as other structured prediction tasks, such as parsing.",
        "(McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "This is an attractive method because we have a simple analytical solution for the optimization problem at each step, which reduces to dual coordinate descent when using 1-best MIRA.",
        "It is also quite easy to implement, as will be shown below.",
        "Despite the proven success of MIRA-based large-margin optimization for both small and large numbers of features, these methods have not yielded wide adoption in the community.",
        "Part of the reason for this is a perception that these methods are complicated to implement, which has been cited as motivation for other work (Hopkins and May, 2011; Gimpel and Smith, 2012).",
        "Furthermore, there is a di",
        "vergence between the standard application of these methods in machine learning, and our application in machine translation (Gimpel and Smith, 2012), where in machine learning there are usually clear correct outputs and no latent structures.",
        "As a consequence of the above, there is a lack of standard practices for large-margin learning for MT, which has resulted in numerous different implementations of MIRA-based optimizers, which further add to the confusion.",
        "This paper aims to shed light on practical concerns with online large margin training.",
        "Specifically, our contribution is first, to present the MIRA passive-aggressive update, which underlies all MIRA-based training, with an eye to application in MT.",
        "Then, we empirically compare several widespread as well as novel optimization strategies for large-margin training on Czech-to-English (cs-en) and French-to-English (fr-en) translation.",

        "The underlying objective of MIRA is the same as that of the margin rescaled Structural SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; Martins et al., 2010), where we want to predict the correct output over the incorrect one by a margin at least as large as the cost incurred by predicting the incorrect output.",
        "However, the norm constraint from SVM is replaced with a proximity constraint, indicating we want to update our parameters, but keep them as close as possible to the previous parameter estimates.",
        "In the original formulation for separable classification (Crammer and Singer, 2003), if no constraints are violated, no update occurs.",
        "However, when there is a loss, the algorithm updates the parameters to satisfy the constraints.",

        "In all, we introduce 650k features for cs-en, and 1.1M for fr-en.",
        "Taking the two best performing strategies from the baseline model, LU/MC and M?C, we compare their performance with the larger feature set in Table 5.",
        "Although integrating these features does not significantly alter the performance on either task, our purpose was to establish once again that the large-margin learning framework is capable of effectively optimizing parameters for a large number of sparse features in the MT setting."

        "Although the performance of the two strategies is competitive on the evaluation sets, this does not relay the entire story.",
        "For a more complete view of the differences between optimization strategies, we turn to Figures 1-6.",
        "Figure 1 and 2 present the comparison of performance on the NT08 development set for cs-en and fr-en, respectively, when using LU/MC to select the oracle and prediction versus M?C selection.",
        "M?C is indicated with a solid black line, while LU/MC is a dotted red line.",
        "The corpus-level oracle and prediction BLEU scores at each iteration are indicated with error bars around each point, using solid lines for M?C and dotted lines for LU/MC.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1, while optimizing with M?C is stable and smooth, where we converge on our optimum after several iterations, optimizing with LU/MC is highly unstable.",
        "This is at least in part due to the wide range in BLEU scores for the oracle and prediction, which are in the range of 10 BLEU points higher or lower than the current model best.",
        "On the contrary, the range of BLEU scores for the M?C optimizer is on the order of 2 BLEU points, leading to more gradual changes.",
        "We see a similar, albeit slightly less pronounced behavior on fr-en in Figure 2.",
        "M?C optimization is once again smooth, and converges quickly, with a small range for the oracle and prediction scores around the model best.",
        "LU/MC remains unstable, oscillating up to 2 BLEU points between iterations.",
        "Figures 3-6 compare the different optimization strategies further.",
        "In Figures 3 and 5, we use M-C as the oracle, and show performance on the development set while using the three prediction selection strategies, M+C with a solid blue line, PB with a dotted green line, and MC with a dashed red line.",
        "Error bars indicate the oracle and prediction BLEU scores for each pairing as before.",
        "In all three cases, the oracle BLEU score is in about the same range, as expected, since all are using the same oracle selection strategy.",
        "We can immediately observe that PB has no error bars going down, indicating that the PB method for selecting the prediction keeps pace with the model best at each iteration.",
        "On the other hand, MC selection also stands out, since it is the only one with a large drop in prediction BLEU score.",
        "Crucially, all learners are stable, and move toward convergence smoothly, which serves to validate our earlier observation that M-C oracle selection can be paired with any prediction selection strategy and optimize effectively.",
        "In both cs-en and fr-en, we can observe that M?C performs the best.",
        "In Figures 4 and 6, we use LU as the oracle, and show performance using the three prediction selection strategies, with each line representing the same strategy as described above.",
        "The major difference, which is immediately evident, is that the optimizers are highly unstable.",
        "The only pairing which shows some stability is LU/MC, with both the other predic",
        "for fr-en of the three prediction selection strategies when using LU selection as oracle.",
        "tion selection methods, PB and M+C significantly underperforming it.",
        "Given that the translation performance of optimizing the loss functions represented by LU/MC and M?C selection is comparable on the evaluation sets for fr-en and cs-en, it may be premature to make a general recommendation for one over the other.",
        "However, taking the unstable nature of LU/MC into account, the extent of which may depend on the tuning set, as well as other factors which need to be further examined, the current more prudent alternative is selecting the oracle and prediction pair based on M?C."

        "In this paper, we strove to elucidate aspects of large-margin structured learning with concrete application to the MT setting.",
        "Towards this goal, we presented the MIRA passive-aggressive algorithm, which can be used directly to effectively tune a statistical MT system with millions of parameters, in the hope that some confusion surrounding MIRA-based methods may be cleared, and more MT researchers can adopt it for their own use.",
        "We then used the presented algorithm to empirically compare several widespread loss functions and strategies for selecting hypotheses for optimization.",
        "We showed that although there are two competing strategies with comparable performance, one is an unstable learner, and before we understand more regarding the nature of the instability, the preferred alternative is to use M?C as the hypothesis pair in optimization."
