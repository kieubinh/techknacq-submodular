        "Social relations like power and influence are difficult concepts to define, but are easily recognizable when expressed.",
        "Most classical definitions of power in the sociology literature (e.g. (Bierstedt, 1950; Dahl, 1957)) include ?an element indicating that power is the capability of one social actor to overcome resistance in achieving a desired objective or result?",
        "(Pfeffer, 1981).",
        "Influence closely resembles power, although some consider it as one of the means by which power is used (Handy, 1985).",
        "The five bases of power ?",
        "Coercive, Reward, Legitimate (Positional), Referent, and Expert ?",
        "proposed by French and Raven (1959) and its extensions are widely used in sociology to study power.",
        "I find these definitions and typologies helpful as general background, but not specific enough for a data-oriented study on how they are expressed in online written dialogs.",
        "One of the primary ways power is manifested is the manner in which people participate in dialog.",
        "Power relations sometimes constrain how one behaves when engaging in dialog; in some other cases, they enable one to constrain someone else's behav-ior.",
        "And in some cases, the dialog behavior becomes a tool to express and even pursue power.",
        "By dialog behavior, I mean the choices one makes while engaging in dialog.",
        "It includes choices with respect to the message content, like lexical choices, degree of politeness or instances of overt display of power such as orders or commands.",
        "It also includes choices participants make in terms of dialog structure, like the choice of when to participate with how much and what sort of contribution, how many questions to ask and which of those questions to answer and the time between those questions and their answers.",
        "The primary goal of my thesis is to show that different social power relations manifest themselves in written dialog in different, but predictable ways, and to investigate how these manifestations differ across languages, genres and domains.",
        "To achieve this goal, I aim to introduce a new typology of power that is relevant in online written interactions and can be validated using data-oriented approaches.",
        "Then, I aim to study how these different types of power differ in their manifestations in dialog.",
        "Specifically, I aim to capture and compare these manifestations in two dimensions of the dialog: content and structure.",
        "In addition to using existing components like dialog act taggers and linkers to capture the dialog structure",
        "and lexical analyzers to capture content features, I plan to identify and extract more structural and linguistic indicators of power relations.",
        "Using these features, I will build a system that can automatically extract power relations between participants of written dialogs across different languages (English vs. Arabic), genres (discussion forums vs. emails) and domains (political vs. scientific).",
        "Currently, I have partially achieved this goal within the context of English corporate email threads, which represent a specific language-genre-domain combination.",
        "The four types of power I have defined are: situational power, hierarchical power, control of communication and influence.",
        "My future research directions include 1) broadening this work onto other languages, genres and domains and 2) using deeper analysis to identify more indicators of power and capture power relations at finer granularity"

        "It has long been established that there is a correlation between dialog behavior of a discourse participant and how influential she is perceived to be by the other discourse participants (Bales et al., 1951; Scherer, 1979; Ng et al., 1995).",
        "Specifically, factors such as frequency of contribution, proportion of turns, and number of successful interruptions have been identified as being important indicators of influence.",
        "Locher (2004) recognizes ?restriction of an interactant's action-environment?",
        "(Wartenberg, 1990) as a key element by which exercise of power in interactions can be identified.",
        "I use a linguistic indicator Overt Display of Power which captures action-restriction at an utterance level.",
        "Wartenberg (1990) also makes the important distinction between two notions of power: power-over and power-to.",
        "Power-over refers to hierarchical relationships between interactants, while power-to refers to the ability an interactant possesses (may be temporarily) and can use within the interaction.",
        "My notions of hierarchical power and situational power roughly correspond to Wartenberg's notions of power-over and power-to, respectively.",
        "Both can be considered special cases of French and Raven (1959)'s notion of legitimate power.",
        "I consider influence as a type of power which captures notions of expert power and referent power described by French and Raven.",
        "Finally, my notion of control of communication is based on the concept of conversational control introduced by Ng and Bradac (1993).",
        "It is a form of power the participant has over the interaction; other forms of power are modeled between participants.",
        "In computational literature, several studies have used Social Network Analysis (Diesner and Carley, 2005; Shetty and Adibi, 2005; Creamer et al., 2009) to deduce social relations from online communication.",
        "These studies use only meta-data about messages: who sent a message to whom and when.",
        "For example, Creamer et al. (2009) find that the response time is an indicator of hierarchical relations; however, they calculate the response time based only on the meta-data, and do not have access to information such as thread structure or message content, which would actually verify that the second email is in fact a response to the first.",
        "Using NLP to analyze the content of messages to deduce power relations from written dialog is a relatively new area which has been studied only recently (Strzalkowski et al., 2010; Bramsen et al., 2011; Peterson et al., 2011).",
        "Using knowledge of the organizational structure, Bramsen et al. (2011) create two sets of messages: messages sent from a superior to a subordinate, and vice versa.",
        "Their task is to determine the direction of power (since all their data, by construction of the corpus, has a power relationship).",
        "They approach the task as a text classification problem and build a classifier to determine whether the set of all emails (regardless of thread) between two participants is an instance of up-speak or down-speak.",
        "In contrast, I plan to use a complete communication thread as a data unit and capture instances where power is actually manifested.",
        "I also plan to study power in a broader sense, looking beyond power attributed by hierarchy to other forms of power.",
        "Strzalkowski et al. (2010) are also interested in power in written dialog.",
        "However, their work concentrates on lower-level constructs called Language Uses, which might indicate higher level social constructs such as leadership and power.",
        "This said, one of their language uses is agenda control, which is very close to our notion of conversational control.",
        "They model it using notions of topic switching, using mainly complex lexical features.",
        "Peterson et al. (2011) focuses on formality in Enron email messages and relates it to social distance and power.",
        "the context of English corporate email threads.",
        "For this purpose, I used a subset of email threads from a version of the Enron email corpus (Yeh and Harnly, 2006) in which messages are organized as threaded conversations.",
        "In the remainder of this section, I first introduce the power typology and annotations and then present the linguistic and structural features I used.",
        "Then, I present the findings from a statistical significance study conducted between these features and different types of power.",
        "Finally, I present a system built using these features to predict participants with power within an email thread.",
        "Power Typology and Annotations: After careful analysis of a part of the email corpus, I defined a power typology to capture different types of power relevant in corporate emails.",
        "I propose four types of power: situational power, hierarchical power, control of communication and influence.1 Person 1 is said to have situational power (SP) over person 2 if person 1 has power or authority to direct and/or approve person 2's actions in the current situation or while a particular task is being performed, as can be deduced from the communication in the current thread.",
        "Person 1 with situational power may or may not be above person 2 in the organizational hierarchy (or there may be no organizational hierarchy at all).",
        "Person 1 is said to have hierarchical power (HP) over person 2 if person 1 appears to be above person 2 in the organizational hierarchy, as can be deduced from the communication in the given thread (annotators did not have access to independent information about the organizational hierarchy).",
        "Possible clues to HP include (by way of example): 1) characteristic of a part of a message as being an approval, or being a direct order; 2) a person's behavior such as asking for approval; 3) a person's authority to make the final decision.",
        "A person is said to have control of the communication (CNTRL) if she actively attempts to achieve the intended goals of the communication.",
        "These are people who ask questions, request others to take action, etc.",
        "and",
        "lated through collaborative effort with another student.",
        "not people who simply respond to questions or perform actions when directed to do so.",
        "A thread could have multiple such participants.",
        "A person is said to have influence (INFL) if she 1) has credibility in the group, 2) persists in attempting to convince others, even if some disagreement occurs, 3) introduces topics/ideas that others pick up on or support, and 4) is a group participant but not necessarily active in the discussion(s) where others support/credit her.",
        "In addition, the influencer's ideas or language may be adopted by others and others may explicitly recognize influencer's authority.2 Prabhakaran et al. (2012a) presents more details on annotations of these power relations in the email corpus.",
        "Manifestations in Content and Stucture: I used six sets of features to explore manifestations of power: dialog act percentages (DAP), dialog link counts (DLC), positional (PST), verbosity (VRB), lexical (LEX) and overt display of power (ODP).",
        "The first four sets of features relate to the whole dialog and its structure while the last two relate to the form and content of individual messages.",
        "The email corpus I used has been previously annotated with dialog acts and links by other researchers (Hu et al., 2009).",
        "I used these annotations to capture DAP and DLC features.",
        "DAP captures percentages of each of the dialog act labels (Request Action, Request Information, Inform, Conventional, and Commit) aggregated over all messages sent by the participant within the thread.",
        "The dialog links include forward links which denote utterances with requests for information or actions, backward links which denote their responses and secondary forward links which denote utterances without explicit requests that were interpreted as requests and were linked back from later utterances.",
        "DLC captures various features derived from these links with respect to each participant such as counts of each type of link, counts of forward links that are connected back and counts and percentages of those which were not connected back.",
        "PST includes features to indicate relative positions of first and last messages by a participant.",
        "VRB includes features to denote how much and how often a participant took part in the conversation.",
        "PST and 2I adopt this definition from the IARPA Socio-Cultural Content in Language (SCIL) program, where many researchers participating in the SCIL program contributed to the scope and refinement of the definition of a person with influence.",
        "VRB are readily derivable from the email threads.",
        "I used simple word ngram features to capture LEX.",
        "Overt display of power (ODP) is a linguistic indicator of power I introduced.",
        "An utterer can choose linguistic forms in her utterance to signal that she is imposing constraints on the addressee's choice of how to respond, which go beyond those defined by the standard set of dialog acts.",
        "For example, if the boss's email is ?Please come to my office right now?, and the addressee declines, he is clearly not adhering to the constraints the boss has signaled, though he is adhering to the general constraints of cooperative dialog by responding to the request for action.",
        "I am interested in these additional constraints imposed on utterances through choices in linguistic form.",
        "I define an utterance to have ODP if it is interpreted as creating additional constraints on the response beyond those imposed by the general dialog act.",
        "An ODP can be an order, command, question or even a declarative sentence.",
        "The presence of an ODP does not presuppose that the utterer actually possess social power: the utterer could be attempting to gain power.",
        "In (Prabhakaran et al., 2012b), I present a system to identify utterances with ODP using lexical features like word and part of speech ngrams along with dialog acts of the utterance.",
        "Statistical significance study: For each type of power, I considered two populations of people who participated in the dialog ?",
        "Pp, those judged to have that type of power and Pn, those not judged to have that power.",
        "Then, for each feature, I performed a two-sample, two-tailed t-test comparing means of feature values of Pp and Pn.",
        "I found many features which are statistically significant, which suggests that power types are reflected in the email threads.",
        "I also found that the significance of features differ considerably from one type of power to another, which suggests that these power types are reflected differently in the threads, and that they are thus indeed different types of power.",
        "For hierarchical power, the feature TokenRatio has a mean of 0.38 for Pp and 0.54 for Pn with a p-value of 0.07.",
        "This suggests that bosses tend to talk less within a thread.",
        "People with situational power or control request actions significantly more often than others and send significantly more and longer messages than others.",
        "People with influence never request actions and send much longer messages than others.",
        "They also tend to have more secondary forward links (with a p-value of 0.07) which suggests that people often respond to what people with influence say even if the influencer's contribution is not a request.",
        "Predicting Persons with Power: I formally defined the problem as: given a communication thread T and an active participant X , predict whether X has power of type P ?",
        "{SP, HP, INFL, CNTRL} over some person Y in the thread.",
        "I built a binary SVM classifier for each power type P predicting whether or not X has power P based on features with respect to X in the context of the given thread T .",
        "I obtained good results for SP and CNTRL, but HP and INFL were hard to predict since they occurred rarely in my corpus.",
        "The combination of DLC and OSP performed best for SP (F = 64.4) and PST performed best for CNTRL (F = 90.0).",
        "For HP, the combination of DLC and LEX performed best (F = 34.8).",
        "For INFL, the best performer was DLC (F = 22.6).",
        "All results except the ones for INFL were statistically significant improvement over an always-true baseline.",
        "I found dialog features to be significant in predicting power, though content features also contribute to detecting some types of power."

        "In particular, I plan to use semantic information from VerbNet to provide useful abstraction of verbs into verb classes.",
        "This will reduce data sparseness, thereby improving the performance of the taggers.",
        "In an initial experiment, I found that using VerbNet class name instead of verb lemma improved the performance of ODP tagger by a small margin.",
        "I did this only for those verbs that belong to a single VerbNet class (hence needing no disambiguation).",
