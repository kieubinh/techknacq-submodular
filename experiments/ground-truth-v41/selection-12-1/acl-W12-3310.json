        "They propose a chain graph-based annotations scheme, which they claim express the discourse relations more accurately than RST, because the relations can access embedded, non-nuclear constituents that would be inaccessible in an RST tree.",
        "Since Wolf and Gibson use attribution and same relations, which are not considered discourse relations in D-LTAG or the PDTB, a direct comparison of chain graph annotations and the PDTB does not seem possible at this point; but violations of tree structure are also attested in the PDTB.",

        "They claim that only shared arguments (same text span taken as argument by two distinct discourse connectives) and properly contained arguments (a text span that is the argument of one connective properly contains a smaller text span that is the argument of another connective) should be considered as contributing to the complexity of discourse structure; the reason being that the instances of partially overlapping arguments and pure crossing can be explained away by anaphora and attribution, both of which are non-structural phenomena.",

        "Egg and Redeker (2008, 2010) argue that tree structure violations can be overcome by applying an underspecification formalism to discourse representation.",
        "They adopt a weak interpretation of nuclearity, where although the relation between an atomic constituent and a complex constituent is understood to hold between the atomic constituent ant the nucleus of the complex constituent, structurally the relation does not access the nucleus of the complex, and therefore does not result in multiple parenting.",
        "This approach is not directly applicable to PDTB-style relations, because of the minimality principle, which constrains the annotators to select the smallest text span possible that is necessary to interpret the discourse relation when annotating the arguments of a discourse connective.",
        "Egg and Redeker also argue that most of the crossing dependencies in Wolf and Gibson (2005) involve anaphora, which is considered non-structural in discourse as well as in syntax.",
        "However, they admit that multi-satellite constructions (MSC) in RST, where one constituent can enter into multiple rhetorical relations as long as it is the nucleus of all relations, seems to violate tree structure.",
        "They state that only some of the MSCs can be expressed as atomic-to-complex relations, but they also state that those the MSCs that cannot be expressed so seems to be genre specific.",
