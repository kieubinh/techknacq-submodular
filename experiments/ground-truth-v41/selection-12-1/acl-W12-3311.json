        "roll) and noun compounds (dry ice).",
        "There is no unique and widely accepted definition for the term multiword expression.",
        "It can be an ?arbitrary and recurrent word combination?",
        "(Smadja, 1993) or ?a syntactic and semantic unit whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived directly from the meaning or connotation of its components?",

        "Limited semantic variability: MWEs do not undergo the same semantic compositionality rules as ordinary word combinations.",
        "This is expressed in terms of (i) non-compositionality, as the meaning of the whole expression often cannot be directly inferred from the meaning of the parts composing it, (ii) non-substitutability, as it is not possible to replace part of an MWE by a related (synonym/equivalent) word or construction, and (iii) no word-for-word translation.",

        "Limited syntactic variability: standard grammatical rules do not apply to MWEs.",
        "This can be expressed in terms of (i) lexicalisation, as one cannot list all MWEs in the lexicon (undergeneration) nor include them all in the grammar (overgenera-tion) and (ii) extragrammaticality, as MWEs are unpredictable and seem ?weird?",

        "Heterogeneity: MWEs are hard to define because they encompass a large amount of phenomena.",
        "Thus, NLP applications cannot use a unified approach and need to rely on some typology3.",
        "In this paper, I adopt the definition by Calzolari et al. (2002), who define MWEs as: different but related phenomena [which] can be described as a sequence4 of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis.",
        "This generic and intentionally vague definition can be narrowed down according to the application needs.",
        "For example, for the statistical machine translation (MT) system5 used in the examples shown in Table 1, an MWE is any sequence of words which, when not translated as a unit, generates errors: ungrammatical or unnatural verbal constructions (sentence 1), awkward literal translations of idioms (sentence 2) and problems of lexical choice and word order in specialised texts (sentence 3).",

        "Despite the importance of MWEs in several applications, they are often neglected in the design and construction of real-life systems.",
        "In 1993, Smadja pointed out that ?.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "although disambiguation was originally considered as a performance task, the collocations retrieved have not been used for any specific computational task.?",
        "Most of the recent and current research in the MWE community still focuses on MWE acquisition instead of integration of automatically acquired or manually compiled resources into applications.",
        "The main contribution of my thesis is that it represents a step toward the integration of automatically extracted MWEs into real-life applications.",
        "Concretely, my contributions can be classified in two categories: first, I propose a unified, open and flexible methodological framework (?",
        "3) for automatic MWE acquisition from corpora; and second, I am performing an intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of MWE acquisition (?",
        "4), dissecting the influence of the different types of resources employed in the acquisition on the quality of the MWEs.",
        "The results of ongoing experiments are interesting but further work is needed to better understand the contributions of MWEs to the systems (?",
        "5).",
        "Methodological Framework To date, there is no agreement on whether there is a single best method for MWE acquisition, or whether a different subset of methods works better for a given MWE type.",
        "Most of recent work on MWE treatment focuses on candidate extraction from preprocessed text (Seretan, 2008) and on the automatic filtering and ranking through association measures (Evert, 2004; Pecina, 2010), but few authors provide a whole picture of the MWE treatment pipeline.",
        "One of the advantages of the framework I propose is that it models the whole acquisition process with modular tasks that can be chained in several ways, each task having multiple available techniques.",
        "Therefore, it is highly customisable and allows for a large number of parameters to be tuned according to the target MWE types.",
        "Moreover, the techniques I have developed do not depend on a fixed length of candidate expression nor on adjacency assumptions, as the words in an expression might occur several words away.",
        "Thanks to this flexibility, this methodology can be easily applied to virtually any language, MWE type and domain, not strictly depending on a given formalism or tool6.",
        "Intuitively, for a given language, if some preprocessing tools like POS taggers and/or parsers are available, the results will be much better than running the methods on raw text.",
        "But since such tools are not available for all languages, the methodology was conceived to be applicable even in the absence of preprocessing.",
        "6However, it is designed to deal with languages that use spaces to separate words.",
        "Thus, when working with Chinese, Japanese, or even with German compounds, some additional preprocessing is required.",
        "Evaluation of MWE Acquisition Published results comparing MWE extraction techniques usually evaluate them on small controlled data sets using objective measures such as precision, recall and mean average precision (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Pearce, 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005).",
        "On the one hand, the results of intrinsic evaluation are often vague or inconclusive: although they shed some light on the optimal parameters for the given scenario, they are hard to generalise and cannot be directly applied to other configurations.",
        "The quality of acquired MWEs as measured by objective criteria depends on the language, domain and type of the target construction, on corpus size and genre, on already available resources7, on the applied filters, preprocessing steps, etc.",
        "On the other hand, extrinsic evaluation consists of inserting acquired MWEs into a real NLP application and evaluating the impact of this new data on the overall performance of the system.",
        "For instance, it may be easier to ask a human annotator to evaluate the output of an MT system than to ask whether a sequence of words constitutes an MWE.",
        "Thus, another original contribution of my thesis is application-oriented extrinsic evaluation of MWE acquisition on two study cases: computer-aided lexicography and statistical machine translation.",
        "My goal is to investigate (1) how much the MWEs impact on the application and (2) what is (are) the best way(s) of integrating them in the complex pipeline of the target application."

        "Among early work on developing methods for MWE identification, there is that of Smadja (1993).",
        "He proposed and developed a tool called Xtract, aimed at general-purpose collocation extraction from text using a combination of n-grams and a mutual information measure.",
        "On general-purpose texts, Xtract has a precision of around 80%.",
        "Since then, many advances have been made, either looking at MWEs in general (Dias, 2003), or focusing on specific MWE types, such as collocations, phrasal verbs and compound nouns.",
        "A popular type-independent approach to MWE identification is to use statistical association measures, which have been applied to the task with varying degrees of success (Evert and Krenn, 2005).",
        "One of the advantages of this approach is that it is language independent.",
        "This is particularly important since although work on MWEs in several languages has been reported, e.g. Dias (2003) for Portuguese and Evert and Krenn (2005) for German, work on English still seems to predominate.",
        "I propose a new framework called mwetoolkit, described in Figure 1, which integrates multiple techniques and covers the whole pipeline of MWE acquisition.",
        "One can preprocess a raw monolingual corpus, if tools are",
        "available for the target language, enriching it with POS tags, lemmas and dependency syntax.",
        "Then, based on expert linguistic knowledge, intuition, empiric observation and/or examples, one defines multilevel patterns in a formalism similar to regular expressions to describe the target MWEs.",
        "The application of these patterns on an indexed corpus generates a list of candidate MWEs.",
        "For filtering, a plethora of methods is available, ranging from simple frequency thresholds to stopword lists and sophisticated association measures.",
        "Finally, the resulting filtered candidates are either directly injected into an NLP application or further manually validated before application.",
        "An alternative use for the validated candidates is to train a machine learning model which can be applied on new corpora in order to automatically identify and extract MWEs based on the characteristics of the previously acquired ones.",

        "Analogously, the French noun compounds (NCs) were extracted from Europarl using the following pattern: a noun followed by either an adjective or a prepositional complement14.",
        "After filtering out candidates that occur once in the corpus, we obtained 3,746 MWE candidates and part of the remaining candidates will be manually analysed in the future.",
        "For Greek, in particular, considerable work has been done to study the linguistic properties of MWEs, but computational approaches are still limited (Fotopoulou et al., 2008).",

        "The candidates were counted in two corpora and annotated with four association measures, and the top 150 according to each measure where annotated by three native speakers, that is, each annotator judged around 1,200 candidates and in the end the annotations were joined, creating a lexicon with 815 Greek",

        "The extraction process resulted in a list of 407,014 candidates which were further filtered using statistical association measures.",
        "Thus, an expert human annotator manually validated 12,545 candidates from which 699 were annotated as compositional verbal expressions and 74 as idiomatic verbal expressions.",

        "They found that both strategies result in improvement of translation quality, which suggests that SMT phrases alone do not model all MWE information.",

        "For translating from and to morphologically rich languages like German, where a compound is in fact a single token formed through concatenation, Stymne (2011) splits the compound into its single word components prior to translation and then applies some post-processing, like the reordering or merging of the components, after translation.",
