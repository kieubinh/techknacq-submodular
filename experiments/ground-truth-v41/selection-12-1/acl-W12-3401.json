        "In statistical, data-driven approaches to natural language syntactic parsing, a central problem is that of accurately modeling lexical relationships from potentially sparse counts within a training corpus.",
        "Our particular interests are centered on reducing lexical data sparseness for linear classification approaches for dependency parsing.",
        "In these approaches, linear models operate over feature vectors that generally represent syntactic structure within a sentence, and feature templates are defined in part over the word forms of one or more tokens in a sentence.",
        "Because treebanks used for training are often small, lexical features may appear relatively infrequently during training, especially for languages with richer morphology than English.",
        "This may, in turn, impede the parsing model's ability to generalize well outside of its training set with respect to lexical features.",
        "Past approaches for achieving lexical generalization in dependency parsing have used WordNet semantic senses in parsing experiments for English (Agirre et al., 2011), and word clustering over large corpora in parsing experiments for English (Koo et al., 2008) as well as for French (Candito et al., 2010b).",
        "These approaches map each word to a single corresponding generalized class (synset or cluster), and integrate generalized classes into parsing models in one of two ways: (i) the replacement strategy, where each word form is simply replaced with a corresponding generalized class; (ii) a strategy where an additional feature is created for the corresponding generalized class.",
        "Our contribution in this paper is applying probabilistic lexical generalization, a richer framework for lexical generalization, to dependency parsing.",
        "Each word form is represented as a categorical distribution over a lexical target space of generalized classes, for which we consider the spaces of lemmas, synsets, and clusters.",
        "The standard single-mapping approach from previous work can be seen as a sub-case: each categorical distribution assigns a probability of 1 to a single generalized class.",
        "The method",
        "we use for introducing probabilistic information into a feature vector is based on that used by Bunescu (2008), who tested the use of probabilistic part-of-speech (POS) tags through an NLP pipeline.",
        "In this paper, we perform experiments for French that use the replacement strategy for integrating generalized classes into parsing models, comparing the single-mapping approach for lexical generalization with our probabilistic lexical generalization approach.",
        "In doing so, we provide first results on the application to French parsing of WordNet automatic sense ranking (ASR), using the method of McCarthy et al. (2004).",
        "For clustering we deviate from most previous work, which has integrated Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) into parsing models, and instead use distributional lexical semantics to create both a distributional thesaurus - for probabilistic generalization in the lemma space and ASR calculation - and to perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).",
        "Though unlexicalized syntactic HAC clustering has been used to improve English dependency parsing (Sagae and Gordon, 2009), we provide first results on using distributional lexical semantics for French parsing.",
        "We also include an out-of-domain evaluation on medical and parliamentary text in addition to an in-domain evaluation.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the lexical target spaces used in this paper, as well as the method of integrating probabilistic lexical information into a feature vector for classification.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss dependency structure and transition-based parsing.",
        "In Section 4 we present the experimental setup, which includes our parser implementation, the construction of our probabilistic lexical resources, and evaluation settings.",
        "We report parsing results both in-domain and out-of-domain in Section 5, we provide a summary of related work in Section 6, and we conclude in Section 7."

        "Probabilities for the lemma space were calculated using the distributional thesaurus, and probabilities for the WordNet synset space were calculated using ASR sense prevalence scores, with probabilistic clusters left for future work.",
        "Our experiments with an arc-eager transition-based dependency parser resulted in modest but significant improvements in LAS over the baseline when parsing out-of-domain medical text.",
        "However, we did not see statistically significant improvements over the baseline when parsing in-domain text or out-of-domain parliamentary text.",
        "An explanation for this result is that the French Treebank training set vocabulary has a very high lexical coverage over the evaluation sets in these domains, suggesting that lexical generalization does not provide much additional benefit.",
        "Comparing the standard single-mapping approach to the probabilistic generalization approach, we found a slightly (though not significantly) better performance for probabilistic generalization across different parsing configurations and evaluation sets.",
        "However, the probabilistic approach also has the downside of a slower running time.",
        "Based on the findings in this paper, our focus for future work on lexical generalization for dependency parsing is to continue improving parsing performance on out-of-domain text, specifically for those domains where lexical variation is high with respect to the training set.",
        "One possibility is to experiment with building a distributional thesaurus that uses text from both the source and target domains, similar to what Candito et al. (2011) did with Brown clustering, which may lead to a stronger bridging effect across domains for probabilistic lexical generalization methods."
