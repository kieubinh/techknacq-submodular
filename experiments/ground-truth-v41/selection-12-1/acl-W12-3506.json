        "The ALADIN learning framework consists of several modules, which are shown schematically in Fig. 1.",
        "On the left-hand side, the provided input is shown, which consists of a spoken utterance (command) coupled with a control input, such as the button press on a remote control or a mouse click, possibly augmented with the internal state of a device (for example the current volume of a television).",
        "In order to provide a common framework for all possible actions we wish to distinguish, we adopt the use of frames, a data structure that encapsulates the control inputs and/or device states relevant to the execution of each action.",
        "Frames consist of one or multiple slots, which each can take a single value from a set of predefined values.",
        "In Section 2.1 we discuss the frame representation in detail.",
        "During training, the word finding module builds acoustic representations of recurring acoustic patterns, given a (small) set of training commands, each described by a frame description and features extracted from the audio signal.",
        "Using the frame description, the module maps such acoustic representations to each slot-value pair in each frame.",
        "When using the framework for decoding spoken commands, the output of the module is a score for each slot-value pair in each frame, representing the probability that this slot-value pair was present in the spoken command.",
        "During training, the grammar induction module builds a model of the grammatical constructs employed by the user, using the frame description and the output of the word finding module.",
        "The output of the word finding module consists of estimates of the slot-value pair scores described above, based on the presence of automatically derived recurring acoustic patterns.",
        "The semantics module, operational during decoding, processes the output of the word finding module to create a single frame description most likely to match the spoken command.",
        "This can then be converted to a control representation the target device can work with.",
        "The module can make use of a grammar module that describes which slot-value pair combinations (and sequences) are likely to occur for each frame.",
        "Such a grammar description should ideally be provided by the grammar induction module, but could optionally be hand-crafted."

        "In our framework, we consider each unique slot-value pair of each frame (for example <to suit>=h of the frame movecard) as a single label, making the total number of labels M0 equal to the cumulative number of different values in all slots in all frames.",

        "This is also likely given the complexity of the learning task: In Patience, about half of the spoken commands pertains to dealcard frames, which means it is very likely that some slot-value pairs have never even occurred in the training data, even after 200 spoken commands.",
        "We expect, however, that we need at least a few repetitions of each slot-value pair to build a robust acoustic representation: the accuracy of correctly detecting the dealcard frame, which has many repetitions in the training data, is close to 100% for all speakers.",
        "Given such data scarcity, the fact that we obtain accuracies up to 76% is encouraging.",

        "With the dealcard typically recognized correctly, this may account both for some of the differences between speakers, as well as for the variation between training sizes observed for some speakers: If the number of movecard frames in the test set is small, this makes the average accuracy more sensitive to errors on these frames.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a self-learning framework for a vocal interface that can be used with any language, dialect, vocabulary and grammar.",
        "In addition to a description of the overall learning framework and its internal knowledge representation, we described the two building blocks that will provide vocabulary learning and grammar induction.",
        "Our experiments show encouraging results, both for vocabulary learning and grammar induction, when applied to the very challenging task of a vocally guided card game, Patience, with only limited training data.",
        "Although the word finding experiments use the oracle action frames rather than the automatically generated frames as supervision information, the preliminary experiments shown in this work are promising enough to have confidence that even with this additional source of uncertainty, the goal of a self-learning vocal interface is feasible.",
        "The concept tagging experiments show that this type of representation is learnable in a supervised way with a high degree of accuracy on the basis of a relatively limited amount of data.",
        "Future experiments will investigate how unsupervised learning techniques can be used to bootstrap concept tagging without using annotated and manually transcribed data.",
        "This will enable the output of the grammar module to replace the manually crafted grammar currently used by the word finding module.",
        "Since the learning curves for the word finding module still show significant room for improvement, more data will need to be collected to adequately investigate the interaction between the two modules.",
        "We expect the word finding results to improve once speaker-specific grammars, provided by the grammar induction module, can be incorporated.",
        "The hand-crafted grammar employed in the word finding experiments include almost all variations, while a speaker-specific grammar will typically be more restrictive.",
        "Another practical approach to improve the user experience is to have the ALADIN system produce an ordered set of several possible frame descriptions, based on the knowledge of the playing field and the rules of the game.",
        "Preliminary experiments revealed that even with a small ordered set of only five frame candidates, the slot-value accuracy of the Patience word finding experiments increased by 10% to 20% absolute.",
        "Furthermore, we expect the number of repetitions needed for each slot-value pair to reduce substantially if we allow sharing of the acoustic representations between slots.",
        "For example, it is very likely that the user will refer to the suit of ?hearts?",
        "the same way, regardless of whether it occurs in a from slot or in a to slot.",
        "While the self-learning modules have not yet been integrated and while there is still ample room for improvement within each module individually, the results of the feasibility experiments described in this paper are encouraging.",
        "The insights gained from these experiments form a solid basis for further experimentation and will serve to further streamline the development of a language independent, self-learning command & control vocal interface for people with a physical impairment."
