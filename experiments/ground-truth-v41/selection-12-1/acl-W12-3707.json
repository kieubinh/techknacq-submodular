        "Several researches then tried syntactic-statistical techniques for polarity classification, reporting good accuracy (Seeker et al., 2009; Moilanen et al., 2010), making the two-step methodology (sentiment lexicon followed by further NLP techniques) the standard method for polarity classification.",
