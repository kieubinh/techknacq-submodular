        "Together with the increase in the access to technology and the Internet, the past years have shown a steady growth of the volume of user-generated contents on the Web.",
        "The diversity of topics covered by this data (mostly containing subjective and opinionated content) in the new textual types such as blogs, fora, microblogs, has been proven to be of tremendous value to a whole range of applications, in Economics, Social Science, Political Science, Marketing, to mention just a few.",
        "Notwithstanding these proven advantages, the high quantity of user-generated contents makes this information hard to access and employ without the use of automatic mechanisms.",
        "This issue motivated the rapid and steady growth in interest from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community to develop computational methods to analyze subjectivity and sentiment in text.",
        "Different methods have been proposed to deal with these phenomena for the distinct types of text and domains, reaching satisfactory levels of performance for English.",
        "Nevertheless, for certain applications, such as news monitoring, the information in languages other than English is also highly relevant and cannot be disregarded.",
        "Additionally, systems dealing with sentiment analysis in the context of monitoring must be reliable and perform at similar levels as the ones implemented for English.",
        "Although the most obvious solution to these issues of multilingual sentiment analysis would be to use machine translation systems, researchers in sentiment analysis have been reluctant to using such technologies due to the low performance they used to have.",
        "However, in the past years, the performance of Machine Translation systems has steadily improved.",
        "Open access solutions (e.g. Google Translate1, Bing Translator2) offer more and more accurate translations for frequently used languages.",
        "Bearing these thoughts in mind, in this article we study the manner in which sentiment analysis can be done for languages other than English, using",
        "this issue in three languages - French, German and Spanish - using three different Machine Translation systems - Google Translate, Bing Translator and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We employ these systems to obtain training and test data for these three languages and subsequently extract features that we employ to build machine learning models using Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization.",
        "We additionally employ meta-classifiers to test the possibility to minimize the impact of noise (incorrect translations) in the obtained data.",
        "Our experiments show that machine translation systems are mature enough to be employed for multilingual sentiment analysis and that for some languages (for which the translation quality is high enough) the performance that can be attained is similar to that of systems implemented for English."

        "Most of the research in subjectivity and sentiment analysis was done for English.",
        "However, there were some authors who developed methods for the mapping of subjectivity lexicons to other languages.",
        "To this aim, (Kim and Hovy, 2006) use a machine translation system and subsequently use a subjectivity analysis system that was developed for English to create subjectivity analysis resources in other languages.",
        "(Mihalcea et al., 2009) propose a method to learn multilingual subjective language via cross-language projections.",
        "They use the Opinion Finder lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) and use two bilingual English-Romanian dictionaries to translate the words in the lexicon.",
        "Since word ambiguity can appear (Opinion Finder does not mark word senses), they filter as correct translations only the most frequent words.",
        "The problem of translating multi-word expressions is solved by translating word-by-word and filtering those translations that occur at least three times on the Web.",
        "Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored by Banea et al. (Banea et al., 2008b).",
        "To this aim, the authors perform three different experiments, obtaining promising results.",
        "In the first one, they automatically translate the annotations of the MPQA corpus and thus obtain subjectivity annotated sentences in Romanian.",
        "In the second approach, they use the automatically translated entries in the Opinion Finder lexicon to annotate a set of sentences in Romanian.",
        "In the last experiment, they reverse the direction of translation and verify the assumption that subjective language can be translated and thus new subjectivity lexicons can be obtained for languages with no such resources.",
        "Further on, another approach to building lexicons for languages with scarce resources is presented by Banea et al. (Banea et al., 2008a).",
        "In this research, the authors apply bootstrapping to build a subjectivity lexicon for Romanian, starting with a set of seed subjective entries, using electronic bilingual dictionaries and a training set of words.",
        "They start with a set of 60 words pertaining to the categories of noun, verb, adjective and adverb from the translations of words in the Opinion Finder lexicon.",
        "Translations are filtered using a measure of similarity to the original words, based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) scores.",
        "Yet another approach to mapping subjectivity lexica to other languages is proposed by Wan (2009), who uses co-training to classify un-annotated Chinese reviews using a corpus of annotated English reviews.",
        "He first translates the English reviews into Chinese and subsequently back to English.",
        "He then performs co-training using all generated corpora.",
        "(Kim et al., 2010) create a number of systems consisting of different subsystems, each classifying the subjectivity of texts in a different language.",
        "They translate a corpus annotated for subjectivity analysis (MPQA), the subjectivity clues (Opinion finder) lexicon and retrain a Nave Bayes classifier that is implemented in the Opinion Finder system using the newly generated resources for all the languages considered.",
        "Finally, (Banea et al., 2010) translate the MPQA corpus into five other languages (some with a similar ethimology, others with a very different structure).",
        "Subsequently, they expand the feature space used in a Nave Bayes classifier using the same data translated to 2 or 3 other languages.",
        "Their conclusion is that by expanding the feature space with data from other languages performs almost as well as training a classifier for just one language on a large set of training data.",
        "Attempts of using machine translation in different natural language processing tasks have not been widely used due to poor quality of translated texts,",
        "but recent advances in Machine Translation have motivated such attempts.",
        "In Information Retrieval, (Savoy and Dolamic, 2009) proposed a comparison between Web searches using monolingual and translated queries.",
        "On average, the results show a drop in performance when translated queries are used, but it is quite limited, around 15%.",
        "For some language pairs, the average result obtained is around 10% lower than that of a monolingual search while for other pairs, the retrieval performance is clearly lower.",
        "In cross-language document summarization, (Wan et al., 2010; Boudin et al., 2010) combined the MT quality score with the informativeness score of each sentence in a set of documents to automatically produce summary in a target language using a source language texts.",
        "In (Wan et al., 2010), each sentence of the source document is ranked according both the scores, the summary is extracted and then the selected sentences translated to the target language.",
        "Differently, in (Boudin et al., 2010), sentences are first translated, then ranked and selected.",
        "Both approaches enhance the readability of the generated summaries without degrading their content."

        "To limit these problems, we test three different classification approaches showing that bagging has a positive impact in the results.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate different document representations, in particular we believe that the projection of our documents in space where the features belong to a sentiment lexical and include syntax information can reduce the impact of the translation errors.",
        "As well we are interested to evaluate different term weights such as tf-idf."
