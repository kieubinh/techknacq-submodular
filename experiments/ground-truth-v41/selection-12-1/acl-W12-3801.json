        "Although they are often not consciously realized, disfluencies are common in everyday speech.",
        "In an overview of several studies, Fox Tree (1995) estimates that approximately 6% of speech is disfluent.",
        "Disfluencies include filled pauses, silent pauses, edited or repeated words, and sounds such as clearing one's throat or click noises.",
        "Disfluencies affect the way that listeners comprehend speech in learning situations (Barr, 2003), formulate opinions of the speaker as being more or less fluent (Lo?vgren and van Doorn, 2005), and even parse grammatically complex sentences (Bailey and Ferreira, 2003).",
        "Since disfluencies are generally absent in written text, they are irrelevant when analyzing text for extra-propositional meaning, such as uncertainty or modality (Vincze et al., 2008, for example).",
        "In contrast, when studying meaning in spoken language, disfluencies provide information about a speaker's cognitive state.",
        "For example, they might indicate cognitive load, uncertainty, confidence, thoughtfulness, problems in reasoning, or stylistic preferences between individuals or groups of individuals.",
        "We study filled pauses (e.g. um and uh) and leave other disfluency types for future work.",
        "The presence of filled pauses could indicate context-dependent facets of cognitive reasoning processes.",
        "We examine filled pauses present in the speech of highly-trained dermatologists who were shown images of dermatological conditions and asked to provide a description and diagnosis.",
        "We look at the difference between two different types of filled pauses: those with nasal consonants, such as um; and those without nasal consonants, such as uh.",
        "We build a computational model to confirm findings that nasal and non-nasal filled pauses differ by prosodic and contextual features.",
        "In addition, we first compare whether there is a difference between filled pause use for variables such as level of physician expertise and gender.",
        "We also examine the relationship of correctness in the diagnostic process with respect to filled pause use.",
        "There is evidence that filled pauses indicate cognitive processing difficulties and could change the",
        "speaker's intended meaning or the listener's perceived meaning of an utterance.",
        "However, such implicit meanings are severely understudied in previous work, especially in specialized, high-stakes domains such as medical diagnostics.",
        "Little is understood about what factors impact the linguistic behavior of using certain filled pauses rather than others, and how the use of filled pauses differs based on level of expertise, gender, or diagnostic correctness.",
        "Looking into these differences is useful to form a better understanding of the relationship between language and specialized decision-making processes.",

        "Filled pauses in English include monosyllables with and without nasal consonants, such as um and uh respectively.",
        "Filled pauses are most common in unstructured, spontaneous speech, but they are also present in prompted, structured speech; and occur in both monologues and dialogues.",
        "Much research has been done into hedging, negation, and other propositional features that change the meaning or modality of phrases (Morante and Sporleder, in press).",
        "Less research has been done into the usage of filled pauses and their relationship to certainty and speculation.",
        "It has been shown that disfluencies are used to indicate uncertainty in speakers?",
        "forthcoming statements or to indicate that the speaker is engaged in the discourse but working to formulate their response (Brennan and Williams, 1995; Smith and Clark, 1993).",
        "These studies found that speakers less confident of their answers take longer to answer and use more disfluencies.",
        "Recent studies have suggested that disfluencies provide meaningful information about the speaker's cognitive or linguistic processes (Arnold et al., 2003; Bortfeld et al., 2001; Corley and Stewart, 2008; Oviatt, 1995, for example), and are unintentional indications that the speaker is having difficulty formulating upcoming speech.",
        "More specifically, it has been shown that the two major categories of filled pauses, i.e. nasal and non-nasal, are specific indicators of the level of cognitive load, with nasal filled pauses indicating higher load and non-nasal filled pauses indicating lower load.",
        "Barr (2001) performed an experiment in which a speaker described one of several visible images to a listener who then selected the image being described.",
        "In this study as well as in Barr and Seyfiddinipur (2010), listeners focused on a topic that was new to the discourse or exceptionally complex when they heard the speaker say um.",
        "Although they did not differentiate between nasal and non-nasal filled pauses, Arnold et al. (2003; 2007) found in similar experiments that filled pauses often preceded unfamiliar or complex objects.",
        "There is evidence that speakers use filled pauses to indicate different processing difficulties.",
        "Clark and Fox Tree (2002) describe four different filled pauses that are annotated in the corpora they use.",
        "These are uh, um, and their elongated versions u:h and u:m. They argue that each of these corresponds to a different following pause time with uh being followed by the shortest pause time, then u:h, um, and u:m followed by the longest.",
        "It is important to note that their primary corpus is the London-Lund Corpus of Spoken English, in which the pause times were annotated based on the transcriber's estimate of pause time in units of ?one light foot?",
        "or ?one stress unit?",
        "(Clark and Fox Tree, 2002, p. 80) rather than measured in seconds.1 However, studies on filled pauses by Barr (2001) and Smith and Clark (1993) measured the duration of silent pauses in seconds and confirm that um was followed by longer silent pauses than uh.",
        "The hypothesis suggested by Barr, Clark and Fox Tree, and Smith and Clark is that uh indicates a minor delay and lower level of cognitive difficulty while um indicates a major delay due to higher level of difficulty in speech planning and production.",
        "On the other hand, a study by O?Connell and Kowal (2005) refuted the findings of Clark and Fox Tree and showed that specific filled pauses could not predict pause time in their corpus of TV interviews.",
        "O?Connell and Kowal's corpus was six interviews conducted by various TV personnel with 1The difference between listeners?",
        "perception of duration and actual duration is an important one because perceptual and actual duration do not always match (Megyesi and Gustafson-Capkova, 2002; Spinos et al., 2002).",
        "Hillary Clinton because these ?professional speakers?",
        "(O?Connell and Kowal, 2005, p. 560) should be more likely to use filled pauses according to convention.",
        "However, speech in public TV interviews is likely to be preplanned and highly self-monitored by the speakers, and it may not be appropriate to consider this situation a model for spontaneous, less formal, and less public speech.",
        "It has been shown that rate and use of filled pauses can vary widely within certain fields (Schachter et al., 1991), in situations that are more or less structured (Oviatt, 1995), and depending on the formality of the situational context (Bortfeld et al., 2001)."

        "of around 1 second in discourse.",

        "Nasal filled pauses are more likely to be preceded and followed by silent pauses, and these following silent pauses are more likely to be longer.",
        "These findings are reinforced by the computational model which identified the duration of the filled pause, duration of surrounding silences, and pitch as important for classification of filled pause type.",
        "That longer and more frequent silent pauses surround nasal filled pauses supports the hypothesis that nasal filled pauses indicate a higher level of cognitive load (Clark and Fox Tree, 2002) or a topic that is new to the discourse or unusually complex (Barr, 2001; Barr and Seyfiddinipur, 2010).",
        "The lack of differences in use of filled pauses by speaker gender given the differences found by Acton (2011), Binnenpoorte et al. (2005), and Bortfeld et al. (2001) shows that more research is needed to understand gender variation in speech.",
        "Another finding was that level of expertise influenced the use of filled pauses and overall narrative length.",
        "On average, attending physicians spoke longer, said more, used more filled pauses, and had a higher percentage of nasal filled pauses.",
        "Attending physicians also had slightly higher holistic expert and correctness scores and were more likely to provide medical lesion morphology, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis.",
        "We believe that attending physicians likely noticed more about the images due to their experience.",
        "The differences by level of expertise (in our study, between attending and resident physicians) need to be verified and compared with more data and in non-medical fields.",
        "The differences could also be related to teaching experience of the attending physicians, so further research could compare experienced physicians who are also teachers with those who are not, and if their speaking style affects students?",
        "comprehension.",
        "In general, differences in linguistic behaviors in relation to levels of expertise deserve more research, and might have long-term implications for development of clinical decision-support and training systems.",
        "The information used by the physicians in our study was limited; they were only shown images of dermatological conditions without being able to examine the patient, run diagnostic tests, or have a patient history.",
        "This may have changed their the behavior, along with factors such as the difficulty of diagnosis of each image and their role in the Master-Apprentice scenario.",
        "Understanding how these variables affect the diagnostic process of physicians could help us understand how disfluencies are impacted by the contexts of diagnostic decision-making.",
        "The differences found between the use of filled pauses based on level of expertise and on the correctness of narratives seem to indicate that filled pauses could provide partial information about the experts?",
        "decision-making process as well as level of confidence and certainty.",
        "This is especially important in the medical domain in order to understand how physicians?",
        "verbal behaviors are interpreted by other physicians as well as by patients and students.",
        "We recently collected a similar, larger data set and we plan to further examine differences based on expertise in this new corpus.",
        "In the recent data collection, observers were also asked to rate their level of certainty about the diagnosis.",
        "This provides the opportunity to examine the relationship between disfluencies and certainty.",
        "We have eye-tracking data for both studies and future work will also look at eye-movements in relation to the use of filled and silent pauses, certainty, expertise level, and cognitive load."
