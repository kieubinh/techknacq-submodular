        "The recent paper by Blanco & Moldovan (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011) has highlighted the fact that negation in natural language is more that just a propositional logic operator.",
        "The central claims of the paper are that negation conveys implicit positivity more than half of the time and that such positivity is both reliably annotatable by humans and promisingly learnable by machine.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate their annotation process and propose a different model that incorporates the pragmatic concept that discourse is guided by questions under discussion (QUDs), often implicit issues that hearers and speakers are attending to.",

        "426) We believe these examples are incorrectly annotated, but in somewhat different ways.",
        "Following Blanco & Moldovan, assume that focus of negation is diagnosed by an implication that some alternative to the focus would make a sentence true.",
        "Then in (1a), in which the focus is annotated as being on the negative polarity item any moxie, any resistance, it is not clear that there is focus at all.",
        "If there were, the sentence would imply that the pilots in question showed something but not some moxie.",
        "This doesn't seem to be the meaning intended.",
        "In contrast, in (1b), we agree that focus is present, but take it to be on the phrase 90 mph, as is confirmed",

        "In these and following examples, we indicate the PB-FOC focus by emboldening and our suggested alternative (if present) by italics",
        "by the overt contrast that follows.",
        "Finally, (1c) and (1d) both show something more complex; in (1c) the scalar quantifier some is not in the scope of negation (lest it mean no shows impress), and thus cannot be a focus.",
        "Nonetheless, we agree that a positive implicature arises here (namely, that some shows do impress), but we suggest that this is simply a fact about scalar implicatures.",
        "Finally, in (1d), in which the verb believe is a so-called neg-raiser (a predicate P such that ?P (x) ?",
        "P (?x)), the implicit positivity about a belief the doctors have is not due to pragmatic focus, but a lexical property of the verb in question.",
        "In sum, what worried us was the variety of constructions being considered equivalent.",
        "In order to respond to these concerns, we reannotated 2304 sentences from the development subcorpus, being careful to try to tease apart the relevant distinctions mentioned above.",
        "This paper documents that effort.",
        "Our central finding is that the PB-FOC data contains an overabundance of focus-marked phrases (i.e., cases like (1a)): the PB-FOC rate of focus marking in our subcorpus is 74% (somewhat higher than the 65% for the whole dataset), while we observed a rate of 50%.",
        "Although the reduction in focus-marking occurs across all Propbank role types, we show that it is highest with the A1 and AM-MNR roles.",
        "One central reason for the overmarking, we argue, is that the definition of focus of negation Blanco & Moldovan use is somewhat vague, allowing one to confuse emphasis with implicit positivity.",
        "We argue instead that although they are right to correlate stress with focus (by and large), focus is connected to referencing a QUD (Rooth, 1996; Roberts, 1996; Kadmon, 2001), and only indirectly leads to positivity."

        "They further argue that when there is a focus of negation, it yields a corresponding positive inference.",
        "This idea has roots in Jackendoff's seminal theory of focus (Jackendoff, 1972).",
        "Jackendoff proposes a) that focus in general (with or without negation) partitions a sentence into a function, obtained by lambda abstracting over the focused constituent and b) that negation is a focus-sensitive operator, stating that the function applied to the focused constituent yields falsity.",
        "To capture the positive inference cases, Jackendoff initially claims",

        "clearly does not lead to the inference that Bill likes someone, even when anybody is strongly stressed.",
        "More contemporary work (Rooth, 1996; Roberts, 1996) has instead argued that what focus presupposes is that there is a relevant question under discussion (QUD).",
        "In the case of 2, it is the question (6) Who does Bill like?",
        "The QUD model assumes that dialogue is structured in terms of currently relevant (often implicit) questions, which serve to explain how a coherent discourse arises.",

        "This serves to explain Jackendoff's counterexample (5) ?",
        "anybody is focused because the question (6) is currently relevant.",
        "Under this account, focus of negation does not automatically yield an existential positive inference, but only if the corresponding QUD is assumed to exclude negative answers (i.e., if it is assumed that no one is not a suitable answer to Who does Bill like?).",

        "However, there is another way of yielding positive inferences to negated sentences, relying merely on the familiar theory of scalar implicature.",
        "Consider (7) below, which involves the scalar expression much (roughly equivalent to a lot).",
