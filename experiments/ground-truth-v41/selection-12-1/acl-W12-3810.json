        "Subjectivity analysis is a thriving field within natural language processing.",
        "However, most research into subjectivity has focused on sentiment with respect to concrete things such as product debates (e.g., (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), (Yu et al., 2011)) and movie reviews (e.g., (He et al., 2011), (Maas et al., 2011), (Pang and Lee, 2004)).",
        "Analysis often follows the opinion-target paradigm, in which expressions of sentiment are assessed with respect to the aspects of the object(s) under consideration towards which they are targeted.",
        "For example, in the domain of smartphone reviews, aspects could include product features such as the keyboard, screen quality, and battery life.",
        "Although sentiment analysis is interesting and important in its own right, this paradigm does not seem to be the best match for fine-grained analysis of ideological domains.",
        "While sentiment is also present in documents from this domain, previous work (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010) has found that arguing subjectivity, a less-studied form of subjectivity, is more frequently employed and more relevant for a robust assessment of ideological positions.",
        "Whereas sentiment conveys the polarity of a writer's affect towards a topic, arguing subjectivity is a type of linguistic subjectivity in which a person expresses a controversial belief about what is true or what action ought to be taken regarding a central contentious issue (Somasundaran, 2010).",
        "For example, consider this sentence about health care reform:",
        "(1) Almost everyone knows that we",
        "must start holding insurance companies accountable and give Americans a greater sense of stability and security when it comes to their health care.",
        "In a traditional opinion-target or sentiment-topic paradigm, perhaps this sentence could be labeled as containing a negative sentiment towards a topic representing ?insurance companies?, or a positive sentiment towards a topic representing ?stability?",
        "or ?security?.",
        "However, a reader of a political editorial or blog may be more interested in why the author is negative to",
        "wards insurers, and how the author proposes to improve stability of the healthcare system.",
        "By focusing on the arguments conveyed through arguing subjectivity, we aim to capture these kind of conceptual reasons an author provides when arguing for his or her position.",
        "However, identifying when someone is arguing is only part of the challenge.",
        "Since arguing subjectivity is used to express arguments, the next natural step is to identify the argument being expressed through each instance of arguing subjectivity.",
        "To illustrate this distinction, consider the following three example spans:",
        "(2) the bill is a job destroyer (3) President Obamas signature do",
        "mestic policy will throw 100,000 people out of work come January (4) he can't expand his business because he can't afford the burden of Obamacare Each of these examples contains arguing subjectivity, but more importantly, each expresses roughly the same idea, namely, that the recently-passed health care reform bill will cause economic harm.",
        "This latent, shared idea giving rise to each of the three spans is what we mean by ?argument tag?.",
        "However, although all three are related, example spans (2) and (3) are more similar than (4) in terms of the notions they convey: while the first two explicitly are concerned with the loss of jobs, the last focuses on business expansion and the economy as a whole.",
        "If we were to tag these three spans with respect to the argument that each is making, should they all receive the same tag, or should (4)'s tag be different?",
        "To address these challenges, we propose in this work a new annotation scheme for identifying arguing subjectivity and a hierarchical model for organizing ?argument tags?.",
        "In our hierarchical model, (4) would receive a different tag from (2) and (3), but because of the tags?",
        "relatedness all would share the same parent tag.",
        "In addition to presenting this new scheme for labeling arguing subjectivity, we also explore sentiment, discourse, and distributional similarity as tools to enhance identification and classification of arguing subjectivity.",
        "Finally, we also investigate splitting the arguing subjectivity detection task up into two distinct phases: identifying expressions of arguing subjectivity, and labelling each such expression with an appropriate argument tag.",
        "Since no corpora annotated for arguing subjectivity yet exist, we gather and annotate a corpus of blog posts and op-eds about a controversial topic, namely, the recently-passed ?ObamaCare?",

        "To address the first goal, our annotators manually identified and annotated spans of text containing arguing subjectivity using the GATE environment1.",
        "Annotators were instructed to identify spans of 1 sentence or less in which a writer ?conveys a controversial private state concerning what she believes to be true or what action she believes should be taken?",
        "concerning the health care reform debate.",
        "To train our annotators to recognize arguing subjectivity, we performed several rounds of practice on a separate dataset.",
        "Between each round, our annotators met to discuss their annotations and resolve disagreements.",
        "As a heuristic to help distinguish between borderline sentences, we advised our annotators to imagine disputants from each side writing the sentence in isolation.",
        "If a disputant from either side could conceivably write the sentence, then the sentence is likely objective.",
        "For example, statements of accepted facts and statistics generally fall into this category.",
        "However, if only one side could conceivably be the author of the sentence, it is highly likely that the sentence expresses a controversial belief relevant to the debate and thus should be labeled as subjective.",
        "Next, the annotators labeled each arguing span with an argument tag.",
        "As illustrated in earlier examples, an argument tag represents a",
        "controversial abstract belief expressed through arguing subjectivity.",
        "Since the meanings of many tags may be related, we organize these tags in a hierarchical ?stance structure?.",

        "Because each stance contains a large number of argument tags, we back-off from each secondary argument tag to its primary argument parent for the classification experiments.",

        "and ?anti?",
        "stances separately, building separate classifiers for each stance for each of the above tasks.",
        "In general, we perform single-label classification at the sentence level.",
        "However, sentences containing multiple labels pose a challenge.",
        "Since this was an early exploratory work on a very difficult task, we decided to handle this situation by splitting sentences containing multiple labels into separate instances for the purpose of learning, assigning a single label to each instance.",
        "However, only about 3% of the sentences in our corpus contained multiple la",
        "bels.",
        "Thus, replacing this splitting step in the future with another method that does not require oracle information, such as choosing the label which covers the most words in the sentence, is a reasonable simplification of the task.",
        "Since discourse actions, such as contrasting, restating, and identifying causation, play a substantial role in arguing, we hypothesize that information about the discourse roles played by a span of text will help improve classification.",
        "Although discourse parsers historically haven't been found to be effective for subjectivity analysis, a new parser (Lin et al., 2010) trained on the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) tagset (Prasad et al., 2008) has recently been released.",

        "Since PDTB contains many fine-grained discourse relations, we replace each discourse relationship type inferred by the discourse parser with the parent top-level PDTB discourse relationship class.",
