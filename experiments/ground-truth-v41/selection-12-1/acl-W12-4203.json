        "Due to the lack of such training data, the SMT systems do not perform as well as they could.",
        "Especially when it comes to negation, it is important that the basic semantics is preserved, i.e. a negated statement should not be translated as a positive one and vice versa.",
        "Given a state-of-the-art baseline Japanese-English SMT system, a separate evaluation on the semantic level of negative only vs. positive only test data reveals the considerably poorer performance on the negative test set.",
        "This tendency and the importance of preserving a negated statement motivates experiments with improving performance on negative sentences.",
        "Providing more training data for negative sentences should even out the discrepancy of the performance between the above mentioned negative and positive test data.",
        "We present a method where a large amount of negative training data is obtained by rephrasing the original training data.",
        "The rephrasing is performed on the semantic level to ensure high reliability and quality of the generated data.",
        "Simple rewriting based on the surface or syntactic level would require complex language specific rules, which is not desirable.",
        "Working on the semantic structure exploits the fact that these representations abstract away from language specific structures.",
        "Thus, our approach can be easily implemented for other languages, provided there are grammars available for both languages involved in the desired parallel corpus.",

        "This paper first describes related work in the following section.",
        "Section 3 presents a semantic analysis of the data with respect to negation and provides some distributional statistics.",
