        "Manual evaluation of machine translation output is a tricky enterprise.",
        "It has been long recognized that different evaluation techniques lead to different outcomes, e.g. Blanchon et al. (2004) mention an evaluation carried out in 1972 where the very same Russian-to-English MT outputs were scored 4.5 out of the maximum 5 points by prospective users of the system but only 1 out of 5 by teachers of English.",
        "Throughout the years, many techniques were explored with more or less of a success.",
        "The two-scale scoring for adequacy and fluency used in NIST evaluation has been abandoned by some evaluation campaigns, most notably the WMT shared task series, see Koehn and Monz (2006) through Callison-Burch et al. (2012)1.",
        "Since 2008, WMT uses a simple relative ranking of MT outputs as its primary manual evaluation technique: the annotator is presented with up to 5 MT outputs for a given input sentence and the task is to rank them from best to worst (ties allowed) on whatever criteria he or she deems appropriate.",
        "While this single-scale relative ranking is perhaps faster to annotate and reaches a higher inter-and intra-annotator agreement than the (absolute) fluency and adequacy (Callison-Burch et al., 2007), the technique and its evaluation are still far from satisfactory.",
        "Bojar et al.",
        "(2011) observe several discrepancies in the interpretation of the rankings, partly due to the high load on human annotators (the comparison of several long sentences at once, among other issues) but partly also due to technicalities of the calculation.",
        "Lo and Wu (2011a) present an interesting evaluation technique called MEANT (or HMEANT if carried out by humans), the core of which lies in assessing whether the key elements in the predicate-argument structure of the sentence have been preserved.",
        "In other words, lay annotators are checking, if they recognize who did what to whom, when, where and why from the MT outputs and whether the respective role fillers convey the same meaning as in the reference translation.",
        "HMEANT has been shown to correlate reasonably well with manual adequacy and ranking evaluations.",
        "It is relatively fast and should lend itself to full automatization.",
        "On the other hand, HMEANT was so far tested only on translation into English and with just three competing MT systems.",
        "In this work, we extend the application of HMEANT to evaluating MT into Czech, a morphologically rich language with relatively free word order.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the technical details of HMEANT and relates HMEANT to an established linguistic theory that underlies the Prague dependency treebanks (Hajic?",
        "et al, 2006; Hajic?",
        "et al, 2012) and several other works.",
        "We also suggest possible benefits of this coupling such as the reuse of tools.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the setup and results of our HMEANT experiment.",
        "Since this is the first time HMEANT is applied to a new language, Section 4 constitutes the main contribution of this work.",
        "We point out at several problems of HMEANT and propose a remedy, the empirical evaluation of which however remains for future work.",
        "Section 5 concludes our observations."

        "The complete guidelines for SRL are given in Figure 1 and it takes less than 15 minutes to train an unskilled person.",

        "An important element of FGD is the valency theory (Panevova?, 1980) which introduces empirical linguistic tests to distinguish between what other theories would call complements vs. adjuncts and postulates the relationship between the set of verb modifiers as observed in the sentence and the set of valency slots that should be listed in a valency dictionary.",

        "Both languages include their respective valency lexicons and the work on a bilingual valency lexicon is being developed (S?indlerova?",
        "and Bojar, 2010).",

        "Most of them are now part of the Treex platform (Popel and Z?abokrtsky?, 2010)4 and they were successfully used in automatic annotation of 15 million parallel sentences (Bojar et al., 2012)5 as well as other NLP tasks including English-to-Czech MT.",
        "Recently, significant effort was also invested in parsing not quite correct output of MT systems into Czech for the purposes of rule-based grammar correction (Rosa et al., 2012).",
