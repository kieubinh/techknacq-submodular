        "In this paper we investigate an unsupervised approach to estimate the degree of contribution of each semantic role type in semantic translation evaluation in low cost without using a human-ranked training corpus but still yields a evaluation metric that correlates comparably with human adequacy judgments to that of recent supervised approaches as in Lo and Wu (2011a, b, c).",
        "The new approach is motivated by an analysis showing that the distribution of the weights learned from the supervised training is similar to the relative frequencies of the occurrences of each semantic role in the reference translation.",
        "We then introduce a relative frequency weighting scheme to approximate the importance of each semantic role type.",
        "With such simple weighting scheme, the cost of evaluating translation of languages with fewer resources available is greatly reduced.",
        "For the past decade, the task of measuring the performance of MT systems has relied heavily on lexical n-gram based MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), PER (Tillmann et al., 1997), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006) and WER (Nie?en et al., 2000) because of their support on fast and inexpensive evaluation.",
        "These metrics are good at ranking overall systems by averaging their scores over the entire document.",
        "As MT systems improve, the focus of MT evaluation changes from generally reflecting the quality of each system to assisting error analysis on each MT output in detail.",
        "The failure of such metrics in evaluating translation quality on sentence level are becoming more apparent.",
        "Though containing roughly the correct words, the MT output as a whole sentence is still quite incomprehensible and fails to express meaning that is close to the input.",
        "Lexical n-gram based evaluation metrics are surface-oriented and do not do so well at ranking translations according to adequacy and are particularly poor at reflecting significant translation quality improvements on more meaningful word sense or semantic frame choices which human judges can indicate clearly.",
        "Callison-Burch et al. (2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006) even reported cases where BLEU strongly disagrees with human judgment on translation quality.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2005) proposed STM, a structural approach based on syntax to addresses the failure of lexical similarity based metrics in evaluating translation grammaticality.",
        "However, a grammatical translation can achieve a high syntax-based score but still contains meaning errors arising from confusion of semantic roles.",
        "On the other hand, despite the fact that non-automatic, manually evaluations, such as HTER (Snover et al., 2006), are more adequacy oriented and show a high correlation with human adequacy judgment, the high labor cost prohibits their widespread use.",
        "There was also work on explicitly evaluating MT adequacy with aggregated linguistic features (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2007, 2008) and textual entailment (Pad√≥ et al., 2009).",
        "In the work of Lo and Wu (2011a), MEANT and its human variants HMEANT were introduced and empirical experimental results showed that HMEANT, which can be driven by low-cost monolingual semantic roles annotators with high inter-annotator agreement, correlates as well as HTER and far superior than BLEU and other surfaced oriented evaluation metrics.",
        "Along with additional improvements to the MEANT family of metrics, Lo and Wu (2011b) detailed the studies of the impact of each individual semantic role to the metric's correlation with human adequacy judgments.",
        "Lo and Wu (2011c) further discussed that with a proper weighting scheme of semantic frame in a sentence, structured semantic role representation is more accurate and intuitive than flattened role representation for semantic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "The recent trend of incorporating more linguistic features into MT evaluation metrics raise the discussion on the appropriate approach in weighting and combining them.",
        "ULC (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2007, 2008) uses uniform weights to aggregate linguistic features.",
        "This approach does not capture the importance of each feature to the overall translation quality to the MT output.",
        "One obvious example of different semantic roles contribute differently to the overall meaning is that readers usually accept translations with errors in adjunct arguments as a valid translation but not those with errors in core arguments.",
        "Unlike ULC, Liu and Gildea (2007); Lo and Wu (2011a) approach the weight estimation problem by maximum correlation training which directly optimize the correlation with human adequacy judgments.",
        "weighting scheme reflecting the degree of contribution of each semantic role type to the semantic frame.",
        "However, the shortcomings of this approach is that it requires a human-ranked training corpus which is expensive, especially for languages with limited resource.",
        "We argue in this paper that for semantic MT evaluation, the importance of each semantic role type can easily be estimated using a simple unsupervised approach which leverage the relative frequencies of the semantic roles appeared in the reference translation.",
        "Our proposed weighting scheme is motivated by an analysis showing that the weights learned from supervised training are distributed in a similar fashion to the relative frequencies of the semantic roles.",
        "Our results show that the semantic MT evaluation metric using the relative frequency weighting scheme to approximate the importance of each semantic role type correlates comparably with human adequacy judgments to previous metrics that use maximum correlation training, which requires expensive human rankings of adequacy over a training corpus.",
