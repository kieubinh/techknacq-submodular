        "In previous work (Pyysalo et al., 2012b), we studied the classification of isolated noun phrases extracted from PubMed to identify anatomy terms.",
        "Travillian et al. (2011) considered two lexical matching applications to detect anatomical entities from two OBO resources in user-provided terms.",
        "However, these efforts have not involved the annotation or detection of mentions in context, which we view as critical for real-world entity mention detection method development and evaluation."

        "We have introduced a manually annotated corpus for open-domain anatomical entity mention detection, consisting of 500 documents (over 90,000 words) drawn from publication abstracts and full texts.",
        "The primary corpus annotation consists of the identification of over 3,000 references to both healthy and pathological anatomical entities, marked using a detailed 11-class categorization based on established biomedical domain ontologies.",
        "We demonstrated the use of the new corpus through a comparative evaluation of MetaMap, a general semantic class tagger; NERsuite, a CRF-based machine learning system; and a stacked combination of the two, finding that under a relaxed matching criterion, the combination approaches 80% F-score at mention detection and 70% F-score at mention detection and classification.",
        "This level of performance is encouraging for a first application and suggests that reliable open-domain anatomical entity mention detection is not an unrealistic target.",
        "We hope that the introduced corpus can serve as a reference standard for the further development and evaluation of methods for anatomical entity mention detection.",
        "This corpus, the introduced evaluation tools, and other resources created in this study are made available under open licences from http: //www.nactem.ac.uk/anatomy/."
