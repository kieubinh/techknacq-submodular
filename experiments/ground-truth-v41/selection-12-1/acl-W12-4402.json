        "Names play a significant role in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) systems.",
        "They are important in Cross Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) and Machine Translation (MT) as the system performance has been shown to positively correlate with the correct conversion of names between the languages in several studies (Demner-Fushman and Oard, 2002; Mandl and Womser-Hacker, 2005; Hermjakob et al., 2008; Udupa et al., 2009).",
        "The traditional source for name equivalence, the bilingual dictionaries ?",
        "whether handcrafted or statistical ?",
        "offer only limited support because new names always emerge.",
        "All of the above point to the critical need for robust Machine Transliteration technology and systems.",
        "Much research effort has been made to address the transliteration issue in the research community (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004; Zelenko and Aone, 2006; Sproat et al., 2006; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007; Hermjakob et al., 2008; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Goldwasser and Roth, 2008; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2008; Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Oh and Choi, 2002; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Kang and Choi, 2000; Gao et al., 2004; Zelenko and Aone, 2006; Li et al., 2009b; Li et al., 2009a).",
        "These previous work fall into three categories, i.e., grapheme-based, phoneme-based and hybrid methods.",
        "Grapheme-based method (Li et al., 2004) treats transliteration as a direct orthographic mapping and only uses orthography-related features while phoneme-based method (Knight and Graehl, 1998) makes use of phonetic correspondence to generate the transliteration.",
        "Hybrid method refers to the combination of several different models or knowledge sources to support the transliteration generation.",
        "The first machine transliteration shared task (Li et al., 2009b; Li et al., 2009a) was held in NEWS 2009 at ACL-IJCNLP 2009.",
        "It was the first time to provide common benchmarking data in diverse language pairs for evaluation of state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "While the focus of the 2009 shared task was on establishing the quality metrics and on baselining the transliteration quality based on those metrics, the 2010 shared task (Li et al., 2010a; Li et al., 2010b) expanded the scope of the transliteration generation task to about a dozen languages, and explored the quality depending on the direction of transliteration, between the languages.",
        "In NEWS 2011 (Zhang et al., 2011a; Zhang et al., 2011b), we significantly increased the hand-crafted parallel named entities corpora to include 14 different language pairs from 11 language families, and made them available as the common dataset for the shared task.",

        "Our aim is not only at capturing the name conversion process from a source to a target language, but also at its practical utility for downstream applications, such as CLIR and MT.",
        "Therefore, we adopted the same definition of transliteration as during the NEWS 2009 workshop (Li et al., 2009a) to narrow down ?transliteration?",
        "to three specific requirements for the task, as fol-lows:?Transliteration is the conversion of a given name in the source language (a text string in the source writing system or orthography) to a name in the target language (another text string in the target writing system or orthography), such that the target language name is: (i) phonemically equivalent to the source name (ii) conforms to the phonology of the target language and (iii) matches the user intuition of the equivalent of the source language name in the target language, considering the culture and orthographic character usage in the target language.?",
        "Following NEWS 2011, in NEWS 2012, we still keep the three back-transliteration tasks.",
        "We define back-transliteration as a process of restoring transliterated words to their original languages.",

        "Training and development data in each of the language pairs have been made available to all registered participants for developing a transliteration system for that specific language pair using any approach that they find appropriate.",
        "At the evaluation time, a standard hand-crafted test set consisting of between 500 and 3,000 source names (approximately 5-10% of the training data size) have been released, on which the participants are required to produce a ranked list of transliteration candidates in the target language for each source name.",
        "The system output is tested against a reference set (which may include multiple correct transliterations for some source names), and the performance of a system is captured in multiple metrics (defined in Section 3), each designed to capture a specific performance dimension.",
        "For every language pair each participant is required to submit at least one run (designated as a ?standard?",
        "run) that uses only the data provided by the NEWS workshop organisers in that language pair, and no other data or linguistic resources.",
        "This standard run ensures parity between systems and enables meaningful comparison of performance of various algorithmic approaches in a given language pair.",
        "Participants are allowed to submit more ?standard?",
        "runs, up to 4 in total.",
        "If more than one ?standard?",
        "runs is submitted, it is required to name one of them as a ?primary?",

        "runs could be submitted for every language pair using either data beyond that provided by the shared task organisers or linguistic resources in a specific language, or both.",
        "This essentially may enable any participant to demonstrate the limits of performance of their system in a given language pair.",
        "The shared task timelines provide adequate time for development, testing (more than 1 month after the release of the training data) and the final result submission (4 days after the release of the test data).11"

        "Clearly, the ability of procuring and distributing a reasonably large (approximately 10K paired names for training and testing together) hand-crafted corpora consisting primarily of paired names is critical for this process.",
