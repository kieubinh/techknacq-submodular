        "Named Entity Recognition (NER), the task of identifying Named Entities (NEs) in unstructured texts and classifying them into preselected classes, is one of the most important subtasks in many NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, information extraction or machine translation.",
        "The NER task was introduced with the 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC) in 1995 (Grishman and Sund-heim, 1996).",
        "In MUC shared tasks the NER consists of three subtasks: entity names, temporal and number expressions.",
        "Although there is a general agreement in the NER community about the inclusion of temporal expressions and some numerical expressions, the most studied types are names of persons, locations and organizations.",
        "The fourth type, called ?miscellaneous?, was introduced in the CoNLL NER tasks in 2002 (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) and 2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), and includes proper names falling outside the three classic types.",
        "Since then, MUC and CoNLL datasets and annotation schemes have been the major standards applied in the field of NER.",
        "The standard datasets are highly domain-specific (mostly newswire) and are restricted in size.",
        "Researchers attempting to merge these datasets to get a bigger training corpus are faced with the problem of combining different tagsets and annotation schemes.",
        "Manually annotating large amounts of text with linguistic information is a time-consuming, highly skilled and delicate job, but large, accurately annotated corpora are essential for building robust supervised machine learning NER systems.",
        "Therefore, reducing the annotation cost is a key challenge.",
        "One approach is to generate the resources automatically, another one is to use collaborative annotation and/or collaboratively constructed resources, such as Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Linked Open Data, or DBpedia.",
        "In this paper we combine these approaches by automatically generating freely available NE tagged corpora from Wikipedia.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we give an overview of related work.",
        "Section 3 contains a description of our method, and Section 4 shows how it is applied to Hungarian.",
        "The corpus format is described in Section 5.",

        "The types in DBpedia are organized into a class hierarchy, available as an OWL1 ontology containing 320 frequent entity categories, arranged into a taxonomy under the base class owl:Thing.",

        "As of version 3.7, the DBpedia ontology allows multiple superclasses, making a directed acyclic graph3.",

        "The English WP corpus was evaluated against itself and a manually annotated English corpus.",
        "Since the filtered English WP corpus, containing only the sentences with NEs, is still very large, our experiments were performed with a sample of 3.5 million tokens, the size of our filtered Hungarian corpus, divided into train and test sets (90%-10%).",
        "For English cross-corpus evaluation the CoNLL2003 corpus was chosen.",
        "As is well known, training and testing across different corpora decreases F-measure.",
        "Domain differences certainly affect NER performance, and the different annotation schemes pose several compatibility problems.",
        "Nothman et al.",
        "(2008) showed that each set of gold standard training data performs better on corresponding test sets than on test sets from other sources.",
        "The situation here is similar (see Table 3 for results): the NE tagger trained on WP does not achieve as high performance tested against CoNLL test set (enwiki-CoNLL) as one trained on its own train set (enwiki-enwiki).",
        "WP-derived corpora can also be used for improving NER accuracy in other ways.",
        "First, we collected gazetteer lists from the corpus for each NE category, which improved the overall F-measure given to the NE tagger training and testing on CoNLL dataset (CoNLL with wikilists).",
        "A second trial was labeling the CoNLL datasets by the model trained on WP corpus, and giving these labels as extra features to the next CoNLL train (CoNLL with wikitags).",
        "Both methods result in improved F-measure on CoNLL test set.",
        "Since in Hungarian NE tagging we followed the Szeged NER corpus annotation guidelines, we performed the experiments on this dataset.",
        "Hungarian results are similar to the English ones (see Table 1), the only difference is that F-measures for Hungarian are significantly higher.",
        "This can be due to the fact that the MISC category for Hungarian contains less types of names, thus the inconsistency of this class is smaller (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "In contrast to the CoNLL corpus, the Szeged NER corpus was accurately annotated with an inter-annotator agreement over 99%.",
        "Due to the quite good F-measure of training on",
        "our Hungarian train corpus and testing on the corresponding test set, our Hungarian corpus can serve as a training corpus to build NE taggers for non-newswire domains."

      "heading": "7 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have presented freely available NE tagged corpora for English and Hungarian, fully automatically generated from WP.",
        "In contrast to the methods used so far for automatic annotation of NEs in WP texts, we applied a new approach, namely mapping DBpedia ontology classes to standard CoNLL NE tags, and assigning them to WP entities.",
        "Following Nothman (2008), the process can be divided into four main steps: classifying WP articles into entity classes; parsing WP and splitting articles into sentences; labeling NEs in the text; and selecting sentences for inclusion in the corpus.",
        "The huge amount of WP articles opens the possibility of building large enough corpora for otherwise less resourced languages such as Hungarian.",
        "Due to the particularities of Hungarian, some steps are slightly different, and special linguistic phenomena pose several problems related to the NER task to solve.",
        "Automatically generated corpora can be useful for improving NER in more ways.",
        "We showed that gazetteer lists extracted from our corpora, and training with extra features given by the model trained on our corpora, improve F-measure.",
        "Moreover, our Hungarian corpus can serve as a training corpus for more general domains than the classic newswire."
