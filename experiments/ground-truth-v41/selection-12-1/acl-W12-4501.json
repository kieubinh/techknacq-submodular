        "The CoNLL-2012 shared task involved predicting coreference in English, Chinese, and Arabic, using the final version, v5.0, of the OntoNotes corpus.",
        "It was a follow-on to the English-only task organized in 2011.",
        "Until the creation of the OntoNotes corpus, resources in this sub-field of language processing were limited to noun phrase coreference, often on a restricted set of entities, such as the ACE entities.",
        "OntoNotes provides a large-scale corpus of general anaphoric coreference not restricted to noun phrases or to a specified set of entity types, and covers multiple languages.",
        "OntoNotes also provides additional layers of integrated annotation, capturing additional shallow semantic structure.",
        "This paper describes the OntoNotes annotation (coreference and other layers) and then describes the parameters of the shared task including the format, preprocessing information, evaluation criteria, and presents and discusses the results achieved by the participating systems.",
        "The task of coreference has had a complex evaluation history.",
        "Potentially many evaluation conditions, have, in the past, made it difficult to judge the improvement in new algorithms over previously reported results.",
        "Having a standard test set and standard evaluation parameters, all based on a resource that provides multiple integrated annotation layers (syntactic parses, semantic roles, word senses, named entities and coreference) and in multiple languages could support joint modeling and help ground and energize ongoing research in the task of entity and event coreference."

      "text": [
        "The importance of coreference resolution for the entity/event detection task, namely identifying all mentions of entities and events in text and clustering them into equivalence classes, has been well recognized in the natural language processing community.",
        "Early work on corpus-based coreference resolution dates back to the mid-90s by McCarthy and Lenhert (1995) where they experimented with decision trees and handwritten rules.",
        "Corpora to support supervised learning of this task date back to the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997; Chinchor, 2001; Chinchor and Sundheim, 2003).",
        "The de facto standard datasets for current coreference studies are the MUC and the ACE1 (Doddington et al., 2004) corpora.",
        "These corpora were tagged with coreferring entities in the form of noun phrases in the text.",
        "The MUC corpora cover all noun phrases in text but are relatively small in size.",
        "The ACE corpora, on the other hand, cover much more data, but the annotation is restricted to a small subset of entities.",
        "Automatic identification of coreferring entities and events in text has been an uphill battle for several decades, partly because it is a problem that requires world knowledge to solve and word knowledge is hard to define, and partly owing to the lack of substantial annotated data.",
        "Aside from the fact that resolving coreference in text is simply a very hard problem, there have been other hindrances that further contributed to the slow progress in this area: (i) Smaller sized corpora such as MUC which covered coreference across all noun phrases.",
        "Corpora such as ACE which are larger in size, but cover a smaller set of entities; and (ii) low consistency in existing corpora annotated with coreference ?",
        "in terms of inter-annotator agreement (ITA) (Hirschman et al., 1998) ?",
        "owing to attempts at covering multiple coreference phenomena that are not equally annotatable with high agreement which likely lessened the reliability of statistical evidence in the form of lexical coverage and semantic relatedness that could be derived from the data and",
        "used by a classifier to generate better predictive models.",
        "The importance of a well-defined tagging scheme and consistent ITA has been well recognized and studied in the past (Poe-sio, 2004; Poesio and Artstein, 2005; Passonneau, 2004).",
        "There is a growing consensus that in order to take language understanding applications such as question answering or distillation to the next level, we need more consistent annotation for larger amounts of broad coverage data to train better automatic models for entity and event detection.",
        "(iii) Complex evaluation with multiple evaluation metrics and multiple evaluation scenarios, complicated with varying training and test partitions, led to situations where many researchers report results with only one or a few of the available metrics and under a subset of evaluation scenarios.",
        "This has made it hard to gauge the improvement in algorithms over the years (Stoyanov et al., 2009), or to determine which particular areas require further attention.",
        "Looking at various numbers reported in literature can greatly affect the perceived difficulty of the task.",
        "It can seem to be a very hard problem (Soon et al., 2001) or one that is relatively easy (Culotta et al., 2007).",
        "(iv) the knowledge bottleneck which has been a well-accepted ceiling that has kept the progress in this task at bay.",
        "These issues suggest that the following steps might take the community in the right direction towards improving the state of the art in coreference resolution:",
        "(i) Create a large corpus with high inter-annotator agreement possibly by restricting the coreference annotating to phenomena that can be annotated with high consistency, and covering an unrestricted set of entities and events; and (ii) Create a standard evaluation scenario with an official evaluation setup, and possibly several ablation settings to capture the range of performance.",
        "This can then be used as a standard benchmark by the research community.",
        "(iii) Continue to improve learning algorithms that better incorporate world knowledge and jointly",
        "incorporate information from other layers of syntactic and semantic annotation to improve the state of the art.",

        "not only in coreference, but with the various layers of semantics that it tries to capture.",
        "As one of its layers, it has created a corpus for general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a subset of entity types.",
        "The coreference layer in OntoNotes constitutes just one part of a multi-layered, integrated annotation of shallow semantic structures in text with high inter-annotator agreement.",
        "This addresses the first issue.",
        "In the language processing community, the field of speech recognition probably has the longest history of shared evaluations held primary by NIST3 (Pallett, 2002).",
        "In the past decade machine translation has been a topic of shared evaluations also by NIST4.",
        "There are many syntactic and semantic processing tasks that are not quite amenable to such continued evaluation efforts.",
        "The CoNLL shared tasks over the past 15 years have filled that gap, helping establish benchmarks and advance the state of the art in various sub-fields within NLP.",
        "The importance of shared tasks is now in full display in the domain of clinical NLP (Chapman et al., 2011) and recently a coreference task was organized as part of the i2b2 workshop (Uzuner et al., 2012).",
        "The computational learning community is also witnessing a shift towards joint inference based evaluations, with the two previous CoNLL tasks (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajic?",
        "et al, 2009) devoted to joint learning of syntactic and semantic dependencies.",
        "A SemEval2010 coreference task (Recasens et al., 2010) was the first attempt to address the second issue.",
        "It included six different Indo-European languages ?",
        "Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
        "Among other corpora, a small subset (?120K) of English portion of OntoNotes was used for this purpose.",
        "However, the lack of a strong participation prevented the organizers from reaching any firm conclusions.",
        "The CoNLL-2011 shared task was another attempt to address the second issue.",
        "It was well received, but the shared task was only limited to the English portion of OntoNotes.",
        "In addition, the coreference portion of OntoNotes did not have a concrete baseline prior to the 2011 evaluation, thereby making it challenging for participants to gauge the performance of their algorithms in the absence of established state of the art on this flavor of annotation.",
        "The closest comparison was to the results reported by Pradhan et al. (2007b) on the newswire portion of OntoNotes.",
        "Since the corpus also covers two other languages from completely different language families, Chinese and Arabic, it provided a great opportunity to have a follow-on task in 2012 covering all",
        "three languages.",
        "As we will see later, peculiarities of each of these languages had to be considered in creating the evaluation framework.",
        "The first systematic learning-based study in coreference resolution was conducted on the MUC corpora, using a decision tree learner, by Soon et al. (2001).",
        "Significant improvements have been made in the field of language processing in general, and improved learning techniques have pushed the state of the art in coreference resolution forward (Morton, 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2001; McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).",
        "Researchers have continued to find novel ways of exploiting ontologies such as WordNet.",
        "Various knowledge sources from shallow semantics to encyclopedic knowledge have been exploited (Ponzetto and Strube, 2005; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Versley, 2007; Ng, 2007).",
        "Given that WordNet is a static ontology and as such has limitation on coverage, more recently, there have been successful attempts to utilize information from much larger, collaboratively built resources such as Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006).",
        "More recently researchers have used graph based algorithms (Cai et al., 2011a) rather than pairwise classifications.",
        "For a detailed survey of the progress in this field, we refer the reader to a recent article (Ng, 2010) and a tutorial (Ponzetto and Poesio, 2009) dedicated to this subject.",
        "In spite of all the progress, current techniques still rely primarily on surface level features such as string match, proximity, and edit distance; syntactic features such as apposition; and shallow semantic features such as number, gender, named entities, semantic class, Hobbs?",
        "distance, etc.",
        "Further research to reduce the knowledge gap is essential to take coreference resolution techniques to the next level.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the OntoNotes corpus.",
        "Section 3 describes the range of phenomena annotated in OntoNotes, and language-specific issues.",

        "Unlike propositions, word sense and named entities, where it is simply a matter of counting the correct answers, or for parsing, where there is an established metric, evaluating the accuracy of coreference continues to be contentious.",
        "Various alternative metrics have been proposed, as mentioned below, which weight different features of a proposed coreference pattern differently.",
        "The choice is not clear in part because the value of a particular set of coreference predictions is integrally tied to the consuming application.",
        "A further issue in defining a coreference metric concerns the granularity of the mentions, and how closely the predicted mentions are required to match those in the gold standard for a coreference prediction to be counted as correct.",
        "Our evaluation criterion was in part driven by the OntoNotes data structures.",
        "OntoNotes coreference makes the distinction between identity coreference and appositive coreference, treating the latter separately.",
        "Thus we evaluated systems only on the identity coreference task, which links all categories of entities and events together into equivalent classes.",
        "The situation with mentions for OntoNotes is also different than it was for MUC or ACE.",
        "OntoNotes data does not explicitly identify the minimum extents of an entity mention, but it does include hand-tagged syntactic parses.",
        "Thus for the official evaluation, we decided to use the exact spans of mentions for determining correctness.",
        "The NP boundaries for the test data were pre-extracted from the hand-tagged Treebank for annotation, and events triggered by verb phrases were tagged using the verbs themselves.",
        "This choice means that scores for the CoNLL-2012 coreference task are likely to be lower than for coreference evaluations based on MUC, or ACE data, where an approximate match is often allowed based on the specified head of the mentions.",
        "As noted above, the choice of an evaluation metric for coreference has been a tricky issue and there does not appear to be any silver bullet that addresses all the concerns.",
        "Three metrics have been commonly used for evaluating coreference performance over an unrestricted set of entity types: i) The link based MUC metric (Vilain et al., 1995), ii) The mention based B-CUBED metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and iii) The entity based CEAF (Constrained Entity Aligned F-measure) metric (Luo, 2005).",

        "Given a set of key entities K, and a set of response entitiesR, with each entity comprising one or more mentions, each metric generates its variation of a precision and recall measure.",
        "The MUC measure is the oldest and most widely used.",
        "It focuses on the links (or, pairs of mentions) in the data.24 The number of common links between entities in K and R divided by the number of links in K represents the recall, whereas, precision is the number of common links between entities in K and R divided by the number of links in R. This metric prefers systems that have more mentions per entity ?",
        "a system that creates a single entity of all the mentions will get a 100% recall without significant degradation in its precision.",

        "29The documentation that comes with the SEMEVAL data package from LDC (LDC2011T01) states: ?Only nominal mentions and identical (IDENT) types were taken from the OntoNotes coreference annotation, thus excluding coreference relations with verbs and appositives.",

        "Each table provides results across multiple dimensions.",
        "For completeness, the tables include the raw precision and recall scores from which the F-scores were derived.",
        "Each table shows the scores for a particular system for the task of mention detection and coreference resolution separately.",

        "Owing to this peculiar nature of the data, the mention detection scores cannot be interpreted independently of the coreference resolution scores.",
        "In this scenario, a mention is effectively an anaphoric mention that has at least one other mention coreferent with it in the document.",
        "Most systems removed singletons from the response as a post-processing step, so not only will they not get credit for the singleton entities that they incorrectly removed from the data, but they will be penalized for the ones that they accidentally linked with another mention.",
        "What this number does indicate is the ceiling on recall that a system would have got in absence of being penalized for making mistakes in coreference resolution.",
        "The tables are subdivided into several logical horizontal sections separated by two horizontal lines.",
        "There can be a total of 12 sections, each categorized by a combination of two parse quality features GS and PS for each training and test set and three variations on the mention qualities ?",
        "NB, GB, and GM, as described earlier.",
        "Just like we used the dots below the graphs earlier to indicate the parameters that were chosen for a particular point on the plot, we use small black squares in the tables after the participant name, to indicate the conditions chosen for the results on that particular row.",
        "Since there are many rows to each table, in order to facilitate finding which number we are referring to, we have added a ID column which uses letters e, c, and a to refer to the three languages ?",
        "English, Chinese and Arabic.",
        "This is followed by a decimal number, in which the number before the decimal identifies the logical block within the table",
        "that share the same experiment parameters, and the one after the decimal indicates the index of a particular system in that block.",

        "Most top performing systems did significant feature engineering ?",
        "expecially a heavy use of lexicalized features, which was possible given the size of the corpus, and performed feature selection.",
        "?",
        "It might be possible that the Chinese accuracy with gold boundaries and mentions is better because the distribution of mentions across the various genres is different, and if there are more mentions in better scoring genres, then the performance would improve overall.",
        "?",

        "It is noteworthy that systems did not seem to attempt the kind of joint inference that could make use of the full potential of various layers available in OntoNotes, but this could well have been owing to the limited time available for the shared task.",
        "?",
        "We had expected to see more attention paid to event coreference, which is a novel feature in this data, but again, given the time constraints and given that events represent only a small portion of the total, it is not surprising that most systems chose not to focus on it.",
