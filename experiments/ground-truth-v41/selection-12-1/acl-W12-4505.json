        "This paper describes the structure of the LTH coreference solver used in the closed track of the CoNLL 2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012).",
        "The solver core is a mention classifier that uses Soon et al. (2001)'s algorithm and features extracted from the dependency graphs of the sentences.",
        "This system builds on Bjo?rkelund and Nugues (2011)'s solver that we extended so that it can be applied to the three languages of the task: English, Chinese, and Arabic.",
        "We designed a new mention detection module that removes pleonastic pronouns, prunes constituents, and recovers mentions when they do not match exactly a noun phrase.",
        "We carefully redesigned the features so that they reflect more complex linguistic phenomena as well as discourse properties.",
        "Finally, we introduced a minimal cluster model grounded in the first mention of an entity.",
        "We optimized the feature sets for the three languages: We carried out an extensive evaluation of pairs of features and we complemented the single features with associations that improved the CoNLL score.",
        "We obtained the respective scores of 59.57, 56.62, and 48.25 on English, Chinese, and Arabic on the development set, 59.36, 56.85, and 49.43 on the test set, and the combined official score of 55.21."

      "text": [
        "Although the input to coreference solvers are pairs or sets of constituents, many systems use concepts from dependency grammars to decide if a pair is coreferent.",
        "The most frequent one is the constituent's head that solvers need then to extract using ad-hoc rules; see the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2011), for instance.",
        "This can be tedious as we may have to write new rules for each new feature to incorporate in the classifier.",
        "That is",
        "why, instead of writing sets of rules applicable to specific types of dependencies, we converted all the constituents in the three corpora to generic dependency graphs before starting the training and solving steps.",
        "We used the LTH converter (Johansson and Nugues, 2007) for English, the Penn2Malt converter (Nivre, 2006) with the Chinese rules for Chinese1, and the CATiB converter (Habash and Roth, 2009) for Arabic.",
        "The CATiB converter (Habash and Roth, 2009) uses the Penn Arabic part-of-speech tagset, while the automatically tagged version of the CoNLL Arabic corpus uses a simplified tagset inspired by the English version of the Penn treebank.",
        "We translated these simplified POS tags to run the CATiB converter.",
        "We created a lookup table to map the simplified POS tags in the automatically annotated corpus to the Penn Arabic POS tags in the gold annotation.",
        "We took the most frequent association in the lookup table to carry out the translation.",
        "We then used the result to convert the constituents into dependencies.",
        "We translated the POS tags in the development set using a dictionary extracted from the gold training file and we translated the tags in the training file by a 5-fold cross-validation.",
        "We used this dictionary during both training and classifying since our features had a better performance with the Arabic tagset."
