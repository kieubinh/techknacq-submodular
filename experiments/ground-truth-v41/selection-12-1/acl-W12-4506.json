        "English, Chinese and Arabic ?",
        "using OntoNotes v5.0 corpus, given predicted information on the syntax, proposition, word sense and named entity layers.",
        "Automatic identification of coreferring entities and events in text has been an uphill battle for several decades, partly because it can require world knowledge which is not well-defined and partly owing to the lack of substantial annotated data.",
        "we use Google Translator to translate Chinese and Arabic into English.",
        "For more details, readers can refer to (Pradhan et al., 2012).",
        "Before this year's task, researchers proposed two typical novel methods to address the problem of natural language processing across multiple languages: projection and joint learning (Rahman and Ng, 2012).",
        "Specific to this year's coreference resolution task, for projection based method, we could first develop a strong resolver or utilize a publicly available system on English, and translate other languages into English, eventually, we could project the coreferring entities resolved on English back into other language sides.",
        "Generally, a projection method is easier to develop since it doesn't need sentence alignment across multiple languages.",
        "Thus, in this year's task, we investigate a translation based model to resolve coreference on English, Chinese and Arabic.",
        "The whole process is illustrated in figure 1, in which we first use Google Translator to translate Chinese and Arabic into English, and we then employ a strong English coreference resolver to generate coreferring entities, after mapping entities from English into",
        "Chinese and Arabic mention candidates, we could obtain coreferring entities for these languages.",
        "Intuitively, the performance of coreference resolver on English should perform better than that on Chinese and Arabic since we have substantial corpus for English and coreference resolution on English is well studied compared to another two languages.",
        "Thus we could imagine that projecting the results from English into Chinese and Arabic should still beats the baseline system using monolingual resolution method.",
        "However, in our experiments, we obtain negative results on developing set that means our projection based model perform worse than the baseline system.",
        "According to our experimental results on developing set, finally, we submit results of baseline system in order to obtain better ranking.",

        "After generating coreferring entities on English, the key step of our system is how to map them into mention candidates detected on Chinese and Arabic.",
        "For instance, assuming we translate Chinese documents into English and obtain coreferring entities e1, e2, ei,.., eE on translated English documents through aforementioned step, meanwhile, we consider all noun phrases(NP) in original Chinese documents and generate mention candidates m1, m2, mj ,.., mM .",
        "Therefore, our task is to map each ei into one mention candidate mj with highest probability, and it can be obtained by the max",
        "Algorithm 1 Algorithm for computing similarity between two phrases in different languages.",
        "1: Input: we1 , .., wen , wc1 , .., wcm , Phrase Table PT 2: s[n] = [0,?",
        "inf, ..,?",

        "0..10 do 5: s[i + j] = max(s[i + j], s[i ?",
        "1] + p(i, i + j)) 6: Output: s[n]V imization of the following formula,",
        "i,j{b(j, i)} = 1, where p(i, j) is the probability of ei mapping into mj and a(i, j) as well as b(i, j) are integers guaranteeing each coreferring entity map into one mention and each mention has only one entity to be mapped into.",
        "To solve this problem, we reduce it as a Cost Flow problem since it is easier to understand and implement compared to other methods such as integer linear programming.",
        "Note that the number of mention candidates is theoretically larger than that of coreferring entities, thus this problem couldn't be reduced as the bipartite graph matching problem since it needs equal number of nodes in two parts.",
        "Figure 2 shows the graph structure designed to solve this problem, where the symbols labeled on each edge is a two tuples(Cost,Flow), indicating the cost and flow for each edge.",
        "Since object of Cost Flow problem is to minimize the cost while maximizing the flows, thus we compute the c(i, j) as 1 ?",
        "p(i, j) in order to be consistent with the equation 1.",
        "To satisfy two constraints aforementioned, we set up two dummy nodes ?Start?",
        "and ?End?, and connect ?Start?",
        "to each entity ei with cost 0 and flow 1 ensuring each entity is available to map one mention.",
        "We also link each mention candidate mj to node ?End?",
        "with the same value ensuring each mention could be mapped into by only one entity.",
        "Clearly, there is an edge with tuple (1?p(i, j), 1) between each entity end mention indicating that each entity could map into any mention while with different probabilities.",
        "Thus, solving this Cost-Flow problem is equal to maximizing the equation 1 with two constraints.",
        "Since Cost-Flow problem is well studied, thus some algorithm can solve this problem in polynomial time (Ahuja et al., 1993).",
        "One may argue that we can modify translation decoder to output alignments between Chinese and translated English sentence, unfortunately, Google Translator API doesn't supply these information while its translation quality is obviously better than others for translating documents in OntoNotes, moreover, it is impossible to output alignment for each word since some translation rules used for directing translation include some unaligned words, thus an algorithm to map each entity into each mention is more applicable.",
        "Clearly, another problem is how to compute p(i, j) for each edge between entity and mention candidate.",
        "This problem could be casted as how to compute similarity of phrases across multiple languages.",
        "Formally, given an English phrases we1 , .., wen and a Chinese phrase wc1 , .., wcm , the problem is how to compute the similar score S between them.",
        "Although we could compute lexical, syntactic or semantic similar score to obtain accurate similarity, here for simplicity, we just compute the lexical similarity using the phrase table extracted by a phrased-based machine translation decoder (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Phrase table is a rich resource that contains probability score for phrase in one language translated into another language, thus we could design a dynamic algorithm shown in Algorithm 1 to compute the similar score.",
        "Equation in line 5 is used to reserve highest similar score for its sub-phrases, and p(i, i + j) is the similar score between sub-phrases wi, .., wi+j and its translation.",
        "When we compute the score of the sub-phrases wi, .., wi+j , we literately pick one pti from PT and check whether wc1 , .., wcm involves pti's target side, if that we record its score until we obtain a higher score obtained by another ptj and then update it.",
