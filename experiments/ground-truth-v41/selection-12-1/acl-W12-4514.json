        "Our system is an extension of Stanford's multi-pass sieve system, (Raghunathan et al., 2010) and (Lee et al., 2011), by adding novel constraints and sieves.",
        "In the original model , sieves are sorted in decreasing order of precision.",
        "Initially each mention is in its own cluster.",
        "Mention clusters are combined by satisfying the condition of each sieve in the scan pass.",

        "Most of the supervised learning models in CoNLL-2011 shared task (Chang et al., 2011)(Bjo?rkelund and Nugues, 2011) used classifiers (Maximum Entropy or SVM) to train the models for obtaining the pairwise mention scores.",
        "However, the training process usually takes much longer time than unsupervised or deterministic systems.",
        "In contrast, (Raghunathan et al., 2010) proposed a rule-based model which obtained competitive result with less time.",
        "Two considerable extensions to the Stanford model in this paper are made to guarantee higher precision and recall.",
        "First, we recorded error patterns from outputs of the original Stanford system and found that the usual errors are mention boundary mismatches, pronoun mismatches and so on.",
        "To avoid the irrational coreference errors, we added some constraints to the mention detection for eliminating some unreasonable mention boundary mismatches.",
        "Second, we added some constraints in the coreference sieves based on the errors on the training set and the development set.",
        "We participated in the closed track and received an official F-score (unweighted mean of MUC, BCUBED and CEAF(E) metric) of 58.25 for English.",

      "text": [
        "Our system mainly focuses on making extensions for mention detection and coreference resolution.",
        "From error analysis, we found that mention boundaries caused many precision and recall errors.",
        "For example, for the gold mention Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, the original system only extracts Robert H. Chandross as the mention and links it with he in the following sentence.",
        "This mismatch leads to both precision and recall errors since the mention with longer boundary is not detected but the shorter one is used.",
        "Another example which omits today in the phrase for the predicted mention is mentioned in (Lee et al., 2011) and this boundary mismatch also accounts for precision and recall errors.",
        "Some other examples may be like this: Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI, and at the CPI level they won't, the gold mentions are Auto prices, the PPI, the CPI level and they while the original system only finds out auto prices.",
        "Considering these boundary mismatches, it is not hard for us to categorize the error types.",
        "By observation, most boundary problems happen in the following cases:",

        "For the example mentioned above, the clause ,an economist ... which modifies the person Robert H. Chandross is annexed to the person name mention.",
        "We also append time and other modifiers to the original mention.",

        "While our system is rule-based and it also works without training data sets, some statistical information is also helpful to detect and avoid errors.",
        "The first extension we used is a direct way to utilize the training data and the development data.",
        "We simply record the erroneous mention pairs in the train and development sets with distance and sieve information.",
        "One of the most common errors is that when mentions with particular types appear twice in the same sentence, the original system often puts them into the same cluster.",
        "For example, there are often two or more you or person names in the dialogue, however, the different occurrences are treated as coreference which produces precision errors.",
        "To address this problem, we convert proper nouns to type designator, e.g. Paul as Man Name.",
        "Then we use the formatted error pairs as constraints on the sieve passes since some pairs mostly cause precision errors.",
        "If the checking pair matches up some records in the errors with the same sieve information and the error frequency is over a threshold, we must discard this pair in this sieve pass.",
        "Another difference between our system and the Stanford system is the semantic similarity sieve.",
        "For each sieve pass, the current clusters are built by stronger sieves ( sieves in the earlier passes ).",

        "Since experiments with semantic knowledge like WordNet and Wikipedia cannot give better performance, we omit the semantic function for generating test result.",

        "If the semantic knowledge tells that two mentions are similar and possibly can be combined while they do not satisfy the sieve constraints, it will be very hard to make a decision since we cannot find an appropriate threshold to let the semantic suggestion pass through."
