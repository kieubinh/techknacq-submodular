      "heading": "1 Introduction Due to the complex and semi-algorithmic nature of the Arabic morphology, it has always been a challenge for computational processing and analysis (Kiraz, 2001; Beesley 2003; Shaalan et al., 2012). A lexicon is an indispensable part of a morphological analyser (Dichy and Farghaly, 2003; Attia, 2006; Buckwalter, 2004; Beesley, 2001), and the coverage of the lexical database is a key factor in the coverage of the morphological analyser. This is why an automatic method for updating a lexical database is crucially important.",

        "We present the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to address lemmatization of Arabic unknown words.",
        "The specific problem with lemmatizing unknown words is that they cannot be matched against a morphological lexicon.",
        "We develop a rule-based finite-state morphological guesser and use a machine learning disambiguator, MADA (Roth et al., 2008), in a pipelined approach to lemmatization.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "The remainder of the introduction reviews previous work on Arabic unknown word extraction and lemmatization, and explains the data used in our experiments.",
        "Section 2 presents the methodology followed in extracting and analysing unknown words.",
        "Section 3 provides details on the morphological guesser we have developed to help deal with the problem.",
        "Section 4 shows and discusses the testing and evaluation results, and finally Section 5 gives the conclusion.",
        "1.1 Previous Work Lemmatization of Arabic words has been addressed in (Roth et al., 2008; Dichy, 2001).",
        "Lemmatization of unknown words has been addressed for Slovene in (Erjavec and D?erosk, 2004), for Hebrew in (Adler at al., 2008) and for English, Finnish, Swedish and Swahili in (Lind?n, 2008).",
        "Lemmatization means the normalization of text data by reducing surface forms to their canonical underlying representations, which, in Arabic, means verbs in their perfective, indicative, 3rd person, masculine, singular forms, such as ?????",
        "?",

        "nAs ?people?.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the study presented here is the first to address lemmatization of Arabic unknown words.",
        "The specific problem with lemmatizing unknown words is that they cannot be matched against a lexicon.",
        "In our method, we use a machine learning disambiguator, develop a rule-based finite-state morphological guesser, and combine them in a pipelined process of lemmatization.",
        "We test our method against a manually created gold standard of 1,310 types (unique forms) and show a significant improvement over the baseline.",
        "Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for weighting and prioritizing new words for inclusion in a lexicon depending on three factors: number of form variations of the lemmas, cumulative frequency of the forms, and POS tags.",
        "1.2 Data Used In our work we rely on a large-scale corpus of 1,089,111,204 words, consisting of 925,461,707 words from the Arabic Gigaword Fourth Edition (Parker et al., 2009), and 163,649,497 words from news articles collected from the Al-Jazeera web site.1 In this corpus, unknown words appear at a rate of between 2% of word tokens (when we ignore possible spelling variants) and 9% of word tokens (when possible spelling variants are included).",
        "2 Methodology To deal with unknown words, or out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs), we use a pipelined approach, which predicts part-of-speech tags and morpho-syntactic features before lemmatization.",
        "First, a machine learning, context-sensitive tool is used.",
        "This tool, MADA (Roth et al., 2008), performs POS tagging and morpho-syntactic analysis and disambiguation of words in context.",
        "MADA internally uses the Standard Arabic Morphological Analyser (SAMA) (Maamouri et al., 2010), an updated version of Buckalter Arabic 1 http://aljazeera.net/portal.",
        "Collected in January 2010.",
        "Morphological Analyser (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004).",
        "Second, we develop a finite-state morphological guesser that gives all possible interpretations of a given word.",
        "The morphological guesser first takes an Arabic form as a whole and then strips off all possible affixes and clitics one by one until all potential analyses are exhausted.",
        "As the morphological guesser is highly non-deterministic, all the interpretations are matched against the morphological analysis of MADA that receives the highest probabilistic scores.",
        "The guesser's analysis that bears the closest resemblance (in terms of morphological features) with the MADA analysis is selected.",
        "These are the steps followed in extracting and lemmatizing Arabic unknown words: ?",
        "A corpus of 1,089,111,204 is analysed with MADA.",
        "The number of types for which MADA could not find an analysis in SAMA is 2,116,180. ?",
        "These unknown types are spell checked by the Microsoft Arabic spell checker using MS Office 2010.",
        "Among the unknown types, the number of types accepted as correctly spelt is 208,188. ?",
        "We then select types with frequency of 10 or more.",
        "This leave us with 40,277 types.",
        "?",
        "We randomly select 1,310 types and manually annotate them with the gold lemma, the gold POS and lexicographic preference for inclusion in a dictionary.",

        "We use the full POS tags and morpho-syntactic features produced by MADA.",
        "?",
        "We use the finite-state morphological guesser to produce all possible morphological interpretations and corresponding lemmatizations.",
        "?",
        "We compare the POS tags and morpho-syntactic features in MADA output with the output of the morphological guesser and choose the one with the highest matching score.",

        "(2003) show how to create a basic guesser.",
        "The core idea of a guesser is to assume that a stem is composed of any arbitrary sequence of Arabic non-numeric characters, and this stem can be prefixed and/or suffixed with a predefined set of prefixes, suffixes or clitics.",
        "The guesser marks clitic boundaries and tries to return the stem to its underlying representation, the lemma.",
        "Due to the nondeterministic nature of the guesser, there will be a large number of possible lemmas for each form.",

        "4.1 Evaluating Lemmatization In the evaluation experiment we measure accuracy calculated as the number of correct tags divided by the count of all tags.",
        "The baseline is given by the assumption that new words appear in their base form, i.e., we do not need to lemmatize them.",
        "The baseline accuracy is 45% as shown in Table 1.",
        "The POS tagging baseline proposes the most frequent tag (proper name) for all unknown words.",
        "In our test data this stands at 45%.",
        "We notice that MADA POS tagging accuracy is unexpectedly low (60%).",
        "We use Voted POS Tagging, that is when a lemma gets a different POS tag with a higher frequency, the new tag replaces the old low frequency tag.",
        "This method has improved the tagging results significantly (69%).",
        "Accuracy POS tagging 1 POS Tagging baseline 45% 2 MADA POS tagging 60% 3 Voted POS Tagging 69% Table 1.",
        "Evaluation of POS tagging As for the lemmatization process itself, we notice that our experiment in the pipelined lemmatization approach gains a higher (54%) score than the baseline (45%) as shown in Table 2.",

        "Evaluation of lemmatization 4.2 Evaluating Lemma Weighting In our data we have 40,277 unknown token types.",
        "After lemmatization they are reduced to 18,399 types (that is 54% reduction of the surface forms) which are presumably ready for manual validation before being included in a lexicon.",
        "This number is still too big for manual inspection.",
        "In order to facilitate human revision, we devise a weighting algorithm for ranking so that the top n number of words will include the most lexicographically relevant words.",
        "We call surface forms that share the same lemma ?sister forms?, and we call the lemma that they share the ?mother lemma?.",
        "This weighting algorithm is based on three criteria: frequency of the sister forms, number of sister forms, and a POS factor which penalizes proper nouns (due to their disproportionate high frequency).",
        "The parameters of the weighting algorithm has been tuned through several rounds of experimentation.",
        "Word Weight = ((number of sister forms having the same mother lemma * 800) + cumulative sum of frequencies of sister forms having the same mother lemma) / 2 + POS factor Good words In top 100 In bottom 100 relying on Frequency alone (baseline) 63 50 relying on number of sister forms * 800 87 28 relying on POS factor 58 30 using the combined criteria 78 15 Table 3.",
        "Evaluation of lemma weighting and ranking Table 3 shows the evaluation of the weighting criteria.",
        "We notice that the combined criteria gives the best balance between increasing the number of good words in the top 100 words and reducing the number of good words in the bottom 100 words.",
        "5 Conclusion We develop a methodology for automatically extracting unknown words in Arabic and lemmatizing them in order to relate multiple surface forms to their base underlying representation using a finite-state guesser and a machine learning tool for disambiguation.",
        "We develop a weighting mechanism for simulating a human decision on whether or not to include the new words in a general-domain lexical database.",
        "We show the feasibility of a highly non-deterministic finite state guesser in an essential and practical application.",
        "Out of a word list of 40,255 unknown words, we create a lexicon of 18,399 lemmatized, POS-tagged and weighted entries.",
        "We make our unknown word lexicon available as a free open-source resource2.",
