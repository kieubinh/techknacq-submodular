        "But since at least (Davidson, 1967), there has been no retreating from events (Parsons, 1990; Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Pratt-Hartmann, 2005).",
        "Be that as it may, an appeal to events carries with it an obligation to provide a minimal account of what holds during these events and perhaps even a bit beyond.",
        "It is for such an account that finite-state methods are deployed below, viewed through the lens of the Bu?chi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem.",
        "That lens gives temporal logic, the formulae of which ?",
        "hereafter called fluents (for brevity) ?",

        "John-driving-to-Boston, by contrast, does not have this property, necessitating the change from to Boston in (4) to toward Boston in (7).",

        "A finite sequence of subevents necessarily has a specified beginning and ending, so it cannot encode the absence of endpoints.",
        "And excluding the specified endpoints simply exposes other specified subevents, which thereby become new endpoints.",
        "Thus encoding nonbounded events requires major surgery in the semantic representation.",
        "[page 316] Jackendoff's objections are overcome below by finite-state manipulations that may well be called surgery.",
        "Following details supplied in the next section,2 strings are formed from a finite set X of fluents that is allowed to vary so that (i) the continuity desired by Jackendoff arises in the inverse limit of a system of projections piX (defined below; Table 1), and (ii) the temporal span of any finite string may, on expanding the set X , stretch without bound to the left (past) and/or to the right (future).",
