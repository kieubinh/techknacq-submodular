        "Understanding the impact of scientific work is also crucial for hiring decisions, allocation of funding, university rankings and other tasks that involve the assessment of scientific merit.",
        "If scientific works stand on the shoulders of giants, we would like to be able to find the giants.",
        "The importance of a scientific work has previously been measured chiefly through metrics derived from citation counts, such as impact factors.",
        "However, citation counts are not the whole story.",
        "Many citations are made in passing, are relevant to only one section of an article, or make no impact on a work but are referenced out of ?politeness, policy or piety?",

        "Some articles are important because they describe scientific discoveries that alter our understanding of the world, while some develop essential tools and techniques which facilitate future research.",
        "Other articles are influential because they introduce the seeds of new ideas, which in turn inspire many other articles.",
        "In this work we introduce topical influence, a quantitative metric for measuring the latter type of scientific influence, defined in the context of an unsupervised generative model for scientific corpora.",
        "The model posits that articles ?coerce?",
        "the articles that cite them into having similar topical content to them.",
        "Thus, articles with higher topical influence have a larger effect on the topics of the articles that cite them.",
        "We model this influence mechanism via a regression on the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over topics in an LDA-style topic model.",
        "We show how the models can be used to recover meaningful influence scores, both for articles and for specific citations.",
        "By looking not just at the citation graph but also taking into account the content of the articles, topical influence can provide a better picture of scientific impact than simple citation counts."

        "Bibliometrics, the quantitative study of scientific literature, has a long history.",
        "One example of a widely-used bibliometric measure of interest is the impact factor of a publication venue for a given year, defined to be the average number of times articles from",
        "that venue, published in the previous two years, were cited in that year.",
        "However, the quality of articles in a given publication venue can vary wildly, and it is difficult to compare impact factors between different disciplines of study.",
        "The number of citations an article receives is an indication of importance, but this is confounded by the unknown function of each citation.",
        "Measures of importance such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) can be derived recursively from the citation graph.",
        "Such graph-based measures do not in general make use of the textual content of the articles, although it is possible to apply them to graphs where the edges between articles are determined based on the similarity of their content instead of the citation graph (Lin, 2008).",
        "A variety of methods have previously been proposed for analyzing text and citation links together, such as modeling connections between words and citations Cohn and Hofmann (2001), classifying citation function (Teufel et al., 2006), and jointly modeling citation links and document content (Chang and Blei, 2009).",
        "However, these methods do not directly measure article importance or influence relationships between articles given their citations.",
        "More closely related to the present work, Dietz et al. (2007) proposed the citation influence model (CIM).",
        "Building on the latent Dirichlet al location (LDA) framework, CIM assumes that each word is drawn by first selecting either (a) the distribution over topics of a cited article (with probability proportional to the influence weight of that article on the present article) or (b) a novel topic distribution, and drawing a topic from the selected distribution, then finally drawing the word from the chosen topic.1 In their approach, every word is assigned an extra latent variable, namely the cited article whose topic distribution the topic was drawn from.",
        "For the model proposed in this paper, we do not need to introduce these additional latent variables, which leads to a simpler latent representation and fewer variables to sample during inference.",
        "Dietz et al. (2007) also assume that the citation graph is bipartite, consisting of one set of citing articles and one set of cited articles?in contrast, our proposed models can handle arbitrary citation graphs in the form of directed 1A somewhat similar model was also proposed by He et al. (2009) acyclic graphs (DAGs).",
        "While both the CIM and our approach can identify the influence of specific citations between articles, our model can also infer how influential each article is overall, and provides a flexible modeling framework which can handle different assumptions about influence.",
        "Another related method is due to Shaparenko and Joachims (2009), who propose a mixture modeling approach for the detection of novel text content.",
        "Nallapati et al. (2011) introduced TopicFlow, a PLSA-based model for the flow of topics in a document network.",
        "In their model, citing articles ?vote?",
        "on each cited article's topic distribution in retrospect, via a network flow model.",
        "Since this voting occurs in time-reversed order, it does not describe an influence mechanism and is not a generative model that can simulate or predict new documents.",
        "Finally, the document influence model of Gerrish and Blei (2010) can be viewed as orthogonal to this work, in that it models the impact of documents on topics over time (specifically, how topics change over time) rather than how articles influence the specific articles that cite them."

        "We emphasize that topical influence measures a specific dimension of scientific importance, namely the tendency of an article to influence the ideas (as mediated by the topics) of citing articles; papers with low topical influence such as the BLEU article may be important for other reasons.",
        "Ranking papers by their influence weights l(d) (Table 2, middle) has the opposite difficulty to ranking by citation counts ?",
        "the papers with the highest topical influence were typically cited only once, by the same authors.",
        "This makes sense, given what the model is designed to do.",
        "The lone citing papers were certainly topically influenced by these articles.",
        "A more useful metric, however, is the total topical influence T (d) (the bottom sub-table in Table 2).",
        "This is the total number of words of prior concentration, summed over all of its citers, that the article has contributed, and is a measure of the total corpus-wide topical influence of the paper.",
        "This metric ranks the BLEU paper at 5th place, down from 1st place by citation count.",
        "The ACL paper with the highest total topical influence, by David Chiang, won the ACL best paper award in 2005.",
        "The behavior of the different metrics is echoed",
        "corresponds to the model assigning a higher log probability score for the test portion of a held-out document than LDA assigned to that document.",
        "Le Cun et al. (1990), is an early successful application of neural networks.",
        "The paper does not introduce novel models or algorithms, but rather, in the authors?",
        "words, ?show[s] that large back propagation (BP) networks can be applied to real image recognition problems.?",
        "Thus, although it is has an important role as a landmark neural network success story, it does not score highly in terms of topical influence.",
        "This paper is ranked 13th according to total topical influence, with a score of 1.6.",
        "The top two-ranked papers according to total topical influence, on Gaussian Process Regression and POMDPs respectively, were both seminal papers that spawned large bodies of related work.",
        "An interesting case is the third-ranked paper in the NIPS corpus, by Wang et al., on the theory of early stopping.",
        "It is only referenced three times, but has a very high topical influence of 19.3 words.",
        "All three citing papers are also on the theory of early stopping, and one of the papers, by Wang and Venkatesh, directly extends a theoretical result of this paper.",
        "Although it is easy to see why this paper scores highly on topical influence, in this case the metric has perhaps overstated its importance.",
        "A limitation of topical influence is that it can potentially give more credit than is due when an article is cited by a small number of topically similar papers, due to overfitting.",
        "This is likely to be an issue for any topic-based approach for modeling scientific influence.",
        "However, topics help to absorb lexical ambiguity and author-specific idiosyncracies, mitigating the problem relative to word-based approaches.",
        "Using the TIRE model, we can also look at influence relationships between pairs of articles.",
        "Tables 4 and 5 show the most and least topically influential references, and the most and least influenced citing papers, for three example articles from ACL and NIPS, respectively.",
        "The model correctly assigns higher influence scores along the edges to and from relevant documents.",
        "For the ACL papers, the BLEU algorithm's article is inferred to have zero topical influence on Chiang's paper, consistent with its role",
        "l(d) inferred by TIR (middle), and total topical influence T (d) inferred by TIR (bottom).",
        "For total topical influence, the breakdown of T (d) = l(d)?",
        "citation count is shown in parentheses.",
        "Top 5 Articles by Citation Count",
        "TIRE model for three example NIPS articles.",
        "in the paper as an evaluation technique.",
        "The paper most topically influenced by Chiang's paper, written by Yang and Zheng, aims to improve upon the ideas in that paper.",
        "In the NIPS corpus, the article by Bengio and Frasconi, on recurrent neural network architectures, extends previous work by the same authors, which is correctly assigned the highest topical influence.",
        "A particularly interesting case is the paper by Dayan and Hinton, which is heavily influenced by a paper by Moore, and in turn strongly influences a later paper by Moore, thus illustrating the interplay of scientific influence between authors along the citation graph.",
        "These three papers were on reinforcement learning, while the lowest scoring reference and citer were on other subjects."

        "This paper introduced the notion of topical influence, a quantitative measure of scientific impact which arises from a latent variable model called topical influence regression.",
        "The model builds upon the ideas of Dirichlet-multinomial regression to encode influence relationships between articles along the citation graph.",
        "By training TIR, we can recover topical influence scores that give us insight into the impact of scientific articles.",
        "The model was applied to two scientific corpora, demonstrating the utility of the method both quantitatively and qualitatively.",
        "In future work, the proposed framework could readily be extended to model other aspects of scientific influence, such as the effects of authors and journals on topical influence, and to exploit the context in which citations occur.",
        "From an exploratory analysis perspective, it would be instructive to compare topical influence trajectories over time for different papers.",
        "This could be further facilitated by explicitly modeling the dynamics of each article's topical influence score.",
        "The TIR framework could potentially also be applicable to other application domains such as modeling how interpersonal influence affects the spread of memes via social media.",
        "To complement TIR, it would be useful to also have systems for identifying articles which are important for alternative reasons, such as providing methodological tools and/or demonstrating important facts.",
        "Ultimately a suite of such tools could feed into a system such as Google Scholar or Citeseer.",
        "We envision that this line of work will also be useful for building visualization tools to help researchers explore scientific corpora."
