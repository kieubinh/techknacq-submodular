        "A prominent approach for representing the meaning of a word in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to treat it as a numerical vector that codes the pattern of co-occurrence of that word with other expressions in a large corpus of language (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "This approach to semantics (sometimes called distributional semantics) scales well to large lexicons and does not require words to be manually disambiguated (Schu?tze, 1997).",
        "Until recently, however, this method had been almost exclusively limited to the level of single content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs), and had not directly addressed the problem of composition-ality (Frege, 1892; Montague, 1970; Partee, 2004), the crucial property of natural language which allows speakers to derive the meaning of a complex linguistic constituent from the meaning of its immediate syntactic subconstituents.",
        "Several recent proposals have strived to extend distributional semantics with a component that also generates vectors for complex linguistic constituents, using compositional operations in the vector space (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Guevara, 2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Socher et al., 2012).",
        "All of these approaches construct distributional representations for novel phrases starting from the corpus-derived vectors for their lexical constituents and exploiting the geometric quality of the representation.",
        "Such methods are able to capture complex semantic information of adjective-noun (AN) phrases, such as characterizing modification (Boleda et al., 2012; Boleda et al., 2013), and can detect semantic deviance in novel phrases (Vecchi et al., 2011).",
        "Furthermore, these methods are naturally recursive: they can derive a representation not only for, e.g., red car, but also for new red car, fast new red car, etc.",
        "This aspect is appealing since trying to extract meaningful representations for all recursive phrases directly from a corpus will result in a problem of sparsity, since most large phrases will never occur in any finite sample.",
        "Once we start seriously looking into recursive modification, however, the issue of modifier ordering restrictions naturally arises.",
        "Such restrictions have often been discussed in the theoretical linguistic literature (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Crisma, 1991; Scott, 2002), and have become one of the key in",
        "gredients of the ?cartographic?",
        "approach to syntax (Cinque, 2002).",
        "In this paradigm, the ordering is derived by assigning semantically different classes of modifiers to the specifiers of distinct functional projections, whose sequence is hard-wired.",
        "While it is accepted that in different languages movement can lead to a principled rearrangement of the linear order of the modifiers (Cinque, 2010; Steddy and Samek-Lodovici, 2011), one key assumption of the cartographic literature is that exactly one intonationally unmarked order for stacked adjectives should be possible in languages like English.",
        "The possibility of alternative orders, when discussed at all, is attributed to the presence of idioms (high American building, but American high officer), to asyndetic conjunctive meanings (e.g. new creative idea parsed as [new & creative] idea, rather than [new [creative idea]]), or to semantic category ambiguity for any adjective which appears in different orders (see Cinque (2004) for discussion).",
        "In this study, we show that the existence of both rigid and flexible order cases is robustly attested at least for adjectival modification, and that flexible ordering is unlikely to reduce to idioms, coordination or ambiguity.",
        "Moreover, we show that at least for some recursively constructed adjective-adjective-noun phrases (AANs) we can extract meaningful representations from the corpus, approximating them reasonably well by means of compositional distributional semantic models, and that the semantic information contained in these models characterizes which AA will have rigid order (as with rapid social change vs. *social rapid change), or flexible order (e.g. total estimated population vs. estimated total population).",
        "In the former case, we find that the same distributional semantic cues discriminate between correct and wrong orders.",
        "To achieve these goals, we consider various properties of the distributional representation of AANs (both corpus-extracted and compositionally-derived), and explore their correlation with restrictions in adjective ordering.",
        "We conclude that measures that quantify the degree to which the modifiers have an impact on the distributional meaning of the AAN can be good predictors of ordering restrictions in AANs."

        "We include those ANs that occur at least 100 times in the corpus in our vocabulary, which amounted to a total of 128K ANs.",
        "Finally, we created a set of AAN phrases composed of the adjectives and nouns used to generate the ANs.",
        "Additional preprocessing of the generated AxAyNs includes: (i) control that both AxN and AyN are attested in the corpus; (ii) discard any AxAyN in which AxN or AyN are among the top 200 most frequent ANs in the source corpus (as in this case, order will be affected by the fact that such phrases are almost certainly highly lexicalized); and (iii) discard AANs seen as part of a conjunction in the source corpus (i.e., where the two adjectives appear separated by comma, and, or or; this addresses the objection that a flexible order AAN might be a hidden A(&)A conjunction: we would expect that such a conjunction should also appear overtly elsewhere).",

        "2The upper threshold was included as an additional filter against potential multiword expressions.",

        "This confirms our hypothesis that a lot has to do with how integrated Ay and N are.",
        "While it is somewhat disappointing that ?PMI outperforms all distributional semantic cues, note that this measure conflates semantic and lexical factors, as the high PMI of AyN in at least some rigid order AANs might be also a cue of the fact that the latter bigram is a lexicalized phrase (as discussed in footnote 2, it",
        "is unlikely that our filtering strategies sifted out all multiword expressions).",
        "Moreover, ?PMI does not produce a semantic representation of the phrase (see how composed distributional vectors approximate of high quality AAN vectors in Table 3).",
        "Finally, this measure will not scale up to cases where the ANs are not attested, whereas measures based on composition only need corpus-harvested representations of adjectives and nouns."

        "Having shown that flexible order and rigid order AANs are significantly distinguished by various properties, we proceed now to test whether those same properties also allow us to distinguish between correct (corpus-attested) and wrong (unattested) adjective ordering in rigid AANs (recall that we are working with cases where the attested-order occurs more than 20 times in the corpus, and both adjectives modify the nouns at least 10 times, so we are confident that there is a true asymmetry).",
        "We expect that the fundamental property that distinguishes the orders is again found in the degree of modification of both component adjectives.",
        "We predict that the single concept created by the AyN in attested-order rigid AANs, such as legal status in formal legal status, is an effect of the modification strength of the Ay on the head noun, and when seen in the incorrect ordering, i.e., ?legal formal status, the strong modification of legal will still dominate the meaning of the AAN.",
        "Composition models should be able to capture this effect based on the distance from both the component adjectives and ANs.",
        "Clearly, we cannot run these analyses on corpus-extracted vectors since the unattested order, by definition, is not seen in our corpus, and therefore we cannot collect co-occurrence statistics for the AAN phrase.",
        "Thus, we test our measures of adjective ordering on the model-generated AAN vectors, for all gold rigid order AANs in both orders.",
        "We also consider the ?PMI measure which was so effective in distinguishing flexible vs. rigid order AANs.",
        "We expect that the greater association with AyN for attested-order AANs will again lead to large, negative differences in PMI scores, while the expectation that unattested-order AANs will be highly associated with their AxN will correspond to large, positive differences in PMI.",
        "AANs.",
        "t-normalized mean paired cosine (or ?PMI) differences between attested (A) and unattested (U) AANs with their components.",
        "For significant differences (paired t-test p<0.05 after Bonferroni correction), last column reports whether cosines (or ?PMI) are on average larger for A or U.",
        "Across all composition models, we find that the distance between the model-generated AAN and its component adjectives, Ax and Ay, are significant indicators of attested vs. unattested adjective ordering (cf. Table 5).",
        "Specifically, we find that rigid order AANs in the correct order are closest to their Ay, while we can detect the unattested order when the rigid order AAN is closer to its Ax.",
        "This finding is quite interesting, since it shows that the order in which the composition functions are applied does not alter the fact that the modification of one adjective in rigid order AANs (the Ay in the case of attested-order rigid order AANs) is much stronger than the other.",
        "Unlike the measures that differentiated flexible and rigid order AANs, here we see that the distance from the component N is not an indicator of the correct adjective ordering (trivially so for MULT, where attested and unattested AANs are identical).",
        "Next, we find that for W.ADD, F.ADD and LFM,",
        "the distance from the component AxN is a strong indicator of attested vs. unattested-order rigid order AANs.",
        "Specifically, attested-order AANs are further from their AxN than unattested-order AANs.",
        "This finding is in line with our predictions and follows the findings of the impact of the distance from the component adjectives.",
        "?PMI, as seen in the ability to distinguish flexible vs. rigid order AANs, is the strongest indicator of correct vs wrong adjective ordering.",
        "This measure confirms that the association of one adjective (the Ay in attested-order AANs) with the head noun is indeed the most significant factor distinguishing these two classes.",
        "However, as we mentioned before, this measure has its limitations and is likely not to be entirely sufficient for future steps in modeling recursive modification."

      "text": [
        "While AN constructions have been extensively studied within the framework of compositional distributional semantics (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Boleda et al., 2012; Boleda et al., 2013; Guevara, 2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Turney, 2012; Vecchi et al., 2011), for the first time, we extended the investigation to recursively built AAN phrases.",
        "First, we showed that composition functions applied recursively can approximate corpus-extracted AAN vectors that we know to be of high semantic quality.",
        "Next, we looked at some properties of the same high-quality corpus-extracted AAN vectors, finding that the distinction between ?flexible?",
        "AANs, where the adjective order can be flipped, and ?rigid?",
        "ones, where the order is fixed, is reflected in distributional cues.",
        "These results all derive from the intuition that the most embedded adjective in a rigid AAN has a very strong effect on the distributional semantic representation of the AAN.",
        "Most compositional models were able to capture at least some of the same cues that emerged in the analysis of the corpus-extracted vectors.",
        "Finally, similar cues were also shown to distinguish (compositional) representations of rigid AANs in the ?correct?",
        "(corpus-attested) and ?wrong?",
        "(unattested) orders, again pointing to the degree to which the (attested-order) closest adjective affects the overall AAN meaning as an important factor.",
        "Comparing the composition functions, we find that the linguistically motivated LFM approach has the most consistent performance across all our tests.",
        "This model significantly outperformed all others in approximating high-quality corpus-extracted AAN vectors, it provided the closest approximation to the corpus-observed patterns when distinguishing flexible and rigid AANs, and it was one of the models with the strongest cues distinguishing attested and unattested orders of rigid AANs.",
        "From an applied point of view, a natural next step would be to use the cues we proposed as features to train a classifier to predict the preferred order of adjectives, to be tested also in cases where neither order is found in the corpus, so direct corpus evidence cannot help.",
        "For a full account of adjectival ordering, non-semantic factors should also be taken into account.",
        "As shown by the effectiveness in our experiments of PMI, which is a classic measure used to harvest idioms and other multiword expressions (Church and Hanks, 1990), ordering is affected by arbitrary lexicalization patterns.",
        "Metrical effects are also likely to play a role, like they do in the well-studied case of ?binomials?",
        "such as salt and pepper (Benor and Levy, 2006; Copestake and Herbelot, 2011).",
        "In a pilot study, we found that indeed word length (roughly quantified by number of letters) is a significant factor in predicting adjective ordering (the shorter adjective being more likely to occur first), but its effect is not nearly as strong as that of the semantic measures we considered here.",
        "In our future work, we would like to develop an order model that exploits semantic, metrical and lexicalization features jointly for maximal classification accuracy.",
        "Adjectival ordering information could be useful in parsing: in English, it could tell whether an AANN sequence should be parsed as A[[AN]N] or A[A[NN]]; in languages with pre-and post-N adjectives, like Italian or Spanish, it could tell whether ANA sequences should be parsed as A[NA] or [AN]A.",
        "The ability to detect ordering restrictions could also help Natural Language Generation tasks (Malouf, 2000), especially for the generation of unattested combinations of As and Ns.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, we would like to extend our analysis to adjective coordination (what?s",
        "the difference between new and creative idea and new creative idea?).",
        "Additionally, we could go more granular, looking at whether compositional models can help us to understand why certain classes of adjectives are more likely to precede or follow others (why is size more likely to take scope over color, so that big red car sounds more natural than red big car?)",
        "or studying the behaviour of specific adjectives (can our approach capture the fact that strong alcoholic drink is preferable to alcoholic strong drink because strong pertains to the alcoholic properties of the drink?).",
        "In the meantime, we hope that the results we reported here provide convincing evidence of the usefulness of compositional distributional semantics in tackling topics, such as recursive adjectival modification, that have been of traditional interest to theoretical linguists from a new perspective."
