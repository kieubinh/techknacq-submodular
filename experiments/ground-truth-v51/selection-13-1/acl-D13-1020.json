        "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text.",

        "In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension.",
        "Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric.",
        "By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself.",
        "The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task.",
        "We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions.",
        "By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost.",

        "A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people.",
        "Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment.",
        "Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal.",
        "On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text.",
        "We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT.",
        "For this, we need a way to measure progress.",
        "One common method for evaluating someone's understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test.",
        "This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set.",
        "Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT.",
        "We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story.",
        "It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story.",
        "We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data.",
        "The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand.",
        "This task is still beyond the capability of today's computers and algorithms.",
        "By restricting the concept space, we gain the difficulty of being an open-domain problem, without the full complexity of the real world (for example, there will be no need for the machine to understand politics, technology, or to have any domain specific expertise).",
        "The multiple choice task avoids ambiguities (such as when the task is to find a sentence that best matches a question, as in some early reading comprehension tasks: see Section 2), and also avoids the need for additional grading, such as is needed in some TREC tasks.",
        "The stories were chosen to be fictional to focus work on finding the answer in the story itself, rather than in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia; the goal is to build technology that actually understands stories and paragraphs on a deep level (as opposed to using information retrieval methods and the redundancy of the web to find the answers).",
        "We chose to use crowd sourcing, as opposed to, for example, contracting teachers or paying for existing standardized tests, for three reasons, namely: (1) scalability, both for the sizes of datasets we can provide, and also for the ease of regularly refreshing the data; (2) for the variety in storytelling that having many different authors brings; and (3) for the free availability that can only result from providing non-copyrighted data.",
        "The content is freely available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct, and we plan to use that site to track published results and provide other resources, such as labels of various kinds."

        "The research goal of mapping text to meaning representations in order to solve particular tasks has a long history.",
        "DARPA introduced the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) in the early 90?s: there the task was to slot-fill flight-related information by modeling the intent of spoken language (see Tur et al., 2010, for a review).",
        "This data continues to be a used in the semantic modeling community (see, for example, Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009).",
        "The Geoquery database contains 880 geographical facts about the US and has played a similar role for written (as opposed to spoken) natural language queries against a database (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and it also continues to spur research (see for example Goldwasser et al., 2011), as does the similar Jobs database, which provides mappings of 640 sentences to a listing of jobs (Tang and Mooney, 2001).",
        "More recently, Zweig and Burges (2012) provided a set of 1040 sentences that comprise an SAT-style multiple choice sentence completion task.",
        "The idea of using story-based reading comprehension questions to evaluate methods for machine reading itself goes back over a decade, when Hirschmann et al. (1999) showed that a bag of words approach, together with some heuristic linguistic modeling, could achieve 40% accuracy for the task of picking the sentence that best matches the query for ?who / what / when / where / why?",
        "questions, on a small reading comprehension dataset from Remedia.",
        "This dataset spurred several research efforts, for example using reinforcement learning (Grois and Wilkins, 2005), named entity resolution (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and mapping questions and answers to logical form (Wellner et al., 2006).",
        "Work on story understanding itself goes back much further, to 1972, when Charniak proposed using a background model to answer questions about children's stories.",
        "Similarly, the TREC (and TAC) Question Answering tracks (e.g., Voor-hees and Tice, 1999) aim to evaluate systems on their ability to answer factual questions such as ?Where is the Taj Mahal?.",
        "The QA4MRE task also aims to evaluate machine reading systems through question answering (e.g., Clark et al., 2012).",
        "Earlier work has also aimed at controlling the scope by limiting the text to children's stories: Breck et al. (2001) collected 75 stories from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's web site for children, and generated 650 questions for them manually, where each question was answered by a sentence in the text.",
        "Leidner et al. (2003) both enriched the CBC4kids data by adding several layers of annotation (such as semantic and POS tags), and measured QA performance as a function of question difficulty.",
        "For a further compendium of resources related to the story comprehension task, see Mueller (2010).",
        "The task proposed here differs from the above work in several ways.",
        "Most importantly, the data collection is scalable: if the dataset proves sufficiently useful to others, it would be straightforward to gather an order of magnitude more.",
        "Even the dataset size presented here is an order of magnitude larger than the Remedia or the CBC4kids data and many times larger than QA4MRE.",
        "Second, the multiple choice task presents less ambiguity (and is consequently easier to collect data for) than the",
        "task of finding the most appropriate sentence, and may be automatically evaluated.",
        "Further, our stories are fictional, which means that the information to answer the question is contained only in the story itself (as opposed to being able to directly leverage knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia).",
        "This design was chosen to focus the task on the machine understanding of short passages, rather than the ability to match against an existing knowledge base.",
        "In addition, while in the CBC4kids data each answer was a sentence from the story, here we required that approximately half of the questions require at least two sentences from the text to answer; being able to control complexity in this way is a further benefit of using multiple choice answers.",
        "Finally, as explained in Section 1, the use of free-form input makes the problem open domain (as opposed to the ATIS, Geoquery and Jobs data), leading to the hope that solutions to the task presented here will be easier to apply to novel, unrelated tasks."

        "That is, for those questions it should not be possible to find the answer in any individual sentence.",
        "The motivation for this was to ensure that the task could not be fully solved using lexical techniques, such as word matching, alone.",
        "Whilst it is still possible that a sophisticated lexical analysis could completely solve the task, requiring that answers be constructed from at least two different sentences in the story makes this much less likely; our hope is that the solution will instead require some inference and some form of limited reasoning.",
        "This hope rests in part upon the observation that standardized reading comprehension tests, whose goal after all is to test comprehension, generally avoid questions that can be answered by reading a single sentence."
