        "Synchronous grammar induction, which refers to the process of learning translation rules from bilingual corpus, still remains an open problem in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Although state-of-the-art SMT systems model the translation process based on synchronous grammars (including bilingual phrases), most of them still learn translation rules via a pipeline with word-based heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "This pipeline first builds word alignments using heuristic combination strategies, then heuristically extracts rules that are consistent with word alignments.",
        "Such heuristic pipeline ?Corresponding author is not elegant theoretically.",
        "It brings an undesirable gap that separates modeling and learning in an SMT system.",
        "Therefore, researchers have proposed alternative approaches to learning synchronous grammars directly from sentence pairs without word alignments, via generative models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009; Neubig et al., 2011; Levenberg et al., 2012) or discriminative models (Xiao et al., 2012).",
        "Theoretically, these approaches describe how sentence pairs are generated by applying sequences of synchronous rules in an elegant way.",
        "However, they learn synchronous grammars by maximizing likelihood,1 which only has a loose relation to translation quality (He and Deng, 2012).",
        "Moreover, generative models are normally hard to be extended to incorporate useful features, and the discriminative synchronous grammar induction model proposed by Xiao et al. (2012) only incorporates local features defined on parse trees of the source language.",
        "Non-local features, which encode information from parse trees of the target language, have never been exploited before due to the computational complexity of normalization in max-likelihood estimation.",
        "Consequently, we would like to learn synchronous grammars in a discriminative way that can directly maximize the end-to-end translation quality measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and is also able to incorporate non-local features from target parse trees.",
        "We thus propose a max-margin estimation method",
        "to discriminatively induce synchronous grammar directly from sentence pairs without word alignments.",
        "We try to maximize the margin between a reference translation and a candidate translation with translation errors that are measured by BLEU.",
        "The more serious the translation errors, the larger the margin.",
        "In this way, our max-margin method is able to learn synchronous grammars according to their translation performance.",
        "We further incorporate various non-local features defined on target parse trees.",
        "We efficiently calculate the non-local feature values of a translation over its exponential derivation space using the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "Because our max-margin estimation optimizes feature weights only by the feature values of Viterbi and reference translations, we are able to efficiently perform optimization even with non-local features.",
        "We apply the proposed max-margin estimation method to learn synchronous grammars for a hierarchical phrase-based translation system (Chiang, 2007) which typically produces state-of-the-art performance.",
        "With non-local features defined on target parse trees, our max-margin method significantly outperforms the baseline that uses synchronous rules learned from the traditional pipeline by 1.3 BLEU points on large-scale Chinese-English bilingual training data.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the discriminative synchronous grammar induction model with the non-local features.",
        "In Section 3, we elaborate our max-margin estimation method which is able to directly optimize BLEU, and discuss how we induce grammar rules.",
        "Local and non-local features are described in Section 4.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we verify the effectiveness of our method through experiments by comparing it against both the traditional pipeline and max-likelihood estimation method."
