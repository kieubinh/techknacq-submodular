        "Anaphors such as this fact and this issue encapsulate complex abstract entities such as propositions, facts, and events.",
        "An example is shown below.",
        "(1) Here is another bit of advice: Environmental Defense, a national advocacy group, notes that ?Mowing the lawn with a gas mower produces as much pollution in half an hour as driving a car 172 miles.?",
        "This fact may help to explain the recent surge in the sales of the good old-fashioned push mowers or the battery-powered mowers.",
        "Here, the anaphor this fact is interpreted with the help of the clausal antecedent marked in bold.",
        "The antecedent here is complex because it involves a number of entities and events (e.g., mowing the lawn, a gas mower) and relationships between them, and is abstract because the antecedent itself is not a purely physical entity.",
        "The distinguishing property of these anaphors is that they contain semantically rich abstract nouns (e.g., fact in (1)) which characterize and label their corresponding antecedents.",
        "Linguists and philosophers have studied such abstract nouns for decades (Vendler, 1968; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Francis, 1986; Ivanic, 1991; Asher, 1993).",
        "Our work is inspired by one such study, namely that of Schmid (2000).",
        "Following Schmid, we refer to these abstract nouns as shell nouns, as they serve as conceptual shells for complex chunks of information.",
        "Accordingly, we refer to the anaphoric occurrences of shell nouns (e.g., this fact in (1)) as anaphoric shell nouns (ASNs).",
        "An important reason for studying ASNs is their ubiquity in all kinds of text.",
        "Schmid (2000) observed that shell nouns such as fact, idea, point, and problem were among the 100 most frequently occurring nouns in a corpus of 225 million words of British English.",
        "Moreover, ASNs can play several roles in organizing a discourse such as encapsulation of complex information, cohesion, and topic boundary marking.",
        "So correct interpretation of ASNs can be an important step for correct interpretation of a discourse, and in a number of NLP applications such as text summarization, information extraction, and non-factoid question answering.",
        "Despite their importance, ASNs have not received much attention in Computational Linguistics, and research in this field remains in its earliest stages.",
        "At",
        "present, the major obstacle is that there is very little annotated data available that could be used to train a supervised machine learning system for robustly interpreting these anaphors, and manual annotation is an expensive and time-consuming task.",
        "We tackle this challenge by exploiting a category of examples, as shown in (2), whose construction is particularly easy to interpret.",
        "(2) Congress has focused almost solely on the fact that special education is expensive ?",
        "and that it takes away money from regular education.",
        "Here, in contrast with (1), the fact is not anaphoric in the traditional sense, but is an easy case of a forward-looking anaphor ?",
        "a cataphor.",
        "While the resolution process of this fact in (1) is quite challenging as it requires the use of semantics and world knowledge, it is fairly easy to interpret the fact in (2) based on the syntactic structure alone.",
        "We refer to these easy-to-interpret cataphoric occurrences of shell nouns as cataphoric shell nouns (CSNs).",
        "The interpretation of both ASNs and CSNs will be referred to as antecedent.",
        "The antecedent of the fact in (2) is given in the post-nominal that clause.",
        "We use the term shell concept to refer to the general notion of a shell noun, i.e., the semantic type of the antecedent.",
        "For example, the notion of an issue is an important problem which requires a solution.",
        "In this work, we propose an approach to interpret ASNs that exploits unlabelled but easy-to-interpret CSN examples to extract characteristic features associated with the antecedent of different shell concepts.",
        "We evaluate our approach using crowdsourcing.",
        "Our results show that these unlabelled CSN examples provide useful linguistic properties that help in interpreting ASNs."

        "In the ASN corpus, each sentence on average had 49.5 distinct syntactic constituents given by the Stanford parser.",
        "If we consider n preceding sentences, the sentence containing the anaphor, and one following sentence8 as sources for antecedents, then the average number of antecedent candidates will be 49.5?",
        "(n+ 2).",
        "This is large compared to the search space of ordinary nominal anaphora.",
        "In our previous work (Kolhatkar et al., 2013), we have developed methods that identify the sentence containing the antecedent of the ASN before identifying the precise antecedent.",
        "In brief, given a set of a fixed number of sentences around the sentence containing an ASN, these methods reliably identify the sentence containing the antecedent.",
        "In this paper, we treat these methods as a black box.",
        "Given the sentence containing the antecedent, we extract all syntactic constituents given by the Stanford parser from that sentence as potential antecedent candidates as for the training phase.",
        "In the training phase, the antecedent is always contained in the set of syntactic constituents given by the Stanford parser because the extractor obtains the appropriate antecedent using the syntactic information.",
        "But in the testing phase, we cannot guarantee that the true antecedent occurs in the extracted syntactic constituents due to the parser's errors.",
        "So for robust candidate extraction, we extract all distinct constituents from the 30-best parses instead of only considering the best parse, which increases the average number of candidates from 49.5 to 55.2.",
        "Feature extraction and candidate ranking Given the antecedent candidates, feature extraction and candidate ranking are essentially the same as for the training phase, except of course we do not know the true antecedent.",
        "Once we have the feature vectors for each antecedent candidate, the appropriate trained model, i.e., the model trained for the corresponding shell noun, is invoked and the candidates are ranked using the svm rank classify call of SVMrank."

        "Recall that each ASN instance is made up of the paragraph containing the ASN and two preceding paragraphs as context.",
        "We displayed the first 10 highly-ranked candidates (ordered randomly) given by our testing phase and asked the evaluators to choose the best answer that represents the ASN antecedent.",
        "We encouraged the evaluators to select None when they did not agree with any of the displayed answers.",
        "We also asked them how satisfied they were with the displayed answers.",

        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "Although different feature combinations gave the best results for different shell nouns, the features that occur frequently in many best-performing combinations were embedding level (E), lexical (LX), and subordinating conjunction (SC) features.",
        "The SC features were particularly effective for issue and question, where we expected patterns such as whether X.",

        "In fact, they resulted in a sharp decline in the precision.",
        "For instance, for question, adding the context features to the best-performing combination {E,SC,V,L,LX} resulted in a drop of 16 percentage points.",
        "This result was not surprising because although the antecedents of ASNs and CSNs share similar properties such as common words, we know that their context is generally different.",
        "We did not observe specific features associated with Schmid's semantic categories.",
        "An exception was the E features which were particularly effective for the factual nouns fact and reason: the results with them alone gave high precision (0.68 for fact and 0.72 for reason).",

        "The goal of this paper was to examine to what extent CSNs help in interpreting ASNs.",
        "Based on the evaluators?",
        "satisfaction level and very few None responses, we conclude that our models trained on CSN antecedents were able to bring the relevant ASN antecedent candidates into the top 10 candidates.",
        "When we applied the models trained on CSN antecedents to interpret ASNs, we achieved precision in the range of 0.35 to 0.72.",
        "The precision results as high as 0.72 for reason and 0.70 for fact and question support our hypothesis that the linguistic knowledge provided by CSN antecedents helps in identifying the antecedents of ASNs.",
        "We observed different behaviour for different nouns.",
        "The mental nouns issue and decision in general were harder to interpret than other shell nouns.",
        "The models trained on CSNs achieved precisions of 0.35 for decision and 0.47 for issue.",
        "So there is still much room for improvement.",
        "That said, for the same nouns, the antecedents were in the first four ranks about 76% to 81% of the times,",
        "suggesting that in future research, our models can be used as base models to reduce the large search space of ASN antecedent candidates.",
        "We observed a wide range of performance for different shell nouns.",
        "One reason is that the size of the training data was different for different shell nouns.",
        "After excluding the noisy examples (Section 5.2), there were about 43,000 training examples for fact, but only about 3,000 for issue.",
        "In addition, a particular shell concept itself can be difficult, e.g., the very idea of what counts as an issue is more fuzzy than what counts as a fact.",
        "One limitation of our approach is that it only learns the properties that are present in CSN antecedents.",
        "However, ASN antecedents have additional properties which are not always captured by CSN antecedents.",
        "For instance, for the shell noun decision, most of the training examples were infinitive phrases of the form to X.",
        "But antecedents of the ASN decision were mostly court decisions and were expressed with full sentences.",
        "Moreover, although the models trained on CSN antecedents are able to encode characteristic features associated with the general shell concept, they are unable to distinguish between two competing candidates both containing the characteristic features of that shell concept.",
        "For instance, our approach will not be able to handle the constructed examples in (7).",
        "(7) The teacher erased the solutions before John had time to copy them out, as he had momentarily been distracted by a band playing outside.",
        "a) This fact infuriated him, as the teacher always erased the board quickly and John suspected it was just to punish anyone who was lost in thought, even for a moment.",
        "b) This fact infuriated the teacher, who had already told John several times to focus on class work.",
        "Here, both propositions possess properties of the shell concept fact.",
        "Understanding the context of the anaphor itself is crucial in correctly identifying the fact in each case, which cannot be learnt from CSN antecedents due to their specific context patterns.",
        "A number of extensions are planned for this work.",
        "First, we plan to use both kinds of data, CSN and ASN antecedent data, which will give us a basis for developing a better performing ASN resolver.",
        "We also plan to incorporate contextual features (e.g., right-frontier rule (Webber, 1991) and context ranking (Eckert and Strube, 2000)).",
        "Finally, we will examine whether a model trained for one shell noun can be generalized to other shell nouns from the same semantic category."
