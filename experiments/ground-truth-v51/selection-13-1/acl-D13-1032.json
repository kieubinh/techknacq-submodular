        "Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are arguably one of the best performing sequence prediction models for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "During CRF training forward-backward computations, a form of dynamic programming, dominate the asymptotic runtime.",
        "The training and also decoding times thus depend polynomially on the size of the tagset and exponentially on the order of the CRF.",
        "This probably explains why CRFs, despite their outstanding accuracy, normally only are applied to tasks with small tagsets such as Named Entity Recognition and Chunking; if they are applied to tasks with bigger tagsets ?",
        "e.g., to part-of-speech (POS) tagging for English ?",
        "then they generally are used as 1st-order models.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that fast and accurate CRF training and tagging is possible for large tagsets of even thousands of tags by approximating the CRF objective function using coarse-to-fine decoding (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Rush and Petrov, 2012).",
        "Our pruned CRF (PCRF) model has much smaller runtime than higher-order CRF models and may thus lead to an even broader application of CRFs across NLP tagging tasks.",
        "We use POS tagging and combined POS and morphological (POS+MORPH) tagging to demonstrate the properties and benefits of our approach.",
        "POS+MORPH disambiguation is an important preprocessing step for syntactic parsing.",
        "It is usually tackled by applying sequence prediction.",
        "POS+MORPH tagging is also a good example of a task where CRFs are rarely applied as the tagsets are often so big that even 1st-order dynamic programming is too expensive.",
        "A workaround is to restrict the possible tag candidates per position by using either morphological analyzers (MAs), dictionaries or heuristics (Hajic?, 2000).",
        "In this paper, however we show that when using pruning (i.e., PCRFs), CRFs can be trained in reasonable time, which makes hard constraints unnecessary.",
        "In this paper, we run successful experiments on six languages with different morphological properties; we interpret this as evidence that our approach is a general solution to the problem of POS+MORPH tagging.",
        "The tagsets in our experiments range from small sizes of 12 to large sizes of up to 1811.",
        "We will see that even for the smallest tagset, PCRFs need only 40% of the training time of standard CRFs.",
        "For the bigger tagset sizes we can reduce training times from several days to several hours.",
        "We will also show that training higher-order PCRF models takes only several minutes longer than training 1st-order models and ?",
        "depending on the language ?",
        "may lead to substantial accuracy im",

        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes our CRF implementation1 and the feature set used.",
        "Section 3 summarizes related work on tagging with CRFs, efficient CRF tagging and coarse-to-fine decoding.",
