        "This paper addresses the task of predicting the correct French translations of third-person subject pronouns in English discourse, a problem that is relevant as a prerequisite for machine translation and that requires anaphora resolution.",

        "When texts are translated from one language into another, the translation reconstructs the meaning or function of the source text with the means of the target language.",
        "Generally, this has the effect that the entities occurring in the translation and their mutual relations will display similar patterns as the entities in the source text.",
        "In particular, coreference patterns tend to be very similar in translations of a text, and this fact has been exploited with good results to project coreference annotations from one language into another by using word alignments (Postolache et al., 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2012).",
        "On the other hand, what is true in general need not be true for all types of linguistic elements.",
        "For instance, a substantial percentage of the English third-person subject pronouns he, she, it and they does not get realised as pronouns in French translations (Hardmeier, 2012).",
        "Moreover, it has been recognised by various authors in the statistical machine translation (SMT) community (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Hardmeier and Federico, 2010; Guillou, 2012) that pronoun translation is a difficult problem because, even when a pronoun does get translated as a pronoun, it may require choosing the correct word form based on agreement features that are not easily predictable from the source text.",
        "The work presented in this paper investigates the problem of cross-lingual pronoun prediction for English-French.",
        "Given an English pronoun and its discourse context as well as a French translation of the same discourse and word alignments between the two languages, we attempt to predict the French word aligned to the English pronoun.",
        "As far as we know, this task has not been addressed in the literature before.",
        "In our opinion, it is interesting for several reasons.",
        "By studying pronoun prediction as a task in its own right, we hope to contribute towards a better understanding of pronoun translation with a long-term view to improving the performance of SMT systems.",
        "Moreover, we believe that this task can lead to interesting insights about anaphora resolution in a multilingual context.",
        "In particular, we show in this paper that the pronoun prediction task makes it possible to model the resolution of pronominal anaphora as a latent variable and opens up a way to solve a task relying on anaphora resolution without using any data annotated for anaphora.",
        "This is what we consider the main contribution of our present work.",
        "We start by modelling cross-lingual pronoun prediction as an independent machine learning task after doing anaphora resolution in the source language (English) using the BART software (Broscheit et al., 2010).",
        "We show that it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with standard maximum",

        "entropy classifiers especially for low-frequency pronouns such as the French feminine plural pronoun elles.",
        "We propose a neural network classifier that achieves better precision and recall and manages to make reasonable predictions for all pronoun categories in many cases.",
        "We then go on to extend our neural network architecture to include anaphoric links as latent variables.",
        "We demonstrate that our classifier, now with its own source language anaphora resolver, can be trained successfully with backpropagation.",
        "In this setup, we no longer use the machine learning component included in the external coreference resolution system (BART) to predict anaphoric links.",

        "We are given an English discourse containing a pronoun along with its French translation and word alignments between the two languages, which in our case were computed automatically using a standard SMT pipeline with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "We focus on the four English third-person subject pronouns he, she, it and they.",
        "The output of the classifier is a multinomial distribution over six classes: the four French subject pronouns il, elle, ils and elles, corresponding to masculine and feminine singular and plural, respectively; the impersonal pronoun ce/c?, which occurs in some very frequent constructions such as c?est (it is); and a sixth class OTHER, which indicates that none of these pronouns was used.",
        "In general, a pronoun may be aligned to multiple words; in this case, a training example is counted as a positive example for a class if the target word occurs among the words aligned to the pronoun, irrespective of the presence of other",
        "aligned tokens.",
        "This task setup resembles the problem that an SMT system would have to solve to make informed choices when translating pronouns, an aspect of translation neglected by most existing SMT systems.",
        "An important difference between the SMT setup and our own classifiers is that we use context from human-made translations for prediction.",
        "This potentially makes the task both easier and more difficult; easier, because the context can be relied on to be correctly translated, and more difficult, because human translators frequently create less literal translations than an SMT system would.",
        "Integrating pronoun prediction into the translation process would require significant changes to the standard SMT decoding setup in order to take long-range dependencies in the target language into account, which is why we do not address this issue in our current work.",
        "In all the experiments presented in this paper, we used features from two different sources: ?",
        "Anaphora context features describe the source language pronoun and its immediate context consisting of three words to its left and three words to its right.",
        "They are encoded as vectors whose dimensionality is equal to the source vocabulary size with a single non-zero component indicating the word referred to (one-hot vectors).",
        "?",
        "Antecedent features describe an antecedent candidate.",
        "Antecedent candidates are represented by the target language words aligned to the syntactic head of the source language markable",
        "noun phrase as identified by the Collins head finder (Collins, 1999).",
        "The different handling of anaphora context features and antecedent features is due to the fact that we always consider a constant number of context words on the source side, whereas the number of word vectors to be considered depends on the number of antecedent candidates and on the number of target words aligned to each antecedent.",
        "The encoding of the antecedent features is illustrated in Figure 2 for a training example with two antecedent candidates translated to elle and la version, respectively.",
        "The target words are represented as one-hot vectors with the dimensionality of the target language vocabulary.",
        "These vectors are then averaged to yield a single vector per antecedent candidate.",
        "Finally, the vectors of all candidates for a given training example are weighted by the probabilities assigned to them by the anaphora resolver (p1 and p2) and summed to yield a single vector per training example."
