        "Information extraction (IE) is becoming increasingly useful as a form of shallow semantic analysis.",
        "Learning relational facts from text is one of the core tasks of IE and has applications in a variety of fields including summarization, question answering, and information retrieval.",
        "Previous work (Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2007) has traditionally relied on extensive human involvement (e.g., hand-annotated training instances, manual pattern extraction rules, hand-picked seeds).",
        "Standard supervised techniques can yield high performance when large amounts of hand-labeled data are available for a fixed inventory of relation types (e.g., Employment, Located), however, extraction systems do not easily generalize beyond their training domains and often must be re-engineered for each application.",
        "Unsupervised approaches offer a promising alternative which could lead to significant resource savings and more portable extraction systems.",
        "It therefore comes as no surprise that latent topic analysis methods have been used for a variety of IE tasks.",
        "Yao et al. (2011), for example, propose a series of topic models which perform relation discovery by clustering tuples representing an observed syntactic relationship between two named entities (e.g., ?X was born in Y?",
        "and ?X is from Y?).",
        "The clusters correspond to semantic relations whose number or type is not known in advance.",
        "Their models depart from standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) in that a document consists of relation tuples rather than individual words; moreover, tuples have features each of which is generated independently from a hidden relation (e.g., the words corresponding to the first and second entities, the type and order of the named entities).",
        "Since these features are local, they cannot capture more global constraints pertaining to the relation extraction task.",
        "Such constraints may take the form of restrictions on which tuples should be clustered together or not.",
        "For instance, different types of named entities may be indicative of different relations (ORG-LOC entities often express a Location relation whereas PER-PER entities express Business or Family relations) and thus tuples bearing these entities should not be grouped together.",
        "Another example are tuples with identical or similar features which intuitively should be clustered together.",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to relation extraction which does not re",
        "quire any relation-specific training data and allows to incorporate global constraints general expressing domain knowledge.",
        "We encode domain knowledge as First Order Logic (FOL) rules and automatically integrate them with a topic model to produce clusters shaped by the data and the constraints at hand.",
        "Specifically, we extend the Fold-all (First-Order Logic latent Dirichlet Allocation) framework (Andrzejewski et al., 2011) to the relation extraction task, explain how to incorporate meaningful constraints, and develop a scalable inference technique.",
        "In the presence of multiple candidate relation decompositions for a given corpus, domain knowledge can steer the model towards relations which are best aligned with user and task modeling goals.",
        "We also argue that a general mechanism for encoding additional modeling assumptions and side information can lessen the need for ?custom?",
        "relation extraction model variants.",
        "Experimental results on the ACE2007 Relation Detection and Categorization (RDC) dataset show that our model outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin and is able to uncover meaningful relations with only two general rule types.",
        "Our contributions in this work are three-fold: a new model that modifies the Fold-all framework and extends it to the relation extraction task; a new formalization of the logic rules applicable to topic models defined over a rich set of features; and a proposal for mining the logic rules automatically from a corpus contrary to Andrzejewski et al. (2011) who employ manually crafted seeds."

        "Semi-supervised methods use a small number of seed instances or patterns (per relation) to launch an iterative training process (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Pan-tel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "The seeds are used to extract a new set of patterns from a large corpus, which are then used to extract more instances, and so on.",

        "Another learning paradigm is distant supervision which does not require labeled data but instead access to a relational database such as Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009).",
        "The idea is to take entities that appear in some relation in the database, find the sentences that express the relation in an unlabeled corpus, and use them to train a relation classifier.",
        "Our own work adds an additional approach into the mix.",
        "We use a topic model to infer an arbitrary number of relations between named entities.",
        "Although we do not have access to relation-specific information (either as a relational database or manually annotated data), we impose task-specific constraints which inject domain knowledge into the learning algorithm.",

        "Schoenmackers et al. (2010) learn Horn clauses from web-scale text with aim of finding answers to a user's query.",
        "Our work is complementary to theirs.",
        "We could make use of their rules to discover more accurate relations.",
        "The general goal of assisting the learner in recovering the ?correct?",
        "clustering by supplying additional domain knowledge is not new.",

        "We thus present results with a model that includes both Must-link and Cannot-link tuple rules (CLT+MLT), and models that include either Must-link (MLT) or Cannot-link (CLT) rules but not both.",
        "We show the performance of these models with the entire feature set (see (ALL) in the table) and with a subset consisting solely of NE pair related features (see (NEPAIR) in the table).",
        "We report results against coarse-and fine-grained relations (6 and 18 relation types in ACE, respectively).",
        "The table shows the optimal number of relation clusters (in parentheses) per model and relation type.",

        "We thus trained an additional variant of our model with rules extracted from the ACE training set (75%) which contains relation annotations.",
        "The extraction procedure was similar to the unsupervised case, save that the relation types were known and thus informative features could be mined more reliably.",
        "For Must-link rules, we extracted unigram and bigram feature frequencies for each relation type and applied TF-IDF weighting in order to discover the most discriminative ones.",
        "We created logic rules for the 10 best feature combinations in each relation type.",
        "Regarding Cannot-link rules, we enumerated the features (unigrams and bigrams)",

        "In general, CLT models perform worse as well as models using both types of rules (MLT+CLT).",
        "The inferior performance of the rule combination may be due to the fact that MLT and CLT rules contain conflicting information and to a certain extent cancel each other out.",
        "The use of many rules might also negatively impact inference, i.e., discriminative rules are sampled less and cannot influence the model towards a better solution.",
        "Restricting the number of features and rules to named entity pairs only incurs a negligible drop in performance.",
        "This is good news for scaling purposes, since a small number of rules can greatly speed-up inference.",
        "Interestingly, model variants which use supervised FOL rules (see the prefix Sin Table 3) perform on par with unsupervised models.",
        "Again, MLT rules perform best in the supervised case, whereas CLT rules marginally improve over RelLDA.",

        "= 0.65 for U-CLT (ALL)).",

        "In this paper we presented a new model for unsupervised relation extraction which operates over tuples representing a syntactic relationship between two named entities.",

        "Specifically, we combine a topic model developed for the relation extraction task with domain relevant rules, and present an algorithm for estimating the parameters of this model.",

        "information to distinct relations.",
        "Aside from devising new rule types, an obvious next step would be to explore different ways of extracting the rule set based on different criteria (e.g., the most general versus most specific rules).",
        "Also note that in the current framework rule weights are set manually by the domain expert.",
        "An appealing direction would be to learn these automatically e.g., via a procedure that optimizes some clustering objective.",
        "Finally, it should be interesting to use some form of distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) either as a means of obtaining useful rules or to discard potentially noisy or uninformative rules."
