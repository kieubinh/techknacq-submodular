        "Measuring the semantic similarity of short units of text is fundamental to many natural language processing tasks, from evaluating machine translation (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006) to grouping redundant event mentions in social media (Petrovic?",
        "et al, 2010).",
        "The task is challenging because of the infinitely diverse set of possible linguistic realizations for any idea (Bhagat and Hovy, 2013), and because of the short length of individual sentences, which means that standard bag-of-words representations will be hopelessly sparse.",
        "Distributional methods address this problem by transforming the high-dimensional bag-of-words representation into a lower-dimensional latent space.",
        "This can be accomplished by factoring a matrix or tensor of term-context counts (Turney and Pan-tel, 2010); proximity in the induced latent space has been shown to correlate with semantic similarity (Mihalcea et al., 2006).",
        "However, factoring the term-context matrix means throwing away a considerable amount of information, as the original matrix of size M ?N (number of instances by number of features) is factored into two smaller matrices of size M ?K and N ?K, with K M,N .",
        "If the factorization does not take into account labeled data about semantic similarity, important information can be lost.",
        "In this paper, we show how labeled data can considerably improve distributional methods for measuring semantic similarity.",
        "First, we develop a new discriminative term-weighting metric called TF-KLD, which is applied to the term-context matrix before factorization.",
        "On a standard paraphrase identification task (Dolan et al., 2004), this method improves on both traditional TF-IDF and Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization (WTMF; Guo and Diab, 2012).",
        "Next, we convert the latent representations of each sentence pair into a feature vector, which is used as input to a linear SVM classifier.",
        "This yields further improvements and substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art on paraphrase classification.",
        "We then add ?fine-grained?",
        "features about the lexical similarity of the sentence pair.",
        "The combination of latent and fine-grained features yields further improvements in accuracy, demonstrating that these feature sets provide complementary information on semantic similarity."

        "Without attempting to do justice to the entire literature on paraphrase identification, we note three high-level approaches: (1) string similarity metrics such as n-gram overlap and BLEU score (Wan et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2012), as well as string kernels (Bu et al., 2012); (2) syntactic operations on the parse structure (Wu, 2005; Das and Smith, 2009); and (3) distributional methods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA; Landauer et al., 1998), which are most relevant to our work.",
        "One application of distributional techniques is to replace individual words with distributionally similar alternatives (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "Alternatively, Blacoe and Lapata (2012) show that latent word representations can be combined with simple element-wise operations to identify the semantic similarity of larger units of text.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) propose a syntactically-informed approach to combine word representations, using a recursive auto-encoder to propagate meaning through the parse tree.",
        "We take a different approach: rather than representing the meanings of individual words, we directly obtain a distributional representation for the entire sentence.",
        "This is inspired by Mihalcea et al. (2006) and Guo and Diab (2012), who treat sentences as pseudo-documents in an LSA framework, and identify paraphrases using similarity in the latent space.",
        "We show that the performance of such techniques can be improved dramatically by using supervised information to (1) reweight the individual distributional features and (2) learn the importance of each latent dimension."

        "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is traditionally used to perform this factorization.",
        "However, recent work has demonstrated the robustness of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF; Lee and Seung, 2001) for text mining tasks (Xu et al., 2003; Arora et al., 2012); the difference from SVD is the addition of a non-negativity constraint in the latent representation based on non-orthogonal basis.",

        "Taking the unigram feature not as an example, we have pk = [0.66, 0.34] and qk = [0.31, 0.69], for a KL-divergence of 0.25: the likelihood of this word being shared between two sentence is strongly dependent on whether the sentences are paraphrases.",
