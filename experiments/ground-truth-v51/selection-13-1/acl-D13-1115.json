        "In recent years, an increasing body of work has been devoted to multimodal or ?grounded?",
        "models of language where semantic representations of words are extended to include perceptual information.",
        "The underlying hypothesis is that the meanings of words are explicitly tied to our perception and understanding of the world around us, and textual-information alone is insufficient for a complete understanding of language.",
        "The language grounding problem has come in many different flavors with just as many different approaches.",
        "Some approaches apply semantic parsing, where words and sentences are mapped to logical structure meaning (Kate and Mooney, 2007).",
        "Others provide automatic mappings of natural language instructions to executable actions, such as interpreting navigation directions (Chen and Mooney, 2011) or robot commands (Tellex et al., 2011; Matuszek et al., 2012).",
        "Some efforts have tackled tasks such as automatic image caption generation (Feng and La-pata, 2010a; Ordonez et al., 2011), text illustration (Joshi et al., 2006), or automatic location identification of Twitter users (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Roller et al., 2012).",
        "Another line of research approaches grounded language knowledge by augmenting distributional approaches of word meaning with perceptual information (Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers, 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2010b; Bruni et al., 2011; Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Johns and Jones, 2012; Bruni et al., 2012a; Bruni et al., 2012b; Silberer et al., 2013).",
        "Although these approaches have differed in model definition, the general goal in this line of research has been to enhance word meaning with perceptual information in order to address one of the most common criticisms of distributional semantics: that the ?meaning of words is entirely given by other words?",
        "(Bruni et al., 2012b).",
        "In this paper, we explore various ways to integrate new perceptual information through novel computational modeling of this grounded knowledge into a multimodal distributional model of word meaning.",
        "The model we rely on was originally developed by",
        "Andrews et al. (2009) and is based on a generalization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.",
        "This model has previously been shown to provide excellent performance on multiple tasks, including prediction of association norms, word substitution errors, semantic inferences, and word similarity (Andrews et al., 2009; Silberer and Lapata, 2012).",
        "While prior work has used the model only with feature norms and visual attributes, we show that low-level image features are directly compatible with the model and provide improved representations of word meaning.",
        "We also show how simple, unsupervised clusters of images can act as a semantically useful and qualitatively interesting set of features.",
        "Finally, we describe two ways to extend the model by incorporating three or more modalities.",
        "We find that each modality provides useful but disjoint information for describing word meaning, and that a hybrid integration of multiple modalities provides significant improvements in the representations of word meaning.",
        "We release both our code and data to the community for future research.1"

        "The language grounding problem has received significant attention in recent years, owed in part to the wide availability of data sets (e.g. Flickr, Von Ahn (2006)), computing power, improved computer vision models (Oliva and Torralba, 2001; Lowe, 2004; Farhadi et al., 2009; Parikh and Grauman, 2011) and neurological evidence of ties between the language, perceptual and motor systems in the brain (Pulvermu?ller et al., 2005; Tettamanti et al., 2005; Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2006).",
        "Many approaches to multimodal research have succeeded by abstracting away raw perceptual information and using high-level representations instead.",
        "Some works abstract perception via the usage of symbolic logic representations (Chen et al., 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011; Matuszek et al., 2012; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), while others choose to employ concepts elicited from psycholinguistic and cognition studies.",
        "Within the latter category, the two most common representations have been association norms, where subjects are given a",
        "cue word and name the first (or several) associated words that come to mind (e.g., Nelson et al. (2004)), and feature norms, where subjects are given a cue word and asked to describe typical properties of the cue concept (e.g., McRae et al. (2005)).",
        "Griffiths et al. (2007) helped pave the path for cognitive-linguistic multimodal research, showing that Latent Dirichlet Allocation outperformed Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) in the prediction of association norms.",
        "Andrews et al. (2009) furthered this work by showing that a bimodal topic model, consisting of both text and feature norms, outperformed models using only one modality on the prediction of association norms, word substitution errors, and semantic interference tasks.",
        "In a similar vein, Steyvers (2010) showed that a different feature-topic model improved predictions on a fill-in-the-blank task.",
        "Johns and Jones (2012) take an entirely different approach by showing that one can successfully infer held out feature norms from weighted mixtures based on textual similarity.",
        "Silberer and Lapata (2012) introduce a new method of multimodal integration based on Canonical Correlation Analysis, and performs a systematic comparison between their CCA-based model and others on association norm prediction, held out feature prediction, and word similarity.",
        "As computer vision techniques have improved over the past decade, other research has begun directly using visual information in place of feature norms.",
        "The first work to do this with topic models is Feng and Lapata (2010b).",
        "They use a Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) model (Lowe, 2004) to create a bimodal vocabulary describing documents.",
        "The topic model using the bimodal vocabulary outperforms a purely textual based model in word association and word similarity prediction.",
        "Bruni et al. (2012a) show how a BoVW model may be easily combined with a distributional vector space model of language using only vector concatenation.",
        "Bruni et al. (2012b) show that the contextual visual words (i.e. the visual features around an object, rather than of the object itself) are even more useful at times, suggesting the plausibility of a sort of distributional hypothesis for images.",
        "More recently, Silberer et al. (2013) show that visual attribute classifiers, which have been immensely successful in object recognition (Farhadi et al., 2009), act as excellent substitutes for feature",
        "norms.",
        "Other work on modeling the meanings of verbs using video recognition has also begun showing great promise (Mathe et al., 2008; Regneri et al., 2013).",
        "The Computer Vision community has also benefited greatly from efforts to unify the two modalities.",
        "To name a few examples, Rohrbach et al. (2010) and Socher et al. (2013) show how semantic information from text can be used to improve zero-shot classification (i.e., classifying never-before-seen objects), and Motwani and Mooney (2012) show that verb clusters can be used to improve activity recognition in videos."
