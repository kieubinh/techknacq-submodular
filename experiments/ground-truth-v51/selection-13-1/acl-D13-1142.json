        "One of the features of hypertext documents are hy-perlinks that point to other resources ?",

        "A fairly familiar category of the latter is related articles; these usually appear at the end of a news article or a blog post with the title of the target document as anchor text.",
        "The target document is similar in content to original document; it may tell the story from another point of view, it may be a more detailed version of a part of the events in the original document, etc.",
        "Another category are the in-text links; these appear inside the main body of text and use some of the existing text as anchor.",
        "Ideally the anchor text is selected in such a way that it conveys some information about the target document; in reality sometimes just an adverb (e.g. here, there) is used, or even the destination URL may serve as anchor.",
        "Our goal is to develop a system that automatically constructs in-text links, i.e. for a query document finds a target document and an appropriate part of the text of the query document that serves as the anchor text for the hyperlink.",
        "We want the target document to be similar in content to the query document and the anchor text to indicate that content.",
        "There are many potential uses for such a system, especially for simplifying and streamlining document creation.",
        "This includes authors of blogs that may use the system for adding related content from other sources without exhausting manual search for such material.",
        "It may also be used when writing a scientific paper, automatically adding citations to other relevant papers inside the main body.",
        "This accelerates the writing, again reducing the time spent searching for possible existing research in the field.",
        "A citation can be considered an in-text link without a defined starting point.",
        "We have addressed the problem in two steps, separately finding a similar document, and finding the anchor text for it.",
        "Since the retrieval of similar documents was a research focus for many years and is thus better researched, we have decided in this paper to focus on the placement of the anchor text for a link to a preselected document.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: related work is discussed in Section 2, the methods, corpus, and evaluation are described in Section 3, followed by",

        "It can be used in many applications such as summarization, educational systems, finding duplicated bug reports in software testing (Lintean et al., 2010), plagiarism detection (Kasprzak and Bran-dejs, 2010), and research of a scientific field (Koberstein and Ng, 2006).",
        "Documents can vary in length from microblogs (Twitter) and sentences (Li et al., 2006; Koberstein and Ng, 2006) to paragraphs (Lin-tean et al., 2010) and larger documents (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "There is also commercial software such as nRe-late1, Zemanta2 and OpenCalais3 with functionality that ranges from named entity recognition (NER) and event detection to related content.",
        "Publishers use in-house tools that offer automatic retrieval of in-house similar documents.",
        "Most of the methods for comparing documents focus on the query document as a whole.",
        "The calculated score therefore belongs to the whole document and nothing can be said about more or less similar parts of the document.",
        "Our goal is to localize the similarity to a part of the query document, a paragraph, sentence, or even a part of the sentence that is most similar to another document.",
        "This part of the query document can then serve as anchor text for a hyperlink connection to the similar document.",
        "Plagiarism detection methods (Alzahrani et al., 2012; Monostori et al., 2002) have a task of verifying the originality of the document.",
        "Extrinsic plagiarism detection methods compare two documents to determine if some of the material in one is plagiarised from the other.",
        "Methods range from simple exact substring matching to more advanced ones like semantic based methods that are able to recognize paraphrasing and refactoring (Alzahrani et al., 2012).",
        "These methods have localization of similarity already built-in as they are searching for parts of the text that seem to be plagiarised.",
        "We have focused on",
        "one such method, the winner of the PAN 2010 challenge (Kasprzak and Brandejs, 2010).",
        "This method uses shared n-grams from the two documents in order to determine if one of them is plagiarised.",
        "Another similar research is automatic citation placement for scientific papers.",
        "Most of the work (Strohman et al., 2007; McNee et al., 2002) is concerned with putting citations at the end of the paper (non-localized), which is a task similar to inserting related articles for a news article at the of the text.",
        "There have been some attempts to place the citations in the main body of text (Tang and Zhang, 2009; He et al., 2011), typically used when referring to an idea or method.",
        "Tang and Zang (2009) used a placeholder constraint: the query document must contain placeholders for citations, i.e. the places in text where citation might be inserted.",
        "Their method then just ranks all possible documents for a particular placeholder and chooses the best ranked document as a result.",
        "Documents are ranked on the basis of a learned topic model, obtained by a two-layer Restricted Boltzmann Machine.",
        "He et al(2011) made a step further towards generality of a citation location; they divide the text into overlapping windows and then decide which windows are viable citation context.",
        "The best method for deciding which citation context to use was a dependency feature model, an ensemble method using 17 different features and decision trees.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) also offers a useful insight into document similarity.",
        "If two documents share a named entity (NE), it is more likely they are similar.",
        "Detected NEs may also serve as anchor text for the link.",
        "NER is a fairly researched field (Finkel et al., 2005; Ratinov et al., 2011; Bunescu and Paşca, 2006; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Milne and Witten, 2008) and is also used in several commercial applications such as Zemanta, OpenCalais and AlchemyAPI4, which are able to automatically insert links for a NE pointing to a knowledge base such as Wikipedia or IMDB.",

        "We have also tested a proper noun - verb - proper noun combination, but there were even fewer results, so this direction was abandoned.",
        "A corpus is represented in LSI (Deerwester et al., 1990) as a large matrix of term occurrences",
        "in individual documents.",
        "The rank of the matrix is then reduced using singular value decomposition that groups together terms that occur in similar context which should therefore account for synonyms.",
        "We have used a tool called gensim (R?ehu?r?ek and Sojka, 2010) that enabled us to quickly train a LSI model using the whole corpus and index just the related articles.",
        "In order to localize the similarity and place an anchor, we split the source document into paragraphs and compute similarity scores between target document and each paragraph of the source document.",
        "We then split the paragraph with the highest score into sentences and again obtain scores for each.",
        "The sentence with the best score is then chosen as the result.",
        "Drawing on plagiarism detection, the winning method from the PAN 2010 (Kasprzak and Bran-dejs, 2010) seemed a viable choice.",
        "The basis of the method is comparing n-grams of the source and the destination documents.",
        "First, the text was again tokenized with NLTK, removed stopwords and tokens with two or less characters.",
        "Then overlapping n-grams were constructed.",
        "We have deviated from Kasprzak's merging policy and decided to merge two results if they are less than 20 tokens apart.",
        "We also required only one shared n-gram to consider the documents similar.",
