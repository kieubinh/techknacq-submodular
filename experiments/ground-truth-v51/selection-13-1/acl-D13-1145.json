        "Experiments demonstrate that the learned classifier can provide high quality idiom labels, more than doubling the number of idiomatic entries from 7,764 to 18,155 at precision levels of over 65%.",
        "These gains also translate to idiom detection in sentences, by simply using known word sense disambiguation algorithms to match phrases to their definitions.",

        "Idiomatic language is common and provides unique challenges for language understanding systems.",

        "Understanding such distinctions is important for many applications, including parsing (Sag et al., 2002) and machine translation (Shutova et al., 2012).",
        "We use Wiktionary as a large, but incomplete, reference for idiomatic entries; individual entries can be marked as idiomatic but, in practice, most are not.",
        "Using these incomplete annotations as supervision, we train a binary Perceptron classifier for identifying idiomatic dictionary entries.",
        "We introduce new lexical and graph-based features that use WordNet and Wiktionary to compute semantic relatedness.",
        "This allows us to learn, for example, that the words in the phrase diamond in the rough are more closely related to the words in its literal definition than the idiomatic one.",
        "Experiments demonstrate that the classifier achieves precision of over 65% at recall over 52% and that, when used to fill in missing Wiktionary idiom labels, it more than doubles the number of idioms from 7,764 to 18,155.",
        "These gains also translate to idiom detection in sentences, by simply using the Lesk word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm (1986) to match phrases to their definitions.",
        "This approach allows for scalable detection with no restrictions on the syntactic structure or context of the target phrase.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to identify dictionary entries as idiomatic and the first to reduce idiom detection to identification via a dictionary.",
        "Previous idiom detection systems fall in one of two paradigms: phrase classification, where a phrase p is always idiomatic or literal, e.g. (Gedigian et al., 2006; Shutova et al., 2010), or token classification, where each occurrence of a phrase p can be idiomatic or literal, e.g. (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006;",
        "Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Li and Sporleder, 2009).",
        "Most previous idiom detection systems have focused on specific syntactic constructions.",
        "For instance, Shutova et al. (2010) consider subject/verb (campaign surged) and verb/direct-object idioms (stir excitement) while Fazly and Stevenson (2006), Cook et al. (2007), and Diab and Bhutada (2009) detect verb/noun idioms (blow smoke).",
        "Fothergill and Baldwin (2012) are syntactically unconstrained, but only study Japanese idioms.",
        "Although we focus on identifying idiomatic dictionary entries, one advantage of our approach is that it enables syntactically unconstrained token-level detection for any phrase in the dictionary."
