        "Graph-based dependency parsing usually consists of two stages.",
        "In the scoring stage, we score all possible edges (or other small substructures) using a learned function; in the decoding stage, we use combinatorial optimization to find the dependency tree with the highest total score.",
        "Generally linear edge-scoring functions are used for speed.",
        "But they use a large set of features, derived from feature templates that consider different conjunctions of the edge's attributes.",
        "As a result, parsing time is dominated by the scoring stage?",
        "computing edge attributes, using them to instantiate feature templates, and looking up the weights of the resulting features in a hash table.",
        "For example, McDonald et al. (2005a) used on average about 120 first-order feature templates on each edge, built from attributes such as the edge direction and length, the two words connected by the edge, and the parts of speech of these and nearby words.",
        "We therefore ask the question: can we use fewer features to score the edges, while maintaining the effect that the true dependency tree still gets a higher score?",
        "Motivated by recent progress on dynamic feature selection (Benbouzid et al., 2012; He et al., 2012), we propose to add features one group at a time to the dependency graph, and to use these features together with interactions among edges (as determined by intermediate parsing results) to make hard decisions on some edges before all their features have been seen.",
        "Our approach has a similar flavor to cascaded classifiers (Viola and Jones, 2004; Weiss and Taskar, 2010) in that we make decisions for each edge at every stage.",
        "However, in place of relatively simple heuristics such as a global relative pruning threshold, we learn a featurized decision-making policy of a more complex form.",
        "Since each decision can affect later stages, or later decisions in the same stage, we model this problem as a sequential decision-making process and solve it by Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) (Ross et al., 2011), a recent iterative imitation learning technique for structured prediction.",
        "Previous work has made much progress on the complementary problem: speeding up the decoding stage by pruning the search space of tree structures.",
        "In Roark and Hollingshead (2008) and Bergsma and Cherry (2010), pruning decisions are made locally as a preprocessing step.",
        "In the recent vine pruning approach (Rush and Petrov, 2012), significant speedup is gained by leveraging structured information via a coarse-to-fine projective parsing cas",
        "cade (Charniak et al., 2006).",
        "These approaches do not directly tackle the feature selection problem.",
        "Although pruned edges do not require further feature computation, the pruning step must itself compute similar high-dimensional features just to decide which edges to prune.",
        "For this reason, Rush and Petrov (2012) restrict the pruning models to a smaller feature set for time efficiency.",
        "We aim to do feature selection and edge pruning dynamically, balancing speed and accuracy by using only as many features as needed.",
        "In this paper, we first explore standard static feature selection methods for dependency parsing, and show that even a few feature templates can give decent accuracy (Section 3.2).",
        "We then propose a novel way to dynamically select features for each edge while keeping the overhead of decision making low (Section 4).",
        "Our present experiments use the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) parsing algorithm (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).",
        "However, our approach applies to other graph-based dependency parsers as well?including non-projective parsing, higher-order parsing, or approximations to higher-order parsing that use stacking (Martins et al., 2008), belief propagation (Smith and Eisner, 2008), or structured boosting (Wang et al., 2007)."
