        "Concept-to-text generation broadly refers to the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Depending on the application and the domain at hand, the input may assume various representations including databases, expert system knowledge bases, simulations of physical systems, or formal meaning representations.",
        "Generation systems typically follow a pipeline architecture consisting of three components: content planning (selecting and ordering the parts of the input to be mentioned in the output text), sentence planning (determining the structure and lexical content of individual sentences), and surface realization (verbalizing the chosen content in natural language).",
        "Traditionally, these components are hand-engineered in order to ensure output of high quality.",
        "More recently there has been growing interest in the application of learning methods because of their promise to make generation more robust and adaptable.",
        "Examples include learning which content should be present in a document (Duboue and McKeown, 2002; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), how it should be aligned to utterances (Liang et al., 2009), and how to select a sentence plan among many alternatives (Stent et al., 2004).",
        "Beyond isolated components, a few approaches have emerged that tackle concept-to-text generation end-to-end.",
        "Due to the complexity of the task, most models simplify the generation process, e.g., by treating sentence planning and surface realization as one component (An-geli et al., 2010), by implementing content selection without any document planning (Konstas and Lapata, 2012; Angeli et al., 2010; Kim and Mooney, 2010), or by eliminating content planning entirely (Belz, 2008; Wong and Mooney, 2007).",
        "In this paper we present a trainable end-to-end generation system that captures all components of the traditional pipeline, including document planning.",
        "Rather than breaking up the generation process into a sequence of local decisions, each learned separately (Reiter et al., 2005; Belz, 2008; Chen and Mooney, 2008; Kim and Mooney, 2010), our model performs content planning (i.e., document planning and content selection), sentence planning (i.e., lex",

        "We represent content plans with grammar rules which operate on the document level and are embedded on top of the original PCFG.",
        "We essentially learn a discourse grammar following two approaches.",
        "The first one is linguistically naive but applicable to multiple languages and domains; it extracts rules representing global patterns of record sequences within a sentence and among sentences from a training corpus.",
        "The second approach learns document plans based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thomson, 1988); it therefore has a solid linguistic foundation, but is resource intensive as it assumes access to a text-level discourse parser.",
        "We learn document plans automatically using both representations and develop a tractable decoding algorithm for finding the best output, i.e., derivation in our grammar.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven model to incorporate document planning in a joint end-to-end system.",

        "The heuristics performed mostly anchor matching between database records and words in the text (e.g., the value Lkly of the field rainChance, matches with the string rain likely in the text).",
        "Using these alignments, GRSE obtained a BLEU score of 39.23 on WEATHERGOV and 41.35 on WINHELP.",
        "These results indicate that improved alignments would lead to more accurate grammar rules.",
        "WEATHERGOV seems more sensitive to the alignments than WINHELP.",
        "This is probably because the dataset shows more structural variations in the choice of record types at the document level, and therefore the grammar extracted from the unsupervised alignments is noisier.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed an end-to-end system that generates text from database input and captures all components of the traditional generation pipeline, including document planning.",

        "We proposed two complementary approaches to inducing content planners.",
        "In a first linguistically naive approach, a document is modelled as a sequence of sentences and each sentence as a sequence of records.",
        "Our second approach draws inspiration from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson, 1988) and represents a document as a tree with intermediate nodes corresponding to discourse relations, and leaf nodes to database records.",
        "Experiments with both approaches demonstrate improvements over models that do not incorporate document planning.",
