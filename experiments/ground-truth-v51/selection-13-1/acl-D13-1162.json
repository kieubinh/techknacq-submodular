        "Our research focuses on the problem of classifying message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.",
        "Most of the posts in our corpus discuss a case involving a specific patient, which we will call patient-specific posts.",
        "But there are also posts that ask a general question, for example to seek advice about different medications, information about new procedures, or how to perform a test.",
        "Our goal is to distinguish the patient-specific posts from general posts so that they can be automatically routed to different message board folders.",
        "Distinguishing patient-specific posts from general posts is a challenging problem for two reasons.",
        "First, virtually any medical topic can appear in either type of post, so the vocabulary is very similar.",
        "Second, a highly skewed distribution exists between patient-specific posts and general posts.",
        "Almost 90% of the posts in our data are about specific patients.",
        "With such a highly skewed distribution, it would seem logical to focus on recognizing instances of the minority class.",
        "But the distinguishing characteristic of a general post is the absence of a patient.",
        "Two nearly identical posts belong in different categories if one mentions a patient and the other does not.",
        "Consequently, our aim is to create features that identify references to a specific patient and use these to more accurately distinguish the two types of posts.",
        "Our research explores the use of information extraction (IE) techniques to automatically identify common attributes of veterinary patients, which we use to encode patient information in a text classifier.",
        "Our approach involves three phases.",
        "First, we train a conditional random fields (CRF) tagger to identify seven common types of attributes that are often ascribed to veterinary patients: SPECIES/BREED, NAME, AGE, GENDER, WEIGHT, POSSESSOR, and DISEASE/SYMPTOM.",
        "Second, we apply the CRF tagger to a large set of unannotated message board posts, collect its extractions, and harvest the most frequently extracted terms to create a Veterinary Patient Attribute (VPA) Lexicon.",
        "Finally, we define three types of features that exploit the harvested VPA lexicon.",
        "These features represent the patient attribute terms, types, and combinations of them to help the classifier determine whether a post is discussing a specific patient.",
        "We conduct experiments which show that the extracted patient attribute information improves text classification performance on this task."

        "Our work demonstrates the use of information extraction techniques to benefit a text classification application.",
        "There has been a great deal of research on text classification (e.g., (Borko and Bernick, 1963; Hoyle, 1973; Joachims, 1998; Nigam et al., 2000; Sebastiani, 2002)), which most commonly has used bag-of-word features.",
        "Researchers have also investigated clustering (Baker and McCallum, 1998), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Zelikovitz and Hirsh, 2001), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Br et al., 2008) and string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2001).",
        "Information extraction techniques have been used previously to create richer features for event-based text classification (Riloff and Lehnert, 1994) and web page classification (Furnkranz et al., 1998).",
        "Semantic information has also been incorporated for text classification.",
        "However, most previous work relies on existing semantic resources, such as Wordnet (Scott and Stan, 1998; Bloehdorn and Hotho, 2006) or Wikipedia (Wang et al., 2009).",
        "There is also a rich history of automatic lexicon induction from text corpora (e.g., (Roark and Char-niak, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; McIntosh and Curran, 2009)), Wikipedia (e.g., (Vyas and Pantel, 2009)), and the Web (e.g., (Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2010)).",
        "The novel aspects of our work are in using an IE tagger to harvest a domain-specific lexicon from unannotated texts, and using the induced lexicon to encode domain-specific features for text classification."
