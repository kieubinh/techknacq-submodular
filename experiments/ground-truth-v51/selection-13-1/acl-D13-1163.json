        "Given a source document, traditionally most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems translate the document sentence by sentence.",
        "In such a translation scheme, sentences are translated independent of any other sentences.",
        "However, a text is normally written cohesively, in which sentences are connected ?Corresponding author to each other via syntactic and lexical devices.",
        "This linguistic phenomenon is called as textual cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "Cohesion is a surface-level property of well-formed texts.",
        "It deals with five categories of relationships between text units, namely co-reference, ellipsis, substitution, conjunction and lexical cohesion that is realized via semantically related words.",
        "The former four cohesion relations can be grouped as grammatical cohesion.",
        "Generally speaking, grammatical cohesion is less common and harder to identify than lexical cohesion (Barzilay and El-hadad, 1997).",
        "As most SMT systems translate a text in a sentence-by-sentence fashion, they tend to build less lexical cohesion than human translators (Wong and Kit, 2012).",
        "We therefore study lexical cohesion for document-level translation.",
        "We use lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991) to capture lexical cohesion in a text.",
        "Lexical chains are connected graphs that represent the lexical cohesion structure of a text.",
        "They have been successfully used for information retrieval (Stairmand, 1996), document summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) and so on.",
        "In this paper, we investigate how lexical chains can be used to incorporate lexical cohesion into document-level translation.",
        "Our basic assumption is that the lexical chains of a target document are direct correspondences of the lexical chains of its counterpart source document.",
        "This assumption is reasonable as the target document translation should be faithful to the source document in terms of both text meaning and structure.",
        "Based on this assumption, we propose a framework",
        "to incorporate lexical cohesion into target document translation via lexical chains, which works as follows.",
        "?",
        "Compute lexical chains for each source document that is to be translated; ?",
        "Project the computed source lexical chains onto the corresponding target document by translating source chain words into target chain words using maximum entropy classifiers; ?",
        "Incorporate lexical cohesion into the target document translation via cohesion models built on the projected target lexical chains .",
        "We build two lexical chain based cohesion models.",
        "The first model is a count model that rewards a hypothesis whenever a word in the projected target lexical chains occur in the hypothesis.",
        "As a source chain word may be translated into many different target words, we further extend the count model to a second cohesion model: a probability model that takes chain word translation probabilities into account.",
        "We test the two lexical chain based cohesion models on a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system that is trained with large-scale Chinese-English bilingual data.",
        "Experiment results show that our lexical chain based cohesion models can achieve substantial improvements over the baseline.",
        "Furthermore, the probability cohesion model is better than the count model and it also outperforms previous cohesion models based on lexical cohesion devices (Xiong et al., 2013).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore lexical chains for statistical machine translation.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work and highlights the differences between our method and previous work.",
        "Section 3 briefly introduces lexical chains and algorithms that compute lexical chains.",

        "The latter two models measure the strength of lexical cohesion relation between two lexical items.",
        "They are incorporated into SMT to calculate how appropriately lexical cohesion devices are used in document translation.",

(2013)."
