        "Translation into morphologically rich languages is a widely studied problem and there is a tremendous amount of related work.",
        "Our technique of synthesizing translation options to improve generation of inflected forms is closely related to the factored translation approach proposed by Koehn and Hoang (2007); however, an important difference to that work is that we use a discriminative model that conditions on source context to make ?local?",
        "decisions about what inflections may be used before combining the phrases into a complete sentence translation.",
        "Combination pre-/post-processing solutions are also frequently proposed.",
        "In these, the target language is generally transformed from multi-morphemic surface words into smaller units more amenable to direct translation, and then a post-processing step is applied independent of the translation model.",
        "For example, Oflazer and El-Kahlout (2007) experiment with partial morpheme groupings to produce novel inflected forms when translating into Turkish; Al-Haj and Lavie (2010) compare different processing schemes for Arabic.",
        "A related but different approach is to enrich the source language items with grammatical features (e.g., a source sentence like John saw Mary is preprocessed into, e.g., John+subj saw+msubj+fobj Mary+obj) so as to make the source and target lexicons have similar morphological contrasts (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Yeniterzi and Oflazer, 2010; Chang et al.,",
        "2009).",
        "In general, this work suffers from the problem that it is extremely difficult to know a priori what the right preprocessing is for a given language pair, data size, and domain.",
        "Several post-processing approaches have relied on supervised classifiers to predict the optimal complete inflection for an incomplete or lemmatized translation.",
        "Minkov et al. (2007) present a method for predicting the inflection of Russian and Arabic sentences aligned to English sentences.",
        "They train a sequence model to predict target morphological features from the lemmas and the syntactic structures of both aligned sentences and demonstrate its ability to recover accurately inflections on reference translations.",
        "Toutanova et al. (2008) apply this method to generate inflections after translation in two different ways: by rescoring inflected n-best outputs or by translating lemmas and re-inflecting them a posteriori.",
        "El Kholy and Habash (2012) follow a similar method and compare different approaches for generating rich morphology in Arabic after a translation step.",
        "Fraser et al. (2012) observe improvements for translation into German with a similar method.",
        "As in that work, we model morphological features rather than directly inflected forms.",
        "However, that work may be criticized for providing no mechanism to translate surface forms directly, even when evidence for a direct translation is available in the parallel data.",
        "Unsupervised morphology has begun to play a role in translation between morphologically complex languages.",
        "Stallard et al. (2012) show that an unsupervised approach to Arabic segmentation performs as well as a supervised segmenter for source-side preprocessing (in terms of English translation quality).",
        "For translation into morphological rich languages, Clifton and Sarkar (2011) use an unsupervised morphological analyzer to produce morphological affixes in Finnish, injecting some linguistic knowledge in the generation process.",
        "Several authors have proposed using conditional models to predict the probability of phrase translation in context (Gimpel and Smith, 2008; Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Jeong et al., 2010).",
        "Of particular note is the work of Subotin (2011), who use a conditional model to predict morphological features conditioned on rich linguistic features; however, this latter work also conditions on target context, which substantially complicates decoding.",
        "Finally, synthetic phrases have been used for different purposes than generating morphology.",
        "Callison-Burch et al. (2006) expanded the coverage of a phrase table by adding synthesized phrases by paraphrasing source language phrases, Chen et al. (2011) produced ?fabricated?",
        "phrases by paraphrasing both source and target phrases, and Habash (2009) created new rules to handle out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "In related work, Tsvetkov et al. (2013) used synthetic phrases to improve generation of (in)definite articles when translating into English from Russian and Czech, two languages which do not lexically mark definiteness."

      "heading": "8 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have presented an efficient technique that exploits morphologically analyzed corpora to produce new inflections possibly unseen in the bilingual training data.",
        "Our method decomposes into two simple independent steps involving well-understood discriminative models.",
        "By relying on source-side context to generate additional local translation options and by leaving the choice of the full sentence translation to the decoder, we sidestep the difficulty of computing features on target translations hypotheses.",
        "However, many morphological processes (most notably, agreement) are most best modeled using target language context.",
        "To capture target context effects, we depend on strong target language models.",
        "Therefore, an important extension of our work is to explore the interaction of our approach with more sophisticated language models that more directly model morphology, e.g., the models of Bilmes and Kirchhoff (2003), or, alternatively, ways to incorporate target language context in the inflection model.",
        "We also achieve language independence by exploiting unsupervised morphological segmentations in the absence of linguistically informed morphological analyses.",
        "Code for replicating the experiments is available from https://github.com/eschling/morphogen; further details are available in (Schlinger et al., 2013)."
