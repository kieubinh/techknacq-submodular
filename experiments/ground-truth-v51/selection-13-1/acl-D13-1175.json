        "The central problem addressed in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is that of translating or projecting a query into the language of the document repository across which retrieval is performed.",
        "There are two main approaches to tackle this problem: The first approach leverages the standard Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) machinery to produce a single best translation that is used as search query in the target language.",
        "We will henceforth call this the direct translation approach.",
        "This technique is particularly useful if large amounts of data are available in domain-specific form.",
        "Alternative approaches avoid to solve the hard problem of word reordering, and instead rely on token-to-token translations that are used to project the query terms into the target language with a probabilistic weighting of the standard term tf-idf scheme.",
        "Darwish and Oard (2003) termed this method the probabilistic structured query approach.",
        "The advantage of this technique is an implicit query expansion effect due to the use of probability distributions over term translations (Xu et al., 2001).",
        "Recent research has shown that leveraging query context by extracting term translation probabilities from n-best direct translations of queries instead of using context-free translation tables outperforms both direct translation and context-free projection (Ture et al., 2012b; Ture et al., 2012a).",
        "While direct translation as well as probabilistic structured query approaches use machine learning to optimize the SMT module, retrieval is done by standard search algorithms in both approaches.",
        "For example, Google's CLIR approach uses their standard proprietary search engine (Chin et al., 2008).",
        "Ture et al.",
        "(2012b; 2012a) use standard retrieval algorithms such as BM25 (Robertson et al., 1998).",
        "That means, machine learning in SMT-based approaches concentrates on the cross-language aspect of CLIR and is agnostic of the ultimate ranking task.",
        "In this paper, we present a method to project search queries into the target language that is complementary to SMT-based CLIR approaches.",
        "Our method learns a table of n-gram correspondences by direct optimization of a ranking objective on relevance rankings of English documents for Japanese queries.",
        "Our model is similar to the approach of Bai et al. (2010) who characterize their technique as ?Learning to rank with (a Lot of) Word Features?.",
        "Given a set of search queries q ?",
        "IRQ and docu",
        "ments d ?",
        "IRD, where the jth dimension of a vector indicates the occurrence of the jth word for dictionaries of size Q and D, we want to learn a score f(q,d) between a query and a given document using the model1",
        "We take a pairwise ranking approach to optimization.",
        "That is, given labeled data in the form of a set R of tuples (q,d+,d?",
        "), where d+ is a relevant (or higher ranked) document and d?",

        "for all data tuples from R. The scoring model learns weights for all possible correspondences of query terms and document terms by directly optimizing the ranking objective at hand.",
        "Such a phrase table contains domain-specific word associations that are useful to discern relevant from irrelevant documents, something that is orthogonal and complementary to standard SMT models.",
        "The challenge of our approach can be explained by constructing a joint feature map ?",
        "from the outer product of the vectors q and d where",
        "Using this feature map, we see that the score function f can be written in the standard form of a linear model that computes the inner product between a weight vector w and a feature vector ?",
        "where",

        "A full-sized model includes Q ?",
        "D parameters which is easily in the billions even for moderately sized dictionaries.",
        "Clearly, an efficient implementation and remedies against overfitting are essential.",

        "and indices (e.g., qi).",
        "table by direct rank optimization feasible, and an experimental verification of the benefits of this approach, especially with regard to a combination of the orthogonal information sources of ranking-based and SMT-based CLIR approaches.",
        "Our approach builds upon a boosting framework for pairwise ranking (Freund et al., 2003) that allows the model to grow incrementally, thus avoiding having to deal with the full matrix W .",
        "Furthermore, we present an implementation of boosting that utilizes parallel estimation on bootstrap samples from the training set for increased efficiency and reduced error (Breiman, 1996).",
        "Our ?bagged boosting?",
        "approach allows to combine incremental feature selection, parallel training, and efficient management of large data structures.",
        "We show in an experimental evaluation on large-scale retrieval on patent abstracts that our boosting approach is comparable in MAP and improves significantly by 13-15 PRES points over very competitive translation-based CLIR systems that are trained on 1.8 million parallel sentence pairs from Japanese-English patent documents.",
        "Moreover, a combination of the orthogonal information learned in ranking-based and translation-based approaches improves over 7 MAP points and over 15 PRES points over the respective translation-based system in a consensus-based voting approach following the Borda Count technique (Aslam and Montague, 2001)."

        "These approaches tackle the problem of complexity and capacity of the cross product matrix of word correspondences from different directions.",

        "Overall, we obtained the best results by a model combination using consensus-based voting where the best SMT-based approach was combined with the boosting phrase table (gaining more than 7 MAP or 15 PRES points).",

        "While this technique is useful to develop patent retrieval systems, it would be interesting to see if our results transfer to patent retrieval scenarios where full patent documents are used instead of only abstracts, or to standard CLIR scenarios that use short search queries in retrieval."
