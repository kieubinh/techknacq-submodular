        "Predicting the success of novels is a curious question among publishers, professional book reviewers, aspiring and even expert writers alike.",
        "There are potentially many influencing factors, some of which concern the intrinsic content and quality of the book, such as interestingness, novelty, style of writing, and engaging storyline, but external factors such as social context and even luck can play a role.",
        "As a result, recognizing successful literary work is a hard task even for experts working in the publication industries.",
        "Indeed, even some of the best sellers and award winners can go through several rejections before they are picked up by a publisher.1 Perhaps due to its obvious complexity of the problem, there has been little previous work that attempts to build statistical models that predict the success of literary works based on their intrinsic content and quality.",
        "Some previous studies do touch on the notion of stylistic aspects in successful literature, e.g., extensive studies in Literature discuss literary styles of significant authors (e.g., Ellega?rd (1962), Mc-Gann (1998)), while others consider content characteristics such as plots, characteristics of characters, action, emotion, genre, cast, of the best-selling novels and blockbuster movies (e.g., Harvey (1953), Hall (2012), Yun (2011)).",
        "All these studies however, are qualitative in nature, as they rely on the knowledge and insights of human experts on literature.",
        "To our knowledge, no prior work has undertaken a systematic quantitative investigation on the overarching characterization of the writing style in successful literature.",
        "In consideration of widely different styles of authorship (e.g., Escalante et al. (2011), Peng et al. (2003), Argamon et al. (2003)), it is not even readily clear whether there might be common stylistic elements that help discriminating highly successful ones from less successful counterpart.",
        "In this work, we present the first study that investigates this unstudied and unexpected connection between stylistic elements and the literary success.",
        "The key findings of our research reveal that there exists distinct linguistic patterns shared among suc-1E.g., Paul Harding's ?Tinkers?",
        "that won 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and J. K. Rowling's ?Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone?",

        "cessful literature, at least within the same genre, making it possible to build a model with surprisingly high accuracy (up to 84%) in predicting the success of a novel.",
        "This result is surprising for two reasons.",
        "First, we tackle the hard task of predicting the success of novels written by previously unseen authors, avoiding incidental learning of authorship signature, since previous research demonstrated that one can achieve very high accuracy in authorship attribution (as high as 96% in some experimental setup) (e.g., Raghavan et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2012)).",
        "Second, we aim to discriminate highly successful novels from less successful, but nonetheless published books written by professional writers, which are undoubtedly of higher quality than average writings.",
        "It is important to note that the task we tackle here is much harder than discriminating highly successful works from those that have not even passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers.",
        "In order to quantify the success of literary works, and to obtain corresponding gold standard labels, one needs to first define ?success?.",
        "For practical convenience, we largely rely on the download counts available at Project Gutenberg as a surrogate to quantify the success of novels.",
        "For a small number of novels however, we also consider award recipients (e.g., Pulitzer, Nobel), and Amazon's sales records to define a novel's success.",
        "We also extend our empirical study to movie scripts, where we quantify the success of movies based on the average review scores at imdb.com.",
        "We leave analysis based on other measures of literary success as future research.",
        "In this study, we do not attempt to separate out success based on literary quality (award winners) from success based on popularity (commercial hit, often in spite of bad literary quality), mainly because it is not practically easy to determine whether the high download counts are due to only one reason or the other.",
        "We expect that in many cases, the two different aspects of success are likely to coincide, however.",
        "In the case of the corpus obtained from Project Gutenberg, where most of our experiments are conducted, we expect that the download counts are more indicative of success based on the literary quality (which then may have resulted in popularity) rather than popularity without quality.",

        "Predicting success of novels and movies: To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that provides quantitative insights into the unstudied connection between the writing style and the success of literary works.",
        "There have been some previous work that aims to gain insights into the secret recipe of successful books, but most were qualitative, based only on a dozen of books, focusing mainly on the high-level content of the books, such as the personalities of protagonists, antagonists, the nature of plots (e.g., Harvey (1953), Yun (2011)).",
        "In contrast, our work examines a considerably larger collection of books (800 in total) over eight different sub-genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterize the writing styles commonly shared among the successful literature.",
        "Another relevant work has been on a different domain of movies (Yun, 2011), however, the prediction is based only on external, non-textual information such as the reputation of actors and directors, and the power of distribution systems etc, without analyzing the actual content of the movie scripts.",
        "Text quality and readability: Louis (2012) explored various features that measure the quality of text, which has some high-level connections to our work.",
        "Combining the insights from Louis (2012) with our results, we find that the characteristics of text quality explored in Louis (2012), readability of text in particular, do not correspond to the prominent writing style of highly successful literature.",
        "There have been a number of other work that focused on predicting and measuring readability (e.g., Kate et al.",
        "(2010), Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005), Heilman and Eskenazi (2006) and Collins-Thompson et al. (2004)) employing various linguistic features.",
        "There is an important difference however, in regard to the nature of the selected text for analysis: most studies in readability focus on differentiating good writings from noticeably bad writings, often involving machine generated text or those written by ESL students.",
        "In contrast, our work essentially deals with differentiating good writings from even better writings.",
        "After all, all the books that we an-alyzed are written by expert writers who passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers, hence it is reasonable to expect that the writing quality of even less successful books is respectful.",
        "Predicting success among academic papers: In the domain of academic papers, which belongs to the broad genre of non-fiction, the work of Sawyer et al. (2008) investigated the stylistic characteristics of award winning papers in marketing journals, and found that the readability plays an important role.",
        "Combined with our study which focuses on fiction and creative writing, it suggests that the recipe for successful publications can be very different depending on whether it belongs to fiction or nonfiction.",
        "The work of Bergsma et al. (2012) is also somewhat relevant to ours in that their work included differentiating the writing styles of workshop papers from major conference papers, where the latter would be generally considered to be more successful."

      "heading": "9 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We presented the first quantitative study that learns to predict the success of literary works based on their writing styles.",
        "Our empirical results demonstrated that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating successful literature, achieving accuracy up to 84% in the novel domain and 89% in the movie domain.",
        "Furthermore, our study resulted in several insights including: lexical and syntactic elements of successful styles, the connection between successful writing style and readability, the connection between sentiment / connotation and the literary success, and last but not least, comparative insights between successful writing styles of fiction and nonfiction.",
