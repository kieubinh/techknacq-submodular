        "There is a relatively long history of research into modeling conversational speech acts in computational linguistics.",
        "Perrault and Allen (1980) conducted pioneering work on computationally formalizing speech acts, though their work pre-dates statistical NLP and is therefore not directly relevant to the present work.",
        "Stolcke et al. (2000; 1998) proposed a probabilistic approach to modeling conversational speech acts based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner and Juang, 1986).",
        "They were interested in modeling an unrestricted set of conversations, and did not impose a hierarchy on the speech acts; they",
        "therefore enumerated many more speech acts (42) than we do in the present work (recall that we use 10 ?high-level?",
        "speech acts).5 Their model has served as the baseline approach in the present work.",
        "Stolcke et al. also considered jointly performing speech recognition and speech act classification.",
        "Others have investigated visual structures of patient-provider interactions to qualitatively assess communication in care.",
        "Specifically, (Cretchley et al., 2010) leveraged concept maps to explore conversations between people with schizophrenia and their carers.",
        "Briefly, this approach allowed them to (qualitatively) identify two distinct conversational strategies used by caretakers and their patients.",
        "Angus et al.",
        "(Angus et al., 2012) presented a similar approach in which they used text visualization software to explore patterns of (inferred) topics in consultations.",
        "Another thread of research has investigated classifying speech acts in emails into one of a small set of ?email speech acts?, e.g., request, propose, commit (Cohen et al., 2004; Goldstein et al., 2006).",
        "Cohen et al.",
        "(2004) demonstrated that good performance can be achieved for this task via existing text classification technologies.",
        "Elsewhere, researchers have explored automatically inferring ?speech acts?",
        "in various other online social mediums, including message board posts (Qadir and Riloff, 2011), Wikipedia talk pages (Ferschke et al., 2012) and Twitter (Zhang et al., 2012).",
        "A separate line of inquiry concerns classifying dialogue acts in chat.",
        "Researchers have attempted dialogue act classification both for 1-on-1 (Kim et al., 2010) and multi-party (Kim et al., 2012; Clark and Popescu-Belis, 2004) online chats.",
        "Ang et al. (2005) considered the task of jointly segmenting and classifying utterances comprising multiparty meetings, while Hsueh and Moore (2006) proposed analogous methods for topic segmentation and labeling (other works on topic segmentation include (Galley et al., 2003) and (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)).",
        "Incorporating such segmentation methods into the proposed model (rather than relying on inputs to be manually segmented beforehand) would be a natural extension of this work.",
        "Additive component models of text have recently 5We note that only 8 of the 42 speech acts appeared with greater than 1% frequency in Stolcke et al's corpus.",
        "gained traction (Eisenstein et al., 2011; Paul, 2012; Paul and Dredze, 2012; Paul et al., 2013).",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first extension of supervised additive component models to a sequential task.6"

        "We have proposed a novel Joint, Additive, Sequential (JAS) model of conversational topics and speech acts.",
        "In contrast to previous approaches to modeling conversational exchanges, this model factors both the current topic and the current speech act into token emission and state transition probabilities.",
        "We demonstrated that this model consistently outperforms a univariate generative baseline that treats speech acts and topics independently.",
        "Furthermore, we showed JAS can automatically reproduce the analysis of a randomized control trial designed to assess the efficacy of an intervention to alter physician communication habits with high-fidelity.",
        "The generative component-based framework we have introduced in this work provides a means of exploring factors in patient-physician communication.",
        "One limitation of the model we have presented is that it makes several simplifying assumptions around dialogue.",
        "For example, we have ignored non-linearities and ?back-channels?",
        "in conversation, and we have ignored differences across physicians with respect to communication styles.",
        "Going forward, we hope to address these limitations.",
        "We also plan on extending this model to investigate qualitative questions surrounding patient-physician communication quantitatively.",
        "For example, we are interested in investigating how communication varies across hospitals and physicians.",
        "To explore this, we can add additional components to the transition probability terms corresponding to different hospitals and doctors.",
        "Ultimately, we would like to correlate patterns in physician communication (as gleaned from the model) with objective, measured health outcomes (e.g., patient satisfaction and adherence to ARVs).",
