        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a task that has attracted much work in computational linguistics (see Agirre and Edmonds [2007] and Navigli [2009] for an overview), including a series of workshops, SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004) and SemEval (Agirre, Ma`rquez, and Wicentowski 2007; Erk and Strapparava 2010), which were originally organized expressly as a forum for shared tasks in WSD.",
        "In WSD, polysemy is typically modeled through a dictionary, where the senses of a word are understood to be mutually disjoint.",
        "The meaning of an occurrence of a word is then characterized through the best-fitting among its dictionary senses.",
        "The assumption of senses that are mutually disjoint and that have clear boundaries has been drawn into doubt by lexicographers (Kilgarriff 1997; Hanks 2000), linguists (Tuggy 1993; Cruse 1995), and psychologists (Kintsch 2007).",
        "Hanks (2000) argues that word senses have uses where they clearly fit, and borderline uses where only a few of a sense's identifying features apply.",
        "This notion matches results in psychology on human concept representation: Mental categories show ?fuzzy boundaries,?",
        "and category members differ in typicality and degree of membership (Rosch 1975; Rosch and Mervis 1975; Hampton 2007).",
        "This raises the question of annotation: Is it possible to collect word meaning annotation that captures degrees to which a sense applies?",
        "Recently, there have been several proposals for modeling word meaning in context that can represent different degrees of similarity to a word sense, as well as different degrees of similarity between occurrences of a word.",
        "The SemEval Lexical Substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli 2009) represents each occurrence through multiple weighted paraphrases.",
        "Other approaches represent meaning in context through a vector space model (Erk and Padó 2008; Mitchell and Lapata 2008; Thater, Fu?rstenau, and Pinkal 2010) or through a distribution over latent senses (Dinu and Lapata 2010).",
        "Again, this raises the question of annotation: Can human annotators give fine-grained judgments about degrees of similarity between word occurrences, like these computational models predict?",
        "The question that we explore in this paper is: Can word meaning be described through annotation in the form of graded judgments?",
        "We want to know whether annotators can provide graded meaning annotation in a consistent fashion.",
        "Also, we want to know whether annotators will use the whole graded scale, or whether they will fall back on binary ratings of either ?identical?",
        "or ?different.?",
        "Our question, however, is not whether annotators can be trained to do this.",
        "Rather, our aim is to describe word meaning as language users perceive it.",
        "We want to tap into the annotators?",
        "intuitive notions of word meaning.",
        "As a consequence, we use untrained annotators.",
        "We view it as an important aim on its own to capture language users?",
        "intuitions on word meaning, but it is also instrumental in answering our first question, of whether word meaning can be described through graded annotator judgments: Training annotators in depth on how to distinguish predefined hand-crafted senses could influence them to assign those senses in a binary fashion.",
        "We introduce two novel annotation tasks in which human annotators characterize word meaning in context.",
        "In the first task, they rate the applicability of dictionary senses on a graded scale.",
        "In the second task, they rate the similarity between pairs of usages of the same word, also on a graded scale.",
        "In designing the annotation tasks, we utilize techniques from psycholinguistic experimentation: Annotators give ratings on a",
        "Erk, McCarthy, and Gaylord Measuring Word Meaning in Context scale, rather than selecting a single label; we also use multiple annotators for each item, retaining all annotator judgments.",
        "The result of this graded annotation can then be used to evaluate computational models of word meaning: either to evaluate graded models of word meaning, or to evaluate traditional WSD systems in a graded fashion.",
        "They can also be used to analyze existing word sense inventories, in particular to identify sense distinctions worth revisiting?we say more on this latter use subsequently.",
        "Our aim is not to improve inter-annotator agreement over traditional sense annotation.",
        "It is highly unlikely that ratings on a scale would ever achieve higher exact agreement than binary annotation.",
        "Our aim is also not to maximize exact agreement, as we expect to see individual differences in perceived meaning, and want to capture those differences.",
        "Still it is desirable to have an end product of the annotation that is robust against such individual differences.",
        "In order to achieve this, we average judgments over multiple annotators after first inspecting pairwise correlations between annotators to ensure that they are all doing their work diligently and with similar outcomes.",
        "Analyzing the annotation results, we find that the annotators make use of intermediate points on the graded scale and do not treat the task as inherently binary.",
        "We find that there is good inter-annotator agreement, measured as correlation.",
        "There is also a highly significant correlation across tasks and with traditional WSD and lexical substitution tasks.",
        "This indicates that the annotators performed these tasks in a consistent fashion.",
        "It also indicates that diverse ways of representing word meaning in context?single best sense, weighted senses, multiple paraphrases, usage similarity?",
        "yield similar characterizations.",
        "We find that annotators frequently give high scores to more than one sense, in a way that is not remedied by a more coarse-grained sense inventory.",

        "Each item is rated by eight annotators in parallel.",
        "This setting, with four different types of word meaning annotation on the same data, allows us to compare annotation results across tasks more directly than before.2 2.",
        "We test whether the similarity ratings on pairs of usages obey the triangle inequality, and find that they do.",

        "Inter-annotator agreement (also called inter-tagger agreement, or ITA) is one indicator of the difficulty of the task of manually assigning word senses (Krishnamurthy and Nicholls 2000).",
        "With WordNet, the sense inventory currently most widely used in word sense annotation, ITA ranges from 67% to 78% (Landes, Leacock, and Tengi 1998; Mihalcea, Chklovski, and Kilgarriff 2004; Snyder and Palmer 2004), depending on factors such as degree of polysemy and interrelatedness of the senses.",
        "This issue is not specific to WordNet.",
        "Annotation efforts based on other dictionaries have achieved similar ITA levels, as shown in Table 1.",
        "The first group in that table shows two corpora in which all open-class words are annotated for word sense, in both cases using WordNet.",
        "The second group consists of two English lexical sample corpora, in which only some target words are annotated.",
        "One of them uses WordSmyth senses for verbs and WordNet for all other parts of speech, and the other uses HECTOR, with similar ITA, so the choice of dictionary does not seem to make much difference in this case.3 Next is SALSA, a German corpus using FrameNet frames as senses, then OntoNotes, again an English lexical sample corpus.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement is listed in the last column of the table; agreement is in general relatively low for the first four corpora, which use fine-grained sense distinctions, and higher for SALSA and OntoNotes, which have more coarse-grained senses.",
        "Sense granularity has a clear impact upon levels of inter-annotator agreement (Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007).",
        "ITA is substantially improved by using coarser-grained senses, as seen in OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006), which uses an ITA of 90% as the criterion for constructing coarse-grained sense distinctions.",
        "Although this strategy does improve ITA, it does not eliminate the issues seen with more fine-grained annotation efforts: For some lemmas, such as leave, 90% ITA is not reached even after multiple re-partitionings of the semantic space (Chen and Palmer 2009).",
        "This suggests that the meanings of at least some words may not be separable into senses distinct enough for consistent annotation.4 Moreover, sense granularity does not appear to be the only question influencing ITA differences between lemmas.",
        "Passonneau et al. (2010) found three main factors: sense concreteness, specificity of the context in which the target word occurs, and similarity between senses.",
        "It is worth noting that of these factors, only the third can be directly addressed by a change in the dictionary.",
        "3 HECTOR senses are described in richer detail than WordNet senses and the resource is strongly corpus-based.",
        "We use WordNet in our work due to its high popularity and free availability.",
        "4 Examples such as this indicate that there is at times a problem with clearly defining consistently separable senses of a word.",
        "There is no clear measure of exactly how frequent such cases are, however.",
        "This is due in part to the fact that this question depends so heavily on the data being considered and the distinctions being posited.",
        "systems trained on the annotated data.",
        "Table 2 shows results for the best systems that participated at four English lexical sample tasks.",
        "With fine-grained sense inventories, the top-ranking WSD systems participating in the event achieved precision scores of 73% to 77% (Edmonds and Cotton 2001; Mihalcea, Chklovski, and Kilgarriff 2004).",
        "Current state-of-the-art systems have made modest improvements on this; for example, the system described by Zhong and Ng (2010) achieves 65.3% on the English lexical sample at SENSEVAL-2, though the same system obtains 72.6%, just below Mihalcea, Chklovski, and Kilgarriff (2004), on the English lexical sample at SENSEVAL-3.",
        "Nevertheless, the picture remains the same with systems getting around three out of four word occurrences correct.",
        "Under a coarse-grained approach, system performance improves considerably (Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007; Pradhan et al. 2007), with the best participating system achieving a precision close to 90%.5 The merits of a coarser-grained approach are still a matter of debate (Stokoe 2005; Ide and Wilks 2006; Navigli, Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007; Brown 2010), however.",
        "Although identifying the proper level of granularity for sense repositories has important implications for improving WSD, we do not focus on this question here.",
        "Rather, we propose novel annotation tasks that allow us to probe the relatedness between dictionary senses in a flexible fashion, and to explore word meaning in context without presupposing hard boundaries between usages.",
        "The resulting data sets can be used to compare different inventories, coarse or otherwise.",
        "In addition, we hope that they will prove useful for the evaluation of alternative representations of ambiguity in word 5 Zhong, Ng, and Chan (2008) report similar results (89.1%) with their state-of-the-art system when evaluating on the OntoNotes corpus, which is larger than the SENSEVAL data sets.",

        "One possible factor contributing to the difficulty of manual and automatic word sense assignment is the design of word sense inventories themselves.",
        "As we have seen, such difficulties are encountered across dictionaries, and it has been argued that there are problems with the characterization of word meanings as sets of discrete and mutually exclusive senses (Tuggy 1993; Cruse 1995; Kilgarriff 1997; Hanks 2000; Kintsch 2007).",
        "and the nature of the finished product depends upon the needs of the target audience, as well as budgetary and related constraints (cf. Hanks 2000).",
        "Consequently, dictionaries differ in the words that they cover, and also in the word meanings that they distinguish.",
        "Dictionary senses are generalizations over the meanings that a word can take, and these generalizations themselves are abstractions over collected occurrences of the word in different contexts (Kilgarriff 1992, 1997, 2006).",
        "Regardless of a dictionary's granularity, the possibility exists for some amount of detail to be lost as a result of this process.",
        "Kilgarriff (1997) calls into question the possibility of general, all-purpose senses of a word and argues that sense distinction only makes sense with respect to a given task.",
        "For example, in machine translation, the senses to be distinguished should be those that lead to different translations in the target language.",
        "It has since been demonstrated that this is in fact the case (Carpuat and Wu 2007a, 2007b).",
        "Hanks (2000) questions the view of senses as disjoint classes defined by necessary and sufficient conditions.",
        "He shows that even with a classic homonym like ?bank,?",
        "some occurrences are more typical examples of a particular sense than others.",
        "This notion of typicality is also important in theories of concept representation in psychology (Murphy 2002).",
        "Theoretical treatments of word meaning such as the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1991) also draw attention to the subtle, yet reliable, fluctuations of meaning-in-context, and work in this paradigm also provides evidence that two senses which may appear to be quite distinct can in fact be quite difficult to distinguish in certain contexts (Copestake and Briscoe 1995, page 53).",
        "mental category are equal.",
        "Some are perceived as more typical than others (Rosch 1975; Rosch and Mervis 1975; and many others), and even category membership itself is clearer in some cases than in others (Hampton 1979).",
        "These results are about mental concepts, however, rather than word meanings per se, which raises the question of the relation between word meanings and conceptual knowledge.",
        "Murphy (1991, 2002) argues that although not every concept is associated with a word, word meanings show many of the same phenomena as concepts in general?word meaning is ?made up of pieces of conceptual structure?",
        "(Murphy 2002, page 391).",
        "A body of work in cognitive linguistics also discusses the relation between word meaning and conceptual structure (Coleman and Kay 1981; Taylor 2003).",
        "Psycholinguistic studies on word meaning offer insight into the question of the mental representation of word senses.",
        "Unlike homonym meanings, the senses of a polysemous word are thought to be related, suggesting that the mental representations of these senses may overlap as well.",
        "The psycholinguistic literature on this question",
        "Erk, McCarthy, and Gaylord Measuring Word Meaning in Context is not wholly clear-cut, but by and large does support the position that polysemous senses are not entirely discrete in the mental lexicon.",
        "Whereas Klein and Murphy (2001, 2002) do provide evidence for discreteness of mental sense representations, it appears as though these findings may be due in part to the particular senses included in their studies (Klepousniotou, Titone, and Romero 2008).",
        "Moreover, many psycholinguistic studies have indeed found evidence for processing differences between homonyms and polysemous words, using a variety of experimental designs, including eye movements and reading times (Frazier and Rayner 1990; Pickering and Frisson 2001) as well as response times in sensicality and lexical decision tasks (Williams 1992; Klepousniotou 2002).",
        "Brown (2008, 2010) takes the question of shared vs. separate meaning representations one step further in a semantic priming study6 in which she shows that intuitive meaning-in-context similarity judgments have a processing correlate in on-line sentence comprehension.",
        "Response time to the target is a negative linear function of its similarity in meaning to the prime, and response accuracy is a positive linear function of this similarity.",
        "In other words, the more similar in meaning a prime?target pair was judged to be, the faster and more accurately subjects responded.",
        "This provides empirical support for a processing correlate of graded similarity-in-meaning judgments.",
        "In our work reported here, we take inspiration from work in psychology and look at ways to model word meaning more continuously.",
        "Even though there is still some controversy, the majority of studies support the view that senses of polysemous words are linked in their mental representations.",

        "It represents a word sense as the sum of the vectors for all synonyms in its synset, plus the vectors for all hypernyms scaled down by a factor of 10.",
        "They also use a more complex, syntax-based model to derive occurrence representations.",
        "Unfortunately their results are not directly comparable to Erk and McCarthy (2009) because they evaluate on a subset of the data (verb lemmas only).",
        "The Usim data, which directly describes the similarity of pairs of usages, can be used to evaluate distributional models of word meaning in context.",
        "So far, only one type of model has been evaluated on this data to the best of our knowledge: the clustering-based approach of Reisinger and Mooney (2010).",
        "They use the Usim data to test to what extent their clusters correspond to human intuitions on a word's senses.",
        "Their result is negative, as a low correlation of human judgments and predictions suggests to them that the induced clusters are not a good match for human senses.",
        "The Usim data is particularly interesting for a different way of evaluating distributional and vector space approaches for word meaning in context.",
        "These have been evaluated on the tasks of lexical substitution (Erk and Padó 2008; Dinu and Lapata 2010; Thater, Fu?rstenau, and Pinkal 2010; Van de Cruys, Poibeau, and Korhonen 2011), information retrieval, and word sense disambiguation (Schu?tze 1998), but Usim, in contrast, offers a different and more direct evaluation perspective."

      "text": [
        "In this paper we have explored the question of whether word meaning can be described in a graded fashion.",
        "Our aim has been to use annotation with graded ratings to capture untrained speakers?",
        "intuitions on word meaning.",
        "Our motivation has been two-fold.",
        "On the one hand we are drawing on current theories of cognition, which hold that mental concepts have ?fuzzy boundaries.?",
        "On the other hand we wanted to give a basis to current computational models for word meaning in context that predicts degrees of similarity between word occurrences.",
        "We have addressed this question through two novel types of graded annotations of word meaning in context that draws on methods from psycholinguistic experimentation.",
        "WSsim obtains word sense annotations from a given sense inventory but uses graded judgments for each sense.",
        "Usim judges similarity of pairs of usages of the same lemma.",
        "The analysis of annotation results lets us answer our main question in the affirmative.",
        "Annotators can describe word meaning through graded ratings with good inter-annotator agreement, measured through pairwise correlation.",
        "Even though no in-depth training on sense distinctions was provided, the pairwise correlations were good in every single case, indicating that all annotators did the tasks in a similar fashion.",
        "In both tasks, all annotators made use of the full graded scale, and did not treat the task as binary.",
        "The Usim annotation provides us with a means of comparing different word meaning annotation paradigms.",
        "We have used it to demonstrate that there is strong correlation of these new annotations with both traditional WSD labels, and with overlap of lexical paraphrases.",
        "This is as we anticipated, as all of these annotations are describing the same phenomenon of word meaning in context through different means.",
        "In additional analysis of the WSsim annotation, we found a high proportion of sentences (between 23% and 46%) in which multiple senses received high positive judgments from the same annotators.",
        "At the same time, annotators used the WSsim ratings in a nuanced and fine-grained fashion, sometimes assigning high ratings on the same sentence to two senses that overall patterned very differently.",
        "Analyzing Usim annotation, we found that all annotators?",
        "ratings obey the triangle inequality in almost",
        " all cases.",
        "This can be taken as a measure of intra-annotator consistency on the task.",
        "It also means that current distributional approaches to word meaning in context are justified in viewing usage similarity as metric.",
        "Triangle inequality can be used to check the validity of future Usim annotation.",
        "We do not propose that either one of our annotations is a panacea for evaluation of systems that represent word meaning in context, but we argue that they provide data sets that better reflect the fluid nature of word meaning and allow us to evaluate questions related to word meaning in a new fashion.",
        "In this paper, we have used both WSsim and Usim data to analyze existing coarse-grained sense inventories.",
        "We have demonstrated that it is often not straightforward to group sentences into disjoint senses, depending on the lemma.",
        "We have also shown how both WSsim and Usim style judgments can be used to identify problematic lemmas, as well as sense groupings that may warrant another inspection to check whether they match naive speakers?",
        "intuitive judgments.",
        "The graded annotation can also be used to identify lemmas whose usages are difficult to group into clear distinct senses.",
        "This information can in the future be used to handle such lemmas differently when making sense inventories, in annotation, and in computational systems.",
        "An important next question to consider is the use of WSsim and Usim data to evaluate computational models of word meaning.",
        "As we have shown (Erk and McCarthy 2009), WSsim data can be used to evaluate traditional WSD systems in a graded fashion.",
        "We plan to do a more large-scale evaluation to assess to what extent the performance of current WSD systems is underestimated.",
        "Also, fine-grained WSsim annotation can be used for a comparison of fine-grained and coarse-grained traditional WSD systems.",
        "We have also shown (Erk and McCarthy 2009) that WSsim can be used to evaluate graded word sense assignment systems.",
        "Although we used a supervised setting, however, we trained on traditional sense annotation.",
        "We plan to collect more WSsim annotation in order to be able to train word sense assignment systems on graded data, for example, using a regression model.",
        "In the same vein, we will extend the available Usim data to cover many more sentences by using crowdsourcing.",
        "The use of Usim for supervised training of word meaning models is particularly interesting as all existing usage similarity models are unsupervised; given previous results in WSD, we can expect that supervision will improve the performance of models of usage meaning.",
        "One way of using Usim data in training is to learn a similarity metric.",
        "Metric learning (see, e.g., Davis et al. 2007) induces a distance measure from given constraints stating similarity or dissimilarity of items.",
        "Our novel graded annotation frameworks, WSsim and Usim, are validated both through good agreement between those data sets themselves, as well as good agreement between those data sets and traditional word sense annotation and lexical substitutions.",
        "Because all labeling schemes provide comparable results, this allows different ways of evaluating systems providing different perspectives on system output.",
        "Furthermore, the different paradigms may suit different types of systems.",
        "Lexical substitution tasks (McCarthy 2002; McCarthy and Navigli 2009) are particularly useful where the application being considered would benefit from lexical paraphrasing, for example, text simplification, summarization, or query expansion in information retrieval.",
        "WSsim is closest to the traditional methodology (WSbest) and would suit systems needing to output WordNet sense labels, for example, because they want to exploit the semantic relations in WordNet for tasks such as inferencing or producing lexical chains.",
        "Unlike WSbest, it avoids a winner-takes-all approach and allows for more nuanced sense tagging.",
        "Usim is application-independent.",
        "It allows for evaluation of systems that relate",
        "Erk, McCarthy, and Gaylord Measuring Word Meaning in Context usages, whether into clusters or simply on a continuum.",
        "It could, for example, be used as a resource-independent gold standard for word sense induction by calculating the within and across class similarities.",
        "Aside from its use as an enabling technology within a natural language processing application, a system that performs well at the Usim task may be useful in its own right.",
        "For example, it could be used to enable lexicographers to work on groups of examples that reflect similar meanings, or find further examples close to the one being scrutinized."
