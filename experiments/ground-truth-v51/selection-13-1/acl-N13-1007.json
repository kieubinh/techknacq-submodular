        "How-ever, our method needs no additional manual annotation particularly for this task and thus we categorize our method as a minimally supervised method.",
        "On the other hand, Hashimoto et al's method heavily depends on the properties of Japanese like the assumption that characteristic expressions of definition sentences tend to appear at the end of sentence in Japanese.",
        "We show that our method is applicable to English, Japanese, and Chinese, and that its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods (Navigli and Velardi, 2010).",

        "Our paraphrase extraction method is mostly language-independent and, through experiments for the three languages, we show that it outperforms unsupervised methods (Pas'ca and Dienes, 2005; Koehn et al., 2007) and is comparable to Hashimoto et al's supervised method for Japanese.",
        "Previous methods for paraphrase (and entailment) extraction can be classified into a distributional similarity based approach (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009) and a parallel corpus based approach (Barzilay and McK-eown, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004; Callison-Burch, 2008).",
        "The former can exploit large scale monolingual corpora, but is known to be unable to distinguish paraphrase pairs from antonymous pairs (Lin et al., 2003).",
        "The latter rarely mistakes antonymous pairs for paraphrases, but preparing parallel corpora is expensive.",
        "As with Hashimoto et al. (2011), our method is a kind of parallel corpus approach in that it uses definition pairs as a parallel corpus.",
        "However, our method does not suffer from a high labor cost of preparing parallel corpora, since it can automatically collect definition pairs from the Web on a large scale.",
        "The difference between ours and Hashimoto et al's is that our method requires no manual label-ing of data and is mostly language-independent.",
        "2 Proposed Method Our method first extracts definition sentences from the Web, and then extracts paraphrases from the definition sentences, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "2.1 Definition Extraction 2.1.1 Automatic Construction of Training Data Our method learns a classifier that classifies sentences into definition and non-definition using automatically constructed training data, TrDat.",
        "TrDat's positive examples, Pos, are the first sentences of Wikipedia articles and the negative examples, Neg, are randomly sampled Web sentences.",
        "The former can be seen as definition, while the chance that the sentences in the latter are definition is quite small.",
        "Our definition extraction not only distinguishes definition from non-definition but also identities the defined term of a definition sentence, and in the paraphrase extraction step our method couples two definition sentences if their defined terms are identical.",
        "For example, the defined terms of (1a) and (1b) in Figure 1 are both 'Paraphrasing'",
        "and thus the two definition sentences are coupled.",

        "Finally, subtree patterns are acquired using the subsequence patterns as input.",
        "N-gram patterns We collect N-gram patterns from TrDat with N ranging from 2 to 6.",
        "We filter out N-grams using thresholds on the Rate and fre-quency, and regard those that are kept as definition or non-definition N-grams.",
        "Subsequence patterns We generate subsequence patterns as ordered combinations of N-grams with the wild card '*'",
        "inserted between them (we use two or three N-grams for a subsequence).",
        "Then, we check each of the generated subsequences and keep it if there exists a sentence in TrDat that contains the subsequence and whose root node is contained in the subsequence.",
        "For example, subsequence '",
        "[term] is a * in the'",
        "is kept if a term-marked sentence like '",
        "[term] is a baseball player in the Dominican Re-public.'",
        "exists in TrDat.",
        "Then, patterns are filtered 65 out using thresholds on the Rate and frequency as we did for N-grams.",
        "Subtree patterns For each definition and non-definition subsequence, we retrieve all the term-marked sentences that contain the subsequence from TrDat, and extract a minimal dependency subtree that covers all the words of the subsequence from each retrieved sentence.",
        "For example, assume that we retrieve a term-marked sentence '",
        "[term] is usually defined as the way of life of a group of peo-ple.'",
        "for subsequence '",
        "[term] is * defined as the'.",
        "Then we extract from the sentence the minimal dependency subtree in the left side of (C) of Table 1.",
        "Note that all the words of the subsequence are contained in the subtree, and that in the subtree a node ('way')",
        "that is not a part of the subsequence is replaced with its dependency label ('NP')",
        "assigned by the dependency parser.",
        "The patterns are filtered out using thresholds on the Rate and frequency.",
        "We train a SVM classifier1 with a linear kernel, using binary features that indicate the occurrence of the patterns described above in a target sentence.",
        "In theory, we could feed all the features to the SVM classifier and let the classifier pick informative features.",
        "But we restricted the feature set for practical reasons: the number of features would become tremendously large.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "First, the number of sentences in our automatically acquired training data is huge (2,439,257 positive sentences plus 5,000,000 negative sentences for English, 703,208 positive sentences plus 1,400,000 negative sentences for Japanese and 310,072 positive sentences plus 600,000 negative sentences for Chinese).",
        "Second, since each subsequence pattern is generated as a combination of two or three N-gram patterns and one subsequence pattern can generate one or more subtree patterns, using all possible features leads to a combinatorial explosion of features.",
        "Moreover, since the feature vector will be highly sparse with a huge number of infrequent fea-tures, SVM learning becomes very time consuming.",
        "In preliminary experiments we observed that when using all possible features the learning process took more than one week for each language.",
        "We therefore introduced the current feature selection method, in which the learning process finished in one day but 1http://svmlight.joachims.org.",

        "Term-marked sentence 2: Albert Pujols is a [term].",
        "Figure 3: Term-marked sentences from a Web sentence.",
        "still obtains good results.",
        "2.1.3 Definition Extraction from the Web We extract a large amount of definition sentences by applying this classifier to sentences in our Web archive.",
        "Because our classifier requires term-marked sentences (sentences in which the term being defined is marked) as input, we first have to identify all such defined term candidates for each sentence.",
        "For example, Figure 3 shows a case where a Web sentence has two NPs (two candidates of defined term).",
        "Basically we pick up NPs in a sentence by simple heuristic rules.",
        "For English, NPs are identified using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) and two NPs are merged into one when they are connected by 'for'",
        "or 'of'.",
        "After applying this procedure recur-sively, the longest NPs are regarded as candidates of defined terms and term-marked sentences are generated.",
        "For Japanese, we first identify nouns that are optionally modified by adjectives as NPs, and allow two NPs connected by '''",
        "(of ), if any, to form a larger NP.",
        "For Chinese, nouns that are optionally modified by adjectives are considered as NPs.",
        "Then, each term-marked sentence is given a feature vector and classified by the classifier.",
        "The term-marked sentence whose SVM score (the distance from the hyperplane) is the largest among those from the same original Web sentence is chosen as the final classification result for the original Web sentence.",
        "2.2 Paraphrase Extraction We use all the Web sentences classified as definition and all the sentences in Pos for paraphrase extraction.",
        "First, we couple two definition sentences whose defined term is the same.",
        "We filter out definition sentence pairs whose cosine similarity of content word vectors is less than or equal to threshold C, which is set to 0.1.",
        "Then, we extract phrases from each definition sentence, and generate all possible phrase pairs from the coupled sentences.",

        "There are three corresponding subfunctions (f3,1 to f3,3).",
        "f4 The ratio of the number of words that appear in a candidate phrase segment of a definition sentence s1 and in a segment that is NOT a part of the candidate phrase of another definition sentence s2 to the number of all the words of s1's candidate phrase.",

        "f8 The ratio of the number of parent dependency subtrees that are shared by two candidate phrases to the number of all the parent dependency subtrees.",
        "The parent dependency subtrees are adjacent to the candidate phrases and represented by their surface form (f8,1), base form (f8,2), or POS (f8,3).",
        "f9 The same as f8 except that we use child dependency sub-trees.",
        "There are 3 subfunctions (f9,1 to f9,3) of f9 type.",

        "Local similarity Following Hashimoto et al., we assume that two candidate phrases (p1, p2) tend to be a paraphrase if they are similar enough and/or their surrounding contexts are sufficiently similar.",
        "Then, we calculate the local similarity (localSim) of (p1, p2) as the weighted sum of 37 similarity subfunctions that are grouped into 10 types (Table 3.)",
        "For example, the f1 type consists of three subfunc-tions, f1,1, f1,2, and f1,3.",
        "The 37 subfunctions are inspired by Hashimoto et al's features.",
        "Then, localSim is defined as: localSim(p1, p2) = max (dl,dm)'DP (p1,p2) ls(p1, p2, dl, dm).",
        "Here, ls(p1, p2, dl, dm) = '10 i=1 'ki j=1 wi,j'fi,j(p1,p2,dl,dm) ki .",

        "is ('the meaning')",
        "and ('keep, intact', 'preserve').",
        "globalSim measures the semantic similarity of the Diff of a phrase pair.",
        "It is proposed based on the following intuition: phrase pair (p1, p2) tend to be a paraphrase if their surface difference (i.e. Diff ) have the same meaning.",
        "For example, if 'keep, intact'",
        "and 'preserve'",
        "mean the same, then ('keep the meaning intact', 'preserve the meaning')",
        "is a paraphrase.",
        "globalSim considers the occurrence of Diff in global contexts (i.e., all the paraphrase candidates from all the definition pairs).",
        "The globalSim of a given phrase pair (p1, p2) is measured by basically counting how many times the Diff of (p1, p2) appears in all the candidate phrase pairs from all the definition pairs.",
        "The assumption is that Diff tends to share the same meaning if it appears repeatedly in paraphrase candidates from all definition sentence pairs, i.e., our parallel corpus.",
