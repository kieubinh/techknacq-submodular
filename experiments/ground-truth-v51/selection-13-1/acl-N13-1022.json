        "Addressee detection (AD) is an important problem for dialog systems in human-human-computer scenarios (contexts involving multiple people and a system) because system-directed speech must be distinguished from human-directed speech.",
        "Recent work on AD (Shriberg et al., 2012) showed good results using prosodic and lexical features trained on in-domain data.",
        "In-domain data, however, is expensive to collect for each new domain.",
        "In this study we focus on lexical models and investigate how well out-of-domain data (either outside the domain, or from single-user scenarios) can fill in for matched in-domain data.",
        "We find that human-addressed speech can be modeled using out-of-domain conversational speech transcripts, and that human-computer utterances can be modeled using single-user data: the resulting AD system outperforms a system trained only on matched in-domain data.",
        "Further gains (up to a 4% reduction in equal error rate) are obtained when in-domain and out-of-domain models are interpolated.",
        "Finally, we examine which parts of an utterance are most useful.",
        "We find that the first 1.5 seconds of an utterance contain most of the lexical information for AD, and analyze which lexical items convey this.",
        "Overall, we conclude that the H-H-C scenario can be approximated by combining data from H-C and H-H scenarios only.",

        "Before a spoken dialog system can recognize and interpret a user's speech, it should ideally determine if speech was even meant to be interpreted by the system.",
        "We refer to this task as addressee detection (AD).",
        "AD is often overlooked, especially in traditional single-user scenarios, because with the exception of self-talk, side-talk or background speech, the majority of speech is usually system-directed.",
        "As dialog systems expand to more natural contexts and multiperson environments, however, AD can become a crucial part of the system's operational requirements.",
        "This is particularly true for systems in which explicit system addressing (e.g., push-to-talk or required keyword addressing) is undesirable.",
        "Past research on addressee detection has focused on human-human (H-H) settings, such as meetings, sometimes with multimodal cues (op den Akker and Traum, 2009).",
        "Early systems relied primarily on rejection of H-H utterances either because they could not be interpreted (Paek et al., 2000), or because they yielded low speech recognition confidence (Dowd-ing et al., 2006).",
        "Some systems combine gaze with lexical and syntactic cues to detect H-H speech (Katzenmaier et al., 2004).",
        "Others use relatively simple prosodic features based on pitch and energy in addition to those derived from automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Reich et al., 2011).",
        "With some exceptions (Bohus and Horvitz, 2011; Shriberg et al., 2012), relatively little work has looked at the human-human-computer (H-H-C) scenario, i.e. at contexts involving two or more people who interact both with a system and with each other.",
        "Shriberg et al. (2012) found that novel prosodic features were more accurate than lexical or semantic features based on speech recognition for the addressee task.",
        "The corpus, also used herein, is comprised of H-H-C dialog in which roughly half of the computer-addressed speech consisted of a small set of fixed commands.",
        "While the word-based features map directly to the commands, they had trouble distinguishing all other (noncommand) computer-directed speech from human-directed speech.",
        "This is because addressee detection in the H-H-C scenario becomes even more challenging when the system is designed for natural speech, i.e., utterances that are conversational in form and not limited to command phrases with restricted syntax.",
        "Furthermore, H-H utterances can be about the domain of the system (e.g., discussing the dialog task), making AD based on language content more difficult.",
        "The prosodic features were good at both types of distinctions?even improving performance significantly when combined with true-word (cheating) lexical features that have 100% accuracy on the commands.",
        "Nevertheless, the prior work showed that lexical n-grams are useful for addressee detection in the H-H-C scenario.",
        "A problem with lexical features is that they are highly task-and domain-dependent.",
        "As with other language modeling tasks, one usually has to collect matched training data in significant quantities.",
        "Data collection is made more cumbersome and expensive by the multi-user aspect of the scenario.",
        "Thus, for practical reasons alone, it would be much better if the language models for AD could be trained on out-of-domain data, and if whatever in-domain data is needed could be limited to single-user interaction.",
        "We show in this paper that precisely this training scenario is feasible and achieves results that are comparable or better than using completely matched H-H-C training data.",
        "In addition to studying the role of out-of-domain data for lexical AD models, we also examine which words are useful, and how soon in elapsed time they are available.",
        "Whereas most prior work in AD has looked at processing of entire utterances, we consider an online processing version where AD decisions are to be made as soon as possible after an utterance was initiated.",
        "We find that most of the addressee-relevant lexical information can be found",
        "in the first 1.5 seconds, and analyze which words convey this information."

        "Combining in-domain and out-of-domain data (both-all, both-small) gives about 1 point additional EER gain.",
        "Note that training on in-domain data plus the smaller-size out-of-domain corpora (both-small) is better than using all available data (both-all).",

        "systems in Table 3.",
        "The DET plot depicts performance not only at the EER operating point (which lies on the diagonal), but over the range of possible trade-offs between false alarm and miss error rates.",

        "Figure 5 shows H-H vs. H-C classification accuracies on each of the four utterance subtypes listed in Table 1.",
        "It is clear that computer-command utterances are the easiest to classify; the accuracy is more than 90% using transcripts, and more than 85% using ASR output.",

        "The biggest gain from use of out-of-domain data is found for computer-directed noncommand utterances.",

        "As for the optimization of the mixing weight ?, we found that minimizing perplexity on the development set of each class is effective.",
        "This is a standard optimization approach for interpolated language models, and can be carried out efficiently using an expectation maximization algorithm.",
        "We also tried search-based optimization using the classification metric (EER) as the criterion.",
        "While this approach could theoretically give better results (since perplexity is not a discriminative criterion) we found no significant improvement in our experiments.",

        "In order to make perplexities comparable, we trained all models using the union of the vocabularies from the different sources.",
        "In spite of perplexity being a good way to optimize the weighting of sources, it is not clear that it is a good criterion for selecting data sources.",
        "For example, we see that the Fisher model has a much lower perplexity on H-H utterances than the ICSI meeting model.",
        "However, as reflected in Table 3, the H language model that leaves out the Fisher data actually performed better.",
        "The most likely explanation is that the Fisher corpus is an order of magnitude larger than the ICSI corpus, and that sheer data size, not stylistic similarity, may account for the lower perplexity of the Fisher model.",

        "Table 5 shows the EER performance of the POS-based model, for various sizes N of the most-frequent word list.",
        "We observe that the partial replacement of words with POS tags indeed improves over the baseline model performance, by 1.5 points on ASR output and by 1.1 points on transcripts.",
        "We also see that the gain over the corresponding word-only model is largest for the in-domain baseline model, and less or non-existent for the out-of-domain model.",
        "This is consistent with the notion that the in-domain model suffers the most from data sparseness, and therefore has the most to gain from better generalization.",
        "Interpolating with out-of-domain data still helps here.",
        "The optimal N differs for ASR output versus transcripts.",
        "The POS-based model with N = 300 improves the EER by 0.5 points on ASR output, and N = 1000 improves the EER by 0.8 points on transcripts.",

        "This pattern holds for both in-domain and out-of-domain training, as well as for combined models.",
