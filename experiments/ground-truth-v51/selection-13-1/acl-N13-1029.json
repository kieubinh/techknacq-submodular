        "In our current implementation of label collapsing, we indiscriminately allow either source labels or target labels to be collapsed at each iteration of the algorithm (see Equation 3).",
        "This is an intuitively sensible setting when collapsing bilingual labels, but it is perhaps less obviously so for a monolingually labeled system such as SAMT.",
        "An alternative would be to collapse target-side labels only, leaving the source-side labels alone since they do not appear in the final grammar anyway.",
        "In this case, the target labels would be represented and clustered as distributions over a static set of latent categories.",
        "A larger area of future concern is the stopping point of the collapsing algorithm.",
        "In our previous work (Hanneman and Lavie, 2011), we manually identified iterations in our run of the algorithm where the L1 distance between the most recently collapsed label pair was markedly lower than the L1 difference of the pair in the previous iteration.",
        "Such an approach is more feasible in our previous runs of 120 iterations than in ours here of nearly 2100, where it is not likely that three manually chosen stopping points represent the optimal collapsing results.",
        "In future work, we plan to work towards the development of an automatic stopping criterion, a more principled test for whether each successive iteration of label collapsing provides some useful benefit to the underlying grammar."
