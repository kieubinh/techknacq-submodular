        "Social media texts include SMS (Short Message Service) messages, Twitter messages, Facebook updates, etc.",
        "They are different from formal texts due to their significant informal characteristics, so they always pose difficulties for applications such as machine translation (MT) (Aw et al., 2005) and named entity recognition (Liu et al., 2011), because of a lack of training data containing informal texts.",
        "Thus, the applications always suffer from a substantial performance drop when evaluated on social media texts.",
        "For example, Ritter et al. (2011) reported a drop from 90% to 76% on part-of-speech tagging, and Foster et al. (2011) found a drop of 20% in dependency parsing.",
        "Creating training data of social media texts specifically for a text processing task is time-consuming.",
        "For example, to create parallel Chinese-English training texts for translation of social media texts, it takes three minutes on average to translate an informally written social media text of eleven words from Chinese into English.",
        "On the other hand, it takes thirty seconds to normalize the same message, a sixfold increase in speed.",
        "After training a text normalization system to normalize social media texts, we can use an existing statistical machine translation (SMT) system trained on normal texts (non-social media texts) to carry out translation.",
        "So we argue that normalization followed by regular translation is a more practical approach.",
        "Thus, text normalization is important for social media text processing.",
        "Most previous work on normalization of social media text focused on word substitution (Beaufort et al., 2010; Gouws et al., 2011; Han and Baldwin, 2011; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "However, we argue that some other normalization operations besides word substitution are also critical for subsequent natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as missing word recovery (e.g., zero pronouns) and punctuation correction.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel beam-search decoder for normalization of social media text for MT.",
        "Our decoder can effectively integrate different normalization operations together.",
        "In contrast to previous work, some of our normalization operations are specifically designed for MT, e.g., missing word recovery based on conditional random fields",
        "(CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and punctuation correction based on dynamic conditional random fields (DCRF) (Sutton et al., 2004).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to perform missing word recovery and punctuation correction for normalization of social media text, and also the first to perform message-level normalization of Chinese social media text.",
        "We investigate the effects on translating social media text after addressing various characteristics of informal social media text through normalization.",
        "To show the applicability of our normalization approach for different languages, we experiment with two languages, Chinese and English.",
        "We achieved statistically significant improvements over two strong baselines: an improvement of 9.98%/7.35% in BLEU scores for normalization of Chinese/English social media text, and an improvement of 1.38%/1.35% in BLEU scores for translation of Chinese/English social media text.",
        "We created two corpora: a Chinese corpus containing 1,000 Weibo1 messages with their normalizations and English translations; and another similar English corpus containing 2,000 SMS messages from the NUS SMS corpus (How and Kan, 2005).",
        "As far as we know, our corpora are the first publicly available Chinese/English corpora for normalization and translation of social media text2."
