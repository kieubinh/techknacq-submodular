        "Automatic translation acquisition is an important task for various applications.",
        "For example, finding term translations can be used to automatically update existing bilingual dictionaries, which are an indispensable resource for tasks such as cross-lingual information retrieval and text mining.",
        "Various previous research like (Rapp, 1999; Fung, 1998) has shown that it is possible to acquire word translations from comparable corpora.",
        "We suggest here an extension of this approach which uses several query terms instead of a single query term.",
        "A user who searches a translation for a query term that is not listed in an existing bilingual dictionary, might first try to find a synonym of that term.",
        "For example, the user might look up a synonym in a thesaurus1 or might use methods for automatic synonym acquisition like described in (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "If the synonym is listed in the bilingual dictionary, we can consider the synonym's translations as the translations of the query term.",
        "Otherwise, if the synonym is not listed in the dictionary either, we use the synonym together with the original query term to find a translation.",
        "We claim that using a set of synonymous query terms to find a translation is better than using a single query term.",
        "The reason is that a single query term's context vector is, in general, unreliable due to sparsity.",
        "For example, a low frequent query term tends to have many zero entries in its context vector.",
        "To mitigate this problem it has been proposed to smooth a query's context vector by its nearest neighbors (Pekar et al., 2006).",
        "However, nearest neighbors, which context vectors are close the query's context vector, can have different meanings and therefore might introduce noise.",
        "The contributions of this paper are two-fold.",
        "First, we confirm experimentally that smoothing a query's context vector with its synonyms leads in deed to higher translation accuracy, compared to smoothing with nearest neighbors.",
        "Second, we propose a simple method to combine a set of context vectors that performs in this setting better than a method previously proposed by (Pekar et al., 2006).",
        "Our approach to combine a set of context vec",
        "tors is derived by learning the mean vector of a von Mises-Fisher distribution.",
        "The combined context vector is a weighted-average of the original context-vectors, where the weights are determined by the word occurrence frequencies.",
        "In the following section we briefly show the relation to other previous work.",
        "In Section 3, we explain our method in detail, followed by an empirical evaluation in Section 4.",
        "We summarize our results in Section 6."
