        "These algorithms use examples from each domain to learn a general model that is also sensitive to individual domain differences.",
        "However, many data sets include a host of meta-data attributes, many of which can potentially define the domains to use.",

        "For multi-domain learning, we should use the metadata attribute most likely to characterize a domain: a change in vocabulary (i.e. features) that most impacts the classification decision (Ben-David et al., 2009).",
        "This choice is not easy.",
        "First, we may not know which metadata attribute is most likely to fit this role.",
        "Perhaps the location most impacts the review language, but it could easily be the price of the meal.",
        "Second, multiple metadata attributes could impact the classification decision, and picking a single one might reduce classification accuracy.",
        "Therefore, we seek multi-domain learning algorithms which can simultaneously learn from many types of domains (metadata attributes).",

        "While our problem formulation has significant conceptual overlap with the SAGE?like multifaceted topic models framework, our proposed methods are motivated from a fast online learning perspective.",
        "A naive approach for MAMD would be to treat every unique set of attributes as a domain, including unique proper subsets of different attributes to account for the case of missing attributes in some instances.3 However, introducing an exponential number of domains requires a similar increase in training data, clearly an infeasible requirement.",
        "Instead, we develop multi-attribute extensions for two multi-domain learning algorithms, such that the increase in parameters is linear in the number of metadata attributes, and no special handling is required for the case where some metadata attributes might be missing from an instance.",
        "Multi-Attribute FEDA The key idea behind FEDA (Daume?",
        "III, 2007) is to encode each domain using its own parameters, one per feature.",

        "Ai, the original features are copied into the appropriate sub-space.",
        "This grows linearly with the number of metadata attribute values, as opposed to exponentially in our naive solution.",
        "While this is still substantial growth, each instance retains the same feature sparsity as in the original input space.",
        "In this new setup, FEDA allows an instance to contribute towards learning the shared parameters, and the attribute-specific parameters for all the attributes present on an instance.",
        "Just like multi-domain FEDA, any supervised learning algorithm can be applied to the transformed representation.",
        "Multi-Attribute MDR We make a similar change to MDR (Dredze et al., 2009) to extend it for the MAMD setting.",
        "In the original formulation, Dredze et al. used confidence-weighted (CW) learning (Dredze et al., 2008) for learning shared and domain-specific classifiers, which are combined based on the confidence scores associated with the feature weights.",
        "For training the MDR approaches in a multi-domain learning setup, they found that computing updates for the combined classifier and then equally distributing them to the shared and domain-specific classifiers was the best strategy, although it approximated the true objective that they aimed to optimize.",
        "In our multi-attribute setup confidence-weighted (CW) classifiers are learned for each of the ?",
        "mKm attribute values in addition to a shared CW classifier.",
        "At classification time, a combined classifier is computed for every instance.",
        "However, instead of combining the shared classifier and a single domain-specific classifier, we combine the shared CW classifier and |Ai |different attribute value-specific CW classifiers associated with xi.",
        "The combined classifier is found by minimizing the KL-divergence of the combined classifier with respect to each of the underlying classifiers.4 When learning the shared and domain-specific classifiers, we follow the best result in Dredze et al.",
        "and use the ?averaged update?",
        "strategy (?7.3 in Dredze et al), where updates are computed for the combined classifier, and are then distributed to the shared and domain-specific classifiers.",
        "MDR-U will indicate that the updates to the combined classifiers are uniformly distributed to the underlying shared and domain-specific classifiers.",
        "Dredze et al. also used another scheme called ?variance?",
        "to distribute the combined update to the underlying classifiers (?4, last paragraph in Dredze et al) Their idea was to give a lower portion of the update to the underlying classifier that has higher variance (or in their terminology, ?less confidence?)",
        "since it contributed less to the combined classifier.",
        "We refer to this as MDR-V.",
        "However, this conflicts with the original CW intuition that features with higher variance (lower confidence) should receive higher updates; since they are more in need of change.",
