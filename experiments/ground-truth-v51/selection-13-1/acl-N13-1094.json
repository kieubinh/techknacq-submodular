        "The goal of relation extraction is to extract tuples of a particular relation from a corpus of natural language text.",
        "A widely employed approach to relation extraction is based on iterative bootstrapping (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; PaÅŸca et al., 2006; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), which can be applied with only small amounts of supervision and which scales well to very large datasets.",
        "A well-known problem with iterative bootstrapping is a phenomenon known as semantic drift (Curran et al., 2007): as bootstrapping proceeds it is likely that unreliable patterns will lead to false extractions.",
        "These extraction errors are amplified in the following iterations and the extracted relation will drift away from the intended target.",
        "Semantic drift often results in low precision extractions and therefore poses a major limitation of iterative bootstrapping algorithms.",
        "Previous work on iterative bootstrapping has addressed the issue of reducing semantic drift for example by bagging the results of various runs employing differing seed tuples, constructing filters which identify false tuples or patterns and adding further constraints to the bootstrapping process (T. McIntosh, 2010; McIntosh and Curran, 2009; Curran et al., 2007).",
        "However, the analysis of Komachi et al. (2008) has shown that semantic drift is an inherent property of iterative bootstrapping algorithms and therefore poses a fundamental problem.",
        "They have shown that iterative bootstrapping without pruning corresponds to an eigenvector computation and thus as the number of iterations increases the resulting ranking will always converge towards the same static ranking of tuples, regardless of the particular choice of seed instances.",
        "In this paper, we describe an alternative method, that is not susceptible to semantic drift.",
        "We represent our data as a bipartite graph, whose vertices correspond to patterns and tuples respectively and whose edges capture cooccurrences and then measure the distance of a tuple to the seed set in terms of random walk hitting times.",
        "Experimental results confirm that semantic drift is avoided by our method and show that substantial improvements over iterative forms of bootstrapping are possible."
