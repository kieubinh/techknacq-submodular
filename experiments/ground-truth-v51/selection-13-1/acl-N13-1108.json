        "In most question answering (QA) systems and search engines term-weights are assigned in a context independent fashion using simple TF-IDF like models (Robertson and Walker, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1998).",
        "Even the more recent advances in information retrieval techniques for query term weighting (Bendersky et al., 2010; Bendersky, 2011) typically rely on bag-of-words models and corpus statistics, such as inverse-document-frequency (IDF), to assign weights to terms in questions.",
        "While such solutions may work for keyword queries of the type common on search engines such as Google, they do not exploit syntactic and semantic information when it comes to well formed natural language questions.",
        "In this paper we propose a new model that identifies important terms and phrases in a natural language question, providing better query analysis that ultimately leads to significant improvements in a QA system.",
        "To motivate the work presented here, consider the query ?How does one apply for a New York day care license??.",
        "A bag-of-words model would likely assign a high score to ?New licenses for day care centers in York county, PA?",
        "because of high word overlap, but it does not answer the question, and also the state is wrong.",
        "A matching component that uses the phrases ?New York,?",
        "?day care,?",
        "and ?license?",
        "is likely to do better.",
        "However, a better matching component will understand that in the context of this query all three phrases ?New York,?",
        "?day care?",
        "and ?license?",
        "are important, and that ?New York?",
        "needs to modify ?day care.?",
        "A snippet that does not contain1 these important phrases, is unlikely an answer.",
        "We call these important phrases mandatory matching phrases (MMPs).",
        "In this paper, we explore deep syntactic and semantic analyses of questions to determine and rank MMPs.",
        "Unlike existing work (Zhao and Callan, 2010; Bendersky et al., 2010; Bendersky, 2011), where term/concept weights are learned from a set of questions and judged documents based on corpus-based statistics, we annotate questions and build a trainable system to select and score MMPs.",
        "This model relies heavily on existing syntactic parsers and semantic-oriented named-entity recognizers, but does not need question answer pairs.",
        "This is espe",
        "?contain?",
        "here means semantic equivalence or entailment, not necessarily the exact words or phrases.",
        "cially attractive at the initial system-building stage when no or little answer data is available.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: firstly, we propose a framework to select and rank important question phrases (MMPs) for question answering in Section 3.",
        "This framework seamlessly incorporates lexical, syntactic and semantic information, resulting in an MMP prediction F-measure as high as 88.6%.",
        "Secondly, we show that features derived from identified MMPs improve significantly a relevance classification model, in Section 4.2.",
        "Thirdly, we show that using the improved relevance model into our QA system results in a statistically significant 5 point improvement in F-measure, in Section 5.",
        "This finding is further corroborated by the results on the official 2012 BOLT IR (IR, 2012) task where the combined system yielded the best performance in the evaluation."

        "Recently, several researchers have studied approaches for term weighting using supervised learning techniques.",

        "While word level importance is perhaps sufficient for an IR task, predicting the importance of phrases, especially those derived from a parse tree, gives a much richer representation that might also be useful for better question understanding and thus generate more relevant answers.",
        "Both (Lease et al., 2009; Zhao and Callan, 2010) propose supervised methods that learn from a large set of queries and relevance judgments on their answers.",
        "While this is possible in a TREC Ad-hoc-retrieval-like task, such a large training corpus of question-answer pairs is unavailable for most scenarios.",
        "(Monz, 2007) learns term weights for the IR component of a question answering task.",
        "His work unlike ours does not aim to find the answers to the questions.",
        "Most QA systems in the literature have dealt with answering factoid questions, where the answer is a noun phrase in response to questions of the form ?Who,?",
        "?Where,?",
        "?When.?",
        "Most systems have a question analysis component that represents the question as syntactic relations in a parse or as deep semantic relations in a handcrafted ontology (Hermjakob et al., 2000; Chu-carroll et al., 2003; Moldovan et al., 2003).",
        "In addition certain systems (Bunescu and Huang, 2010) aim to find the ?focus?",
        "of the question, that is, the noun-phrases in the question that would co-refer with answers.",
        "Additionally, much past work has focused on finding the lexical answer type (Pinchak, 2006; Li and Roth, 2002).",
        "Since these papers considered a small number of answer types, rules over the detected relations and answer types could be applied to find the relevant answer.",
        "However, since our system answers non-factoid questions that can have answer of arbitrary types, we want to use as few rules as possible.",
        "The MMPs therefore become a critical component of our system, both for question analysis and for relevance detection."
