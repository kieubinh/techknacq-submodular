        "Repetition is one of the most common coreferential devices in written text, making string-match features important to all coreference resolution systems.",
        "In fact, the scores achieved by just head match and a rudimentary form of pronominal resolution1 are not far from that of state-of-the-art systems (Recasens and Hovy, 2010).",
        "This suggests that opaque mentions (i.e., lexically different) such as iPad and the Cupertino slate are a serious problem for modern systems: they comprise 65% of the non-pronominal 1Closest NP with the same gender and number.",
        "errors made by the Stanford system on the CoNLL2011 data.",
        "Solving this problem is critical for overcoming the recall gap of state-of-the-art systems (Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Stoyanov et al., 2009).",
        "Previous systems have turned either to ontologies (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Uryupina et al., 2011; Rahman and Ng, 2011) or distributional semantics (Yang and Su, 2007; Kobdani et al., 2011; Bansal and Klein, 2012) to help solve these errors.",
        "But neither semantic similarity nor hypernymy are the same as coreference: Microsoft and Google are distribu-tionally similar but not coreferent; people is a hypernym of both voters and scientists, but the people can corefer with the voters, but is less likely to corefer with the scientists.",
        "Thus ontologies lead to precision problems, and to recall problems like missing NE descriptions (e.g., Apple and the iPhone maker) and metonymies (e.g., agreement and wording), while distributional systems lead to precision problems like coreferring Microsoft and the Mountain View giant because of their similar vector representation (release, software, update).",
        "We increase precision by drawing on the intuition that referents that are both similar and participate in the same event are likely to corefer.",
        "We restrict distributional similarity to collections of articles that discuss the same event.",
        "In the following two documents on the Nexus One from different sources, we take the subjects of the identical verb release?",
        "Google and the Mountain View giant?as coreferent.",
        "Based on this idea, we introduce a new unsupervised method that uses verbs in comparable corpora",
        "as pivots for extracting the hard cases of coreference resolution, and build a dictionary of opaque coreferent mentions (i.e., the dictionary entries are pairs of mentions).",
        "This dictionary is then integrated into the Stanford coreference system (Lee et al., 2011), resulting in an average 1% improvement in the F1 score of all the evaluation measures.",
        "Our work points out the importance of context to decide whether a specific mention pair is coreferent.",
        "On the one hand, we need to know what semantic relations are potentially coreferent (e.g., content and video).",
        "On the other, we need to distinguish contexts that are compatible for coreference?",
        "(1) and (2-a)?",
        "from those that are not?",

        "b. Elemental is powering the video for HBO Go.",
        "Our dictionary of opaque coreferent pairs is our solution to the first problem, and we report on some preliminary work on context compatibility to address the second problem.",
        "2 Building a Dictionary for Coreference To build a dictionary of semantic relations that are appropriate for coreference we will use a cluster of documents about the same news event, which we call a story.",
        "Consider as an example the story Sprint blocks out vacation days for employees.",

        "Existing ontologies are not optimal for solving opaque coreferent mentions because of both a precision and a recall problem (Lee et al., 2011; Uryupina et al., 2011).",
        "On the other hand, using data-driven methods such as distributional semantics for coreference resolution suffers especially from a precision problem (Ng, 2007).",
        "Our work combines ideas from distributional semantics and paraphrase acquisition methods in order to efficiently use contextual information to extract coreference relations.",
        "The main idea that we borrow from paraphrase acquisition is the use of monolingual (non-parallel) comparable corpora, which have been exploited to extract both sentence-level (Barzilay and McK-eown, 2001) and sub-sentential-level paraphrases (Shinyama and Sekine, 2003; Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011).",
        "To ensure that the NPs are coreferent, we limit the meaning of comparable corpora to collections of documents that report on the very same story, as opposed to collections of documents that are about the same (general) topic.",
        "However, the distinguishing factor is that while most paraphrasing studies, including Lin and Pantel (2001), use NEs?",
        "or nouns in general?as pivots to learn paraphrases of their surrounding context, we use verbs as pivots to learn coreference relations at the NP level.",
        "There are many similarities between paraphrase and coreference, and our work is most similar to",
        "that by Wang and Callison-Burch (2011).",
        "However, some paraphrases that might not be considered to be valid (e.g., under $200 and around $200) can be acceptable coreference relations.",
        "Unlike Wang and Callison-Burch (2011), we do not work on document pairs but on sets of at least five (comparable) documents, and we do not require sentence alignment, but just verb alignment.",
        "Another source of inspiration is the work by Bean and Riloff (2004).",
        "They use contextual roles (i.e., the role that an NP plays in an event) for extracting patterns that can be used in coreference resolution, showing the relevance of verbs in deciding on coreference between their arguments.",
        "However, they use a very small corpus (two domains) and do not aim to build a dictionary.",
        "The idea of creating a repository of extracted concept-instance relations appears in Fleischman et al. (2003), but restricted to person-role pairs, e.g. Yasser Arafat and leader.",
        "Although it was originally designed for answering who-is questions, Daume?",
        "III and Marcu (2005) successfully used it for coreference resolution.",
        "The coreference relations that we extract might overlap but go beyond those detected by Bansal and Klein (2012)'s Web-based features.",
        "First, they focus on NP headwords, while we extract full NPs, including multi-word mentions.",
        "Second, the fact that they use the Google n-gram corpus means that the two headwords must appear at most four words apart, thus ruling out coreferent mentions that can only appear far from each other.",
        "Finally, while their extraction patterns focus on synonymy and hypernymy relations, we discover other types of semantic relations that are relevant for coreference (Section 2.5)."

        "We have pointed out an important problem with current coreference resolution systems: their heavy reliance on string overlap.",
        "Pronouns aside, opaque mentions account for 65% of the errors made by state-of-the-art systems.",
        "To improve coreference scores beyond 60-70%, we therefore need to make better use of semantic and world knowledge to deal with non-identical-string coreference.",
        "But, as we have also shown, coreference is not the same as semantic similarity or hypernymy.",
        "Only certain semantic relations in certain contexts are good cues for coreference.",
        "We therefore need semantic resources specifically targeted at coreference.",
        "We proposed a new solution for detecting opaque mention pairs: restricting distributional similarity to a comparable corpus of articles about the very same story, thus ensuring that similar mentions will also likely be coreferent.",
        "We used this corpus to build a dictionary focused on coreference, and successfully extracted the specific semantic and world knowledge relevant for coreference.",
        "The resulting dictionary can be added on top of any coreference system to increase recall at a minimum cost to precision.",
        "Integrated into the Stanford coreference resolution system, which won the CoNLL-2011 shared task, the F-score increases about 1 percentage point according to all of the six evaluation measures.",
        "The dictionary and NE signatures are available on the Web.13 We showed that apart from the need for extracting coreference-specific semantic and world knowledge, we need to take into account the context surrounding the mentions.",
        "The results from our preliminary work for identifying incompatible contexts is promising.",
        "Our unsupervised method for extracting opaque coreference relations can be easily extended to other domains by using online news aggregators, and trained on more data to build a more comprehensive dictionary that can increase recall even further.",
        "We integrated the dictionary into a rule-based coreference system, but it remains for future work to integrate it into a learning-based architecture, where the system can combine the dictionary features with other features.",
        "This can also make it easier to include contextual features that take into account how well a dictionary pair fits in a specific context."
