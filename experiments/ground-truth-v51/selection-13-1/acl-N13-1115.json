        "The tuning process improves the performance of an SMT system as measured by this metric; with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) being the most popular choice.",
        "Minimum error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) was the first approach in MT to directly optimize an evaluation metric.",
        "Several alternatives now exist: MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), linear regression (Bazrafshan et al., 2012) and ORO (Watanabe, 2012) among others.",
        "However these approaches optimize towards the best score as reported by a single evaluation metric.",
        "MT system developers typically use BLEU and ignore all the other metrics.",
        "This is done despite the fact that other metrics model wide-ranging aspects of translation: from measuring the translation edit rate (TER) in matching a translation output to a human reference (Snover et al., 2006), to capturing lexical choices in translation as in METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) to modelling semantic similarity through textual entailment (Pado?",
        "et al, 2009) to RIBES, an evaluation metric that pays attention to long-distance reordering (Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "While some of these metrics such as TER, METEOR are gaining prominence, BLEU enjoys the status of being the de facto standard tuning metric as it is often claimed and sometimes observed that optimizing with BLEU produces better translations than other metrics (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).",
        "The gains obtained by the MT system tuned on a particular metric do not improve performance as measured under other metrics (Cer et al., 2010), suggesting that over-fitting to a specific metric might happen without improvements in translation quality.",
        "In this paper we propose a new tuning framework for jointly optimizing multiple evaluation metrics.",
        "Pareto-optimality is a natural way to think about multi-metric optimization and multi-metric optimization (MMO) was recently explored using the notion of Pareto optimality in the Pareto-based Multi-objective Optimization (PMO) approach (Duh et al., 2012).",
        "PMO provides several equivalent solutions (parameter weights) having different trade-offs between the different MT metrics.",
        "In (Duh et al., 2012) the choice of which option to use rests with the MT system developer and in that sense their approach is an a posteriori method to specify the preference (Marler and Arora, 2004).",
        "In contrast to this, our tuning framework provides a principled way of using the Pareto optimal options using ensemble decoding (Razmara et al., 2012).",

        "Linear combination of BLEU and TER is reported in (Zaidan, 2009; Dyer et al., 2009; Servan and Schwenk, 2011); an alternative is to optimize on BLEU with MERT while enforcing that TER does not degrade per iteration (He and Way, 2009).",

        "For instance, (Mauser et al., 2008; Cer et al., 2010) report that tuning on linear combinations of BLEU-TER is more robust than a single metric like WER.",
        "The approach in (Devlin and Matsoukas, 2012) modifies the optimization function to include traits such as output length so that the hypotheses produced by the decoder have maximal score according to one metric (BLEU) but are subject to an output length constraint, e.g. that the output is 5% shorter.",
        "This is done by rescoring an N-best list (forest) for the metric combined with each trait condition and then the different trait hypothesis are combined using a system combination step.",
