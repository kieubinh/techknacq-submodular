        "data streams, researchers have reported mining insights about a variety of domains, from election results (Tumasjan et al., 2010) and democracy movements (Starbird and Palen, 2012) to health issues and disease spreading (Paul and Dredze, 2011; Sadilek et al., 2012), as well as tracking product feedback and sentiment (Asur and Huberman, 2010).",
        "A critical step in mining information from a micro-blogging service, such as Twitter, is the identification of entities in tweets.",
        "In order to mine the relationship between drugs, symptoms and side-effects, or track the popularity of politicians or sentiment about social issues, we must first be able to identify the topics and specific entities being discussed.",
        "The challenge is that messages on microblogs are short, noisy, and informal texts with little context, and often contain phrases with ambiguous meanings.",
        "For example, ?one day?",
        "may be either a set phrase or a reference to a movie.",
        "Given such difficulties, current mining and analysis of microblogs lists limits its application to certain domains with easy-to-recognize, unambiguous entities in order to avoid noise in the extraction results.",
        "We begin this paper with a thorough investigation of mention detection and entity disambiguation for social media, focused on the Twitter micro-blogging service.",
        "Mention detection is the task of extraction surface form candidates that can link to an entity in the domain of interest.",
        "Entity disambiguation is the task of linking an extracted mention to a specific definition or instance of an entity in a knowledge base.",
        "While mention detection and entity disambiguation are frequently cast as equally important but distinct and separate problems, we find that mention detection is where today's systems and our baseline techniques incur the most failures.",
        "Detecting the correct entity mention is a significant challenge given mis-capitalizations, incorrect grammar, and ambiguous phrases.",
        "In (Ritter et al., 2011), the authors report their system achieves 0.64 to 0.67 F1 on named entity segmentation results with 34K tokens of labeled examples.",
        "On the other hand, once the correct entity mention is detected, a trivial disambiguation that maps to the most popular entity2 will achieve 85% accuracy in our set.",
        "Our primary contribution in this paper is a recasting and merging of the tasks of mention detection and entity disambiguation into a single end-to-end entity linking task.",
        "We achieve significant improvements by applying structural learning techniques to jointly optimize the detection and disambiguation of entities.",
        "Treating detection and disambiguation as a single task also enables us to apply a large set of new features, conventionally used only for disambiguation, to the initial detection of mentions.",
        "These features, derived from external knowledge bases, include entity popularity and inter-entity relations from external knowledge bases, and are not well utilized in current mention detection systems.",
        "For example, consider the following partial tweet: (1) The town is so, so good.",
        "And don't worry Ben, we already forgave you for Gigli.",
        "Really.",
        "Determining whether or not ?The town?",

        "Knowing ?The Town?",
        "is the name of a recent movie helps, and we can we be more confident if we know that Ben Affleck is an actor in the movie, and Gigli is another of his movies.",
        "To train and evaluate our system, we created three separate annotated data sets of approximately 500 tweets each.",

        "While their system also considers mention detection and entity disambiguation together, they do not consider entity-to-entity relationships and do not incorporate contextual words from tweets.",
