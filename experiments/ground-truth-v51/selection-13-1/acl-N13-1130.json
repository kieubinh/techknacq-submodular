        "A fundamental problem in computational linguistics is the paucity of manually annotated data, such as part-of-speech tagged sentences, treebanks, and logical forms, which exist only for few languages (Ide et al., 2010).",
        "A case in point is the lack of abundant sense annotated data, which hampers the performance and coverage of lexical semantic tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012, WSD) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "A possible way to break this bottleneck is to use pseudowords, i.e., artificial words constructed by conflating a set of unambiguous words, with the aim of modeling polysemy in real ambiguous words.",
        "The idea of pseudowords was originally proposed by Gale et al. (1992) and Schu?tze (1992) for WSD evaluation, but later found application in other tasks such as selectional preferences (Erk, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2010), Word Sense Induction (Bor-dag, 2006; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013) or studies concerning the effects of the amount of data on machine learning for natural language disambiguation (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "Being made up of monose-mous words, pseudowords can potentially be used to create large amounts of pseudosense-annotated data at virtually no cost, hence enabling large-scale studies in lexical semantics.",
        "Unfortunately, though, the extent of their usability for such a purpose is hampered by two main issues: semantic awareness and wide coverage.",
        "Semantic awareness corresponds to the constraint that pseudowords, in order to be realistic, are expected to have senses which are in a semantic relationship (thus modeling systematic polysemy).",
        "Recent work has focused on this issue and, by exploiting either specific lexical hierarchies (Nakov and Hearst, 2003; Lu et al., 2006), or the WordNet structure (Otrusina and Smrz, 2010), have succeeded in generating pseudowords which are comparable to real words in terms of disambiguation difficulty.",
        "The second challenge is coverage, which corresponds to the number of distinct pseudowords an algorithm can generate.",
        "When coupled with the semantic awareness issue, wide coverage is hampered by the difficulty in generating thousands of pseudowords which mimic existing polysemous words.",
        "Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches to the generation of pseudowords can meet both these challenges simultaneously, and this has hindered the generation of a large pseudosense-annotated dataset.",
        "For instance, approaches which exploit the monosemous neighbors of a target sense in WordNet (Otrusina and Smrz, 2010) can be used to generate pseudowords with good semantic awareness, but",
        "they have low coverage of ambiguous nouns when many pseudosense-tagged sentences are needed (cf.",
        "Section 2.1.1).",
        "In this paper we propose a new approach, based on Personalized PageRank, which simultaneously addresses the two above-mentioned issues concerning the generation of pseudowords (i.e., semantic awareness and coverage), and hence enables the generation of large-scale pseudosense-annotated datasets.",
        "We perform three different experiments to show that our pseudowords are good at modeling existing ambiguous words in terms of disambiguation difficulty, representativeness of real senses and dis-tinguishability of the artificial senses.",
        "As a byproduct of this work, we generate a large dataset that provides 1000 tagged sentences for each of the 15,935 pseudowords modeled after real ambiguous nouns in WordNet 3.0."

        "However, constructing a pseudoword by merely combining a random set of unambiguous words selected on the basis of their falling in the same range of occurrence frequency (Schu?tze, 1992), or leveraging homophones and OCR ambiguities (Yarowsky, 1993), does not provide a suitable model of a real polysemous word (Gaustad, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2003).",
        "This is because in the real world different senses, unless they are homonymous, share some semantic or pragmatic relation.",
        "Therefore, random pseudowords will typically model only homonymous distinctions (such as the centimeter vs. curium senses of cm), while they will fall short of modeling systematic polysemy (such as the lack vs. insufficiency senses of deficiency)."

        "A computational lexicon such as WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) can be used as the basis for the automatic generation of semantically-aware pseudowords, an idea which was first proposed by Otrusina and Smrz (2010).",
        "WordNet can be viewed as a graph in which synsets act as nodes and the lexical and semantic relationships among them as edges.",
        "Given a sense, the approach looks into its surrounding synsets in the WordNet graph in order to find a related monosemous term that can represent that sense.",
        "As search space, the approach considers: the other literals in the same synset, the genus phrase from its textual definition, direct siblings, and direct hyponyms.",
        "If no monosemous candidate can be found, this space is further extended to hypernyms and meronyms.",
        "Hereafter, we term this approach as vicinity-based.",
        "For example, consider the generation process of the vicinity-based pseudoword corresponding to the term coke, which has three senses in WordNet 3.0.",
        "There exist multiple monosemous candidates for each sense: dozens of candidates (such as biomass and butane) in the direct siblings?",

        "Among these candidates Otrusina and Smrz (2010) select those whose occurrence frequency ratio in a given text corpus is most similar to that of the senses of the corresponding real word as given by a sense-annotated corpus.",
        "Clearly, a sufficiently large sense-tagged corpus is required for calculating the occurrence frequency of the individual senses of a word.",
        "This is a limitation of the vicinity-based approach.",
        "In addition, as we mentioned earlier, we need pseudowords that can enable the generation of large-scale pseudosense-tagged corpora.",
        "For this to be achieved, each pseudosense is required to occur with a relatively high frequency in a given text corpus.",
        "The vicinity-based approach can, however, identify at best only a few representatives for each pseudosense, thus undermining its ability to cover many ambiguous nouns.",
        "Table 1 shows the percentage of ambiguous nouns in WordNet that can be modeled using the vicinity-based approach when different minimum numbers of annotated sentences are requested, i.e. each pseudosense is required to occur in at least 0 (i.e., no minimum frequency restriction), 500, or 1000 unique sentences in the reference corpus (we use Gigaword (Graff and Cieri, 2003) in our experiments).",
        "In the Table, beside the overall coverage percentage, we present the coverage by degree of polysemy and for three different values of minimum pseudosense occurrence frequency.",
        "Even though the overall coverage is over 80% when no restriction on minimum frequency is considered (first row in the Table), this high coverage drops rapidly when we request some hundred sentences per sense.",
        "For instance, only 25% of the ambiguous nouns in WordNet can be modeled using this approach when a minimum frequency of 1000 noun occurrences is required (last row of Table 1), with most of the covered words having low polysemy (in fact about 93% of them are either 2 or 3-sense nouns).",
        "This severe limitation of the vicinity-based approach hinders a wide-coverage modeling of ambiguous nouns in WordNet, thus preventing it from being an option for the generation of a large-scale pseudosense-annotated dataset.",
        "With a view to addressing the above-mentioned issues and to enable wide coverage, in the next subsection we propose a flexible approach for the generation of semantically-aware pseudowords.",
        "The vicinity-based pseudoword generation approach works on local subgraphs of WordNet, considering mostly all those candidates which are in a direct relationship with a real sense si, and treating them as potentially good representatives of si.",
        "We propose an extension to this approach which exploits the WordNet semantic network in its entirety, hence enabling us to determine a graded degree of similarity between si and all the senses of all other words in WordNet.",
        "We chose a graph-based similarity measure for two reasons: firstly, it comes as a natural extension of the vicinity-based method, and, secondly, alternative context-based methods such as Lin's measure (Lin, 1998) have been shown to require a wide-coverage sense-tagged dataset in order to calculate similarities on a sense-by-sense basis for all words in the lexicon (Otrusina and Smrz, 2010).",
        "As our similarity measure we selected the Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002, PPR) algorithm.",
        "PPR basically computes the probability according to which a random walker at a specific node in a graph would visit an arbitrary node in the same graph.",

        "In addition to assessing the representativeness of pseudosenses, their degree of distinguishability has to be determined.",
        "In other words, we have to determine how easily each pseudosense can be distinguished from the others in a pseudoword.",
        "Our reason for having such an experiment is readily illustrated by way of an example: consider the similarity-based pseudoword philanthropist*benefactor4 corresponding to the noun donor5.",
        "Even though both pseudosenses are good representatives for their corresponding senses, the distinguishability of the two",
        "(scores range from 1 to 4 for representativeness and from 0 to 1 for distinguishability evaluation).",
        "real senses is not preserved in the pseudoword.",
        "For instance, benefactor is a suitable pseudosense for both senses of donor, whereas philanthropist cannot be used in the blood donation sense.",
        "Therefore we carried out another manual evaluation to test the efficacy of pseudowords in preserving the distinguishability of senses of real words.",
        "To this end, for each pseudoword Pw (from the same set of 110 sampled pseudowords used in Section 3.2) we presented its corresponding pseudosenses in random order to two annotators and asked them to associate each pseudosense with the most appropriate WordNet sense of the real word w. Then we calculated a distinguishability score for each polysemy degree by dividing the number of correct mappings by the total number of senses.",
        "For instance, for the similarity-based pseudoword corresponding to the word representative (shown in Table 6), we provided the shuffled list of pseudosenses [spokesperson, case in point, negotiator, congressman] to each annotator and asked them to sort the list according to the WordNet sense inventory of representative (i.e., map each pseudosense to its most suitable real sense).",
        "Both annotators correctly mapped all pseudosenses of this pseudoword; hence, the distinguishability score given by each annotator for this pseudoword was 4/4 = 1.",
        "The average distinguishability scores for each degree of polysemy, as well as the overall score, is shown in Table 7 (second row).",
        "Each value is an average of the scores obtained from the two annotators.",
        "It can be seen that the distinguishability score decreases for higher degrees of polysemy.",
        "The score, however, remains above 0.70 with highly-polysemous pseudowords.",
        "The overall score of 0.79 shows that similarity-based pseudowords effectively preserve the distinguishability of senses of their real counterparts.",
        "In other words, they do not tend to have over-generalized pseudosenses which cover more than one sense."

        "The idea of pseudowords dates back to 1992, when it was first proposed as a means of generating large amounts of artificially annotated evaluation data for WSD algorithms (Gale et al., 1992; Schu?tze, 1992).",
        "However, as mentioned earlier in Section 2, constructing a pseudoword by combining a random set of unambiguous words, as was done in these early works, can not model systematic polysemy (Gaus-tad, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2003), since different senses of a real ambiguous word, unless it is homonymous, share some semantic or pragmatic relation.",
        "Several researchers addressed the issue of producing semantically-aware pseudowords that can model semantic relationships between senses.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2003) used lexical category membership from a medical term hierarchy (extracted from MeSH6 (Medical Subject Headings)) to create ?more plausibly-motivated?",
        "pseudowords.",
        "By considering the frequency distributions from lexical category co-occurrence, they produced a set of pseudowords which were closer to real ambiguous words in terms of disambiguation difficulty than random pseudowords.",
        "However, this approach requires a specific hierarchical lexicon and falls short of creating many pseudowords with high polysemy (the authors report generating pseudowords with two senses only).",
        "More recent work has focused on the identification of monosemous representatives in the surrounding of a sense, i.e., selected among concepts directly related to the given sense.",
        "Lu et al. (2006) modeled senses of a real ambiguous word by picking out the most similar monosemous morpheme from a Chinese hierarchical lexicon.",
        "Pseudowords are then constructed by conflating these morphemes accordingly.",
        "However, this method leverages a specific Chinese hierarchical lexicon, in which different lev",
        "els of the hierarchy correspond to different levels of sense granularity.",
        "A more flexible technique is proposed by Otrusina and Smrz (2010) who model ambiguous words in WordNet.",
        "Their vicinity-based approach searches the surroundings of each particular sense in the WordNet graph in order to find an unambiguous representative for that sense.",
        "However, as we described in Section 2.1.1, while the approach addresses the semantic awareness issue, it falls short of providing a high coverage, an issue which we tackle in our novel similarity-based approach."

        "In this paper we proposed a new technique for the generation of pseudowords which, in contrast to existing work, can simultaneously tackle the two major issues associated with pseudowords, i.e., semantic awareness and coverage.",
        "Our approach can be used to model any given ambiguous noun in WordNet, hence enabling the generation of large-scale pseudosense-annotated datasets for thousands of pseudowords.",
        "We performed three experiments to evaluate the reliability of our pseudowords.",
        "We showed that the similarity-based pseudowords are highly correlated with their real counterparts in terms of disambiguation difficulty.",
        "Further evaluations demonstrated that this approach is able to provide a good semantic modeling of individual senses of real words while preserving their distinguishability.",
        "We are releasing to the research community the entire set of 15,935 pseudowords, i.e., for all WordNet polysemous nouns (http://lcl.",
        "uniroma1.it/pseudowords/).",
        "This set of pseudowords (together with the English Gigaword corpus) can be used to generate a large pseudosense-tagged dataset containing ?1000 annotated sentences for every sense of all the pseudowords modeled after real ambiguous nouns in WordNet.",
        "The resulting dataset could be a good complement for MASC (Ide et al., 2010) which, being human-created, can provide 1000 sense-annotated sentences for just a few words.",
        "We hope that the availability of this resource will enable large-scale experiments in tasks such as semantic role labeling, semantic parsing, and Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "Specifically, as future work, we plan to utilize the generated pseudosense-tagged dataset to perform an in-depth study of different WSD paradigms.",
