        "However, some turkers try to maximize their pay by supplying quick answers that have nothing to do with the correct label.",

        "publications/licensed-sw/mace/index.html this type of annotator as a spammer.",
        "In order to mitigate the effect of spammers, researchers typically collect multiple annotations of the same instance so that they can, later, use de-noising methods to infer the best label.",
        "The simplest approach is majority voting, which weights all answers equally.",
        "Unfortunately, it is easy for majority voting to go wrong.",
        "A common and simple spammer strategy for categorical labeling tasks is to always choose the same (often the first) label.",
        "When multiple spammers follow this strategy, the majority can be incorrect.",
        "While this specific scenario might seem simple to correct for (remove annotators that always produce the same label), the situation grows more tricky when spammers do not annotate consistently, but instead choose labels at random.",
        "A more sophisticated approach than simple majority voting is required.",
        "If we knew whom to trust, and when, we could reconstruct the correct labels.",
        "Yet, the only way to be sure we know whom to trust is if we knew the correct labels ahead of time.",
        "To address this circular problem, we build a generative model of the annotation process that treats the correct labels as latent variables.",
        "We then use unsupervised learning to estimate parameters directly from redundant annotations.",
        "This is a common approach in the class of unsupervised models called item-response models (Dawid and Skene, 1979; Whitehill et al., 2009; Carpenter, 2008; Raykar and Yu, 2012).",
        "While such models have been implemented in other fields (e.g., vision), we are not aware of their availability for NLP tasks (see also Section 6).",

        "It does not require any annotated instances, but is capable of including varying levels of supervision via token constraints (Section 5.2).",
        "We consistently outperform majority voting, and achieve performance equal to that of more complex state-of-the-art models.",
        "Additionally, we find that thresholding based on the posterior label entropy can be used to trade off coverage for accuracy in label reconstruction, giving considerable gains (Section 5.1).",

        "We note that majority voting results level or even drop when going from an odd to an even number.",
        "In these cases, the new annotator does not improve accuracy if it goes with the previous majority (i.e., going from 3:2 to 4:2), but can force an error when going against the previous majority (i.e., from 3:2 to 3:3), by creating a tie.",
        "MACE-EM and MACE-VB dominate majority voting for RTE and Temporal.",
        "For WSD, the picture is less clear, where majority voting dominates when there are fewer annotators.",
        "Note that the differences are minute, though (within 1 percentage point).",
        "For very small pool sizes (< 3), MACE-VB outperforms both other methods.",
        "Amount of Supervision So far, we have treated the task as completely unsupervised.",
        "MACE does not require any expert annotations in order to achieve high accuracy.",
        "However, we often have annotations for some of the items.",
        "These annotated data points are usually used as control items (by removing annotators that answer them incorrectly).",
        "If such annotated data is available, we would like to make use of it.",
        "We include an option that lets users supply annotations for some of the items, and use this information as token constraints in the E-step of training.",
        "In those cases, the model does not need to estimate the correct value, but only has to adjust the trust parameter.",
        "This leads to improved performance.3 We explore for RTE and Temporal how performance changes when we vary the amount of supervision in increments of 5%.4 We average over 10 runs for each value of n, each time supplying annotations for a random set of n items.",
        "The baseline uses the annotated label whenever supplied, otherwise the majority vote, with ties split at random.",
        "improve with additional supervision, ultimately reaching perfect accuracy.",
        "However, MACE uses the information more effectively, resulting in higher accuracy for a given amount of supervision.",
        "This gain is more pronounced when only little supervision is available."

        "Snow et al. (2008) and Sorokin and Forsyth (2008) showed that Amazon's MechanicalTurk use in providing non-expert annotations for NLP tasks.",
        "Various models have been proposed for predicting correct annotations from noisy non-expert annotations and for estimating annotator trustworthiness.",
        "These models divide naturally into two categories: those that use expert annotations for supervised learning (Snow et al., 2008; Bian et al., 2009), and completely unsupervised ones.",
        "Our method falls into the latter category because it learns from the redundant non-expert annotations themselves, and makes no use of expertly annotated data.",
        "Most previous work on unsupervised models belongs to a class called ?Item-response models?, used in psychometrics.",
        "The approaches differ with respect to which aspect of the annotation process",

        "MACE uses supervision more efficiently.",
        "they choose to focus on, and the type of annotation task they model.",
        "For example, many methods explicitly model annotator bias in addition to annotator competence (Dawid and Skene, 1979; Smyth et al., 1995).",
        "Our work models annotator bias, but only when the annotator is suspected to be spamming.",
        "Other methods focus modeling power on instance difficulty to learn not only which annotators are good, but which instances are hard (Carpenter, 2008; Whitehill et al., 2009).",
        "In machine vision, several models have taken this further by parameter-izing difficulty in terms of complex features defined on each pairing of annotator and annotation instance (Welinder et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010).",
        "While such features prove very useful in vision, they are more difficult to define for the categorical problems common to NLP.",
        "In addition, several methods are specifically tailored to annotation tasks that involve ranking (Steyvers et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011), which limits their applicability in NLP.",
        "The method of Raykar and Yu (2012) is most similar to ours.",
        "Their goal is to identify and filter out annotators whose annotations are not correlated with the gold label.",
        "They define a function of the learned parameters that is useful for identifying these spammers, and then use this function to build a prior.",
        "In contrast, we use simple priors, but incorporate a model parameter that explicitly represents the probability that an annotator is spamming.",
        "Our simple model achieves the same accuracy on gold label predictions as theirs."

        "We provide a Java-based implementation, MACE, that recovers correct labels with high accuracy, and reliably identifies trustworthy annotators.",
