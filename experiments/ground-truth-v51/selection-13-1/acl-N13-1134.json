        "In the course of the last two decades, significant progress has been made with regard to the automatic extraction of lexical semantic knowledge from large-scale text corpora.",
        "Most work relies on the distributional hypothesis of meaning (Harris, 1954), which states that words that appear within the same contexts tend to be semantically similar.",
        "A large number of researchers have taken this dictum to heart, giving rise to a plethora of algorithms that try to capture the semantics of words by looking at their distribution in text.",
        "Up till now, however, most work on the automatic acquisition of semantics only deals with individual words.",
        "The modeling of meaning beyond the level of individual words ?",
        "i.e. the combination of words into larger units ?",
        "is to a large degree left unexplored.",
        "The principle of compositionality, often attributed to Frege, is the principle that states that the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the way those parts are (syntactically) combined (Frege, 1892).",
        "It is the fundamental principle that allows language users to understand the meaning of sentences they have never heard before, by constructing the meaning of the complex expression from the meanings of the individual words.",
        "Recently, a number of researchers have tried to reconcile the framework of distributional semantics with the principle of compositionality (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2012).",
        "However, the absolute gains of the systems remain a bit unclear, and a simple method of composition ?",
        "vector multiplication ?",
        "often seems to produce the best results (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we present a novel method for the joint composition of a verb with its subject and direct object.",
        "The key idea is that compositionality is modeled as a multi-way interaction between latent factors, which are automatically constructed from corpus data.",
        "In order to adequately model the multi-way interaction between a verb and its subject and objects, a significant part of our method relies on tensor algebra.",
        "Additionally, our method makes use of a factorization model appropriate for tensors.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we give an overview of previous work that is relevant to the task of computing compositionality within a distributional framework.",

        "In recent years, a number of methods have been developed that try to capture compositional phenomena within a distributional framework.",
        "One of the first approaches to tackle compositional phenomena in a systematic way is Mitchell and Lapata's (2008) approach.",
        "They explore a number of different models for vector composition, of which vector addition (the sum of each feature) and vector multiplication (the elementwise multiplication of each feature) are the most important.",
        "They evaluate their models on a noun-verb phrase similarity task, and find that the multiplicative model yields the best results, along with a weighted combination of the additive and multiplicative model.",
        "Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) present a method for the composition of adjectives and nouns.",
        "In their model, an adjective is a linear function of one vector (the noun vector) to another vector (the vector for the adjective-noun pair).",
        "The linear transformation for a particular adjective is represented by a matrix, and is learned automatically from a corpus, using partial least-squares regression.",
        "Coecke et al. (2010) present an abstract theoretical framework in which a sentence vector is a function of the Kronecker product of its word vectors, which allows for greater interaction between the different word features.",
        "A number of instantiations of the framework are tested experimentally in Grefen-stette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) and Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011b).",
        "The key idea is that relational words (e.g. adjectives or verbs) have a rich (multidimensional) structure that acts as a filter on their arguments.",
        "Our model uses an intuition similar to theirs.",
        "Socher et al. (2012) present a model for compositionality based on recursive neural networks.",
        "Each node in a parse tree is assigned both a vector and a matrix; the vector captures the actual meaning of the constituent, while the matrix models the way it changes the meaning of neighbouring words and phrases.",
        "Closely related to the work on compositionality is research on the computation of word meaning in context.",
        "Erk and Pado?",
        "(2008, 2009) make use of selectional preferences to express the meaning of a word in context; the meaning of a word in the presence of an argument is computed by multiplying the word's vector with a vector that captures the inverse selectional preferences of the argument.",
        "Thater et al.",
        "(2009, 2010) extend the approach based on selectional preferences by incorporating second-order co-occurrences in their model.",
        "And Dinu and Lapata (2010) propose a probabilistic framework that models the meaning of words as a probability distribution over latent factors.",
        "This allows them to model contextualized meaning as a change in the original sense distribution.",
        "Dinu and Lapata use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to induce latent factors.",
        "Similar to their work, our model uses NMF ?",
        "albeit in a slightly different configuration ?",
        "as a first step towards our final factorization model.",
        "In general, latent models have proven to be useful for the modeling of word meaning.",
        "One of the best known latent models of semantics is Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), which uses singular value decomposition in order to automatically induce latent factors from term-document matrices.",
        "Another well known latent model of meaning, which takes a generative approach, is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Tensor factorization has been used before for the modeling of natural language.",

        "Our underlying tensor factorization ?",
        "Tucker decomposition ?",
        "is the same as Giesbrecht?s; and similar to Van de Cruys (2010), we construct a latent model of verb, subject, and object interactions.",
        "The way our model is constructed, however, is significantly different.",
        "The former research does not use any syntactic information for the construction of the tensor, while the latter makes use of a more restricted tensor factorization model, viz. parallel factor analysis (Harshman and Lundy, 1994).",
        "The idea of modeling compositionality by means of tensor (Kronecker) product has been proposed in the literature before (Clark and Pulman, 2007; Coecke et al., 2010).",
        "However, the method presented here is the first that tries to capture compositional phenomena by exploiting the multi-way interactions between latent factors, induced by a suitable tensor factorization model."

        "First, we compute a latent factor model for nouns from standard co-occurrence data.",

        "Our model has been evaluated on a similarity task for transitive phrases, in which it matches and even exceeds the state of the art.",
        "We conclude with a number of future work issues.",
        "First of all, we would like to extend our framework in order to incorporate more compositional phenomena.",
        "Our current model is designed to deal with the latent modeling of subject verb object combinations.",
        "We would like to investigate how other compositional phenomena might fit within our latent interaction framework, and how our model is able to tackle the computation of compositionality across a differing number of modes.",
        "Secondly, we would like to further explore the possibilities of our model in which all three modes are represented by latent factors.",
        "The instantiation of our model presented in this paper has two latent modes, using the original instances of the verb mode in order to efficiently compute verb similarity.",
        "We think a full-blown latent interaction model might prove to have interesting applications in a number of NLP tasks, such as the paraphrasing of compositional expressions.",
        "Finally, we would like to test our method using a number of different evaluation frameworks.",
        "We think tasks of similarity judgement have their merits, but in a way are also somewhat limited.",
        "In our opinion, research on the modeling of compositional phenomena within a distributional framework would substantially",
        "benefit from new evaluation frameworks.",
        "In particular, we think of a lexical substitution or paraphrasing task along the lines of McCarthy and Navigli (2009), but specifically aimed at the assessment of compositional phenomena."
