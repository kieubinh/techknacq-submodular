        "People report the events they are experiencing or publish comments on a wide variety of events happening around the world, ranging from the unexpected natural disasters, regional riots, to many scheduled events, such as sports games, political debates, local festivals, and even academic conferences.",
        "The Twitter data streams thus cover a broad range of events and broadcast these information in a live manner.",
        "Event summarization in this paper aims to generate a representative and concise textual description of the scheduled events that are being lively reported on Twitter, providing people with an alternative means of observing the world beyond the traditional journalism.",
        "Specifically, we investigate scheduled events of different types, including six of the NBA (National Basketball Association) sports games and a representative conference event, namely the Apple CEO's keynote speech in the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2012)1.",
        "All these events have excited great discussion among the Twitter community.",
        "Summarizing the Twitter event is a challenging task that has yet been fully explored in the past.",
        "Most previous summarization studies focus on the well-formatted news documents, as driven by the annual DUC2 and TAC3 evaluations.",
        "In contrast, the Twitter messages (a.k.a., tweets) are very short and noisy, containing nonstandard terms such as abbreviations, acronyms, emoticons, etc.",
        "(Liu et al., 2011b; Liu et al., 2012; Eisenstein, 2013).",
        "The noisy contents also cause great difficulties to the traditional NLP tools such as NER and dependency parser (Ritter et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2011), limiting the possibility of applying finer-grained event analysis tools.",
        "In nature, the event tweets are closely associated with the timeline and are drastically different from a static collection of news documents.",
        "The tweets converge into text streams that pulse along the timeline and cluster around the important moments or sub-events.",
        "These ?sub-events?",
        "are of crucial importance since they represent a surge of interest from the Twitter audience and the correspond",
        "ticipant stream (lower).",
        "Event stream contains tweets related to an NBA basketball game (Spurs vs Thunder) scheduled on May 31, 2012; participant stream contains tweets corresponding to the player Russell Westbrook in team Thunder.",
        "X-axis denotes the timeline and y-axis represents the number of tweets per 10-second interval.",
        "ing key information must be reflected in the event summary.",
        "As such, event summarization research has been focusing on developing accurate sub-event detection systems and generating text descriptions that can best summarize the sub-events in a progressive manner (Chakrabarti and Punera, 2011; Nichols et al., 2012; Zubiaga et al., 2012).",
        "In Figure 1, we show an example Twitter event stream and one of its ?participant?",
        "streams.",
        "The event stream contains all the tweets related to an NBA basketball game Spurs vs Thunder; while the participant stream contains only tweets corresponding to the player Russell Westbrook in this game.",
        "Previous research on event summarization focuses on identifying the important moments from the coarse-level event stream.",
        "This may yield several side effects: first, the spike patterns are not clearly identifiable from the overall event stream, though they are more clearly seen if we ?zoom-in?",
        "to the participant level; second, it is arguable whether the important sub-events can be accurately detected based solely on the tweet volume change; third, a popular participant or sub-event can elicit huge volume of tweets which dominant the event discussion and shield less prominent sub-events.",
        "For example, in the NBA games, discussions about the key players (e.g., ?LeBron James?, ?Kobe Bryant?)",
        "can heavily shadow other important participants or sub-events, resulting in an event summary with repetitive descriptions about the dominant players.",
        "In this work, we propose a novel participant-based event summarization approach, which dynamically identifies the participants from data streams, then ?zooms-in?",
        "the event stream to participant level, detects the important sub-events related to each participant using a novel time-content mixture model, and generates the event summary progressively by concatenating the descriptions of the important sub-events.",
        "Results show that the mixture model-based sub-event detection approach can efficiently incorporate the ?burstiness?",
        "and ?cohesiveness?",
        "of the participant streams, and the participant-based event summarization can effectively capture the sub-events that have otherwise been shadowed by the long-tail of other dominant sub-events, yielding summaries with considerably better coverage than the state-of-the-art approach."
