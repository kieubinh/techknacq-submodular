        "TMTprime is a recommender system that facilitates the effective use of both translation memory (TM) and machine translation (MT) technology within industrial language service providers (LSPs) localization work-flows.",

        "Recent research shows how MT systems can be combined with TMs in Computer Aided Translation (CAT) systems, selecting either TM or MT output based on sophisticated translation quality estimation without access to a reference.",
        "However, to date there are no commercially available frameworks for this.",
        "TMTprime takes confidence estimation out of the lab and provides a commercially viable platform that allows for the seamless integration of MT with legacy TM systems to provide the most effective (least effort/cost) translation options to human translators, based on the TMTprime confidence score."

        "When high-quality MT output is available, translators see significant productivity gains over translation from scratch, but poor MT quality leads to frustration and wasted time as suggested translations are discarded in favour of providing a translation from scratch.",
        "We present a commercially-relevant software platform providing a translation confidence estimation metric and, based on this, a mechanism for effectively integrating MT with TMs in localisation workflows.",
        "The confidence metric ensures that only ?Author did this work during his post doctoral research at CNGL.",
        "those MT outputs that are guaranteed to require less post-editing effort than the best corresponding TM match are presented to the post-editor (He et al., 2010a).",
        "The MT is integrated seamlessly, and established localisation cost estimation models based on TM technologies still apply as upper bounds."

        "Typically the costs for post-editing those translations which have a lower-error rate (i.e. fewer errors) is less than the cost for post-editing translations which have a greater number of errors, as they are of lower quality.",
        "The user is requested to upload a file for translation to the system.",
        "Once the user has selected their desired options, the TMTprime platform provides various analysis measures based on its recommendation engine, such as how many segments from the input file are recommended for translation by the various selected translation engines or TMs available.",
        "Based on the input costs, it provides a visualisation of overall estimated cost of either using an individual translation system on its own, or using the recommender selecting the best performing system on a segment-by-segment basis.",

        "This estimated cost includes both the cost for translation (currently uniform cost for each translation system) and the cost required for post-editing.",
        "For example, if the MT is an in-house system the cost of translation will be (close to) zero whereas there is potentially an additional base cost for using an external MT engine.",
