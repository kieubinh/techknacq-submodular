        "Modern statistical machine translation approaches can be roughly divided into two broad categories: phrase-based and syntax-based.",
        "Phrase-based approaches treat phrase, which is usually a sequence of consecutive words, as the basic unit of translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "As phrases are capable of memorizing local context, phrase-based approaches excel at handling local word selection and reordering.",
        "In addition, it is straightforward to integrate n-gram language models into phrase-based decoders in which translation always grows left-to-right.",
        "As a result, phrase-based decoders only need to maintain the boundary words on one end to calculate language model probabilities.",
        "However, as phrase-based decoding usually casts translation as a string concatenation problem and permits arbitrary permutation, it proves to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999).",
        "Syntax-based approaches, on the other hand, model the hierarchical structure of natural languages (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "As syntactic information can be exploited to provide linguistically-motivated reordering rules, predicting non-local permutation is computationally tractable in syntax-based approaches.",
        "Unfortunately, as syntax-based decoders often generate target-language words in a bottom-up way using the CKY algorithm, integrating n-gram language models becomes more expensive because they have to maintain target boundary words at both ends of a partial translation (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007).",
        "Moreover, syntax-based approaches often suffer from the rule coverage problem since syntactic constraints rule out a large portion of non-syntactic phrase pairs, which might help decoders generalize well to unseen data (Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, the introduction of non-terminals makes the grammar size significantly bigger than phrase tables and leads to higher memory requirement (Chiang, 2007).",
        "As a result, incremental decoding with hierarchical structures has attracted increasing attention in recent years.",
        "While some authors try to integrate syntax into phrase-based decoding (Galley and Manning, 2008; Galley and Manning, 2009; Feng et al., 2010), others develop incremental algorithms for syntax-based models (Watanabe et al., 2006; Huang and Mi, 2010; Dyer and Resnik, 2010; Feng et al., 2012).",
        "Despite these successful efforts, challenges still remain for both directions.",
        "While parsing algorithms can be used to parse partial translations in phrase-based decoding, the search space is significantly enlarged since there are exponentially many parse trees for exponentially many translations.",
        "On the other hand, although target words can be generated left-to-right by altering the way of tree transversal in syntax-based models, it is still difficult to reach full rule coverage as compared with phrase table.",
        "zongtong jiang yu siyue lai lundun fangwen The President will visit London in April source phrase target phrase dependency category",
        "tree, and the word alignment between them.",
        "Each translation rule is composed of a source phrase, a target phrase with a set of dependency arcs.",
        "Following Shen et al. (2008), we distinguish between fixed, floating, and ill-formed structures.",
        "In this paper, we propose a shift-reduce parsing algorithm for phrase-based string-to-dependency translation.",
        "The basic unit of translation in our model is string-to-dependency phrase pair, which consists of a phrase on the source side and a dependency structure on the target side.",
        "The algorithm generates well-formed dependency structures for partial translations left-to-right using string-to-dependency phrase pairs.",
        "Therefore, our approach is capable of combining the advantages of both phrase-based and syntax-based approaches: 1. compact rule table: our rule table is a subset of the original string-to-dependency grammar (Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010) by excluding rules with non-terminals.",
        "2. full rule coverage: all phrase pairs, both syntactic and non-syntactic, can be used in our algorithm.",
        "This is the same with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "3. efficient integration of n-gram language model: as translation grows left-to-right in our algorithm, integrating n-gram language models is straightforward.",
        "4. exploiting syntactic information: as the shift-reduce parsing algorithm generates target language dependency trees in decoding, dependency language models (Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010) can be used to encourage linguistically-motivated reordering.",
        "5. resolving local parsing ambiguity: as dependency trees for phrases are memorized in rules, our approach avoids resolving local parsing ambiguity and explores in a smaller search space than parsing word-by-word on the fly in decoding (Galley and Manning, 2009).",
        "We evaluate our method on the NIST Chinese-English translation datasets.",
        "Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2007) and string-to-dependency approaches (Shen et al., 2008) in terms of BLEU and TER."

        "One possible reason is that our decoder organizes stacks with respect to actions, whereas Moses groups partial translations with the same number of covered source words in stacks.",
        "In the second pass, our decoder reranks the hypergraph with additional dependency features.",
        "We find that adding dependency language and maximum entropy shift-reduce models consistently brings significant improvements, both separately and jointly.",
        "We analyzed translation rules extracted from the training data.",
        "Among them, well-formed structures account for 43.58% (fixed 33.21%, floating left 9.01%, and floating right 1.36%) and ill-formed structures 56.42%.",
        "As shown in Table 4, using all rules clearly outperforms using only well-formed structures.",
        "Figure 5 shows the performance of Moses and our system with various distortion limits on the development set.",
        "Our system consistently outperforms Moses in all cases, suggesting that adding dependency helps improve phrase reordering."

        "The work of Galley and Manning (2009) is closest in spirit to ours.",
        "They introduce maximum spanning tree (MST) parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) into phrase-based translation.",
        "The system is phrase-based except that an MST parser runs to parse partial translations at the same time.",
        "One challenge is that MST parsing itself is not incremental, making it expensive to identify loops during hypothesis expansion.",
        "On the contrary, shift-reduce parsing is naturally incremental and can be seamlessly integrated into left-to-right phrase-based decoding.",
        "More importantly, in our work dependency trees are memorized for phrases rather than being generated word by word on the fly in decoding.",
        "This treatment might not only reduce decoding complexity but also potentially revolve local parsing ambiguity.",
        "Our decoding algorithm is similar to Gimpel and Smith (2011)'s lattice parsing algorithm as we divide decoding into two steps: hypergraph generation and hypergraph rescoring.",
        "The major difference is that our hypergraph is not a phrasal lattice because each phrase pair is associated with a dependency structure on the target side.",
        "In other words, our second pass is to find the Viterbi derivation with addition features rather than parsing the phrasal lattice.",
        "In addition, their algorithm produces phrasal dependency parse trees while the leaves of our dependency trees are words, making dependency language models can be directly used.",
        "Shift-reduce parsing has been successfully used in phrase-based decoding but limited to adding structural constraints.",
        "Galley and Manning (2008) propose a shift-reduce algorithm to integrate a hierarchical reordering model into phrase-based systems.",
        "Feng et al. (2010) use shift-reduce parsing to impose ITG (Wu, 1997) constraints on phrase permutation.",
        "Our work differs from theirs by going further to incorporate linguistic syntax into phrase-based decoding.",
        "Along another line, a number of authors have developed incremental algorithms for syntax-based models (Watanabe et al., 2006; Huang and Mi, 2010; Dyer and Resnik, 2010; Feng et al., 2012).",
        "Watanabe et al. (2006) introduce an Early-style top-down parser based on binary-branching Greibach Normal Form.",
        "Huang et al. (2010), Dyer",
        "and Resnik (2010), and Feng et al. (2012) use dotted rules to change the tree transversal to generate target words left-to-right, either top-down or bottom-up."

      "text": [
        "We have presented a shift-reduce parsing algorithm for phrase-based string-to-dependency translation.",
        "The algorithm generates dependency structures incrementally using string-to-dependency phrase pairs.",
        "Therefore, our approach is capable of combining the advantages of both phrase-based and string-to-dependency models, it outperforms the two baselines on Chinese-to-English translation.",
        "In the future, we plan to include more contextual information (e.g., the uncovered source phrases) in the maximum entropy model to resolve conflicts.",
        "Another direction is to adapt the dynamic programming algorithm proposed by Huang and Sagae (2010) to improve our string-to-dependency decoder.",
        "It is also interesting to compare with applying word-based shift-reduce parsing to phrase-based decoding similar to (Galley and Manning, 2009)."
