        "As a common drawback of the staged architecture, errors in upstream component are often compounded and propagated to the downstream classifiers.",
        "The downstream components, however, cannot impact earlier decisions.",

        "However, knowing that ?tank?",
        "is very likely to be an Instrument argument of Attack events, the correct event subtype assignment of ?fired?",
        "is obviously Attack.",
        "Likewise, in sentence (2), ?air defense chief?",
        "is a job title, hence the argument classifier is likely to label it as an Entity argument for End-Position trigger.",
        "In addition, the local classifiers are incapable of capturing interdependencies among multiple event triggers and arguments.",
        "Consider sentence (1) again.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the corresponding event triggers and arguments.",
        "The dependency between ?fired?",
        "and ?died?",
        "cannot be captured by the local classifiers, which may fail to attach ?cameraman?",

        "By using global features, we can propagate the Victim argument of the Die event to the Target argument of the Attack event.",
        "As another example, knowing that an Attack event usually only has one Attacker argument, we could penalize assignments in which one trigger has more than one Attacker.",
        "Such global features cannot be easily exploited by a local classifier.",
        "Therefore, we take a fresh look at this problem and formulate it, for the first time, as a structured learning problem.",
        "We propose a novel joint event extraction algorithm to predict the triggers and arguments simultaneously, and use the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002) to train the joint model.",
