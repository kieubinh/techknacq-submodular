        "Quantitative social science research has experienced a recent expansion, out of controlled settings and into natural environments.",
        "With this influx of interest comes new methodology, and the inevitable question arises of how to move towards testable hypotheses, using these uncontrolled sources of data as scientific lenses into the real world.",
        "The study of conversational transcripts is a key domain in this new frontier.",
        "There are certain social and behavioral phenomena in conversation that cannot be easily identified through questionnaire data, self-reported surveys, or easily extracted user metadata.",
        "Examples of these social phenomena in conversation include overt displays of power (Prabhakaran et al., 2012) or indicators of rapport and relationship building (Wang et al., 2012).",
        "Manually annotating these social phenomena cannot scale to large data, so researchers turn to automated annotation of transcripts (Rose?",
        "et al, 2008).",
        "While machine learning is highly effective for annotation tasks with relatively balanced labels, such as sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), more complex social functions are often rarer.",
        "This leads to unbalanced class label distributions and a much more difficult machine learning task.",
        "Moreover, features indicative of rare social annotations tend to be drowned out in favor of features biased towards the majority class.",
        "The net effect is that classification algorithms tend to bias towards the majority class, giving low accuracy for rare class detection.",
        "Automated annotation of social phenomena also brings opportunities for real-world applications.",
        "For example, real-time annotation of conversation can power adaptive intervention in collaborative learning settings (Rummel et al., 2008; Adamson and Rose?, 2012).",
        "However, with the considerable power of automation comes great responsibility.",
        "It is critical to avoid intervening in the case of erroneous annotations, as providing unnecessary or inappropriate support in such a setting has been shown to be harmful to group performance and social cohesion (Dillenbourg, 2002; Stahl, 2012).",
        "We propose adaptations to existing machine learning algorithms which improve recognition of rare annotations in conversational text data.",
        "Our primary contribution comes in the form of within-instance content selection.",
        "We develop a novel algorithm based on textual cues, suppressing information which is likely to be irrelevant to an instance's class label.",
        "This allows features which predict minority classes to gain prominence, helping to sidestep the frequency of common features pointing to a majority class label.",
        "Additionally, we propose modifications to existing algorithms.",
        "First, we identify a new application of logistic model trees to text data.",
        "Next,",
        "we define a modification of confidence-based ensemble voting which encourages minority class la-beling.",
        "Using these techniques, we demonstrate a significant improvement in classifier performance when recognizing the language of empowerment in support group chatrooms, a critical application area for researchers studying conversational interactions in healthcare (Uden-Kraan et al., 2009).",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "We introduce the domain of empowerment in support contexts, along with previous studies on the challenges that these annotations (and similar others) bring to machine learning.",
        "We introduce our new technique for improving the ability to automate this annotation, along with other optimizations to the machine learning workflow which are tailored to this skewed class balance.",
        "We present experimental results showing that our method is effective, and provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of our model and the features it uses most.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of particularly useful applications of this work."

        "We ground this paper's discussion of machine learning with a real problem, turning to the annotation of empowerment language in chat1.",
        "The concept of empowerment, while a prolific area of research, lacks a broad definition across professionals, but broadly relates to ?the power to act efficaciously to bring about desired results?",
        "(Boehm and Staples, 2002) and ?experiencing personal growth as a result of developing skills and abilities along with a more positive self-definition?",
        "(Staples, 1990).",
        "Participants in online support groups feel increased empowerment (Uden-Kraan et al., 2009; Barak et al., 2008).",
        "Quantitative studies have shown the effect of empowerment through statistical methods such as structural equation modeling (Vauth et al., 2007), as have qualitative methods such as deductive transcript analysis (Owen et al., 2008) and interview studies (Wahlin et al., 2006).",
        "The transition between these styles of research has been gradual.",
        "Pioneering work has demonstrated the ability to distinguish empowerment language in written texts, including prompted writing samples (Pennebaker and Seagal, 1999), nar",
        "ratives in online forums (Hoybye et al., 2005), and some preliminary analysis of synchronous discussion (Ogura et al., 2008; Mayfield et al., 2012b).",
        "These transitional works have used limited analysis methodology; in the absence of sophisticated natural language processing, their conclusions often rely on coarse measures, such as word counts and proportions of annotations in a text.",
        "Users, of course, do not express empowerment in every thread in which they participate, which leads to a challenge for machine learning.",
        "Threads often focus on a single user's experiences, in which most participants in a chat are merely commentators, if they participate at all, matching previous research on shifts in speaker salience over time (Hassan et al., 2008).",
        "This leads to many user threads which are annotated as not applicable (N/A).",
        "We move to our proposed approach with these skewed distributions in mind."

        "Our data consists of a set of chatroom conversation transcripts from the Cancer Support Community2.",
        "Each 90-minute conversation took place in the context of a weekly meeting in a real-time chat, with up to 6 participants in addition to a professional therapist facilitating the discussion.",
        "In total, 2,206 conversations were collected from 2007- 2011.",
        "This data offers potentially rich insight into coping and social support; however, annotating such a dataset by hand would be prohibitively expensive, even when it is already transcribed.",
        "Twenty-one of these conversations have been annotated, as originally described and analyzed in (Mayfield et al., 2012b)3.",
        "This data was disentangled into threads based on common themes or topics, as in prior work (Elsner and Charniak,",
        "used for classification in this paper (right), with example annotations for self-empowerment indicated.",
        "2010; Adams and Martel, 2010).",
        "A novel peruser, per-thread annotation was then employed for empowerment annotation, following a coding manual based on definitions like those in Section 2.",
        "Each user was assigned a label of positive or negative empowerment if they exhibited such emotions, or was left blank if they did not do so within the context of that thread.",
        "This annotation was performed both for their self-empowerment as well as their attitude towards others?",
        "situations (other-empowerment).",
        "An example of this annotation for self-empowerment is presented in Figure 1 and the distribution of labels is given in Table 1.",
        "Most previous annotation tasks attempt to annotate on a per-utterance basis, such as dialogue act tagging (Popescu-Belis, 2008), or on arbitrary spans of text, such as in the MPQA subjectivity corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "However, for our task, a per-user, per-thread annotation is more appropriate, because empowerment is often indicated best through narrative (Hoybye et al., 2005).",
        "Human annotators are instructed to take this context into account when annotating (Mayfield et al., 2012b).",
        "It would therefore be nonsensical to annotate individual lines as ?embodying?",
        "empowerment.",
        "Similar arguments have been made for sentiment, especially as the field moves towards aspect-oriented sentiment (Breck et al., 2007).",
        "Assigning labels based on thread boundaries allows for context to be meaningfully taken into account, without crossing topic boundaries.",
        "However, this granularity comes with a price: the distribution of class values in these instances is highly skewed.",
        "In our data, the vast majority of users?",
        "threads are marked as not applicable to empowerment.",
        "Perhaps more inconveniently, while taking context into account is important for reliable annotation, it leads to extraneous information in many cases.",
        "Many threads can have multiple lines of contributions that are topically related to an expression of empowerment (and thus belong in the same thread), but which do not indicate any empowerment themselves.",
        "This exacerbates the likelihood of instances being classified as N/A.",
        "We choose to take advantage of these attributes of threads.",
        "We know from research in discourse analysis that many sections of conversations are formulaic and rote, like introductions and greetings (Schegloff, 1968).",
        "We additionally know that polarity often shifts in dialogue through the use of discourse connectives such as conjunctions and transitional phrases.",
        "These issues have been addressed in work in the language technologies community, most notably through the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008); however, their applications to noisier synchronous conversation has beenrare in computational linguistics.",
        "With these linguistic insights in mind, we examine how we can make best use of them for machine learning performance.",
        "While techniques for predicting rare events (Weiss and Hirsh, 1998) and compensating for class imbalance (Frank and",
        "Bouckaert, 2006), these approaches generally focus on statistical properties of large class sets without taking the nature of their datasets into account.",
        "In the next section, we propose a new algorithm which takes advantage specifically of the linguistic phenomena in the conversation-based data that we study for empowerment detection.",
        "As such, our algorithm is highly suited to this data and task, with the necessary tradeoff in uncertain generality to new domains with unrelated data.",
        "4 Cue Discovery for Content Selection Our algorithm performs content selection by learning a set of cue features.",
        "Each of these features indicates some linguistic function within the discourse which should downplay the importance of features either before or after that discourse marker.",
        "Our algorithm allows us to evaluate the impact of rules against a baseline, and to iteratively judge each rule atop the changes made by previous rules.",
        "This algorithm fits into existing language technologies research which has attempted to partition documents into sections which are more or less relevant for classification.",
        "Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), especially for segmentation both in prose (Hearst, 1997) and conversation (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "The approach of content selection, meanwhile, has been explored for sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), where individual sentences may be less subjective and therefore less relevant to the sentiment classification task.",
        "It is also similar conceptually to content selection algorithms that have been used for text summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and text generation (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009), both of which rely on finding highly-relevant passages within source texts.",
        "Our work is distinct from these approaches.",
        "While we have coarse-grained annotations of empowerment, there is no direct annotation of what makes a good cue for content selection.",
        "With our cues, we hope to take advantage of shallow discourse structure in conversation, such as contrastive markers, making use of implicit structure in the conversational domain."
