        "Many current Natural Language Processing [NLP] techniques work well assuming a large context of text as input data.",
        "However they become ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds.",
        "To overcome the issue, we want to find a related newswire document to a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks.",
        "This requires robust modeling and understanding of the semantics of short texts.",
        "The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-to-News task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a graph based latent variable model that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information).",
        "This is motivated by the observation that a tweet usually only covers one aspect of an event.",
        "We show that using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus completes the semantic picture of a short text.",
        "Our experiments show significant improvement of our new model over baselines with three evaluation metrics in the new task."

        "Recently there has been an increasing interest in language understanding of Twitter messages.",
        "Researchers (Speriosui et al., 2011; Brody and Diakopoulos, 2011; Jiang et al., 2011) were interested in sentiment analysis on Twitter feeds, and opinion mining towards political issues or politicians (Tumasjan et al., 2010; Conover et al., 2011).",
        "Others (Ramage et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2011) summarized tweets using topic models.",
        "Although these NLP techniques are mature, their performance on tweets inevitably degrades, due to the inherent sparsity in short texts.",
        "In the case of sentiment analysis, while people are able to achieve 87.5% accuracy (Maas et al., 2011) on a movie review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004), the performance drops to 75% (Li et al., 2012) on a sentence level movie review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2005).",
        "The problem worsens when some existing NLP systems cannot produce any results given the short texts.",
        "Considering the following tweet: Pray for Mali... A typical event extraction/discovery system (Ji and Grishman, 2008) fails to discover the war event due to the lack of context information (Benson et al., 2011), and thus fails to shed light on the users focus/interests.",
        "To enable the NLP tools to better understand Twitter feeds, we propose the task of linking a tweet to a news article that is relevant to the tweet, thereby augmenting the context of the tweet.",
        "For example, we want to supplement the implicit context of the above tweet with a news article such as the following entitled: State of emergency declared in Mali where abundant evidence can be fed into an off-the-shelf event extraction/discovery system.",
        "To create a gold standard dataset, we download tweets spanning over 18 days, each with a url linking to a news article of CNN or NYTIMES, as well as all the news of CNN and NYTIMES published during the period.",
        "The goal is to predict the url referred news article based on the text in each tweet.1 We",
        "believe many NLP tasks will benefit from this task.",
        "In fact, in the topic modeling research, previous work (Jin et al., 2011) already showed that by incorporating webpages whose urls are contained in tweets, the tweet clustering purity score was boosted from 0.280 to 0.392.",
        "Given the few number of words in a tweet (14 words on average in our dataset), the traditional high dimensional surface word matching is lossy and fails to pinpoint the news article.",
        "This constitutes a classic short text semantics impediment (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Latent variable models are powerful by going beyond the surface word level and mapping short texts into a low dimensional dense vector (Socher et al., 2011; Guo and Diab, 2012b).",
        "Accordingly, we apply a latent variable model, namely, the Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization [WTMF] (Guo and Diab, 2012b; Guo and Diab, 2012c) to both the tweets and the news articles.",
        "WTMF is a state-of-the-art unsupervised model that was tested on two short text similarity datasets: (Li et al., 2006) and (Agirre et al., 2012), which outperforms Latent Semantic Analysis [LSA] (Landauer et al., 1998) and Latent Dirichelet Allocation [LDA] (Blei et al., 2003) by a large margin.",
        "We employ it as a strong baseline in this task as it exploits and effectively models the missing words in a tweet, in practice adding thousands of more features for the tweet, by contrast LDA, for example, only leverages observed words (14 features) to infer the latent vector for a tweet.",
        "Apart from the data sparseness, our dataset proposes another challenge: a tweet usually covers only one aspect of an event.",
        "In our previous example, the tweet only contains the location Mali while the event is about French army participated in Mali war.",
        "In this scenario, we would like to find the missing elements of the tweet such as French, war from other short texts, to complete the semantic picture of Pray in Mali tweet.",
        "One drawback of WTMF for our purposes is that it simply models the text-to-word information without leveraging the correlation between short texts.",
        "While this is acceptable on standard short text similarity datasets (data points are independently generated), it ignores some valuable information characteristically present in our dataset: (1) The tweet specific features such as hashtags.",
        "Hashtags prove to be a direct indication of the semantics of tweets (Ramage et al., 2010); (2) The news specific features columbia.edu/'weiwei such as named entities in a document.",
        "Named entities acquired from a news document, typically with high accuracy using Named Entity Recognition [NER] tools, may be particularly informative.",
        "If two texts mention the same entities then they might describe the same event; (3) The temporal information in both genres (tweets and news articles).",
        "We note that there is a higher chance of event description overlap between two texts if their time of publication is similar.",
        "In this paper, we study the problem of mining and exploiting correlations between texts using these features.",
        "Two texts may be considered related or complementary if they share a hashtag/NE or satisfies the temporal constraints.",
        "Our proposed latent variable model not only models text-to-word information, but also is aware of the text-to-text information (illustrated in Figure 1): two linked texts should have similar latent vectors, accordingly the semantic picture of a tweet is completed by receiving semantics from its related tweets.",
        "We incorporate this additional information in the WTMF model.",
        "We also show the different impact of the text-to-text relations in the tweet genre and news genre.",
        "We are able to achieve significantly better results than with a text-to-words WTMF model.",
        "This work can be regarded as a short text modeling approach that extends previous work however with a focus on combining the mining of information within short texts coupled with utilizing extra shared information across the short texts."
