        "Recently, researchers have begun exploring methods of scoring student essays with respect to particular dimensions of quality such as coherence, technical errors, and relevance to prompt, but there is relatively little work on modeling thesis clarity.",
        "We present a new annotated corpus and propose a learning-based approach to scoring essays along the thesis clarity dimension.",
        "Additionally, in order to provide more valuable feedback on why an essay is scored as it is, we propose a second learning-based approach to identifying what kinds of errors an essay has that may lower its thesis clarity score."

        "Automated essay scoring, the task of employing computer technology to evaluate and score written text, is one of the most important educational applications of natural language processing (NLP) (see Shermis and Burstein (2003) and Shermis et al.",
        "(2010) for an overview of the state of the art in this task).",
        "A major weakness of many existing scoring engines such as the Intelligent Essay AssessorTM(Landauer et al., 2003) is that they adopt a holistic scoring scheme, which summarizes the quality of an essay with a single score and thus provides very limited feedback to the writer.",
        "In particular, it is not clear which dimension of an essay (e.g., style, coherence, relevance) a score should be attributed to.",
        "Recent work addresses this problem by scoring a particular dimension of essay quality such as coherence (Miltsakaki and Ku-kich, 2004), technical errors, Relevance to Prompt (Higgins et al., 2004), and organization (Persing et al., 2010).",
        "Essay grading software that provides feedback along multiple dimensions of essay quality such as E-rater/Criterion (Attali and Burstein, 2006) has also begun to emerge.",
        "Nevertheless, there is an essay scoring dimension for which few computational models have been developed ?",
        "thesis clarity.",
        "Thesis clarity refers to how clearly an author explains the thesis of her essay, i.e., the position she argues for with respect to the topic on which the essay is written.1 An essay with a high thesis clarity score presents its thesis in a way that is easy for the reader to understand, preferably but not necessarily directly, as in essays with explicit thesis sentences.",
        "It additionally contains no errors such as excessive misspellings that make it more difficult for the reader to understand the writer's purpose.",
        "Our goals in this paper are two-fold.",
        "First, we aim to develop a computational model for scoring the thesis clarity of student essays.",
        "Because there are many reasons why an essay may receive a low thesis clarity score, our second goal is to build a system for determining why an essay receives its score.",
        "We believe the feedback provided by this system will be more informative to a student than would a thesis clarity score alone, as it will help her understand which aspects of her writing need to be improved in order to better convey her thesis.",
        "To this end, we identify five common errors that impact thesis clarity, and our system's purpose is to determine which of these errors occur in a given essay.",
        "We evaluate our thesis clarity scoring model and error identification system on a data set of 830 essays annotated with both thesis clarity scores and errors.",
        "In sum, our contributions in this paper are threefold.",
        "First, we develop a scoring model and error identification system for the thesis clarity dimension on student essays.",
        "Second, we use features explicitly designed for each of the identified error 1An essay's thesis is the overall message of the entire essay.",
        "This concept is unbound from the the concept of thesis sentences, as even an essay that never explicitly states its thesis in any of its sentences may still have an overall message that can be inferred from the arguments it makes."

        "Analysis of these essays reveals that, though annotators only exactly agree on the thesis clarity score of an essay 36% of the time, the scores they apply are within 0.5 points in 62% of essays and within 1.0 point in 85% of essays.",

        "We present our annotators with descriptions of these five error classes (see Table 4), and ask them to assign zero or more of the error types to each essay.",
        "It is important to note that we ask our annotators to mark an essay with one of these errors only when the error makes the thesis less clear.",
        "So for example, an essay whose thesis is irrelevant to the prompt but is explicitly and otherwise clearly stated would not be marked as having a Relevance to Prompt error.",
        "If the irrelevant thesis is stated in such a way that its inapplicability to the prompt causes the reader to be confused about what the essay's purpose is, however, then the essay would be assigned a Relevance to Prompt error.",
        "To measure inter-annotator agreement on error identification, we ask both annotators to identify",
        "the errors in the same 100 essays that were doubly-annotated with thesis clarity scores.",
        "We then compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) on each error from the two sets of annotations, obtaining an average Kappa value of 0.75, which indicates fair agreement.",

        "Relationship between clarity scores and error classes.",
        "To determine the relationship between thesis clarity scores and the five error classes, we train a linear SVM regressor using the SVMlight software package (Joachims, 1999) with the five error types as independent variables and the reduction in thesis clarity score due to errors as the dependent variable.",
        "More specifically, each training example consists of a target, which we set to the essay's thesis clarity score minus 4.0, and six binary features, each of the first five representing the presence or absence of one of the five errors in the essay, and the sixth being a bias feature which we always set to 1.",
        "Representing the reduction in an essay's thesis clarity score with its thesis clarity score minus 4.0 allows us to more easily interpret the error and bias weights of the trained system, as under this setup, each error's weight should be a negative number reflecting how many points an essay loses due to the presence of that error.",
        "The bias feature allows for the possibility that an essay may lose points from its thesis clarity score for problems not accounted for in our five error classes.",
        "By setting this bias feature to 1, we tell our learner that an essay's default score may be less than 4.0 because these other problems may lower the average score of otherwise perfect essays.",
        "After training, we examined the weight parameters of the learned regressor and found that they were all negative: ?0.6 for CP, ?0.5998 for IPR, ?0.8992 for R, ?0.6 for MD, ?0.8 for WP, and ?0.1 for the bias.",
        "These results are consistent with our intuition that each of the enumerated error classes has a negative impact on thesis clarity score.",
        "In particular, each has a demonstrable negative impact, costing essays an average of more than 0.59 points when it occurs.",
        "Moreover, this set of errors accounts for a large majority of all errors impacting thesis clarity because unenumerated errors cost essays an average of only one-tenth of one point on the four-point thesis clarity scale."

        "of the combined system for one test fold are calculated by",
        "However, the macro F-score calculation can be seen as giving too much weight to the less frequent errors.",

        "Since we perform fivefold cross-validation, each value we report for each of these measures is an average over its values for the five folds.8 Results and discussion.",
        "Results on error identification, expressed in terms of precision, recall, micro F-score, and macro F-score are shown in the first four columns of Table 6.",
        "Our Baseline system, which only uses word n-gram and random indexing features, seems to perform uniformly poorly across both micro and macro F-scores (F and F?",
        "; see row 1).",
        "The per-class results9 show that, since micro F-score places more weight on the correct identification of the most frequent errors, the system's micro F-score (31.1%) is fairly close to the average of the scores obtained on the three most frequent error classes, CP, IPR, and R,",
        "sis clarity error identification and scoring.",
        "and remains unaffected by very low F-scores on the two remaining infrequent classes.10 When we add the misspelling feature to the baseline, resulting in the system called Bm (row 2), the micro F-score sees a very small, insignificant improvement.11 What is pleasantly surprising, however, is that, even though the misspelling features were developed for the Confusing Phrasing error type, they actually have more of a positive impact on Missing Details and Writer Position, bumping their individual error F-scores up by about 5 and 3 percent respectively.",
        "This suggests that spelling difficulties may be correlated with these other essay-writing difficulties, despite their apparent unrelatedness.",
        "This effect is strong enough to generate the small, though insignificant, gain in macro F-score shown in the table.",
        "When we add keyword features to the system, micro F-score increases significantly by 3.7 points (row 3).",
        "The micro per-class results reveal that, as intended, keyword features improve Incomplete Prompt Response and Relevance to Prompt's F-scores reveals that they do by 6.4 and 9.2 percentage points respectively.",
        "The macro F-scores reveal this too, though the macro F-score gains are 3.2 points and 11.5 points respectively.",
        "The macro F-score of the overall system would likely have improved more than shown in the table if the addition of keyword features did not simultaneously reduce Missing Details's score by several points.",
        "While we hoped that adding aggregated word n-gram features to the system (row 4) would be able to improve performance on Confusing Phrasing due to the presence of phrases such as ?in university be?",
        "in the error's Aw+i list, there turned out to be few such common phrases in the data set, 10Since parameters for optimizing micro F-score and macro F-score are selected independently, the per-class F-scores associated with micro F-score are different than those used for calculating macro F-score.",
        "Hence, when we discuss per-class changes influencing micro F-score, we refer to the former set, and otherwise we refer to the latter set.",
        "11All significance tests are paired t-tests, with p < 0.05.",
        "so performance on this class remains mostly unchanged.",
        "This feature type does, however, result in major improvements to micro and macro performance on Missing Details and Writer Position, the other two classes this feature was designed to help.",
        "Indeed, the micro F-score versions of Missing Details and Writer Position improve by 15.3 and 10.8 percentage points respectively.",
        "Since these are minority classes, however, the large improvements result in only a small, insignificant improvement in the overall system's micro F-score.",
        "The macro F-score results for these classes, however, improve by 6.5% and 17.6% respectively, giving us a nearly 5-point, statistically significant bump in macro F-score after we add this feature.",
        "Confusing Phrasing has up to now stubbornly resisted any improvement, even when we added features explicitly designed to help our system do better on this error type.",
        "When we add aggregated part of speech n-gram features on top of the previous system, that changes dramatically.",
        "Adding these features makes both our system's F-scores on Confusing Phrasing shoot up almost 8%, resulting in a significant, nearly 4.9% improvement in overall micro F-score and a more modest but insignificant 3.2% improvement in macro F-score (row 5).",
        "The micro F-score improvement can also be partly attributed to a four point improvement in Incomplete Prompt Response's micro F-score.",
        "The 13.7% macro F-score improvement of the Missing Details error plays a larger role in the overall system's macro F-score improvement than Confusing Phrasing's improvement, however.",
        "The improvement we see in micro F-score when we add aggregated frame features (row 6) can be attributed almost solely to improvements in classification of the minority classes.",
        "This is surprising because, as we mentioned before, minority classes tend to have a much smaller impact on overall micro F-score.",
        "Furthermore, the overall micro F-score improvement occurrs despite declines in the performances on two of the majority class errors.",
        "Missing Details and Writer Position's micro F-score performances increase by 19.1% and 13.4%.",
        "The latter is surprising only because of the magnitude of its improvement, as this feature type was explicitly intended to improve its performance.",
        "We did not expect this aggregated feature type to be especially useful for Missing Details error identification because very few of these types of features occur in its Af+i list, and there are none in its Af?i list.",
        "The few that are in the former list, however, occur fairly often and look like fairly good indicators of this error (both the examples ?Event-Event-it?",
        "and ?Categorization-Item-that?",
        "occur in the positive list, and both do seem vague, indicating more details are to be desired).",
        "Overall, this system improves our baseline's macro F-score performance significantly by 13.3% and its micro F-score performance significantly by 10.3%.",
        "As we progressed, adding each new feature type to the baseline system, there was no definite and consistent pattern to how the precisions and recalls changed in order to produce the universal increases in the F-scores that we observed for each new system.",
        "Both just tended to jerkily progress upward as new feature types were added.",
        "This confirms our intuition about these features ?",
        "namely that they do not all uniformly improve our performance in the same way.",
        "Some aim to improve precision by telling us when essays are less likely to be positive instances of an error class, such as any of the Aw?i, Ap?i, or Af?i features, and others aim to tell us when an essay is more likely to be a positive instance of an error."

        "We design three evaluation metrics to measure the error of our thesis clarity scoring system.",
        "The S1 metric measures the frequency at which a system predicts the wrong score out of the seven possible scores.",
        "Hence, a system that predicts the right score only 25% of the time would receive an S1 score of 0.75.",
        "The S2 metric measures the average distance between the system's score and the actual score.",
        "This metric reflects the idea that a system that estimates scores close to the annotator-assigned scores should be preferred over a system whose estimations are further off, even if both systems estimate the correct score at the same frequency.",
        "Finally, the S3 metric measures the average square of the distance between a system's thesis clarity score estimations and the annotator-assigned scores.",
        "The intuition behind this metric is that not only should we prefer a system whose estimations are close to the annotator scores, but we should also prefer one whose estimations are not too frequently very far away from the annotator scores.",
        "These three scores are given by:",
        "where Aj , Ej , and E?j are the annotator assigned, system estimated, and rounded system estimated scores12 respectively for essay j, and N is the number of essays.",
        "Results and discussion.",
        "Results on scoring are shown in the last three columns of Table 6.",
        "We see that the thesis clarity score predicting variation of the Baseline system, which employs as features only word n-grams and random indexing features, predicts the wrong score 65.8% of the time.",
        "Its predicted score is on average 0.517 points off of the actual score, and the average squared distance between the predicted and actual scores is 0.403.",
        "We observed earlier that a high number of misspellings may be positively correlated with one or more unrelated errors.",
        "Adding the misspelling feature to the scoring systems, however, only yields minor, insignificant improvements to their performances under the three scoring metrics.",
        "While adding keyword features on top of this system does not improve the frequency with which the right score is predicted, it both tends to move the predictions closer to the actual thesis clarity score value (as evidenced by the significant improvement in S2) and ensures that predicted scores will not too often stray too far from the actual value (as evidenced by the significant improvement in S3).",
        "Overall, the scoring model employing the Bmk feature set performs significantly better than the Baseline scoring model with respect to two out of three scoring metrics.",
        "The only remaining feature type whose addition yields a significant performance improvement is the aggregated word feature type, which improves system Bmk's S2 score significantly while having an insignificant impact on the other S metrics.",
        "Neither of the remaining aggregative features yields any significant improvements in performance.",
        "This is a surprising finding since, up until we introduced aggregated part-of-speech tag n-gram features into our regressor, each additional feature that helped with error classification made at least a small but positive contribution to at least two out of the three S scores.",
        "These aggregative features, which proved to be very powerful when assigning error labels, are not as useful for thesis 12Since our regressor assigns each essay a real value rather than an actual valid thesis clarity score, it would be difficult to obtain a reasonable S1 score without rounding the system estimated score to one of the possible values.",
        "For that reason, we round the estimated score to the nearest of the seven scores the human annotators were permitted to assign (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0) only when calculating S1.",
        "To more closely examine the behavior of the best scoring systems, in Table 7 we chart the distributions of scores they predict for each gold standard score.",
        "As an example of how to read this table, consider the number 2.8 appearing in row 1.5 in the .25 column of the S2 (Bmkwp) region.",
        "This means that 25% of the time, when system Bmkwp (which obtains the best S2 score) is presented with a test essay having a gold standard score of 1.5, it predicts that the essay has a score less than or equal to 2.8 for the S2 metric.",
        "From this table, we see that each of the best systems has a strong bias toward predicting more frequent scores as there are no numbers less than 3.0 in the 50% columns, and about 82.8% of all essays have gold standard scores of 3.0 or above.",
        "Nevertheless, no system relies entirely on bias, as evidenced by the fact that each column in the table has a tendency for its scores to ascend as the gold standard score increases, implying that the systems have some success at predicting lower scores for essays with lower gold standard scores.",
        "Finally, we note that the difference in error weighting between the S2 and S3 scoring metrics appears to be having its desired effect, as there is a strong tendency for each entry in the S3 subtable to be less than or equal to its corresponding entry in the S2 subtable due to the greater penalty the S3 metric imposes for predictions that are very far away from the gold standard scores."
