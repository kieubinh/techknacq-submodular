        "Most modern machine translation systems use phrase pairs as translation units, allowing for accurate modelling of phrase-internal translation and reordering.",

        "We propose a new model to address this imbalance, based on a word-based Markov model of translation which generates target translations left-to-right.",
        "Our model encodes word and phrase level phenomena by conditioning translation decisions on previous decisions and uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process prior to provide dynamic adaptive smoothing.",
        "This mechanism implicitly supports not only traditional phrase pairs, but also gapping phrases which are non-consecutive in the source.",

        "Recent years have witnessed burgeoning development of statistical machine translation research, notably phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003) and syntax-based approaches (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).",
        "These approaches model sentence translation as a sequence of simple translation decisions, such as the application of a phrase translation in phrase-based methods or a grammar rule in syntax-based approaches.",
        "In order to simplify modelling, most MT models make an independence assumption, stating that the translation decisions in a derivation are independent of one another.",
        "This conflicts with the intuition behind phrase-based MT, namely that translation decisions should be dependent on context.",
        "On one hand, the use of phrases can memorize local context and hence helps to generate better translation compared to word-based models (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "On the other hand, this mechanism requires each phrase to be matched strictly and to be used as a whole, which precludes the use of discontinuous phrases and leads to poor generalisation to unseen data (where large phrases tend not to match).",
        "In this paper we propose a new model to drop the independence assumption, by instead modelling correlations between translation decisions, which we use to induce translation derivations from aligned sentences (akin to word alignment).",
        "We develop a Markov model over translation decisions, in which each decision is conditioned on previous n most recent decisions.",
        "Our approach employs a sophisticated Bayesian non-parametric prior, namely the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process (Teh, 2006; Teh et al., 2006) to represent back-off from larger to smaller contexts.",
        "As a result, we need only use very simple translation units ?",
        "primarily single words, but can still describe complex multi-word units through correlations between their component translation decisions.",
        "We further decompose the process of generating each target word into component factors: finishing the translating, jumping elsewhere in the source, emitting a target word and deciding the fertility of the source words.",
        "Overall our model has the following features:",
        "1. enabling model parameters to be shared between similar translation decisions, thereby obtaining more reliable statistics and generalizing better from small training sets.",
        "2. learning a much richer set of translation fragments, such as gapping phrases, e.g., the translation for the German werde .",

        "Word based models have a long history in machine translation, starting with the venerable IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) and the hidden Markov model (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "These models are still in widespread use today, albeit only as a preprocessing step for inferring word level alignments from sentence-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "They combine a number of factors, including distortion and fertility, which have been shown to improve word-alignment and translation performance over simpler models.",
        "Our approach is similar to these works, as we also develop a word-based model, and explicitly consider similar translation decisions, alignment jumps and fertility.",
        "We extend these works in two important respects: 1) while they assume a simple parame-terisation by making iid assumptions about each translation factor, we instead allow for rich correlations by modelling sequences of translation decisions; and 2) we develop our model in the Bayesian framework, using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process prior with rich backoff semantics between high and lower order sequences of translation decisions.",
        "Together this results in a model with rich expressiveness but can still generalize well to unseen data.",
        "More recently, a number of authors have proposed Markov models for machine translation.",
        "Vaswani et al. (2011) propose a rule Markov model for a tree-to-string model which models correlations between pairs of mininal rules, and use Kneser-Ney smoothing to alleviate the problems of data sparsity.",
        "Similarly, Crego et al. (2011) develop a bilingual language model which incorporates words in the source and target languages to predict the next unit, which they use as a feature in a translation system.",
        "This line of work was extended by Le et al. (2012) who develop a novel estimation algorithm based around discriminative projection into continuous spaces.",
        "Also relevant is Durrani et al. (2011), who present a sequence model of translation including reordering.",
        "Our work also uses bilingual information, using the source words as part of the conditioning context.",
        "In contrast to these approaches which primarily address the decoding problem, we focus on the learning problem of inferring alignments from parallel sentences.",
        "Additionally, we develop a full generative model using a Bayesian prior, and incorporate additional factors besides lexical items, namely jumps in the source and word fertility.",
        "Another aspect of this paper is the implicit support for phrase-pairs that are discontinous in the source language.",
        "This idea has been developed explicitly in a number of previous approaches, in grammar based (Chiang, 2005) and phrase-based systems (Galley and Manning, 2010).",
        "The latter is most similar to this paper, and shows that discontinuous phrases compliment standard contiguous phrases, improving expressiveness and translation performance.",
        "Unlike their work, here we develop a complimentary approach by constructing a generative model which can induce these rich rules directly from sentence-aligned corpora."

        "Note that even the simplest Markov model far outperforms the GIZA++ baseline (+1.5 BLEU) despite the baseline (IBM model 4) including a number of advanced features (e.g., jump, fertility) that are not present in the basic Markov model.",
        "This improvement is a result of the Markov model making use of rich bilingual contextual information coupled with sophisticated backoff, as opposed to GIZA++ which considers much more local events, with nothing larger than word-class bi-grams.",

        "Like the IBM models, our approach allows each source word to produce any number of target words.",

        "Among the three initialisations, we get the best result with the initialisation of grow.",
        "Gdf often introduces alignment links involving function words which should instead be aligned to null.",
        "Intersection includes many fewer alignments, typically only between content words, and the sparsity means that words can only have a fertility of either 0 or 1.",
        "This leads to the initialisation being a strong mode which is difficult to escape from during sampling.",
        "Despite this problem, it has only a mild negative effect on the performance of our model, which is probably due to improvements in the alignments for words that truly should be dropped or aligned only to one word.",
        "Grow provides a good compromise between gdf and intersection, and we use this initialisation in all our subsequent experiments.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example comparing alignments produced by our model and the GIZA++ baseline, in both cases after combining the two directional models.",
        "Note that GIZA++ has linked many function words which should be left unaligned, by using rare English terms as garbage collectors.",
        "Consequently this only allows for the extraction of few large phrase-pairs (e.g. <?",
