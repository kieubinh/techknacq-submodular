        "Most importantly, our method produces better translation results (as demonstrated on the OPUS MT task).",

        "Our method is also easily extensible to out-of-domain translation scenarios similar to (Dou and Knight, 2012).",
        "While their work also uses Bayesian inference with a slice sampling scheme, our new approach uses a novel hash sampling scheme for decipherment that can easily scale to more complex models.",
        "The new decipherment framework also allows one to easily incorporate additional information (besides standard word translations) as features (e.g., context features, topic features, etc.)",
        "for unsupervised machine translation which can help further improve the performance in addition to accelerating the sampling process.",
        "We already demonstrated the utility of this system by going beyond words and incorporating phrase translations in a decipherment model for the first time.",
        "In the future, we can obtain further speedups (especially for large-scale tasks) by parallelizing the sampling scheme seamlessly across multiple machines and CPU cores.",
