        "Textual entailment recognition (RTE) involves a wide range of semantic inferences to determine whether the meaning of a hypothesis sentence (h) can be inferred from another text (t) (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Although several evaluation campaigns (e.g., PASCAL/TAC RTE challenges) have made significant progress, the RTE community recognizes the necessity of a deeper understanding of the core phenomena involved in textual inference.",
        "Such recognition comes from the ideas that crucial progress may derive from decomposing the complex RTE task into basic phenomena and from solving each basic phenomenon separately (Ben-tivogli et al., 2010; Sammons et al., 2010; Cabrio and Magnini, 2011; Toledo et al., 2012).",
        "Given this background, we focus on solving one of the basic phenomena in RTE: semantic inference related to numerical expressions.",
        "The specific problem we address is acquisition of numerical common sense.",
        "For example,",
        "(1) t : Before long, 3b people will face a water shortage in the world.",
        "h : Before long, a serious water shortage will occur in the world.",
        "Although recognizing the entailment relation between t and h is frustratingly difficult, we assume",
        "|= a serious water shortage.",
        "In the first phase, it is necessary to recognize 3b as a numerical expression and to resolve the expression 3b into the exact amount 3,000,000,000.",
        "The second phase is much more difficult because we need subjective but common-sense knowledge that 3,000,000,000 people is a large number.",
        "In this paper, we address the first and second phases of inference as an initial step towards semantic processing with numerical expressions.",
        "The contributions of this paper are four-fold.",
        "1.",
        "We examine instances in existing RTE corpora, categorize them into groups in terms of the necessary semantic inferences, and discuss the impact of this study for solving RTE problems with numerical expressions.",
        "2.",
        "We describe a method of normalizing numerical expressions referring to the same amount in text into a unified semantic representation.",
        "3.",
        "We present approaches for aggregating numerical common sense from examples of numerical expressions and for judging whether a given amount is large, small, or normal.",
        "4.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, reporting experimental results and analyses in detail.",
        "Although it would be ideal to evaluate the impact of this study on the overall RTE task, we evaluate each phase separately.",
        "We do this because the existing RTE data sets tend to exhibit very diverse linguistic phenomena, and it is difficult to employ such data for evaluating the real impact of this study."
