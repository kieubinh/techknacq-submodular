        "Detailed domain knowledge is crucial to many NLP tasks, either as an input for language understanding, or as the goal itself, to acquire such knowledge.",
        "For example, in information extraction, a list of slots in the target domain is given to the system, and in natural language generation, content models are trained to learn the content structure of texts in the target domain for information structuring and automatic summarization.",
        "Generative probabilistic models have been one popular approach to content modelling.",
        "An important advantage of this approach is that the structure of the model can be adapted to fit the assumptions about the structure of the domain and the nature of the end task.",
        "As this field has progressed, the formal structures that are assumed to represent a domain have increased in complexity and become more hierarchical.",
        "Earlier work assumes a flat set of topics (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), which are expressed as states of a latent random variable in the model.",
        "Later work organizes topics into a hierarchy from general to specific (Haghighi and Van-derwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010).",
        "Recently, Cheung et al. (2013) formalized a domain as a set of frames consisting of prototypical sequences of events, slots, and slot fillers or entities, inspired by classical AI work such as Schank and Abelson's (1977) scripts.",
        "We adopt much of this terminology in this work.",
        "For example, in the CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS domain, there may be events such as a murder, an investigation of the crime, an arrest, and a trial.",
        "These would be indicated by event heads such as kill, arrest, charge, plead.",
        "Relevant slots would include VICTIM, SUSPECT, AUTHORITIES, PLEA, etc.",
        "One problem faced by this line of work is that, by their nature, these models are typically trained on a small corpus from the target domain, on the order of hundreds of documents.",
        "The small size of the training corpus makes it difficult to estimate reliable statistics, especially for more powerful features such as higher-order N-gram features or syntactic features.",
        "By contrast, distributional semantic models are trained on large, domain-general corpora.",
        "These methods model word meaning using the contexts in the training corpus in which the word appears.",
        "The most popular approach today is a vector space representation, in which each dimension corresponds to some context word, and the value at that dimension corresponds to the strength of the association between the context word and the target word being modelled.",
        "A notion of word similarity arises naturally from these models by comparing the similarity of the word vectors, for example by using a cosine measure.",
        "Recently, these models have been extended by considering how distribu",
        "tional representations can be modified depending on the specific context in which the word appears (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008, for example).",
        "Contextualization has been found to improve performance in tasks like lexical substitution and word sense disambiguation (Thater et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper, we propose to inject contextualized distributional semantic vectors into generative probabilistic models, in order to combine their complementary strengths for domain modelling.",
        "There are a number of potential advantages that distributional semantic models offer.",
        "First, they provide domain-general representations of word meaning that cannot be reliably estimated from the small target-domain corpora on which probabilistic models are trained.",
        "Second, the contextualization process allows the semantic vectors to implicitly encode disambiguated word sense and syntactic information, without further adding to the complexity of the generative model.",
        "Our model, the Distributional Semantic Hidden Markov Model (DSHMM), incorporates contextualized distributional semantic vectors into a generative probabilistic model as observed emissions.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in two domain modelling tasks.",
        "First, we apply it to slot induction on guided summarization data over five different domains.",
        "We show that our model outperforms a baseline version of our method that does not use distributional semantic vectors, as well as a recent state-of-the-art template induction method.",
        "Then, we perform an extrinsic evaluation using multi-document summarization, wherein we show that our model is able to learn event and slot topics that are appropriate to include in a summary.",
        "From a modelling perspective, these results show that probabilistic models for content modelling and template induction benefit from distributional semantics trained on a much larger corpus.",
        "From the perspective of distributional semantics, this work broadens the variety of problems to which distributional semantics can be applied, and proposes methods to perform inference in a probabilistic setting beyond geometric measures such as cosine similarity."

        "We recently showed how such models can be evaluated for their ability to support semantic inference for use in complex NLP tasks like question answering or automatic summarization (Cheung and Penn, 2012).",

        "By contrast, our method better modularizes the two, and provides a principled way to train the model.",
