        "Over the years, ParGram has continuously grown and includes grammars for Ara",

        "This output forms the basis of the ParGramBank parallel treebank discussed here.",
        "ParGramBank is constructed using an innovative alignment methodology developed in the XPAR project (Dyvik et al., 2009) in which grammar parallelism is presupposed to propagate alignment across different projections (section 6).",
        "This methodology has been implemented with a drag-and-drop interface as part of the LFG Parsebanker in the INESS infrastructure (Rose?n et al., 2012; Rose?n et al., 2009).",
        "ParGramBank has been constructed in INESS and is accessible in this infrastructure, which also offers powerful search and visualization.",
        "In recent years, parallel treebanking1 has gained in importance within NLP.",
        "An obvious application for parallel treebanking is machine translation, where treebank size is a deciding factor for whether a particular treebank can support a particular kind of research project.",
        "When conducting in-depth linguistic studies of typological features, other factors such as the number of included languages, the number of covered phenomena, and the depth of linguistic analysis become more important.",

        "Third, the treebank will be expanded to include 100 more sentences within the next year.",
        "We also plan to include more languages as other ParGram groups contribute structures to ParGramBank.",
        "ParGramBank, including its multilingual sentences and all annotations, is made freely available for research and commercial use under the CC-BY 3.0 license via the INESS platform, which supports alignment methodology developed in the XPAR project and provides search and visualization methods for parallel treebanks.",
        "We encourage the computational linguistics community to contribute further layers of annotation, including semantic (Crouch and King, 2006), abstract knowledge representational (Bobrow et al., 2007), Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005), or TimeBank (Mani and Pustejovsky, 2004) annotations."
