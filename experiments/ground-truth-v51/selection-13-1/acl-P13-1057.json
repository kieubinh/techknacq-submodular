        "Low-resource languages present a particularly difficult challenge for natural language processing tasks.",
        "For example, supervised learning methods can provide high accuracy for part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Manning, 2011), but they perform poorly when little supervision is available.",
        "Good results in weakly-supervised tagging have been obtained by training sequence models such as hidden Markov models (HMM) using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM), however most work in this area has still relied on relatively large amounts of data, both annotated and unannotated, as well as an assumption that the annotations are very clean (Kupiec, 1992; Merialdo, 1994).",
        "The ability to learn taggers using very little data is enticing: only a tiny fraction of the world's languages have enough data for standard supervised models to work well.",
        "The collection or development of resources is a time-consuming and expensive process, creating a significant barrier for an understudied language where there are few experts and little funding.",
        "It is thus important to develop approaches that achieve good accuracy based on the amount of data that can be reasonably obtained, for example, in just a few hours by a linguist doing fieldwork on a non-native language.",
        "Previous work explored learning taggers from weak information, but the type, amount, quality, and sources of data raise questions about the applicability of those results to real-world low-resource scenarios (Toutanova and Johnson, 2008; Ravi and Knight, 2009; Hasan and Ng, 2009; Garrette and Baldridge, 2012).",
        "Most research simulated weak supervision with tag dictionaries extracted from existing large, expertly-annotated corpora.",
        "These resources have been developed over long periods of time by trained annotators who collaborate to produce high-quality analyses.",
        "They are also biased towards including only the most likely tag for each word type, resulting in a cleaner dictionary than one would find in a real scenario.",
        "As such, these experiments do not reflect real-world constraints.",
        "One exception to this work is Goldberg et al. (2008): they use a manually-constructed lexicon for Hebrew in order to learn an HMM tagger.",
        "However, this lexicon was constructed by trained lexicographers over a long period of time and achieves very high coverage of the language with very good quality, much better than could be achieved by our non-expert linguistics graduate student annotators in just a few hours.",
        "Cucerzan and Yarowsky",
        "(2002) learn a POS-tagger from existing linguistic resources, namely a dictionary and a reference grammar, but these resources are not available, much less digitized, for most understudied languages.",
        "Haghighi and Klein (2006) develop a model in which a POS-tagger is learned from a list of POS tags and just three ?prototype?",
        "word types for each tag, but their approach requires a vector space to compute the distributional similarity between prototypes and other word types in the corpus.",
        "Such distributional models are not feasible for low-resource languages because they require immense amounts of raw text, much more than is available in these settings (Abney and Bird, 2010).",
        "Further, they extracted their prototype lists directly from a labeled corpus, something we are specifically avoiding.",
        "Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2013) evaluate the use of mixed type and token constraints generated by projecting information from a high-resource language to a low-resource language via a parallel corpus.",
        "However, large parallel corpora are not available for most low-resource languages.",
        "These are also expensive resources to create and would take considerably more effort to produce than the monolingual resources that our annotators were able to generate in a four-hour timeframe.",
        "Of course, if they are available, such parallel text links could be incorporated into our approach.",
        "In our previous work, we developed a different strategy based on generalizing linguistic input with a computational model: linguists annotated either types or tokens for two hours, these annotations are projected onto a corpus of unlabeled tokens using label propagation and HMMs, and a final POS-tagger is trained on this larger auto-labeled corpus (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).",
        "That approach uses much more realistic types and quantities of resources than previous work; nonetheless, it leaves many open questions regarding the effectiveness of incrementally more annotation, the role of unannotated data, and whether there is a good balance to be found using a combination of type-and token-supervision.",
        "We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994).",
        "This paper addresses these questions via a series of experiments designed to quantify the effect on performance given by the amount of time spent finding or annotating training materials.",

        "Amount of raw data available for training",
        "We explore these strategies in the context of POS-tagging for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy.",
        "We also include experiments for English, pretending as though it is a low-resource language.",
        "The overwhelming take away from our results is that type supervision?when backed by an effective semi-supervised learning approach?is the most important source of linguistic information.",
        "Also, morphological analyzers help for morphologically rich languages when there are few labeled types or tokens (and, it never hurts to use them).",
        "Finally, performance improves with more raw data, though we see diminishing returns past 400,000 tokens.",
        "With just four hours of type annotation, our system obtains good accuracy across the three languages: 89.8% on English, 81.9% on Kinyarwanda, and 81.2% on Malagasy.",
        "Our results compare favorably with previous work despite using considerably less supervision and a more difficult set of tags.",
        "For example, Li et al.",

        "Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2013) average 88.8% across 8 major languages, but for Turkish, a morphologically rich language, they achieve only 65.2%, significantly below our 81.9% for morphologically-rich Kinyarwanda."

        "Learning under low-resource conditions is more difficult than scenarios in most previous POS work because the vast majority of the word types in the training and test data are not covered by the annotations.",
        "When most words are unknown, learning algorithms such as EM struggle (Garrette and Baldridge, 2012).",
        "Recall that most work on learning POS-taggers from tag dictionaries used tag dictionaries culled from test sets (even when considering incomplete dictionaries).",
        "We thus build on our previous approach, which exploits extremely sparse, human-generated annotations that are produced without knowledge of which words appear in the test set (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).",
        "This approach generalizes a small initial tag dictionary to include unannotated word types appearing in raw data.",
        "It estimates word/tag pair and tag-transition frequency information using model-minimization, which also reduces noise introduced by automatic tag dictionary expansion.",
        "The approach exploits type annotations effectively to learn parameters for out-of-vocabulary words and infer missing frequency and sequence information.",

        "The purpose of tag dictionary expansion is to estimate label distributions for tokens in a raw cor",
        "pus, including words missing in the annotations.",
        "For this, a graph connecting annotated words to unannotated words via features is constructed and POS labels are pushed between these items using label propagation (LP) (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009).",
        "LP has been used successfully for extending POS labels from high-resource languages to low via parallel corpora (Das and Petrov, 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2013; Ding, 2011) or high-to low-resource domains (Subramanya et al., 2010), among other tasks.",
        "These works have typically used n-gram features (capturing basic syntax) and character affixes (basic morphology).",
        "The character n-gram affix-as-morphology approach produces many features, but only a fraction of them represent actual morphemes.",
        "Incorrect features end up pushing noise around the graph, so affixes can lead to more false labels that drown out the true labels.",
        "While affixes may be sufficient for languages with limited morphology, their effectiveness diminishes for morphology-rich languages, which have much higher type-to-token ratios.",
        "More types means sparser word frequency statistics and more out-of-vocabulary items, and thus problems for EM.",
        "Here, we modify the LP graph by supplementing or replacing generic affix features with a focused set of morphological features produced by an FST.",
        "These targeted morphological features are effective during LP because words that share them are much more likely to actually share POS tags.",
        "FSTs produce multiple analyses, which is actually advantageous for LP.",
        "Ambiguities need not be resolved since we just take the union of all morphological features for all analyses and use them as features in the graph.",
        "Note that each FST produces its own POS-tags as features, but these do not correspond to the target POS tagset used by the tagger.",
        "This is important because it decouples FST development and the final POS task.",
        "Thus, any FST for the language, regardless of its provenance, can be used with any target POS tagset.",
        "Since the LP graph contains a node for each corpus token, and each node is labeled with a distribution over POS tags, the graph provides a corpus of sentences labeled with noisy tag distributions along with an expanded tag dictionary.",
        "This output is useful as input to EM because it contains labels for all seen word types as well as sequence and frequency information.",
        "There is a high degree of noise in the LP output, so we employ the model minimization strategy of Ravi et al. (2010), which finds a minimal set of tag bigrams needed to explain the sentences in the raw corpus.",
        "It outputs a corpus of tagged sentences, which are used as a good starting point for EM training of an HMM.",
        "The expanded tag dictionary constrains the EM search space by providing a limited tagset for each word type, steering EM towards a desirable result.",

        "Therefore, the collection of raw data can be considered another time-sensitive task for which the tradeoffs with previously-discussed annotation efforts must contend.",
        "It could be the case that more raw data for training could make up for additional annotation and FST development effort or make the LP procedure unnecessary.",

        "Care must be taken when drawing conclusions from small-scale annotation studies such as those presented in this paper.",
        "Nonetheless, we have explored realistic annotation scenarios for POS-tagging for low-resource languages and found several consistent patterns.",
        "Most importantly, it is clear that type annotations are the most useful input one can obtain from a linguist?provided a semi-supervised algorithm for projecting that information reliably onto raw tokens is available.",
        "In a sense, this result validates the research trajectory of efforts of the past two decades put into learning taggers from tag dictionaries: papers have successively removed layers of unrealistic assumptions, and in doing so have produced pipelines for type-supervision that easily beat token-supervision prepared in comparable amounts of time.",
        "The result of most immediate practical value is that we show it is possible to train effective POS-taggers on actual low-resource languages given only a relatively small amount of unlabeled text and a few hours of annotation by a non-native linguist.",
        "Instead of having annotators label full sentences as one might expect the natural choice would be, it is much more effective to simply extract a list of the most frequent word types in the language and concentrate efforts on annotating these types with their potential parts of speech.",
        "Furthermore, for languages with rich morphology, a morphological transducer can yield significant performance gains when large amounts of other annotated resources are unavailable.",
        "(And it never hurts performance.)",
        "Finally, additional raw text does improve performance.",
        "However, using substantial amounts of raw text is unlikely to produce gains larger than only a few hours spent annotating types.",
        "Thus, when deciding whether to spend time locating larger volumes of digitized text or to spend time annotating types, choose types.",
        "Despite the consistent superiority of type annotations in our experiments, it of course may be the case that techniques such as active learning may better select sentences for token annotation, so this should be explored in future work."
