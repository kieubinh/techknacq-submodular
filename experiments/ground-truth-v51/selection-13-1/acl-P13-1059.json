        "A shrinking fraction of the world's Web pages are written in English, therefore the ability to access pages across a range of languages is becoming increasingly important.",
        "This need can be addressed in part by cross-lingual information access tasks such as entity linking (McNamee et al., 2011; Cas-sidy et al., 2012), event extraction (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007), slot filling (Snover et al., 2011) and question answering (Parton et al., 2009; Parton and McKeown, 2010).",
        "A key bottleneck of high-quality cross-lingual information access lies in the performance of Machine Translation (MT).",
        "Traditional MT approaches focus on the fluency and accuracy of the overall translation but fall short in their ability to translate certain content words including critical information, especially names.",
        "A typical statistical MT system can only translate 60% person names correctly (Ji et al., 2009).",
        "Incorrect segmentation and translation of names which often carry central meanings of a sentence can also yield incorrect translation of long contexts.",
        "Names have been largely neglected in the prior MT research due to the following reasons: ?",
        "The current dominant automatic MT scoring metrics (such as Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002)) treat all words equally, but names have relative low frequency in text (about 6% in newswire and only 3% in web documents) and thus are vastly outnumbered by function words and common nouns, etc.. ?",
        "Name translations pose a greater complexity because the set of names is open and highly dynamic.",
        "It is also important to acknowledge that there are many fundamental differences between the translation of names and other tokens, depending on whether a name is rendered phonetically, semantically, or a mixture of both (Ji et al., 2009).",
        "?",
        "The artificial settings of assigning low weights to information translation (compared to overall word translation) in some large-scale government evaluations have discouraged MT developers to spend time and explore resources to tackle this problem.",
        "We propose a novel Name-aware MT (NAMT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into the training and decoding processes of an end-to-end MT pipeline, and a new name-aware metric to evaluate MT which can assign different weights to different tokens according to their importance values in a document.",

        "First, we replace tagged name pairs with their entity types, and then use Giza++ and symmetrization heuristics to regenerate word alignment.",

        "The realigned parallel corpora are used to train our NAMT system based on SCFG.",

        "Then we apply a state-of-the-art name translation system (Ji et al., 2009) to translate names into the target language.",
        "The name translation system is composed of the following steps: (1) Dictionary matching based on 150,041 name translation pairs; (2) Statistical name transliteration based on a structured perceptron model and a character based MT model (Dayne and Shahram, 2007); (3) Context information extraction based re-ranking.",

        "It is challenging to decide when to use name translation results.",
        "The simple transfer method ensures all name translations appear in the MT output, but it heavily relies on word alignment and does not take into account word reordering or the words found in a name's context; therefore it could mistakenly break some context phrase structures due to name translation or alignment errors.",
        "The LM selection method often assigns an inappropriate weight to the additional name translation table because it is constructed independently from translation of context words; therefore after weighted voting most correct name translations are not used in the final translation output.",

        "More importantly, in these approaches the MT model was still mostly treated as a ?black-box?",
        "because neither the translation model nor the LM was updated or adapted specifically for names.",
        "Recently the wider idea of incorporating semantics into MT has received increased interests.",
        "Most of them designed some certain semantic representations, such as predicate-argument structure or semantic role labeling (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2009; Meyer et al., 2011; Bojar and Wu, 2012), word sense disambiguation (Carpu-at and Wu, 2007b; Carpuat and Wu, 2007a) and graph-structured grammar representation (Jones et al., 2012).",
        "Lo et al. (2012) proposed a semantic role driven MT metric.",

        "Some statistical MT systems (e.g. (Zens et al., 2005), (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005)) have attempted to use text normalization to improve word alignment for dates, numbers and job titles.",

        "name tagging on overall word alignment.",
        "Most of the previous name translation work combined supervised transliteration approaches with LM based re-scoring (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Huang et al., 2004).",
        "Some recent research used comparable corpora to mine name translation pairs (Feng et al., 2004; Kutsumi et al., 2004; Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Lu and Zhao, 2006; Hassan et al., 2007).",
        "However, most of these approaches required large amount of seeds, suffered from Information Extraction errors, and relied on phonetic similarity, context co-occurrence and document similarity for re-scoring.",
