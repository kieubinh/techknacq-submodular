        "Its most important advantage is that arbitrary features can be added to the model.",
        "Thus, it casts complex translation between a pair of languages as feature engineering, which facilitates research and development for SMT.",
        "Regardless of how successful the log-linear model is in SMT, it still has some shortcomings.",
        "This joint work was done while the first author visited NICT.",
        "On the one hand, features are required to be linear with respect to the objective of the translation model (Nguyen et al., 2007), but it is not guaranteed that the potential features be linear with the model.",
        "This induces modeling inadequacy (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008), in which the translation performance may not improve, or may even decrease, after one integrates additional features into the model.",
        "On the other hand, it cannot deeply interpret its surface features, and thus can not efficiently develop the potential of these features.",
        "What may happen is that a feature p does initially not improve the translation performance, but after a nonlinear operation, e.g. log(p), it does.",
        "The reason is not because this feature is useless but the model does not efficiently interpret and represent it.",
        "Situations such as this confuse explanations for feature designing, since it is unclear whether such a feature contributes to a translation or not.",
        "A neural network (Bishop, 1995) is a reasonable method to overcome the above shortcomings.",
        "However, it should take constraints, e.g. the decoding efficiency, into account in SMT.",
        "Decoding in SMT is considered as the expansion of translation states and it is handled by a heuristic search (Koehn, 2004a).",
        "In the search procedure, frequent computation of the model score is needed for the search heuristic function, which will be challenged by the decoding efficiency for the neural network based translation model.",
        "Further, decoding with non-local (or state-dependent) features, such as a language model, is also a problem.",
        "Actually, even for the (log-) linear model, efficient decoding with the language model is not trivial (Chiang, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we propose a variant of neural networks, i.e. additive neural networks (see Section 3 for details), for SMT.",

        "cal (or state independent) features.",
        "Compared with the log-linear model, it has more powerful expressive abilities and can deeply interpret and represent features with hidden units in neural networks.",
        "Moreover, our method is simple to implement and its decoding efficiency is comparable to that of the log-linear model.",
        "We also integrate word embedding into the model by representing each word as a feature vector (Collobert and Weston, 2008).",
        "Because of the thousands of parameters and the non-convex objective in our model, efficient training is not simple.",
        "We propose an efficient training methodology: we apply the mini-batch conjugate sub-gradient algorithm (Le et al., 2011) to accelerate the training; we also propose pre-training and post-training methods to avoid poor local minima.",
        "The biggest contribution of this paper is that it goes beyond the log-linear model and proposes a non-linear translation model instead of re-ranking model (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008; Sokolov et al., 2012).",
        "On both Chinese-to-English and Japanese-to-English translation tasks, experiment results show that our model can leverage the shortcomings suffered by the log-linear model, and thus achieves significant improvements over the log-linear based translation."
