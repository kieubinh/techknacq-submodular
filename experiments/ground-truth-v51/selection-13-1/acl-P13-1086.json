        "With the exception of Bar-Haim et al. (2011), these NLP studies have relied on small corpora of hand-labeled data for training or evaluation, and the connection to market events is done indirectly through sentiment detection.",

        "The experimental results show the SemTree space to be the one representation tested here that is significantly better than BOW, but only for the polarity task.",
        "Post hoc analysis indicates this may be due to the aptness of semantic frame parsing for polarity.",
        "Limitations in our treatment of time point to directions for improvement regarding the change task.",
        "Some strengths of our approach are the separate treatment of different sectors, and the benefits of SemTree features.",
        "To analyze which were the best performing features within sectors, we extracted the best performing frame fragments for the polarity task using a tree kernel feature engineering method presented in Pighin and Moschitti (2009).",
        "The algorithm selects the most relevant features in accordance with the weights estimated by SVM, and uses these features to build an explicit representation of the kernel space.",
        "Figure 3 shows the best performing SemTree fragments of the polarity task for the consumer staples sector.",
        "Recall that we hypothesized differences in semantic frame features across sectors.",
        "This shows up as large differences in the strength of features across sectors.",
        "More strikingly, the same feature can differ in polarity across sectors.",
        "For example, in consumer staples, (EVALUEE(Judgment communication)) has positive polarity, compared with negative polarity in information technology sector.",
        "The examples we see indicate that the positive cases pertain to aggressive retail practices that lead to lawsuits with only small fines, but whose larger impact benefits the bottom line.",
        "A typical case is the sentence, The plaintiffs accused Wal-Mart of discriminating against disabled customers by mounting ?point-of-sale?",
        "terminals in many stores at elevated heights that cannot be reached.",
        "Lawsuits in the IT sector, on the other hand, are often about technology patent disputes, and are more negative, as illustrated by our example sentence in Figure 2.",
        "SemTree features capture the differences between semantic roles for the same frame, and between the same semantic role in different frames.",
        "For example, the PERCEIVER AGENTIVE role of the Perception active frame contributes to prediction of an increase in price, as in R.J. Reynolds is watching this situation closely and will respond as appropriate.",
        "Conversely, a company that fills the PHENOMENON role of the same frame contributes to prediction of a price decrease, as in Investors will get a clearer look at how the market values the Philip Morris tobacco businesses when Altria Group Inc. ?when-issued?",
        "shares begin trading on Tuesday.",
        "When a company fills the VICTIM role in the Cause harm frame, this can predict a decrease in price, as in Hershey has been hurt by soaring prices for cocoa, energy and other commodities, whereas filling the VICTIM role in the Defend frame is associated with an increase in price, as in At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Warren Buffett defended Wal-Mart , saying the scandal did not change his opinion of the company.",
        "One weakness of our approach that we discussed above is that there is a strong effect of time that we do not address.",
        "The same SemTree feature can be predictive for one time period and not for another.",
        "(GOODS(Commerce sell)) is related to a decrease in price for 2008 and 2009 but to an increase in price for 2010-2012.",
        "There is clearly an influence of the overall economic context that we do not take into account.",
        "For example,",
        "the practices of acquiring or selling a business are different in downturning versus recovering markets.",
        "An important observation of the MCC values, especially in the case of SemTreeFWD is that MCC increases during the years 2011-2012.",
        "We attribute this change to the difficulty of predicting stock price trends when there is the high volatility typical of a financial crisis.",
        "The effect of news on volatility, however, can be explored independently.",
        "For example, Creamer et al. (2012) detect a strong association.",
        "Another weakness of our approach is that we take sentences out of context, which can lead to prediction errors.",
        "For example, the sentence Longs?",
        "real estate assets alone are worth some $2.9 billion, or $71.50 per share, Ackman wrote, meaning that CVS would essentially be paying for real estate, but gaining Longs?",
        "pharmacy benefit management business and retail operations for free is treated as predicting a positive polarity for CVS.",
        "This would be accurate if CVS was actually going to acquire Longs?",
        "business.",
        "Later in the same news item, however, there is a sentence indicating that the sale will not go through, which predicts negative polarity for CVS: Pershing Square Capital Management said on Thursday it won't support a tender offer from CVS Caremark Corp for rival Longs Drug Stores Corp because the offer price ?materially understates the fair value of the company,?",
