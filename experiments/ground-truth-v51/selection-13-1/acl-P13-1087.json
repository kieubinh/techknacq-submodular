        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a task to identify the intended sense of a word based on its context.",
        "All-words WSD is its variant, where all the unrestricted running words in text are expected to be disambiguated.",
        "In the all-words task, all the senses in a dictionary are potentially the target destination of classification, and purely supervised approaches inherently suffer from data-sparsity problem.",
        "The all-words task is also characterized by sense-interdependency of target words.",
        "As the target words are typically taken from the same text string, they are naturally expected to be interrelated.",
        "Disambiguation of a word should affect other words as an important clue.",
        "From such characteristics of the task, knowledge-based unsupervised approaches have been extensively studied.",
        "They compute dictionary-based sense similarity to find the most related senses among the words within a certain range of text.",
        "(For reviews, see (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006; Navigli, 2009).)",
        "In recent years, graph-based methods have attracted considerable attentions (Mihalcea, 2005; Navigli and Lapata, 2007; Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "On the graph structure of lexical knowledge base (LKB), random-walk or other well-known graph-based techniques have been applied to find mutually related senses among target words.",
        "Unlike earlier studies disambiguating word-by-word, the graph-based methods obtain sense-interdependent solution for target words.",
        "However, those methods mainly focus on modeling sense distribution and have less attention to contextual smoothing/generalization beyond immediate context.",
        "There exist several studies that enrich immediate context with large corpus statistics.",
        "McCarthy et al. (2004) proposed a method to combine sense similarity with distributional similarity and configured predominant sense score.",
        "Distributional similarity was used to weight the influence of context words, based on large-scale statistics.",
        "The method achieved successful WSD accuracy.",
        "Agirre et al. (2009) used a k-nearest words on distributional similarity as context words.",
        "They apply a LKB graph-based WSD to a target word together with the distributional context words, and showed that it yields better results on a domain dataset than just using immediate context words.",
        "Though these 884 studies are word-by-word WSD for target words, they demonstrated the effectiveness to enrich immediate context by corpus statistics.",
        "This paper proposes a smoothing model that integrates dictionary-based semantic similarity and corpus-based context statistics, where a combinatorial optimization scheme is employed to deal with sense interdependency of the all-words WSD task.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first describe our smoothing model in the following section.",
        "The combinatorial optimization method with the model is described in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes a specific implementation for evaluation.",

        "In Section 6 we discuss whether the intended context-to-sense mapping and the sense-interdependency are properly modeled.",

        "2 Smoothing Model Let us introduce in this section the basic idea for modeling context-to-sense mapping.",
        "The distance (or similarity) metrics are assumed to be given for context and for sense.",
        "A specific implementation of these metrics is described later in this paper, for now the context metric is generalized with a distance function dx(?, ?)",
        "and the sense metric with ds(?, ?).",

        "This dataset is denoted by X = {xi}Ni=1, where xi corresponds to the context of the i-th word but not the word by itself.",

        "Let the two-tuple hij = (xi, sij) be the hypothesis that the intended sense in xi is sij .",
        "The hypothesis is an element of the direct product H = X ?",
        "S. As (X, dx) and (S, ds) each composes a metric space, H is also a metric space, provided a proper distance definition with dx and ds.",
        "Here, we treat the space H as a continuous one, which means that we assume the relationship between context and sense can be generalized in continuous fashion.",
        "In natural language processing, continuity has been sometimes assumed for linguistic phenomena including word context for corpus based WSD.",
        "As for classes or senses, it may not be a common assumption.",

        "We here analyze the second peak conditions at k = 30 (JCN) and k = 10 (Lesk) instead of the first peak at k = 5, because we can observe tendency the better with the larger number of word interactions.",

        "On the contrary, if we take nearby words that are biased to particular words, the sense distribution also becomes biased, and the extrapolation becomes less reliable.",

        "Our method generalize context representation.",
        "In the evaluation, our method was compared to SemEval-2 systems.",
        "The main subject of the SemEval-2 task was domain adaptation, therefore those systems each exploited their own adaptation techniques.",
        "Kulkarni et al. (2010) used a WordNet pre-pruning.",
        "Disambiguation is performed by considering only those candidate synsets that belong to the top-k largest connected components of the WordNet on domain corpus.",

        "They disambiguated each target word using its distributionally similar words instead of its immediate context words.",
        "The proposed method is an extension of density estimation (Parzen, 1962), which is a construction of an estimate based on observed data.",
        "Our method naturally extends the density estimation in two points, which make it applicable to unsupervised knowledge-based WSD.",
        "First, we introduce stochastic treatment of data, which is no longer observations but hypotheses having ambiguity.",
        "This extension makes the hypotheses possible to cross-validate the plausibility each other.",
        "Second, we extend the definition of density from Euclidean distance to general metric, which makes the proposed method applicable to a wide variety of corpus-based context similarities and dictionary-based sense similarities.",

        "Detailed inspection of dynamics clearly show that the proposed optimization method effectively exploit the sense-dependency of all-words.",
