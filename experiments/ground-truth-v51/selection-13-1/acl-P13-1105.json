        "In past decades supervised methods achieved the state-of-the-art in constituency parsing (Collins, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) and dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2006; Nivre et al., 2006; Nivre et al., 2007; Koo and Collins, 2010).",
        "For supervised models, the human-annotated corpora on which models are trained, however, are expensive and difficult to build.",
        "As alternative strategies, methods which utilize raw texts have been investigated recently, including unsupervised methods which use only raw texts (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; William et al., 2009), and semi-supervised methods (Koo et al., 2008) which use both raw texts and annotated corpus.",
        "And there are a lot of efforts have also been devoted to bilingual projection (Chen et al., 2010), which resorts to bilingual text with one language parsed, and projects the syntactic information from the parsed language to the unparsed one (Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009).",
        "In dependency grammar induction, unsupervised methods achieve continuous improvements in recent years (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Bod, 2006; William et al., 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010).",
        "Relying on a predefined distributional assumption and iteratively maximizing an approximate indicator (entropy, likelihood, etc.",
        "), an unsupervised model usually suffers from two drawbacks, i.e., lower performance and higher computational cost.",
        "On the contrary, bilingual projection (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang and Liu, 2010) seems a promising substitute for languages with a large amount of bilingual sentences and an existing parser of the counterpart language.",
        "By projecting syntactic structures directly (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang and Liu, 2010) across bilingual texts or indirectly across multilingual texts (Snyder et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011; Naseem et al., 2012), a better dependency grammar can be easily induced, if syntactic isomorphism is largely maintained between target and source languages.",

        "part language.",
        "Considering this, we propose a novel strategy for automatically inducing a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency information, which integrates the advantage of bilingual projection into the unsupervised framework.",
        "A randomly-initialized monolingual treebank evolves in a self-training iterative procedure, and the grammar parameters are tuned to simultaneously maximize both the monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood of the evolving treebank.",
        "The monolingual likelihood is similar to the optimization objectives of conventional unsupervised models, while the bilingually-projected likelihood is the product of the projected probabilities of dependency trees.",
        "By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, we can automatically induce a monolingual dependency grammar which is much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction.",
        "In addition, since both likelihoods are fundamentally factorized into dependency edges (of the hypothesis tree), the computational complexity approaches to unsupervised models, while with much faster convergence.",
        "We evaluate the final automatically-induced dependency parsing model on 5 languages.",
        "Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous work based on unsupervised method or indirect/direct dependency projection, where we see an average improvement of 28.5% over unsupervised baseline on all languages, and the improvements are 3.9%/3.0% over indirect/direct baselines.",
        "And our model achieves the most significant gains on Chinese, where the improvements are 12.0%, 4.5% over indirect and direct projection baselines respectively.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we first describe the unsupervised dependency grammar induction framework in section 2 (where the unsupervised optimization objective is given), and introduce the bilingual projection method for dependency parsing in section 3 (where the projected optimization objective is given); Then in section 4 we present the bilingually-guided induction strategy for dependency grammar (where the two objectives above are jointly optimized, as shown in Figure 1).",
