        "The desire to incorporate high-dimensional sparse feature representations into statistical machine translation (SMT) models has driven recent research away from Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003), and toward other discriminative methods that can optimize more features.",
        "Examples include minimum risk (Smith and Eis-ner, 2006), pairwise ranking (PRO) (Hopkins and May, 2011), RAMPION (Gimpel and Smith, 2012), and variations of the margin-infused relaxation algorithm (MIRA) (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Cherry and Foster, 2012).",
        "While the objective function and optimization method vary for each optimizer, they can all be broadly described as learning a linear model, or parameter vector w, which is used to score alternative translation hypotheses.",
        "In every SMT system, and in machine learning in general, the goal of learning is to find a model that generalizes well, i.e. one that will yield good translations for previously unseen sentences.",
        "However, as the dimension of the feature space increases, generalization becomes increasingly difficult.",
        "Since only a small portion of all (sparse) features may be observed in a relatively small fixed set of instances during tuning, we are prone to overfit the training data.",
        "An alternative approach for solving this problem is estimating discriminative feature weights directly on the training bi-text (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Blunsom et al., 2008; Simianer et al., 2012), which is usually substantially larger than the tuning set, but this is complementary to our goal here of better generalization given a fixed size tuning set.",
        "In order to achieve that goal, we need to carefully choose what objective to optimize, and how to perform parameter estimation of w for this objective.",
        "We focus on large-margin methods such as SVM (Joachims, 1998) and passive-aggressive algorithms such as MIRA.",
        "Intuitively these seek a w such that the separating distance in geometric space of two hypotheses is at least as large as the cost incurred by selecting the incorrect one.",
        "This criterion performs well in practice at finding a linear separator in high-dimensional feature spaces (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; Crammer et al., 2006).",
        "Now, recent advances in machine learning have shown that the generalization ability of these learners can be improved by utilizing second order information, as in the Second Order Perceptron (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2005), Gaussian Margin Machines (Crammer et al., 2009b), confidence-weighted learning (Dredze and Crammer, 2008), AROW (Crammer et al., 2009a; Chiang, 2012) and Relative Margin Machines (RMM) (Shiv-aswamy and Jebara, 2009b).",
        "The latter, RMM, was introduced as an effective and less computationally expensive way to incorporate the spread of the data ?",
        "second order information about the",
        "distance between hypotheses when projected onto the line defined by the weight vector w. Unfortunately, not all advances in machine learning are easy to apply to structured prediction problems such as SMT; the latter often involve latent variables and surrogate references, resulting in loss functions that have not been well explored in machine learning (Mcallester and Keshet, 2011; Gimpel and Smith, 2012).",
        "Although Shivaswamy and Jebara extended RMM to handle sequential structured prediction (Shivaswamy and Jebara, 2009a), their batch approach to quadratic optimization, using existing off-the-shelf QP solvers, does not provide a practical solution: as Taskar et al.",
        "(2006) observe, ?off-the-shelf QP solvers tend to scale poorly with problem and training sample size?",
        "for structured prediction problems..",
        "This motivates an online gradient-based optimization approach?an approach that is particularly attractive because its simple update is well suited for efficiently processing structured objects with sparse features (Crammer et al., 2012).",
        "The contributions of this paper include (1) introduction of a loss function for structured RMM in the SMT setting, with surrogate reference translations and latent variables; (2) an online gradient-based solver, RM, with a closed-form parameter update to optimize the relative margin loss; and (3) an efficient implementation that integrates well with the open source cdec SMT system (Dyer et al., 2010).1 In addition, (4) as our solution is not dependent on any specific QP solver, it can be easily incorporated into practically any gradient-based learning algorithm.",
        "After background discussion on learning in SMT (?2), we introduce a novel online learning algorithm for relative margin maximization suitable for SMT (?3).",
        "First, we introduce RMM (?3.1) and propose a latent structured relative margin objective which incorporates cost-augmented hypothesis selection and latent variables.",
        "Then, we derive a simple closed-form online update necessary to create a large margin solution while simultaneously bounding the spread of the projection of the data (?3.2).",
        "Chinese-English translation experiments show that our algorithm, RM, significantly outperforms strong state-of-the-art optimizers, in both a basic feature setting and high-dimensional (sparse) feature space (?4).",
        "Additional Arabic-English experiments further validate these results,",
        "even where previously MERT was shown to be advantageous (?5).",

        "RAMPION performed similarly to RM on the smaller feature set.",
        "RM's loss was only up to 0.8 BLEU (0.7 TER) from MERT or MIRA, while its gains were up to 1.7 BLEU and 2.1 TER over MIRA.",
        "as an indication for the importance of bounding the spread.",
        "Spread analysis: For RM, the average spread of the projected data in the Chinese-English small feature set was 0.9?3.6 for all tuning iterations, and 0.7?2.9 for the iteration with the highest decoder performance.",
        "In comparison, the spread of the data for MIRA was 5.9?20.5 for the best iteration.",
        "In the sparse setting, RM had an average spread of 0.9?2.4 for the best iteration, while MIRA had a spread of 14.0?31.1.",
        "Similarly, on Arabic-English, RM had a spread of 0.7?2.4 in the small setting, and 0.82?1.4 in the sparse setting, while MIRA's spread was 9.4?26.8 and 11.4?22.1, for the small and sparse settings, respectively.",
        "Notice that the average spread for RM stays about the same when moving to higher dimensions, with the variance decreasing in both cases.",
        "For MIRA, however, the average spread increases in both cases, with the variance being much higher than RM.",
        "For instance, observe that the spread of MIRA on Chinese grows from 5.9 to 14.0 in the sparse feature setting.",
        "While bounding the spread is useful in the low-dimensional setting (0.7-1.5 BLEU gain with RM over MIRA as shown in Table 3), accounting for the spread is even more crucial with sparse features, where MIRA gains only up to 0.1 BLEU, while RM gains 1 BLEU.",
        "These results support the claim that our imposed bound B indeed helps decrease the spread, and that, in turn, lower spread yields better generalization performance.",
        "Error Analysis: The inconclusive advantage of RM over MIRA (in BLEU vs. TER scores) on Arabic-English MT08 calls for a closer look.",
        "Therefore we conducted a coarse error analysis on 15 randomly selected sentences from MERT, RMM and MIRA, with basic and sparse feature settings for the latter two.",
        "This sample yielded 450 data points for analysis: output of the 5 conditions on 15 sentences scored in 6 violation categories.",
        "The categories were: function word drop, content word drop, syntactic error (with a reasonable meaning), semantic error (regardless of syntax), word order issues, and function word mistranslation and ?hallucination?.",
        "The purpose of this analysis was to get a qualitative feel for the output of each model, and a better idea as to why we obtained performance improvements.",
        "RM no",
        "ticeably had more word order and excess/wrong function word issues in the basic feature setting than any optimizer.",
        "However, RM seemed to benefit the most from the sparse features, as its bad word order rate dropped close toMIRA, and its excess/wrong function word rate dropped below that of MIRA with sparse features (MIRA's rate actually doubled from its basic feature set).",
        "We conjecture both these issues will be ameliorated with syntactic features such as those in Chiang et al. (2008).",
        "This correlates with our observation that RM's overall BLEU score is negatively impacted by the BP, as the BLEU precision scores are noticeably higher.",
        "K-best: RM is potentially more sensitive to the size and order of the k-best list.",
        "While MIRA is only concerned with the margin between y+ and y?, RM also accounts for the distance between y+ and yw.",

        "selection, such as bold updating, local updating (Liang et al., 2006b), or max-BLEU updating (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006) might have a greater impact.",
        "Also, we only explored several settings of B, and there remains a continuum of RM solutions that trade off between margin and spread in different ways.",
        "Active features: Perhaps contrary to expectation, we did not see evidence of a correlation between the number of active features and optimizer performance.",
        "RAMPION, with the fewest features, is the closest performer to RM in Chinese, while MIRA, with a greater number, is the closest on Arabic.",

      "text": [
        "We have introduced RM, a novel online margin-based algorithm designed for optimizing high-dimensional feature spaces, which introduces constraints into a large-margin optimizer that bound the spread of the projection of the data while maximizing the margin.",
        "The closed-form online update for our relative margin solution accounts for surrogate references and latent variables.",
        "Experimentation in statistical MT yielded significant improvements over several other state-of-the-art optimizers, especially in a high-dimensional feature space (up to 2 BLEU and 4.3 TER on average).",
        "Overall, RM achieves the best or comparable performance according to two scoring methods in two language pairs, with two test sets each, in small and large feature settings.",
        "Moreover, across conditions, RM always yielded the best combined TER-BLEU score.",
        "These improvements are achieved using standard, relatively small tuning sets, contrasted with improvements involving sparse features obtained using much larger tuning sets, on the order of hundreds of thousands of sentences (Liang et al., 2006a; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Blunsom et al., 2008; Simianer et al., 2012).",
        "Since our approach is complementary to scaling up the tuning data, in future work we intend to combine these two methods.",
        "In future work we also intend to explore using additional sparse features that are known to be useful in translation, e.g. syntactic features explored by Chiang et al. (2008).",
        "Finally, although motivated by statistical machine translation, RM is a gradient-based method that can easily be applied to other problems.",
        "We plan to investigate its utility elsewhere in NLP (e.g. for parsing) as well as in other domains involving high-dimensional structured prediction."
