        "We have presented HEADY, an abstractive headline generation system based on the generalization of syntactic patterns by means of a Noisy-OR Bayesian network.",
        "We evaluated the model both automatically and through human annotations.",
        "HEADY performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art open domain abstractive model (Filippova, 2010) in all evaluations, and is in par with human-generated headlines in terms of ROUGE scores.",
        "We have shown that it is possible to achieve high quality generation of news headlines in an open-domain, unsupervised setting by successfully exploiting syntactic and ontological information.",
        "The system relies on a standard NLP pipeline, requires no manual data annotation and can effectively scale to web-sized corpora.",
        "For feature work, we plan to improve all components of HEADY in order to fill in the gap with the human-generated titles in terms of readability and informativeness.",
        "One of the directions in which we plan to move is the removal of the syntactic heuristics that currently enforce pattern well-formedness and to automatically learn the necessary transformations from the data.",
        "Two other lines of work that we plan to explore are the possibility of personalizing the headlines to user interests (as stored in user profiles or expressed as user queries), and to investigate further applications of the Bayesian network of event patterns, such as its use for relation extraction and knowledge base population."
