        "Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) research.",
        "The challenge stems from the fact that an accurate reordering hinges upon the model's ability to make many local and global reordering decisions accurately.",
        "Often, such reordering decisions require contexts that span across multiple translation units.",
        "Unfortunately, previous approaches fall short in capturing such cross-unit contextual information that could be critical in reordering.",
        "1 We define translation units as phrases in phrase-based SMT, and as translation rules in syntax-based SMT.",
        "Specifically, the popular distortion or lexicalized reordering models in phrase-based SMT focus only on making good local prediction (i.e. predicting the orientation of immediate neighboring translation units), while translation rules in syntax-based SMT come with a strong context-free assumption, which model only the reordering within the confine of the rules.",
        "In this paper, we argue that reordering modeling would greatly benefit from richer cross-boundary contextual information We introduce a reordering model that incorporates such contextual information, named the Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model.",
        "We first identify anchors as regions in the source sentences around which ambiguous reordering patterns frequently occur and chunks as regions that are consistent with word alignment which may span multiple translation units at decoding time.",
        "Most no-tably, anchors and chunks in our model may not necessarily respect the boundaries of translation units.",
        "Then, we jointly model the orientations of chunks that immediately precede and follow the anchors (hence, the name 'two-neighbor')",
        "along with the maximal span of these chunks, to which we refer as Maximal Orientation Span (MOS).",
        "As we will elaborate further in next sections, our models provide a stronger mechanism to make more accurate global reordering decisions for the following reasons.",
        "First of all, we consider the orientation decisions on both sides of the anchors simultaneously, in contrast to existing works that only consider one-sided decisions.",
        "In this way, we hope to upgrade the unigram formulation of existing reordering models to a higher order formulation.",
        "Second of all, we capture the reordering of chunks that may cross translation units and may be composed of multiple units, in contrast to ex-1264 isting works that focus on the reordering between individual translation units.",
        "In effect, MOS acts as a global reordering parameter that guides or constrains the underlying local reordering decisions.",
        "To show the effectiveness of our model, we integrate our TNO model into a state-of-the-art syntax-based SMT system, which uses synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) rules to jointly model reordering and lexical translation.",
        "The introduction of nonterminals in the SCFG rules provides some degree of generalization.",
        "However as mentioned earlier, the context-free assumption ingrained in the syntax-based formalism often limits the model's ability to influence global reordering decision that involves cross-boundary contexts.",
        "In integrating TNO, we hope to strengthen syntax-based system's ability to make more accurate global reordering decisions.",
        "Our other contribution in this paper is a practical method for integrating the TNO model into syntax-based translations.",
        "The integration is non-trivial since the decoding of syntax-based SMT proceeds in a bottom-up fashion, while our model is more natural for top-down parsing, thus the model's full context sometimes is often available only at the latest stage of decoding.",
        "We implement an efficient shift-reduce algorithm that facilitates the accumulation of partial context in a bottom-up fashion, allowing our model to influence the translation process even in the absence of full context.",
        "We show the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task where the introduction of our TNO model provides a significant gain over a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency SMT system (Shen et al., 2008) that we enhance with additional state-of-the-art features.",
        "Even though the experimental results carried out in this paper employ SCFG-based SMT systems, we would like to point out that our models is applicable to other systems including phrase-based SMT systems.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the formulation of our TNO model.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce and motivate the concept of Maximal Orientation Span.",
        "In Section 4, we introduce four variants of the TNO model with different model complexities.",
        "In Section 5, we describe the training procedure to estimate the parameters of our models.",
        "In Section 6, we describe our shift-reduce algorithm which integrates our proposed TNO model into syntax-based SMT.",
        "In Section 7, we describe our experiments and present our results.",

        "UOM views reordering as a process of generating (b, o) in a left-to-right fashion, where b is the current phrase pair and o is the orientation of b with the previously generated phrase pair b'.",
        "UOM makes strong independence assumptions and formulates the model as P (o|b).",

        "Their original intent is to model P (o, b|o', b'",
        "), but perhaps due to sparsity concerns, they settle with P (o|b, b'",
        "), dropping the conditioning on the previous orientation o'.",
        "Subsequent improvements use the P (o|b, b')",
        "formula, for example, for incorporating various linguistics feature like part-of-speech (Zens and Ney, 2006), syntactic (Chang et al., 2009), dependency information (Bach et al., 2009) and predicate-argument structure (Xiong et al., 2012).",
        "Our TNO model is more faithful to the BOM's original formulation.",
        "Our MOS concept is also closely related to hierarchical reordering model (Galley and Manning, 2008) in phrase-based decoding, which computes o of b with respect to a multi-block unit that may go beyond b'.",
        "They mainly use it to avoid overestimating 'discontiguous'",
        "orientation but fall short in modeling the multi-block unit, perhaps due to data sparsity issue.",

        "(Xiong et al., 2009) learn the boundaries from parsed and aligned training data, while (Xiong et al., 2010) learn the boundaries from aligned training data alone.",
        "Recent work couples span modeling tightly with reordering decisions, either by adding an additional feature for each hierarchical phrase (Chiang et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2009) or by refining the nonterminal label (Venugopal et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010; Zollmann and Vo-gel, 2011).",

        "However, we provide a discriminative treatment to the model to include a richer set of features including the MOS modeling.",
        "Our work in incorporating global context also intersects with existing work in Preordering Model (PM), e.g. (Niehues and Kolss, 2009; Costa-jussa` and Fonollosa, 2006; Genzel, 2010; Visweswariah et al., 2011; Tromble and Eisner, 2009).",
        "The goal of PM is to reorder the input sentence F into F '",
        "whose order is closer to the target language order, whereas the goal of our model is to directly reorder F into the target language order.",
        "The crucial difference is that we have to integrate our model into SMT decoder, which is highly non-trivial.",
        "9 Conclusion We presented a novel approach to address a kind of long-distance reordering that requires global cross-boundary contextual information.",
