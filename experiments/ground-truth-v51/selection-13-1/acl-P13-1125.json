        "This approach generates alignments that are 2.6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner.",
        "The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1.8 BLEU points on the NIST MT-08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses manual word alignments, and a gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline."

        "Dealing with word order differences between source and target languages presents a significant challenge for machine translation systems.",
        "Failing to produce target words in the correct order results in machine translation output that is not fluent and is often very hard to understand.",
        "These problems are particularly severe when translating between languages which have very different structure.",
        "Phrase based systems (Koehn et al., 2003) use lexicalized distortion models (Al-Onaizan and Pa-pineni, 2006; Tillman, 2004) and scores from the target language model to produce words in the correct order in the target language.",
        "These systems typically are only able to capture short range re-orderings and the amount of data required to potentially capture longer range reordering phenomena is prohibitively large.",
        "There has been a large body of work showing the efficacy of preordering source sentences using a source parser and applying hand written or automatically learned rules (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Ramanathan et al., 2009; Xia and Mc-Cord, 2004; Genzel, 2010; Visweswariah et al., 2010).",
        "Recently, approaches that address the problem of word order differences between the source and target language without requiring a high quality source or target parser have been proposed (DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Visweswariah et al., 2011; Neubig et al., 2012).",
        "These methods use a small corpus of manual word alignments (where the words in the source sentence are manually aligned to the words in the target sentence) to learn a model to preorder the source sentence to match target order.",
        "In this paper, we build upon the approach in (Visweswariah et al., 2011) which uses manual word alignments for learning a reordering model.",
        "Specifically, we show that we can significantly improve reordering performance by using a large number of sentence pairs for which manual word alignments are not available.",
        "The motivation for going beyond manual word alignments is clear: the reordering model can have millions of features and estimating weights for the features on thousands of sentences of manual word alignments is",
        "likely to be inadequate.",
        "One approach to deal with this problem would be to use only part-of-speech tags as features for all but the most frequent words.",
        "This will cut down on the number of features and perhaps the model would be learnable with a small set of manual word alignments.",
        "Unfortunately, as we will see in the experimental section, leaving out lexical information from the models hurts performance even with a relatively small set of manual word alignments.",
        "Another option would be to collect more manual word alignments but this is undesirable because it is time consuming and expensive.",
        "The challenge in going beyond manual word alignments and using machine alignments is the noise in the machine alignments which affects the performance of the reordering model (see Section 5).",
        "We illustrate this with the help of a motivating example.",
        "Consider the example English sentence and its translation shown in Figure 1.",
        "He went to the stadium to play vaha khelne keliye stadium ko gaya",
        "its Urdu translation with alignment links.",
        "Red (dotted) links are incorrect links while the blue (dashed) links are the corresponding correct links.",
        "A standard word alignment algorithm that we used (McCarley et al., 2011) made the mistake of misaligning the Urdu ko and keliye (it switched the two).",
        "Deriving reference reorderings from these wrong alignments would give us an incorrect reordering.",
        "A reordering model trained on such incorrect reorderings would obviously perform poorly.",
        "Our task is thus twofold (i) improve the quality of machine alignments (ii) use these less noisy alignments to derive cleaner training data for a reordering model.",
        "Before proceeding, we first point out that the two tasks, viz., reordering and word alignment are related: Having perfect reordering makes the alignment task easier while having perfect alignments in turn makes the task of finding reorderings trivial.",
        "Motivated by this fact, we introduce models that allow us to connect the source/target reordering and the word alignments and show that these models help in mutually improving the performance of word alignments and reordering.",
        "Specifically, we build two models: the first scores reorderings given the source sentence and noisy alignments, the second scores alignments given the noisy source and target reorderings and the source and target sentences themselves.",
        "The second model helps produce better alignments, while we use the first model to help generate better reference reordering given noisy alignments.",
        "These improved reference reorderings will then be used to train a reordering model.",
        "Our experiments show that reordering models trained using these improved machine alignments perform significantly better than models trained only on manual word alignments.",
        "This results in a 1.8 BLEU point gain in machine translation performance on an Urdu-English machine translation task over a preordering model trained using only manual word alignments.",
        "In all, this increases the gain in performance by using the preordering model to 5.2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based system with no preordering.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the main reordering issues in Urdu-English translation.",
        "Section 3 introduces the reordering modeling framework that forms the basis for our work.",

        "Dealing with the problem of handling word order differences in machine translation has recently received much attention.",
        "The approaches proposed for solving this problem can be broadly divided into 3 sets as discussed below.",
        "The first set of approaches handle the reordering problem as part of the decoding process.",
        "Hierarchical models (Chiang, 2007) and syntax based models (Yamada and Knight, 2002; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Zollmann and Venu-gopal, 2006) improve upon the simpler phrase based models but with significant additional computational cost (compared with phrase based systems) due to the inclusion of chart based parsing in the decoding process.",
        "Syntax based models also require a high quality source or target language parser.",
        "The second set of approaches rely on a source language parser and treat reordering as a separate process that is applied on the source language sentence at training and test time before using a standard approach to machine translation.",
        "Preordering the source data with hand written or automatically learned rules is effective and efficient (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Ramanathan et al., 2009; Xia and McCord, 2004; Genzel, 2010; Visweswariah et al., 2010) but requires a source language parser.",
        "Recent approaches that avoid the need for a source or target language parser and retain the efficiency of preordering models were proposed in (Tromble and Eisner, 2009; DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Visweswariah et al., 2011; Neubig et al., 2012).",
        "(DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Visweswariah et al., 2011; Neubig et al., 2012) focus on the use of manual word alignments to learn preordering models and in both cases no benefit was obtained by using the parallel corpus in addition to manual word alignments.",
        "Our work is an extension of Visweswariah et al. (2011) and we focus on being able to incorporate relatively noisy machine alignments to improve the reordering model.",
        "In addition to being related to work in reordering, our work is also more broadly related to several other efforts which we now outline.",
        "Setiawan et al. (2010) proposed the use of function word reordering to improve alignments.",
        "While this work is similar to one of our models (model of alignments given reordering) we differ in using a reordering model of all words (not just function words) and both source and target sentences (not just the source sentence).",
        "The task of directly learning a reordering model for language pairs that are very different is closely related to the task of parsing and hence work on semi-supervised parsing (Koo et al., 2008; McClosky et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2009) is broadly related to our work.",
        "Our work coupling reordering and alignments is also similar in spirit to approaches where parsing and alignment are coupled (Wu, 1997)."

      "text": [
        "In the paper we showed that a reordering model can benefit from data beyond a relatively small corpus of manual word alignments.",
        "We proposed a model that scores reorderings given alignments and the source sentence that we use to generate cleaner training data from noisy alignments.",
        "We also proposed a model that scores alignments given source and target sentence reorderings that improves a supervised alignment model by 2.6 points in f-Measure.",
        "While the improvement in alignment performance is modest, the improvement does result in improved reordering models.",
        "Cumulatively, we see a gain of 1.8 BLEU points over a baseline reordering model that only uses manual word alignments, a gain of 2.0 BLEU points over a hierarchical phrase based system, and a gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a phrase based",
        "system that uses no source preordering on a publicly available Urdu-English test set.",
        "As future work we would like to evaluate our models on other language pairs.",
        "Another avenue of future work we would like to explore is the use of monolingual source and target data to further assist the reordering model.",
        "We hope to be able to learn lexical information such as how many arguments a verb takes, what nouns are potential subjects for a given verb by gathering statistics from an English parser and projecting to the source language via our word/phrase translation table."
