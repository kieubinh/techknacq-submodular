        "Novels are important as social communication documents, in which novelists develop the plot by means of discourse between various characters.",
        "In spite of a frequently expressed opinion that all novels are simply variations of a certain number of basic plots (Tobias, 2012), every novel has a unique plot (or several plots) and a different set of characters.",
        "The interactions among characters, especially in the form of conversations, help the readers construct a mental model of the plot and the changing relationships between characters.",
        "Many of the complexities of interpersonal relationships, such as romantic interests, family ties, and rivalries, are conveyed by utterances.",
        "A precondition for understanding the relationship between characters and plot development in a novel is the identification of speakers behind all utterances.",
        "However, the majority of utterances are not explicitly tagged with speaker names, as is the case in stage plays and film scripts.",
        "In most cases, authors rely instead on the readers?",
        "comprehension of the story and of the differences between characters.",
        "Since manual annotation of novels is costly, a system for automatically determining speakers of utterances would facilitate other tasks related to the processing of literary texts.",
        "Speaker identification could also be applied on its own, for instance in generating high quality audio books without human lectors, where each character would be identifiable by a distinct way of speaking.",
        "In addition, research on spoken language processing for broadcast and multi-party meetings (Salamin et al., 2010; Favre et al., 2009) has demonstrated that the analysis of dialogues is useful for the study of social interactions.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the task of speaker identification in novels.",
        "Departing from previous approaches, we develop a general system that can be trained on relatively small annotated data sets, and subsequently applied to other novels for which no annotation is available.",
        "Since every novel has its own set of characters, speaker identification cannot be formulated as a straightforward tagging problem with a universal set of fixed tags.",
        "Instead, we adopt a ranking approach, which enables our model to be applied to literary texts that are different from the ones it has been trained on.",
        "Our approach is grounded in a variety of features that are easily generalizable across different novels.",
        "Rather than attempt to construct complete semantic models of the interactions, we exploit lexical and syntactic clues in the text itself.",
        "We propose several novel features, including the speaker alternation pattern, the presence of vocatives in utterances, and unsupervised actor-topic features that associate speakers with utterances on the basis of their content.",
        "Experimental evaluation shows that our approach not only outperforms the baseline, but also compares favorably to previous approaches in terms of accuracy and generality, even when tested on novels and authors that are different from those used for training.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After discussing previous work, and defining the terminology, we present our approach and the features that it is based on.",
        "Next, we describe the data, the an",
        "notation details, and the results of our experimental evaluation.",
        "At the end, we discuss an application to extracting a set of family relationships from a novel."

        "To identify the speaker of a given utterance, they assume that all previous utterances are already correctly assigned to their speakers.",
        "Our approach differs in considering the utterances in a sequence, rather than independently from each other, and in removing the unrealistic assumption that the previous utterances are correctly identified.",

        "The term dialogue denotes a series of utterances together with related narratives, which provide the context of conversations.",
        "We define a dialogue as a series of utterances and intervening narratives, with no more than three continuous narratives.",
        "The rationale here is that more than three narratives without any utterances are likely to signal the end of a particular dialogue.",

        "anaphoric speaker (identified by an anaphoric expression), and implicit speaker (no speaker information within the paragraph).",

        "In this section, we describe an application of the speaker identification system to the extraction of family relationships.",
        "Elson et al. (2010) extract unlabeled networks where the nodes represent characters and edges indicate their proximity, as indicated by their interactions.",
        "Our goal is to construct networks in which edges are la-beled by the mutual relationships between characters in a novel.",
        "We focus on family relationships, but also include social relationships, such as friend",
        "Our approach to building a social network from the novel is to build an active database of relationships explicitly mentioned in the text, which is expanded by triggering the execution of queries that deduce implicit relations.",
        "This inference process is repeated for every discovered relationship until no new knowledge can be inferred.",
        "The following example illustrates how speaker identification helps in the extraction of social relations among characters.",
        "Consider, the following conversation: ?How so?",
        "how can it affect them??",
        "?My dear Mr. Bennet,?",
        "replied his wife, ?how can you be so tiresome!?",
        "If the speakers are correctly identified, the utterances are attributed to Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, the second utterance implies that its speaker is the wife of the preceding speaker.",
        "This is an example of an explicit relationship which is included in our database.",
        "Several similar extraction rules are used to extract explicit mentions indicating family and affective relations, including mother, nephew, and fiancee.",
        "We can also derive relationships that are not explicitly mentioned in the text; for example, that Mr. Bennet is the husband of Mrs. Bennet.",
        "Figure 3 shows a snippet of the relational database of the network extracted from Pride & Prejudice.",
        "Table Character contains all characters in the book, each with a unique identifier and gender information, while Table Relation contains all relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text or derived through reasoning.",
        "Figure 4 shows an example of an inference rule used in our system.",
        "The rule derives a new relationship indicating that character c1 is the wife of character c2 if it is known (through an explicit mention in the text) that c2 is the husband of c1.",
        "One condition for the rule to be applied is that the database must not already contain a record indicating the wife relationship.",
        "This inference rule would derive the tuple in Figure 3 indicating that the wife or Mr. Collins is Charlotte.",
        "In our experiment with Pride & Prejudice, a total of 55 explicitly indicated relationships were automatically identified once the utterances were attributed to the characters.",
        "From those, another 57 implicit relationships were derived through inference.",
        "A preliminary manual inspection of the set of relations extracted by this method (Makazhanov et al., 2012) indicates that all of them are correct, and include about 40% all personal relations that can be inferred by a human reader from the text of the novel."

        "We have presented a novel approach to identifying speakers of utterances in novels.",
        "Our system incorporates a variety of novel features which utilize vocatives, unsupervised actor-topic models, and the speaker alternation pattern.",
        "The results of our evaluation experiments indicate a substantial improvement over the current state of the art.",
        "There are several interesting directions for the future work.",
        "Although the approach introduced in this paper appears to be sufficiently general to handle novels written in a different style and period, more sophisticated statistical graphical models may achieve higher accuracy on this task.",
        "A reliable automatic generation of characters and their aliases would remove the need for the preprocessing step outlined in Section 6.",
        "The extraction of social networks in novels that we discussed in Section 8 would benefit from the introduction of additional inference rules, and could be extended to capture more subtle notions of sentiment or relationship among characters, as well as their development over time.",
        "We have demonstrated that speaker identification can help extract family relationships, but the converse is also true.",
        "Consider the following utterance: ?Lizzy,?",
        "said her father, ?I have given him my consent.",
        "?",
        "In order to deduce the speaker of the utterance, we need to combine the three pieces of information: (a) the utterance is addressed to Lizzy (vocative prediction), (b) the utterance is produced by Lizzy's father (pronoun resolution), and (c) Mr. Bennet is the father of Lizzy (relationship extraction).",
        "Similarly, in the task of compiling a list of characters, which involves resolving aliases such as Caroline, Caroline Bingley, and Miss Bingley, simultaneous extraction of family relationships would help detect the ambiguity of Miss Benett, which can refer to any of several sisters.",
        "A joint approach to resolving speaker attribution, relationship extraction, co-reference resolution, and alias-to-character mapping would not only improve the accuracy on all these tasks, but also represent a step towards deeper understanding of complex plots and stories."
