        "We wish to create a lexicon covering as many languages as possible, with as much useful information as possible.",
        "Generally, language resources, to be useful, must be both accessible (legal to use) and usable (of sufficient quality, size and with a documented interface) (Ishida, 2006).",
        "We address both of these concerns in this paper.",
        "One of the many attractions of the semantic network WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), is that there are numerous wordnets being built for different languages.",
        "There are, in addition, many projects for groups of languages: Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998), BalkaNet (Tufis?",
        "et al, 2004), Asian Wordnet (Charoenporn et al., 2008) and more.",
        "Although there are over 60 languages for which wordnets exist in some state of development (Fell-baum and Vossen, 2012, 316), less than half of these have released any data, and for those that have, the data is often not freely accessible (Bond and Paik, 2012).",
        "For those wordnets that are available, they are of widely varying size and quality, both in terms of accuracy and richness.",
        "Further, there is very little standardization in terms of format, what information is included, or license.",
        "The goal of the research outlined in this paper is to make it possible for a researcher interested in working on the lexical semantics of a language or languages to be able to access wordnets for those languages with a minimum of legal and technical barriers.",
        "In practice this means making it possible to access multiple wordnets with a common interface.",
        "We also use sources of semi-structured data that have minimal legal restrictions to automatically extend existing freely available wordnets and to create additional wordnets which can be added to our open wordnet grid.",
        "Previous studies have leveraged multiple wordnets and Wiktionary (Wikimedia, 2013) to extend existing wordnets or create new ones (de Melo and Weikum, 2009; Hanoka and Sagot, 2012).",
        "These studies passed over the valuable sense groupings of translations within Wiktionary and merely used Wiktionary as a source of translations that were not disambiguated according to sense.",
        "The present study built and extended wordnets by directly linking Wiktionary senses to WordNet senses.",
        "Meyer and Gurevych (2011) demonstrated the ability to automatically identify many matching senses in Wiktionary and WordNet based on the similarity of monolingual features.",
        "Our study combines monolingual features with the disambiguating power of multiple languages.",
        "In addition to differences in linking methodology, our project gives special attention to ensuring the maximum re-usability and accessibility of the data and software released.",
        "Other large scale multilingual lexicons have been made by linking wordnet to Wikipedia (Wikipedia, 2013; de Melo and Weikum, 2010; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012).",
        "Our approach is complementary to these: in general Wikipedia has more entities than classes, while Wiktionary has more classes.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss linking freely available wordnets to form a single multilingual semantic network.",
        "In Section 3 we extend the wordnets with data from two sources.",
        "We show the results in Section 4 and then discuss them and outline future",
        "work in Section 5."

        "In order to make the data from existing wordnet projects more accessible, we have built a simple database with information from those wordnets with licenses that allow redistribution of the data.",
        "These wordnets, their licenses and recent activity are summarized in Table 1 (sizes for most of them are shown in Table 2).1",
        "The first wordnet developed is the Princeton WordNet (PWN: Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "It is a large lexical database of English.",
        "Open class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) are grouped into concepts represented by sets of synonyms (synsets).",
        "Synsets are linked by semantic relations such as hyponomy and meronomy.",
        "PWN is released under an open license (allowing one to use, copy, modify and distribute it so long as you properly acknowledge the copyright).",
        "The majority of freely available wordnets take the basic structure of the PWN and add new lemmas (words) to the existing synsets: the extend model (Vossen, 2005).",
        "For example, dogn:1 is linked to the lemmas chien in French, anjing in Malay, and so on.",
        "It is widely realized that this 1We have now added Mandarin Chinese.",
        "model is imperfect as different languages lexical-ize different concepts and link them in different ways (Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012).",
        "Nevertheless, many projects have found that the overall structure of PWN serves as a useful scaffold.",
        "The fact that, for example, a dogn:1 is an animaln:1 is language independent.",
        "In theory, such wordnets can easily be combined into a single resource by using the PWN synsets as pivots.",
        "All languages are linked through the English wordnet.",
        "Because they are linked at the synset level, the problem of ambiguity one gets when linking bilingual dictionaries through a common language is resolved: we are linking senses to senses.",
        "In practice, linking a new language's wordnet into the grid could be problematic for three reasons.",
        "The first problem was that the wordnets were linked to various versions of the Princeton WordNet.",
        "In order to combine them into a single multilingual structure, we had to map to a common version.",
        "The second problem was the incredible variety of formats that the wordnets are distributed in.",
        "Almost every project uses a different format.",
        "Even different versions of the same project often had slightly different formats.",
        "The final problem was legal: not all wordnets have been released under licenses that allow reuse.",
        "The first problem can largely be overcome using the mapping scripts from Daude et al. (2003).",
        "Mapping introduces some distortions, in particular, when a synset is split, we chose to only map the translations to the most probable mapping, so some new synsets will have no translations.",
        "The second problem we are currently solving through brute force, writing a new script for every new project we add.",
        "We make these scripts, along with the reformatted wordnets, freely available for download.",
        "Any problems or bugs found when converting the wordnets have been reported back to the original projects, with many of them fixed in newer releases.",
        "We consider this feedback to be an important part of our work: it means that other researchers and users do not have to suffer from the same problems and it encourages projects to release updates.",
        "The third, legal, problem is being solved by an ongoing campaign to encourage projects to (re-)release their data under open licenses.",
        "Since Bond and Paik (2012) surveyed wordnet licenses in 2011, six projects have newly released data un",
        "der open licenses and eight projects have updated their data.",

        "On our server, the wordnets are all in a shared sqlite database using the schema produced by the Japanese WordNet project (Isahara et al., 2008).",
        "The database is based on the logical structure of the Princeton WordNet, with an additional language attribute for lemmas, examples, definitions and senses.",
        "It is a single open multilingual resource.",
        "When we redistribute the data, each project's data is made available separately, with a common format, but separate licenses.",
        "The Scandinavian and Polish wordnets are based on the merge approach, where independent language specific structures are built and then some synsets linked to PWN.",

        "Although anyone can edit a Wiktionary page and use any style of formatting they desire, the community of users encourages adhering to established guidelines, which produces a format that is generally predictable.",

        "These sense groups are marked by a short text gloss (short gloss), which is usually an abbreviated version of one of the full definitions (full definition).",
        "The parser makes no attempt to match these short glosses with the full definitions.",
        "Data is simply extracted, cleaned, and then stored in a relational database or flat file.",
        "Translations proved to be easy to extract due to the fairly consistent use of a specifically formatted translation template.",

        "Examples of translation templates:",
        "To enable later processing, it is necessary to tie synonyms and translations to their corresponding short gloss via a unique key.",
        "Most parsers simply use an automatically generated surrogate key or a key based on the ordered position of data within a Wiktionary article.",
        "Since Wiktionary is constantly changing, the side effect of this approach is that data extracted from a specific snapshot of the Wiktionary database can only be meaningfully used in connection with other data extracted by the same parser from the exact same snapshot.",
        "To overcome this, we use a unique key that can be recreated from the data itself, which we call the defkey.",
        "To generate this key, we concatenate the language code, headword, part of speech, and the short gloss and use the sha1 hash function (NIST, 2012) to create a unique 40-character hexadecimal string from the resulting text.",

        "Conversely, if a Wiktionary contributor changes a short gloss, historical data connected to the old defkey is preserved while new data imported at a later time will not be incorrectly linked to an older definition.",
        "Another feature of our parser is a feedback mode, which generates a report about poorly for-mated data that was encountered.",
        "These automatically generated reports can be used to create a quality-enhancing feedback loop with Wiktionary.",
        "Meyer and Gurevych (2011) showed that automatic alignments between Wiktionary senses and PWN can be established with reasonable accuracy and recall by combining multiple text similarity scores to compare a bag of words based on several pieces of information linked to a WordNet sense with another bag of words obtained from a Wiktionary entry.",
        "In our study we evaluated the potential for aligning senses based on common translations in combination with monolingual similarity features.",
        "In this study we used 20 of the wordnets described in Section 2,9 and the Wiktionary data obtained using the parser described in Section 3.2.1.",
        "Before searching for translation matches, we normalized the data to ensure the most accurate possible overlap count.",
        "First, article headwords were included as English translations of Wiktionary senses (along with synonyms).",
        "Then differences in language codes were rectified and translations containing symbolic characters or a mixture of ro-man and non-roman characters were marked to be ignored, save a few exceptions.",
        "This left approximately 1.4 million sense translations in 20 languages in our wordnet grid, and nearly 1.3 million Wiktionary translations in over 1,000 languages.",
        "We then created a list of all possible alignments where at least one translation of a wordnet sense matched a translation of a Wiktionary sense.",
        "This represented a small percentage of the possible alignments, because definitions in Wiktionary that do not contain any translations were ignored in our study.",
        "Of more than 500,000 English definitions in Wiktionary, only about 130,000 presently have associated translations.",
        "The resulting graph contained over 700,000 possible sense alignments.",

        "Finally, where the short definition was blank and only a long definition was present, we aligned the two.",
        "The results of this alignment were less than 90% accurate, so to offset the effects of this noise we included both the full definition and the short gloss in wkdef.",

        "We make the data available in two ways.",

        "Each language has up to three files: the data from the wordnet project (if it exists), the data from the CLDR and the data from Wiktionary.",
        "They are kept separate in order",
        "to keep the licenses as free as possible.",
        "The second is as two on-line searches: one using only the data from the projects, and one with all the data combined.",
        "The combination is done by simple union.12 We maintain this separation as we cannot guarantee the quality of the automatically extracted data.",
        "Because the raw data is there it is possible to combine them in other ways.",

        "We have created a large open wordnet of high quality (85%?99% measured on senses).",
        "Twenty six languages have more than 10,000 concepts covered, with 42?100% coverage of the most common core concepts.",
        "The data is easily downloadable with minimal restrictions.",
        "The overall accuracy is estimated at over 94%, as most of the original wordnets are hand verified (and so should be 100% accurate).",
        "The high accuracy is largely thanks to the disambiguating power of the multiple translations, made possible by the many open wordnets we have access to.",
        "Because we link senses between wordnet and Wiktionary and then use the translations of the sense, manually validating this mapping will improve the entries in multiple languages simultaneously.",
        "As the Wiktionary-wordnet algnment mapping is linked to persistent keys it will remain useful even as the resources change.",
        "Further, it can be used to identify and add missing senses to wordnet: unmapped Wiktionary entries are candidates for new concepts.",
        "The Universal Wordnet (UWN: de Melo and Weikum, 2009) brings in data from even more resources, and combines them to make a larger resource, choosing parameters with slightly lower precision (just under 90%).",
        "It is further linked to Wikipedia, adding many named entities.",
        "We expect that our work is complementary.",
        "Because we use a different approach, it would be possible to merge the two if the licenses allowed us to.",
        "However, since the CC BY-SA and CC-BY-NC-SA licenses are mutually exclusive, the two works cannot be combined and rereleased unless relevant parties can relicense the works.",
        "There is no easy way to improve UWN beyond checking each and every entry, which is expensive.",
        "An ad-12http://casta-net.jp/~kuribayashi/multi/ vantage of our approach, noted above, is that we can validate the sense matches for English and the accuracy percolates down to all the languages.",
        "Integrating data from the most recent version of Wiktionary can be done simply and takes a few hours.",
        "It is therefore feasible to update the downloadable data regularly.",
        "Improvements in either the wordnet projects or Wiktionary (or both) can also result in improved mappings.",
        "We further hope to take advantage of ongoing initiatives in the global wordnet grid to add new concepts not in the Princeton WordNet, so that we can expand beyond an English-centered world view.",
        "By making the data from multiple sources easily available with minimal restrictions, we hope that it will be easier to do research that exploits lexical semantics.",
        "In particular, we make the data easily accessible to the original wordnet projects, some of whom have already started to merge it into their own resources.",
        "We cannot check the accuracy of data in all languages, nor, for example, check that synsets have the most appropriate lemmas associated with them.",
        "Many languages have their own orthographic issues (for example a choice of scripts, or the choice to include vowels or not).",
        "Our automatic extraction does not deal with these issues at all.",
        "This kind of language specific quality control is best done by the individual wordnet projects.",
        "We also consider it important to keep feeding data back to the individual wordnet projects, as much of the innovative research comes from them: the class/instance distinction from PWN; the distinction between rigid and non-rigid synsets from the Kyoto Project; domain mappings from the MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002); representing orthographic variation from the Japanese Wordnet (Kuroda et al., 2011); combining close languages from the Wordnet Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana et al., 2011); and so on.",
        "For all of these reasons, we do not consider automatic extraction from/linking to Wiktionary a substitute for building languages specific wordnets.",
        "Further work that this data should allow us to do include: automatically producing a list of bad data found in Wiktionary that can be used by Wiktionary editors to correct errors; and finding gaps in wordnet by identifying senses in Wiktionary that have a large number of translations, but fail to have any significant alignment with existing wordnet synsets.",
        "We currently only link through the English Wiktionary and its translations.",
        "It should be possible to expand the multilingual wordnet in the same way using Wiktionaries in other languages, which we would expect to improve coverage.",
        "Finally, Wiktionary contains a lot of useful information we are not currently using (information on gender, transliterations, pronunciations, alternative spellings and so forth).",
        "We can also think of the aligned definitions as a paraphrase corpus for English.",
        "We have devoted more space than is usual for a computational linguistics paper to issues of licensing and sustainability.",
        "This is deliberate: we feel papers about lexical resources should be clear about licensing, and that it should be considered early on when creating new resources.",
        "There are strong arguments that open data leads to better science (Pederson, 2008), and it has been shown that open resources are cited more (Bond and Paik, 2012).",
        "In addition, how to maintain resources over time is a major unsolved problem.",
        "We consider it important that our wordnet is not just large and accurate but also maintainable and as accessible as possible."
