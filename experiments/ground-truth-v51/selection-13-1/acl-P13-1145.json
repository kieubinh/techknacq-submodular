        "The task of event extraction is to recognize event mentions of a predefined event type and their arguments (participants and attributes).",
        "Generally, it can be divided into two subtasks: trigger extraction, which aims to identify trigger/event mentions and determine their event type, and argument extraction, which aims to extract various arguments of a specific event and assign the roles to them.",
        "In this paper, we focus on argument extraction in Chinese event extraction.",
        "While most of previous studies in Chinese event extraction deal with Chinese trigger extraction (e.g., Chen and Ji, 2009a; Qin et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b), there are only a few on Chinese argument extraction (e.g., Tan et al., 2008; Chen and Ji, 2009b).",
        "Following previous studies, we divide argument extraction into two components, argument identification and role determination, where the former recognizes the arguments in a specific event mention and the latter classifies these arguments by roles.",
        "With regard to methodology, most of previous studies on argument extraction recast it as a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task and focus on intra-sentence information to identify the arguments and their roles.",
        "However, argument extraction is much different from SRL in the sense that, while the relationship between a predicate and its arguments in SRL can be mainly decided from the syntactic structure, the relationship between an event trigger and its arguments are more semantics-based, especially in Chinese, as a paratactic (e.g., discourse-driven and pro-drop) language with the wide spread of ellipsis and the open flexible sentence structure.",
        "Therefore, some arguments of a specific event mention are far away from the trigger and how to recover those inter-sentence arguments becomes a challenging issue in Chinese argument extraction.",
        "Consider the following discourse (from ACE 2005 Chinese corpus) as a sample: D1: ???????????????",
        "20 ?",
        "????????????(E1)?????",
        "(E2)?????????????(E3)??",
        "(The Palestinian National Authority denied any involvement in the bomb attack (E2) occurred in the Gaza Strip on the morning of the 20th, which killed (E1) two Israelites.",

        "They claimed that they will be investigating this attack (E3).)",
        "- From CBS20001120.1000.0823 In above discourse, there are three event mentions, one kill (E1) and two Attack (E2, E3).",
        "While it is relatively easy to identify 20???",
        "(morning of 20th), ????",
        "(Gaza Strip) and ?",
        "?",
        "(bomb) as the Time, Place and Instrument roles in E2 by a sentence-based argument",
        "extractor, it is really challenging to recognize these entities as the arguments of its corefered mention E3 since to reduce redundancy in a Chinese discourse, the later Chinese sentences omit many of these entities already mentioned in previous sentences.",
        "Similarly, it is hard to recognize ??????",
        "(two Israelites) as the Target role for event mention E2 and identify?",
        "?",
        "(bomb) as the Instrument role for event mention E1.",
        "An alternative way is to employ various relationships among relevant event mentions in a discourse to infer those inter-sentence arguments.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: 1) We propose a novel global argument inference model, in which various kinds of event relations are involved to infer more arguments on their semantic relations.",
        "2) Different from Liao and Grishman (2010) and Hong et al. (2011), which only consider document-level consistency, we propose a more fine-gained consistency model to enforce the consistency in the sentence, discourse and document layers.",
        "3) We incorporate argument semantics into our global argument inference model to unify the semantics of the event and its arguments.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 overviews the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes a state-of-the-art Chinese argument extraction system as the baseline.",
        "Section 4 introduces our global model in inferring those inter-sentence arguments.",
        "Section 5 reports experimental results and gives deep analysis.",

        "In the task of event extraction as defined in ACE evaluations, an event is defined as a specific occurrence involving participants (e.g., Person, Attacker, Agent, Defendant) and attributes (e.g., Place, Time).",

        "The arguments are the entity mentions involved in an event mention with a specific role, the relation of an argument to an event where it participates.",
        "Hence, extracting an event consists of four basic steps, identifying an event trigger, determining its event type, identifying involved arguments (participants and attributes) and determining their roles.",
        "As the baseline, we choose a state-of-the-art Chinese event extraction system, as described in Li et al. (2012b), which consists of four typical components: trigger identification, event type determination, argument identification and role determination.",

        "It's well-known that Chinese is a paratactic language, with an open flexible sentence structure and often omits the subject or the object, while English is a hypotactic language with a strict sentence structure and emphasizes on cohesion between clauses.",
        "Hence, there are two issues in Chinese argument extraction, associated with its nature of the paratactic language.",
        "The first is that many arguments of an event mention are out of the event mention scope since ellipsis is a common phenomenon in Chinese.",
        "We call them inter-sentence arguments in this paper.",
        "Table 1 gives the statistics of intra-sentence and inter-sentence arguments in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus and it shows that 20.8% of the arguments are inter-sentence ones while this figure is less than 1% of the ACE 2005 English corpus.",
        "The main reason of that difference is that some Chinese arguments are omitted in the same sentence of the trigger since Chinese is a paratactic language with the wide spread of ellipsis.",
        "Besides, a Chinese sentence does not always end with a full stop.",
        "In particular, a comma is used frequently as the stop sign of a sentence in Chinese.",
        "We detect sentence boundaries, relying on both full stop and comma signs, since in a Chinese document, comma can be also used to sign the end of a sentence.",
        "In particular, we detect sentence boundaries on full stop, exclamatory mark and question mark firstly.",
        "Then, we identify the sentence boundaries on comma, using a binary classifier with a set of lexical and constituent-based syntactic features, similar to Xue and Yang (2010).",
        "with regard to intra-sentence and inter-sentence arguments.",
        "The second issue is that the Chinese word order in a sentence is rather agile for the open",
        "flexible sentence structure.",
        "Hence, different word orders can often express the same semantics.",
        "For example, a Die event mention ?Three person died in this accident.?",
        "can be expressed in many different orders in Chinese, such as ??????",
        "????",
        "?, ?????????",
        "?, ??????",
        "????",
        "?, etc.",
        "In a word, above two issues indicate that syntactic feature-based approaches are limited in identifying Chinese arguments and it will lead to low recall in argument identification.",
        "Therefore, employing those high level information to capture the semantic relation, not only the syntactic structure, between the trigger and its long distance arguments is the key to improve the performance of the Chinese argument identification.",
        "Unfortunately, it is really hard to find their direct relations since they always appear in different clauses or sentences.",
        "An alternative way is to link the different event mentions with their predicates (triggers) and use the trigger as a bridge to connect the arguments to the trigger in another event mention indirectly.",
