        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential for a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as information extraction.",
        "There has been a fair amount of work on NER for a variety of languages including Arabic.",
        "To train an NER system, some of the following feature types are typically used (Benajiba and Rosso, 2008; Nadeau and Sekine, 2009): - Orthographic features: These features include capitalization, punctuation, existence of digits, etc.",
        "One of the most effective orthographic features is capitalization in English, which helps NER to generalize to new text of different genres.",
        "However, capitalization is not very useful in some languages such as German, and nonexistent in other languages such as Arabic.",
        "Further, even in English social media, capitalization may be inconsistent.",
        "- Contextual features: Certain words are indicative of the existence of named entities.",
        "For example, the word ?said?",
        "is often preceded by a named entity of type ?person?",
        "or ?organization?.",
        "Sequence labeling algorithms (ex.",
        "Conditional Random Fields (CRF)) can often identify such indicative words.",
        "- Character-level features: These features typically include the leading and trailing letters of words.",
        "In some languages, these letters could prefixes and suffixes.",
        "Such features can be indicative or counter-indicative of the existence of named entities.",
        "For example, a word ending with ?ing?",
        "is typically not a named entity, while a word ending in ?berg?",
        "is often a named entity.",
        "- Part-of-speech (POS) tags and morphological features: POS tags indicate (or counter-indicate) the possible presence of a named entity at word level or at word sequence level.",
        "Morphological features can mostly indicate the absence of named entities.",
        "For example, Arabic allows the attachment of pronouns to nouns and verbs.",
        "However, pronouns are rarely ever attached to named entities.",
        "- Gazetteers: This feature checks the presence of a word or a sequence of words in large lists of named entities.",
        "If gazetteers are small, then they would have low coverage, and if they are very large then their entries may be ambiguous.",
        "For example, ?syntax?",
        "may refer to sentence construction or the music band ?Syntax?.",
        "Typically, a subset of these features are available for different languages.",
        "For example, morphological, contextual, and character-level features have been shown to be effective for Arabic NER (Bena-jiba and Rosso, 2008).",
        "However, Arabic lacks indicative orthographic features that generalize to previously unseen named entities.",
        "Also, although some",
        "of the Arabic gazetteers that were used for NER were small (Benajiba and Rosso, 2008), there has been efforts to build larger Arabic gazetteers (Attia et al., 2010).",
        "Since training and test parts of standard datasets for Arabic NER are drawn from the same genre in relatively close temporal proximity, a named entity recognizer that simply memorizes named entities in the training set generally performs well on such test sets.",
        "Thus, the results that are reported in the literature are generally high (Abdul-Hamid and Darwish, 2010; Benajiba et al., 2008).",
        "We illustrate the limited capacity of existing recognizers to generalize to previously unseen named entities using two new test sets that include microblogs as well as news texts that cover local and international politics, economics, health, sports, entertainment, and science.",
        "As we will show later, recall is well below 50% for all named entity types on the new test sets.",
        "To address this problem, we introduce the use of cross-lingual links between a disadvantaged language, Arabic, and a language with good discriminative features and large resources, English, to improve Arabic NER.",
        "We exploit English's orthographic features, particularly capitalization, as well as Arabic and English Wikipedias, including existing annotations from large knowledge sources such as DBpedia.",
        "We also show how to use transliteration mining to improve NER, even when neither language has a capitalization (or similar) feature.",
        "The intuition is that if the translation of a word is in fact a transliteration, then the word is likely a named entity.",
        "Cross-lingual links are obtained using Wikipedia cross-language links and a large Machine Translation (MT) phrase table that is true cased, where word casing is preserved during training.",
        "We show the effectiveness of these new features on a standard dataset as well as two new test sets.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows:",
        "- Using cross-lingual links to exploit orthographic features in other languages.",
        "- Employing transliteration mining to improve NER.",
        "- Using cross-lingual links to exploit a large knowledge base, namely English DBpedia, to benefit NER.",
        "- Introducing two new NER test sets for Arabic that include recent news as well as microblogs.",
        "We plan to release these test sets.",
        "- Improving over the best reported results in the liter",
        "ature by 4.1% (Abdul-Hamid and Darwish, 2010) by strictly adding cross-lingual features.",
        "We also show improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new test sets.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides related work; Section 3 describes the baseline system; Section 4 introduces the cross-lingual features and reports on their effectiveness; and Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "For many NLP tasks, some languages may have significantly more training data, better knowledge resources, or more discriminating features than other languages.",
        "If cross-lingual resources are available, such as parallel data, increased training data, better resources, or superior features can be used to improve the processing (ex.",
        "tagging) for other languages (Ganchev et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2010; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001).",
        "Some work has attempted to use bilingual features in NER.",
        "Burkett et al. (2010) used bilingual text to improve monolingual models including NER models for German, which lacks a good capitalization feature.",
        "They did so by training a bilingual model and then generating more training data from unlabeled parallel data.",
        "They showed significant improvement in German NER effectiveness, particularly for recall.",
        "In our work, there is no need for tagged text that has a parallel equivalent in another language.",
        "Benajiba et al.",
        "(2008) used an Arabic English dictionary from MADA, an Arabic analyzer, to indicate if a word is capitalized in English or not.",
        "They reported that it was the second most discriminating feature that they used.",
        "However, there seems to be room for improvement because: (1) MADA's dictionary is relatively small and would have low coverage; and (2) the use of such a binary feature is problematic, because Arabic names are often common Arabic words and hence a word may be translated as a named entity and as a common word.",
        "To overcome these two problems, we use cross-lingual features to improve NER using large bilingual resources, and we incorporate confidences to avoid having a binary feature.",
        "Richman and Schone (2008) used English linguis",
        "tic tools and cross language links in Wikipedia to automatically annotate text in different languages.",
        "Transliteration Mining (TM) has been used to enrich MT phrase tables or to improve cross language search (Udupa et al., 2009).",
        "Conversely, people have used NER to determine if a word is to be transliterated or not (Hermjakob et al., 2008).",
        "However, we are not aware of any prior work on using TM to determine if a sequence is a NE.",
        "Further, we are not aware of prior work on using TM (or transliteration in general) as a cross lingual feature in any annotation task.",

        "This led to a 17.1% improvement in overall F-measure.",
        "We also tested NER on the TWEETS test set, where we observed substantial improvements in recall (35.9%).",
        "However, precision dropped by 6.2% for the reasons we mentioned earlier.",
        "For future work, it would be interesting to apply cross-lingual features to other language pairs and to make use of joint cross-lingual models.",
