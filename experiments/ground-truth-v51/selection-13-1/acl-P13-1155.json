        "Social Media text is usually very noisy and contains a lot of typos, ad-hoc abbreviations, phonetic substitutions, customized abbreviations and slang language.",
        "The social media text is evolving with new entities, words and expressions.",
        "Natural language processing and understanding systems such as Machine Translation, Information Extraction and Text-to-Speech are usually trained and optimized for clean data; therefore such systems would face a challenging problem with social media text.",
        "Various social media genres developed distinct characteristics.",
        "For example, SMS developed a nature of shortening messages to avoid multiple keystrokes.",
        "On the other hand, Facebook and instant messaging developed another genre where more emotional expressions and different abbreviations are very common.",
        "Somewhere in between, Twitter's statuses come with some brevity similar to SMS along with the social aspect of Facebook.",
        "On the same time, various social media genres share many characteristics and typo styles.",
        "For example, repeating letters or punctuation for emphasizing and emotional expression such as ?",
        "?goooood morniiing??.",
        "Using phonetic spelling in a generalized way or to reflect a local accent; such as ?",
        "?wuz up bro??",

        "(before).",
        "Substituting phonetically similar letters such as ??phone??",

        "Slang abbreviations which usually abbreviates multi-word expression such as ??LMS??",
        "(like my status) , ??idk??",
        "(i do not know), ??rofl??",
        "(rolling on floor laughing).",
        "While social media genres share many characteristics, they have significant differences as well.",
        "It is crucial to have a solution for text normalization that can adapt to such variations automatically.",
        "We propose a text normalization approach using an unsupervised method to induce normalization equivalences from noisy data which can adapt to any genre of social media.",
        "In this paper, we focus on providing a solution for social media text normalization as a preprocessing step for NLP applications.",
        "However, this is a challenging problem for several reasons.",
        "First, it is not straightforward to define the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Traditionally, an OOV word is defined as a word that does not exist in the vocabulary of a given system.",
        "However, this definition is not adequate for the social media text which has a very dynamic nature.",
        "Many words and named entities that do not exist in a given vocabulary should not be considered for normalization.",
        "Second, same OOV word may have many",
        "appropriate normalization depending on the context and on the domain.",
        "Third, text normalization as a preprocessing step should have very high precision; in other words, it should provide conservative and confident normalization and not over-correct.",
        "Moreover, the text normalization should have high recall, as well, to have a good impact on the NLP applications.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a social media text normalization system which addresses the challenges mentioned above.",
        "The proposed system is based on constructing a lattice from possible normalization candidates and finding the best normalization sequence according to an n-gram language model using a Viterbi decoder.",
        "We propose an unsupervised approach to learn the normalization candidates from unlabeled text data.",
        "The proposed approach uses RandomWalks on a contextual similarity graph constructed form n-gram sequences on large unlabeled text corpus.",
        "The proposed approach is very scalable, accurate and adaptive to any domain and language.",
        "We evaluate the approach on the normalization task as well as machine translation task.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section(2) discusses the related work, Section(3) introduces the text normalization system and the baseline candidate generators, Section(4) introduces the proposed graph-based lexicon induction approach, Section(5) discusses the experiments and output analysis, and finally Section(6) concludes and discusses future work."

        "Some researchers used Statistical Machine Translation approach for text normalization; formalizing the problem as a translation from the noisy forms to the normalized forms.",
        "(Aw et al., 2006) proposed an approach for normalizing Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts by translating it into normalized forms using Phrase-based SMT techniques on character level.",
        "The main drawback of these approaches is that the noisy channel model cannot accurately represent the errors types without contextual information.",
        "More recent approaches tried to handle the text normalization problem using normalization lexicons which map the noisy form of the word to a normalized form.",
        "For example, (Han et al., 2011) proposed an approach using a classifier to identify the noisy words candidate for normalization; then using some rules to generate lexical variants and a small normalization lexicon.",

        "More recently, (Han et al., 2012) introduced a similar approach by generating a normalization lexicon based on distributional similarity and string similarity.",
        "This approach uses pairwise similarity where any two words that share the same context are considered as normalization equivalences.",
        "The pairwise approach has a number of limitations.",
        "First, it does not take into account the relative frequencies of the normalization equivalences that might share different contexts.",
        "Therefore, the selection of the normalization equivalences is performed on pairwise basis only and is not optimized over the whole data.",
        "Secondly, the normalization equivalences must appear in the exact same context to be considered as a normalization candidate.",
        "These limitations affect the accuracy and the coverage of the produced lexicon.",
        "Our approach also adopts a lexicon based approach for text normalization, we construct a lattice from possible normalization candidates and find the best normalization sequence according to an n-gram language model using a Viterbi decoder.",
        "The normalization lexicon is acquired from unlabeled data using random walks on a contextual similarity graph constructed form n-gram sequences on large unlabeled text corpus.",
        "Our approach has some similarities with (Han et al., 2012) since both approaches utilize a normaliza",
        "tion lexicon acquired form unlabeled data using distributional and string similarities.",
        "However, our approach is significantly different since we acquire the lexicon using random walks on a contextual similarity graph which has a number of advantages over the pairwise similarity approach used in (Han et al., 2012).",
        "Namely, the acquired normalization equivalence are optimized globally over the whole data, the rare equivalences are not considered as good candidates unless there is a strong statistical evidence across the data, and finally the normalization equivalences may not share the same context.",
        "Those are clear advantages over the pairwise similarity approach and result in a lexicon with higher accuracy as well as wider coverage.",
        "Those advantages will be clearer when we describe the proposed approach in details and during evaluation and comparison to the pairwise approach."
