        "We present a mobile dialogue system (an Android app) called Spacebook that addresses the problem of pedestrian navigation and tourist information in urban environments.",
        "There has been little prior work that addresses these two problems - navigation and tourist information provision - in an integrated way.",
        "By navigation, we refer to the problem of finding appropriate destinations to go to and the task of wayfinding to reach them and by tourist information provision we refer to the problem of meeting the informational needs of a user about entities such as museums, statues and famous personalities.",
        "A dialogue system such as this could serve as a personal tour guide to pedestrian tourists as they walk around unknown cities.",
        "With the proliferation of smartphones, there has been a number of mobile apps developed to address these problems.",
        "However these apps have the following problems: first, they demand the user's visual attention because they predominantly present information on a mobile screen.",
        "This can be dangerous in urban environments, as well as being distracting.",
        "Second, these apps address the problems of navigation and tourist information independently and therefore do not have a shared interaction context.",
        "This means that users cannot switch between information and navigation tasks in a natural and",
        "ated system In contrast to many existing mobile apps, Spacebook has a speech-only interface and addresses both problems in an integrated way.",
        "We conjecture that with a speech-only interface, users can immerse themselves in exploring the city, and that because of the shared context they can switch between navigation and tourist information tasks more easily.",
        "Using the navigational context, Spacebook pushes point-of-interest information which can then initiate tourist information tasks using the QA module.",
        "Table 1 presents an example interaction with our system showing the integrated use of navigation and question-answering capabil",
        "ities.",
        "Utterances System4-8 show the system's capability to push information about nearby points-of-interest (PoI) during a navigation task and answer followup questions using the QA system (in utterances User2 and User3).",
        "The final 3 utterances show a natural switch between navigation to an entity and QA about that entity.",
        "We investigate whether our system using a combination of geographical information system (GIS) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies would be a better companion to pedestrian city explorers than the current state-of-the-art mobile apps.",
        "We hypothesize that, (1) users will find our speech-only interface to navigation efficient as it allows them to navigate without having to repeatedly look at a map and (2), that users will find a dialogue interface which integrates touris-tic question-answering and navigation within a shared context to be useful for finding information about entities in the urban environment.",
        "We first present some related work in section 2.",
        "We describe the architecture of the system in section 3.",
        "We then present our experimental design, results and analysis in sections 5, 6 and 7."

        "We evaluated the system against a state-of-the-art baseline (Samsung S-Voice with Google Navigation and Search) with a group of 17 users in the streets of Edinburgh.",
        "We found that users found Spacebook interesting to interact with, and that it was their system of choice for touristic information exploration tasks.",
        "These results were statistically significant.",
        "Based on observations and user ratings, we conclude that our speech-only system was less preferred for navigation and more preferred for tourist information tasks due to features such as PoI pushing and the integrated QA module, when compared to the baseline system.",
        "Younger users, who used Spacebook, even felt that they learned new facts about the city."
