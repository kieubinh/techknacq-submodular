        "Social media platforms have enabled people from anywhere in the world to express their views and discuss any issue of interest in online discussions/debates.",
        "Existing works in this context include recognition of support and oppose camps (Agrawal et al., 2003), mining of authorities and subgroups (Mayfield and Ros?, 2011; Abu-Jbara et al. (2012), dialogue act segmentation and classification (Morbini and Sagae, 2011; Boyer et al., 2011), etc.",
        "This paper probes further to study a different and important angle, i.e., the psycholinguistic phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions.",
        "Tolerance is an important concept in the field of communications.",
        "It is a subfacet of deliberation which refers to critical thinking and exchange of rational arguments on an issue among participants that seek to achieve consensus/solution (Habermas, 1984).",
        "Perhaps the most widely accepted definition of tolerance is that of Gastil (2005; 2007), who defines tolerance as a means to engage (in written or spoken communication) in critical thinking, judicious argument, sound reasoning, and justifiable claims through constructive discussion as opposed to mere coercion/egotistic clashes of ideologies.",
        "In this work, we adopt this definition, and also employ the following characteristics of tolerance (also known as ?code of conduct?)",
        "(Crocker, 2005; Gutmann and Thompson, 1996) to guide our work.",
        "Reciprocity: Each member (or participant) offers proposals and justifications in terms that others could understand and accept.",
        "Publicity: Each member engages in a process that is transparent to all and each member knows with whom he is agreeing or disagreeing.",
        "Accountability: Each member gives acceptable and sound reasons to others on the various claims or proposals suggested by him.",
        "Mutual respect and civic integrity: Each member's speech should be morally acceptable, i.e., using proper language irrespective of agreement or disagreement of views.",
        "The issue of tolerance has been actively researched in the field of communications for the past two decades, and has been investigated in multiple dimensions.",
        "However, existing studies are typically qualitative and focus on theorizing the sociolinguistic aspects of tolerance (more details in ?2).",
        "With the rapid growth of social media, the large volumes of online discussions/debates offer a golden opportunity to investigate people's implicit psyche in discussions quantitatively based on the real-life data, i.e., their tolerance levels and their arguing nature, which are of fundamental interest to several fields, e.g., communications, marketing, politics, and sociology (Dahlgren, 2005; Gastil, 2005; Moxey and",
        "Sanford, 2000).",
        "Communication and political scholars are hopeful that technologies capable of identifying tolerance levels of people on social issues (often discussed in online discussions) can render vital statistics which can be used in predicting political outcomes in elections and helpful in tailoring voting campaigns and agendas to maximize winning chances (Dahlgren, 2002).",
        "Objective: The objective of this work is twofold:",
        "1.",
        "Identifying tolerant and intolerant participants in discussions.",
        "2.",
        "Analyzing how disagreement affects tolerance and estimating the tipping point of such",
        "effects.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, these tasks have not been attempted quantitatively before.",
        "The first task is a classification/prediction problem.",
        "Due to the complex and interactive nature of discussions, the traditional n-gram features are no longer sufficient for accurate classification.",
        "We thus propose a generative model, called DTM, to discover some key pieces of information which characterize the nature of discussions and their participants, e.g., the arguing nature (agreeing vs. disagreeing), topic and expression distributions.",
        "These allow us to generate a set of novel features from the estimated latent variables of DTM capable of capturing authors?",
        "tolerance psyche during discussions.",
        "The features are then used in learning to identify tolerant and intolerant authors.",
        "Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms several strong baselines significantly.",
        "The second task studies the interplay of tolerance and disagreement.",
        "It is well-known that tolerance facilitates constructive disagreements, but sustained disagreements often result in a transition to destructive disagreement leading to polarization and intolerance (Dahlgren, 2005).",
        "An interesting question is: What is the tipping point of disagreement to exhibit intolerance?",
        "We take a Bayesian approach to seek an answer and discover issue-specific tipping points.",
        "Our empirical results discover some interesting relationships which are supported by theoretical studies in psychology and linguistic communications.",
        "Finally, this work also produces an annotated corpus of tolerant and intolerant users in online discussions across two domains: politics and religion.",

        "Ryfe (2005) provided a comprehensive survey of the literature.",
        "The topic has been studied in multiple dimensions, e.g., opinion and attitude (Luskin et al., 2004; Price et al., 2002), public engagement (Escobar, 2012), psychoanalysis (Slavin and Kriegman, 1992), argument repertoire (Cappella et al., 2002), etc.",
        "Tolerance has also been investigated in the domain of political communications with an emphasis on political sophistication (Gastil and Dillard, 1999), civic culture (Dahlgren, 2002), and democracy (Fishkin, 1991).",
        "These existing works study tolerance from the qualitative perspective.",
        "Our focus is quantitative analysis.",
        "Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis determines positive or negative opinions expressed on topics (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Main tasks include aspect extraction (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012c; Chen et al., 2013), opinion polarity identification (Hassan and Radev, 2010; Choi and Cardie, 2010) and subjectivity analysis (Wiebe, 2000).",
        "Although related, tolerance is different from sentiment.",
        "Sentiments are mainly indicated by sentiment terms (e.g., great, good, bad, and poor).",
        "Tolerance in discussions refers to the reception of certain views and often indicated by agreement and disagreement expressions and other features (?5).",
        "Online discussions or debates: Several works put authors in debate into support and oppose camps.",
        "Agrawal et al. (2003) used a graph based method, and Murakami and Raymond (2010) used a rule-based method.",
        "In (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a), contention points were identified, in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012b), various expressions in review comment discussions were mined, and in (Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003), speaker utterances were classified into agreement, disagreement, and backchannel classes.",
        "Also related are studies on linguistic style accommodation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012d) and user pair interactions (Mukherjee and Liu, 2013) in online debates.",
        "However, these works do not consider tolerance analysis in debate discussions, which is the focus of this work.",
        "In a similar vein, several classification methods have been proposed to recognize opinion stances and speaker sides in online debates (So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Burfoot et al., 2011; Yessenalina et al., 2010).",
        "Lin and Hauptmann (2006) also proposed a method to identify opposing perspectives.",
        "Abu-Jbara et al. (2012) identified subgroups.",
        "Kim and Hovy (2007) studied election prediction by analyzing online discussions.",
        "Other related works studying dialogue and discourse in discussions include authority recognition (Mayfield and Ros?, 2011), dialogue act segmentation and classification (Morbini and Sagae, 2011; Boyer et al., 2011), discourse structure prediction (Wang et al., 2011).",
        "All these prior works are valuable.",
