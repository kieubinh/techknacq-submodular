        "Research is a collaborative effort to increase knowledge.",
        "While it includes validating previous approaches, our experience is that most research output in our field focuses on presenting new approaches, and to a somewhat lesser extent building upon existing work.",
        "In this paper, we argue that the value of research that attempts to replicate previous approaches goes beyond simply validating what is already known.",
        "It is also an essential aspect for building upon existing approaches.",
        "Especially when validation fails or variations in results are found, systematic testing helps to obtain a clearer picture of both the approach itself and of the meaning of state-of-the-art results leading to a better insight into the quality of new approaches in relation to previous work.",
        "We support our claims by presenting two use cases that aim to reproduce results of previous work in two key NLP technologies: measuring WordNet similarity and Named Entity Recognition (NER).",
        "Besides highlighting the difficulty of repeating other researchers?",
        "work, new insights about the approaches emerged that were not presented in the original papers.",
        "This last point shows that reproducing results is not merely part of good practice in science, but also an essential part in gaining a better understanding of the methods we use.",
        "Likewise, the problems we face in reproducing previous results are not merely frustrating inconveniences, but also pointers to research questions that deserve deeper investigation.",
        "We investigated five aspects that cause experimental variation that are not typically described in publications: preprocessing (e.g. tokenisa-tion), experimental setup (e.g. splitting data for cross-validation), versioning (e.g. which version of WordNet), system output (e.g. the exact features used for individual tokens in NER), and system variation (e.g. treatment of ties).",
        "As such, reproduction provides a platform for systematically testing individual aspects of an approach that contribute to a given result.",
        "What is the influence of the size of the dataset, for example?",
        "How does using a different dataset affect the results?",
        "What is a reasonable divergence between different runs of the same experiment?",
        "Finding answers to these questions enables us to better interpret our state-of-the-art results.",
        "Moreover, the experiments in this paper show that even while strictly trying to replicate a previous experiment, results may vary up to a point where they lead to different answers to the main question addressed by the experiment.",
        "The WordNet similarity experiment use case compares the performance of different similarity measures.",
        "We will show that the answer as to which measure works best changes depending on factors such as the gold standard used, the strategy towards part-of-speech or the ranking coefficient, all aspects that are typically not addressed in the literature.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are the following: 1) An in-depth analysis of two reproduction use cases in NLP 2) New insights into the state-of-the-art results for WordNet similarities and NER, found because of problems in reproducing prior research 3) A categorisation of aspects influencing reproduction of experiments and suggestions on testing their influence systematically The code, data and experimental setup for the WordNet experiments are available at http://github.com/antske/ WordNetSimilarity, and for the NER experiments at http://github.com/Mvanerp/ NER.",

        "This section provides a brief overview of recent work addressing reproduction and benchmark results in computer science related studies and discusses how our research fits in the overall picture.",
        "Most researchers agree that validating results entails that a method should lead to the same overall conclusions rather than producing the exact same numbers (Drummond, 2009; Dalle, 2012; Buchert and Nussbaum, 2012, etc.).",
        "In other words, we should strive to reproduce the same answer to a research question by different means, perhaps by reimplementing an algorithm or evaluating it on a new (in domain) data set.",
        "Replication has a somewhat more limited aim, and simply involves running the exact same system under the same conditions in order to get the exact same results as output.",
        "According to Drummond (2009) replication is not interesting, since it does not lead to new insights.",
        "On this point we disagree with Drummond (2009) as replication allows us to: 1) validate prior research, 2) improve on prior research without having to rebuild software from scratch, and 3) compare results of reimplementations and obtain the necessary insights to perform reproduction experiments.",
        "The outcome of our use cases confirms the statement that deeper insights into an approach can be obtained when all resources are available, an observation also made by Ince et al. (2012).",
        "Even if exact replication is not a goal many strive for, Ince et al. (2012) argue that insightful reproduction can be an (almost) impossible undertaking without the source code being available.",
        "Moreover, it is not always clear where replication stops and reproduction begins.",
        "Dalle (2012) distinguishes levels of reproducing results related to how close they are to the original work and how each contributes to research.",
        "In general, an increasing awareness of the importance of reproduction research and open code and data can be observed based on publications in high-profile journals (e.g.",
        "Nature (Ince et al., 2012)) and initiatives such as myExperiment.1 Howison and Herbsleb (2013) point out that, even though this is important, often not enough (academic) credit is gained from making resources available.",
        "What is worse, the same holds for research that investigates existing methods rather than introducing new ones, as illustrated by the question that is found on many review forms ?how novel is the presented approach??.",
        "On the other hand, initiatives for journals addressing exactly this issue (Neylon et al., 2012) and tracks focusing on results verification at conferences such as VLDB2 show that this opinion is not universal.",
        "A handful of use cases on reproducing or replicating results have been published.",
        "Louridas and Gousios (2012) present a use case revealing that source code alone is not enough for reproducing",
        "results, a point that is also made by Mende (2010) who provides an overview of all information required to replicate results.",
        "The experiments in this paper provide use cases that confirm the points brought out in the literature mentioned above.",
        "This includes both observations that a detailed level of information is required for truly insightful reproduction research as well as the claim that such research leads to better understanding of our techniques.",
        "Furthermore, the work in this paper relates to Bikel (2004)'s work.",
        "He provides all information needed in addition to Collins (1999) to replicate Collins?",
        "benchmark results.",
        "Our work is similar in that we also aim to fill in the blanks needed to replicate results.",
        "It must be noted, however, that the use cases in this paper have a significantly smaller scale than Bikel?s.",
        "Our research distinguishes itself from previous work, because it links the challenges of reproduction to what they mean for reported results beyond validation.",
        "Ruml (2010) mentions variations in outcome as a reason not to emphasise comparisons to benchmarks.",
        "Vanschoren et al. (2012) propose to use experimental databases to systematically test variations for machine learning, but neither links the two issues together.",
        "Raeder et al. (2010) come closest to our work in a critical study on the evaluation of machine learning.",
        "They show that choices in the methodology, such as data sets, evaluation metrics and type of cross-validation can influence the conclusions of an experiment, as we also find in our second use case.",
        "However, they focus on the problem of evaluation and recommendations on how to achieve consistent reproducible results.",
        "Our contribution is to investigate how much results vary.",
        "We cannot control how fellow researchers carry out their evaluation, but if we have an idea of the variations that typically occur within a system, we can better compare approaches for which not all details are known."

        "The fact that results of similarity measures on WordNet can differ even while the same software and same versions are used indicates that properties which are not addressed in the literature may influence the output of similarity measures.",
        "We therefore conducted a range of experiments that, in addition to searching for the right settings to replicate results of previous research, address the following questions:",

        "Leacock and Chodorow (1998) (lch), Resnik (1995) (res), Jiang and Conrath (1997) (jcn), Lin (1998) (lin), Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) (lesk), Hirst and St-Onge (1998) (hso) and Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) (vector and vpairs) respectively.",
        "Consequently, settings and properties were changed systematically and shared with Pedersen who attempted to produce the new results with his own implementations.",
        "First, we made sure that the script implemented by Fokkens could produce the same WordNet similarity scores for each individual word pair as those used to calculate the ranking on the mc-set by Pedersen (2010).",
        "Finally, the gold standard and exact implementation of the Spearman ranking coefficient were compared.",
        "Differences in results turned out to be related to variations in the experimental setup.",
        "First, we made different assumptions on the restriction of part-of-speech tags (henceforth ?PoS-tag?)",
        "considered in the comparison.",
        "Miller and Charles (1991) do not discuss how they deal with words with more than one PoS-tag in their study.",
        "Pedersen therefore included all senses with any PoS-tag in his study.",
        "The first replication attempt had restricted PoS-tags to nouns based on the idea that most items are nouns and subjects would be primed to primarily think of the noun senses.",
        "Both assumptions are reasonable.",
        "Pos-tags were not restricted in the second replication attempt, but because of a bug in the code only the first identified PoS-tag (?noun?",
        "in all cases) was considered.",
        "We therefore mistakenly assumed that PoS-tag restrictions did not matter until we compared individual scores between Pedersen and the replication attempts.",
        "Second, there are two gold standards for the Miller and Charles (1991) set: one has the scores assigned during the original experiment run by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965), the other has the scores assigned during Miller and Charles (1991)'s own experiment.",
        "The ranking correlation between the two sets is high, but they are not identical.",
        "Again, there is no reason why one gold standard would be a better choice than the other, but in order to replicate results, it must be known which of the two was used.",
        "Third, results changed because of differences in the treatment of ties while calculating Spearman ?.",

        "Finally, results for lch, lesk and wup changed according to measure specific configuration settings such as including a PoS-tag specific root node or turning on normalisation.",

        "As we worried about the complexity of the feature set relative to the size of the data set, we deviated somewhat from Freire et al. (2012)'s experiments in that we switched some features on and off.",

        "The complex features based on VIAF,7 GeoN-ames8 and WordNet do contribute to the classification in the Mallet setup as removing them and only using the focus token, window and generic features causes a slight drop in overall F-score from 49.45 to 47.25.",
        "When training the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005) on just the tokens from the Freire data set and the parameters from en-glish.all.3class.distsim.prop (included in the Stanford NER release, see also Van Erp and Van der Meij (2013)), our F-scores come very close to those reported by Freire et al. (2012), but mostly with a higher recall and lower precision.",
        "It is puzzling that the Stanford system obtains such high",
        "results with only very simple features, whereas for Mallet the complex features show improvement over simpler features.",

        "The experiments follow a general machine learning setup consisting roughly of four steps: preprocess data, generate features, train model and test model.",
        "The novelty and replication problems lie in the first three steps.",
        "How the data was preprocessed is a major factor here.",
        "The data set consisted of XML files marked up with inline named entity tags.",
        "In order to generate machine learning features, this data has to be tokenised, possibly cleaned up and the named entity markup had to be converted to a token-based scheme.",
        "Each of these steps can be carried out in several ways, and choices made here can have great influence on the rest of the pipeline.",
        "Similar choices have to be made for preprocessing external resources.",

        "It is thus not feasible to identify the main potential variations without the original data to verify this prepatory step.",

        "Freire recalls that encoding features as multi-value discrete fea",
        "tures versus several boolean features can have significant impact.",
        "These settings are not mentioned in the paper, making reproduction very difficult.",
        "As the project in which the original research was performed has ended, and there is no central repository where such information can be retrieved, we are left to wonder how to reuse this approach in order to further domain-specific NER."

        "The choice of which steps we perform, and how each of these steps is carried out exactly are part of our experimental setup.",
        "A major difference in the results for the NER experiments was caused by variations in the way in which we split the data for cross-validation.",
        "As we fine-tune our techniques, software gets updated, data sets are extended or annotation bugs are fixed.",
        "In the WordNet experiment, we found that there were two different gold standard data sets.",
        "There are also different versions of WordNet, and the WordNet::Similarity packages.",
        "Similarly for the NER experiment, GeoNames, VIAF and Mallet are updated regularly.",

        "Our experiments often consist of several different steps whose outputs may be difficult to retrace.",
        "In order to check the output of a reproduction experiment at every step of the way, system output of experiments, including intermediate steps, is vital.",
        "The WordNet replication was only possible, because Pedersen could provide the similarity scores of each word pair.",
        "This enabled us to compare the intermediate output and identify the source of differences in output.",
        "Lastly, there may be inherent system variations in the techniques used.",
        "Machine learning algorithms may for instance use coin flips in case of a tie.",
        "This was not observed in our experiments, but such variations may be determined by running an experiment several times and taking the average over the different runs (cf. Raeder et al. (2010)).",

        "Still, our use cases have shown that they can have a tremendous impact on reproduction, and can even lead to different conclusions.",
        "This leads to serious questions on how we can interpret our results and how we can compare the performance of different methods.",
        "Is an improvement of a few per cent really due to the novelty of the approach if larger variations are found when the data is split differently?",
        "Is a method that does not quite achieve the highest reported state-of-the-art result truly less good?",
        "What does a state-of-the-art result mean if it is only tested on one data set?",
        "If one really wants to know whether a result is better or worse than the state-of-the-art, the range of variation within the state-of-the-art must be known.",
        "Systematic experiments such as the ones we carried out for WordNet similarity and NER, can help determine this range.",
        "For results that fall within the range, it holds that they can only be judged by evaluations going beyond comparing performance numbers, i.e. an evaluation of how the approach achieves a given result and how that relates to alternative approaches.",
        "Naturally, our use cases do not represent the entire gamut of research methodologies and problems in the NLP community.",
        "However, they do represent two core technologies and our observations align with previous literature on replication and reproduction.",
        "Despite the systematic variation we employed",
        "in our experiments, they do not answer all questions that the problems in reproduction evoked.",
        "For the WordNet experiments, deeper analysis is required to gain full understanding of how individual influential aspects interact with each measurement.",
        "For the NER experiments, we are yet to identify the cause of our failure to reproduce.",
        "The considerable time investment required for such experiments forms a challenge.",
        "Due to pressure to publish or other time limitations, they cannot be carried out for each evaluation.",
        "Therefore, it is important to share our experiments, so that other researchers (or students) can take this up.",
        "This could be stimulated by instituting reproduction tracks in conferences, thus rewarding systematic investigation of research approaches.",
        "It can also be aided by adopting initiatives that enable authors to easily include data, code and/or workflows with their publications such as the PLOS/figshare collaboration.9 We already do a similar thing for our research problems by organising challenges or shared tasks, why not extend this to systematic testing of our approaches?"

        "Our WordNet experiments show that the performance of similarity measures can be influenced by the PoS-tags considered, measure specific variations, the rank coefficient and the gold standard used for comparison.",
        "We not only find that such variations lead to different numbers, but also different rankings of the individual measures, i.e. these aspects lead to a different answer to the question as to which measure performs best.",
        "We did not succeed in reproducing the NER results of Freire et al. (2012), showing the complexity of what seems a straightforward reproduction case based on a system description and training data only.",
        "Our analyses show that it is still an open question whether additional complex features improve domain specific NER and that this may partially depend on the CRF implementation.",
        "Some observations go beyond our use cases.",
        "In particular, the fact that results vary significantly",
        "an indication of this variation.",
        "We have classified relevant aspects in five categories occurring across subdisciplines of NLP: preprocessing, experimental setup, versioning, system output, and system variation.",
        "We believe that knowing the influence of different aspects in our experimental workflow can help increase our understanding of the robustness of the approach at hand and will help understand the meaning of the state-of-the-art better.",
        "Some techniques are reused so often (the papers introducing WordNet similarity measures have around 1,000- 2,000 citations each as of February 2013, for example) that knowing their strengths and weaknesses is essential for optimising their use.",
        "As mentioned many times before, sharing is key to facilitating reuse, even if the code is imperfect and contains hacks and possibly bugs.",
        "In the end, the same holds for software as for documentation: it is like sex: if it is good, it is very good and if it is bad, it is better than nothing!10 But most of all: when reproduction fails, regardless of whether original code or a reimplementation was used, valuable insights can emerge from investigating the cause of this failure.",
