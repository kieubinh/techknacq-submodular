        "Text segmentation is the task of splitting text into segments by placing boundaries within it.",
        "Segmentation is performed for a variety of purposes and is often a preprocessing step in a larger task.",
        "E.g., text can be topically segmented to aid video and audio retrieval (Franz et al., 2007), question answering (Oh et al., 2007), subjectivity analysis (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008), and even summa-rization (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "A variety of segmentation granularities, or atomic units, exist, including segmentations at the morpheme (e.g., Sirts and Aluma?e 2012), word (e.g., Chang et al. 2008), sentence (e.g., Rey-nar and Ratnaparkhi 1997), and paragraph (e.g., Hearst 1997) levels.",
        "Between each atomic unit lies the potential to place a boundary.",
        "Segmentations can also represent the structure of text as being organized linearly (e.g., Hearst 1997), hierarchically (e.g., Eisenstein 2009), etc.",
        "Theoretically, segmentations could also contain varying boundary types, e.g., two boundary types could differentiate between act and scene breaks in a play.",
        "Because of its value to natural language processing, various text segmentation tasks have been automated such as topical segmentation?",
        "for which a variety of automatic segmenters exist (e.g., Hearst 1997, Malioutov and Barzilay 2006, Eisenstein and Barzilay 2008, and Kazantseva and Szpakowicz 2011).",
        "This work addresses how to best select an automatic segmenter and which segmentation metrics are most appropriate to do so.",
        "To select an automatic segmenter for a particular task, a variety of segmentation evaluation metrics have been proposed, including Pk (Beeferman and Berger, 1999, pp.",
        "198?200), WindowDiff (WD; Pevzner and Hearst 2002, p. 10), and most recently Segmentation Similarity (S; Fournier and Inkpen 2012, p. 154?156).",
        "Each of these metrics have a variety of flaws: Pk and WindowDiff both under-penalize errors at the beginning of segmentations (Lamprier et al., 2007) and have a bias towards favouring segmentations with few or tightly-clustered boundaries (Niekrasz and Moore, 2010), while S produces overly optimistic values due to its normalization (shown later).",
        "To overcome the flaws of existing text segmentation metrics, this work proposes a new series of metrics derived from an adaptation of boundary edit distance (Fournier and Inkpen, 2012, p. 154?",

        "although manual coders often agree upon the bulk of where segment lie, they frequently disagree upon the exact position of boundaries (Artstein and Poesio, 2008, p. 40).",
        "To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon.",
        "IR metrics were then used to compare automatic segmenters to this majority solution.",
        "Such a majority solution is unsuitable, however, because it does not contain actual subtopic breaks, but instead the conflation of a collection of potentially disagreeing solutions.",
        "Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a majority is subjective (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1993, p. 150), Litman and Passonneau (1995), Hearst (1993, p. 6) each used 4/7, 3/7, and > 50%, respectively).",

        "Pk is the sum of these penalties over all windows.",
        "Measuring the proportion of windows in error allows Pk to penalize a fully missed boundary by k windows, whereas a nearly missed boundary is penalized by the distance that it is offset.",
        "Pk was not without issue, however.",
        "Pevzner and Hearst (2002, pp.",
        "5?10) identified that Pk: i) penalizes false negatives (FNs)2 more than false positives (FPs); ii) does not penalize full misses within k units of a reference boundary; iii) penalize near misses too harshly in some situations; and iv) is sensitive to internal segment size variance.",
        "To solve Pk's issues, Pevzner and Hearst (2002, pp.",
        "10) proposed a modification referred to as WindowDiff (WD).",
        "Its major difference is in how it decides to penalized windows: within a window, if the number of boundaries in the manual segmentation (Mij) differs from the number of boundaries in the automatic segmentation (Aij), then a penalty is given.",
        "The ratio of penalties over windows then represents the degree of error between the segmentations, as in Equation 1.",
        "This change better allowed WD to: i) penalize FPs and FNs more equally;3 ii) Not skip full misses; iii) Less harshly penalize near misses; and iv) Reduce its sensitivity to internal segment size variance.",
        "WD did not, however, solve all of the issues related to window-based segmentation comparison.",
        "WD, and inherently Pk: i) Penalize errors less at the beginning and end of segmentations (Lamprier et al., 2007); ii) Are biased towards favouring automatic segmentations with either few or tightly-clustered boundaries (Niekrasz and Moore, 2010); iii) Calculate window size k inconsistently;4 iv) Are not symmetric5 (meaning that they cannot be used to produce a pairwise mean of multiple manual segmentations6).",
        "Segmentation Similarity (S; Fournier and Inkpen 2012, pp.",
        "154?156) took a different approach to comparing segmentations.",
        "Instead of using windows, the work proposes a new restricted edit distance called boundary edit distance which differentiates between full and near misses.",

        "tion, thus rounding must be used, but no rounding method is specified.",

        "If the segmenters in the Moonstone data set truly agreed with each other, then they should have all behaved similarly.",

        "If instead of creating pseudo-coders from a random segmentation a series of random segmentations with the same parameters were generated, a properly functioning inter-coder agreement coefficient should report some agreement (due to the similar parameters used to create the segmentations) but it should be quite low.",

        "drastically overestimates what should be very low agreement whereas B-based pi?",

        "To put this evaluation into context, an upper and lower bound were also created comprised of a random coder from the manual data (Human) and a random segmenter (Random), respectively.",
        "These automatic segmenters, and the upper and lower bounds, were created, trained, and run by another researcher (Anna Kazantseva) with their labels removed during the development of the metrics detailed herein (to improve the impartiality of these analyses).",

        "Despite the difference in the scale of their values, both S and WD performed almost identically, placing the three automatic segmenters between the upper and lower bounds as expected.",
        "For S, statistically significant differences11 (?",
        "= 0.05) were found between all segmenters except between APS?human and MinCut?BayesSeg, and WD could only find significant differences between the automatic segmenters and the upper and lower bounds.",
        "B, however, shows a marked deviation, and places MinCut and APS statistically significantly below the random baseline with only BayesSeg between the upper and lower bounds?to a significant degree.",
        "Why would pairwise mean B act in such an unexpected manner?",
        "The answer lies in a further analysis using the confusion matrix proposed earlier to calculate B-precision and B-recall (as shown in Table 2).",

        "Mean B shows an unbiased ranking of these automatic segmenters in terms of the upper and lower bounds.",

        "In this work, a new segmentation evaluation metric, referred to as boundary similarity (B) is proposed as an unbiased metric, along with a boundary-edit-distance-based (BED-based) confusion matrix to compute predictably biased IR metrics such as precision and recall.",
        "Additionally, a method of adapting inter-coder agreement coefficients to award partial credit for near misses is proposed that uses B as opposed to S for actual agreement so as to not overestimate agreement.",
        "B overcomes the cosmetically high values of S and, the bias towards segmentations with few or tightly-clustered boundaries of WD?manifesting in this work as a bias towards precision over recall for both WD and S. When such precision is desirable, however, B-precision can be computed from a BED-based confusion matrix, along with other IR metrics.",
        "WD and Pk should not be preferred because their biases do not occur consistently in all scenarios, whereas BED-based IR metrics offer expected biases built upon a consistent, edit-based, interpretation of segmentation error.",
        "B also allows for an intuitive comparison of boundary pairs between segmentations, as opposed to the window counts of WD or the simplistic edit count normalization of S. When an unbiased segmentation evaluation metric is desired, this work recommends the usage of B and the use of an upper and lower bound to provide context.",
        "Otherwise, if the evaluation of a segmentation task requires some biased measure, the predictable bias of IR metrics computed from a BED-based confusion matrix is recommended.",
        "For all evaluations, however, a justification for the biased/unbiased metrics used should be given, and more than one metric should be reported so as to allow a reader to ascertain for themselves whether a particular automatic segmenter's bias in some manner is cause for concern or not."
