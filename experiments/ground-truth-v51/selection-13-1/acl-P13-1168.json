        "For instance, Table 1 illustrates the variation in flat segmentation by 10 annotators.",
        "This confusion is mainly because the definition of a segment in a query is ambiguous and of an unspecified granularity.",
        "This is further compounded by the fact that other than easily recognizable and agreed upon segments such as Named Entities or Multi-Word Expressions, there is no established notion of linguistic grouping such as phrases and clauses in a query.",
        "Although there is little work on the use of crowdsourcing for query segmentation (Hagen et al., 2011; Hagen et al., 2012), the idea that the",

      "text": [
        "The IAA statistics clearly show that there are certain strong biases in both flat and nested query segmentation, especially those obtained through crowdsourcing.",
        "To identify these biases, we went through the annotations and came up with possible hypotheses, which we tried to verify through statistical analysis of the data.",
        "Here, we report the most prominent biases that were thus discovered.",
        "Bias 1: During flat segmentation, annotators prefer dividing the query into two segments of roughly equal length.",
        "As discussed earlier, one of the major problems of flat segmentation is the fuzziness in granularity.",
        "In our experiments, we intentionally left the decision of whether to go for fine or coarse-grained segmentation to the annotator.",
        "However, it is surprising to observe that annotators typically divide the query into two segments (see Fig. 3, plots A1 and A2), and at times three, but hardly ever more than three.",
        "This bias is observed across queries, sentences and random queries, where the percentage of annotations with 2 or 3 segments are greater than 83%, 91% and 96% respectively.",
        "This bias is most strongly visible for QRand because the lack of syntactic or semantic cohesion between the words provides no clue for segmentation.",
        "Furthermore, we observe that typically segments tend to be of equal length.",
        "For this, we computed standard deviations (sd) of segment lengths for all annotations having 2 or 3 segments; the distribution of sd is shown in Fig. 3, plots B1 and B2.",
        "We observe that for all datasets, sd lies mainly between 0.5 and 1 (for perspective, consider a query",
        "4 the sd is 0.5, and for 2 and 5, the sd is 1.5), implying that segments are roughly of equal length.",
        "It is likely that due to this bias, the S or observed agreement is moderately high for queries and very high for sentences, but then it also leads to high agreement across different queries and sentences (i.e., high s2total) especially when they are of equal length, which in turn brings down the value of ?",
        "?",
        "the true agreement after bias correction.",
        "Bias 2: During nested segmentation, annotators prefer balanced binary trees.",
        "Quite analogous to bias 1, for nested segmentation we observe that annotators tend to prefer more balanced binary trees.",
        "Fig.",
        "3 plots C1 and C2 show the distribution of the tree heights for various cases and Table 5 reports the corresponding average height of the trees for queries and sentences of various lengths and the the expected value of the height if all trees were equally likely.",
        "The observed heights are much lower than the expected values clearly implying the preference of the annotators for more balanced trees.",
        "Thus, the crowd seems to choose the middle path, avoiding extremes and hence may not be a reliable source of annotation for query segmentation.",
        "It can be argued that similar biases are also observed for gold annotations, and therefore, probably it is the inherent structure of the queries and sentences that lead to such biased distribution of segmentation patterns.",
        "However, note that ?",
        "for QG500 is much higher than all other cases, which shows that the true agreement between gold annotators is immune to such biases or skewed distributions in the datasets.",
        "Furthermore, high values of ?",
        "for QRand despite the very strong biases in annotation shows that there perhaps is very little choice that the annotators have while segmenting randomly generated queries.",
        "On the other hand, the textual coherence of the real queries and sentences provide many different choices for segmentation and the Turker typically gets carried away by these biases, leading to low ?.",
        "Bias 3: Phrase structure drives segmentation only when reconcilable with Bias 1.",
        "Whenever the sentence or query has a verb phrase (VP) spanning roughly half of it, annotators seem to chunk before the VP as one would expect, quite as often as just after the verb, which is quite unexpected.",
        "For instance, the sentence A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger.",
        "gathers as many as eight flat annotations with a boundary between sarcasm and ruffled, and four with a boundary between ruffled and her.",
        "However, if the VP is very short consisting of a single",
        "boundaries with respect to prepositions.",
        "Prepositions occurring in the beginning or end of a query/sentence have been excluded from the analysis; hence, numbers in a column do not total 100. verb, as in A fleeting and furtive air of triumph erupted., annotators seem to attempt for a balanced annotation due to Bias 1.",
        "As a clear middle boundary is not present in such sentences, the annotations show a lot more variation and disagreement.",
        "For instance, only 1 out of 10 annotations had a boundary before erupted in the above example.",
        "In fact, at least one annotation had a boundary after each word in the sentence, with no clear majority.",
        "Bias 4: Prepositions influence segment boundaries differently for queries and sentences.",
        "We automatically labeled all the prepositions in the flat annotations and classified them according to the criterion of whether a boundary was placed immediately before or after it, or on both sides or neither side.",
        "The statistics, reported in Table 6, show that for NL sentences a majority of the boundaries are present before the preposition, marking the beginning of a prepositional phrase.",
        "However, for queries, a much richer pattern emerges depending on the specific preposition.",
        "For instance, to, of and for are often chunked with the previous word (e.g., how to | choose a bike size, birthday party ideas for |one year old).",
        "We believe that this difference is because in sentences due to the presence of a verb, the PP has a well-defined head, lack of which leads to preposition in queries getting chunked with words that form more commonly seen patterns (e.g., flights to and tickets for).",
        "Bias 3 and 4 present the complex interpretation of the structure of queries by the annotators which could be due to some emerging cognitive model of queries among the search engine users.",
        "This is a fascinating and unexplored aspect of query structures that demands deeper investigation through cognitive and psycholinguistic experiments."

        "We have studied various aspects of query segmentation through crowdsourcing by designing and conducting suitable experiments.",
        "Analysis of experimental data leads us to conclude the following: (a) crowdsoucing may not be a very effective way to collect judgments for query segmentation; (b) addressing fuzziness of granularity for flat segmentation by introducing strict binary nested segments does not lead to better agreement in crowdsourced annotations, though it definitely improves the IAA for gold standard segmentations, implying that low IAA in flat segmentation among experts is primarily an effect of unspecified granularity of segments; (c) low IAA is not due to the inherent structural ambiguity in queries as this holds true for sentences as well; (d) there are strong biases in crowdsourced annotations, mostly because turkers prefer more balanced segment structures; and (e) while annotators are by and large guided by linguistic principles, application of these principles differ between query and NL sentences and also closely interact with other biases.",
        "One of the important contributions of this work is the formulation of a new IAA metric for comparing across flat and nested segmentations, especially for crowdsourcing based annotations.",
        "Since trees are commonly used across various linguistic annotations, this metric can have wide applicability.",
        "The metric, moreover, can be easily adapted to other annotation schemes as well by defining an appropriate distance metric between annotations.",
        "Since large scale data for query segmentation is very useful, it would be interesting to see if the problem can be rephrased to the Turkers in a way so as to obtain more reliable judgments.",
        "Yet a deeper question is regarding the theoretical status of query structure, which though in an emergent state is definitely an operating model for the annotators.",
        "Our future work in this area would specifically target understanding and formalization of the theoretical model underpinning a query."
