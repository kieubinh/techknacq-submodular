        "?Why-question answering?",
        "(why-QA) is a task to retrieve answers from a given text archive for a why-question, such as ?Why are tsunamis generated??",
        "The answers are usually text fragments consisting of one or more sentences.",
        "Although much research exists on this task (Girju, 2003; Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008; Verberne et al., 2008; Verberne et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2012), its performance remains much lower than that of the state-of-the-art factoid QA systems, such as IBM's Watson (Ferrucci et al., 2010).",
        "In this work, we propose a quite straightforward but novel approach for such difficult why-QA task.",
        "Consider the sentence A1 in Table 1, which represents the causal relation between the cause, ?the ocean's water mass ..., waves are gen-A1 [Tsunamis that can cause large coastal inundation are generated]effect because [the ocean's water mass is displaced and, much like throwing a stone into a pond, waves are generated.",
        "]cause A2 [Earthquake causes seismic waves which set up the water in motion with a large force.",
        "]cause This causes [a tsunami.",
        "]effect A3 [Tsunamis]effect are caused by [the sudden displacement of huge volumes of water.",
        "]cause A4 [Tsunamis weaken as they pass through forests]effect because [the hydraulic resistance of the trees diminish their energy.",
        "]cause A5 [Automakers in Japan suspended production for an array of vehicles]effect because [the magnitude 9",
        "relations.",
        "Cause and effect parts of each causal relation, marked with [..]cause and [..]effect, are connected by the underlined cue phrases for causality, such as because, this causes, and are caused by.",
        "erated,?",
        "and its effect, ?Tsunamis ... are generated.?",
        "This is a good answer to the question, ?Why are tsunamis generated?",
        "?, since the effect part is more or less equivalent to the (propositional) content of the question.",
        "Our method finds text fragments that include such causal relations with an effect part that resembles a given question and provides them as answers.",
        "Since this idea looks quite intuitive, many people would probably consider it as a solution to why-QA.",
        "However, to our surprise, we could not find any previous work on why-QA that took this approach.",
        "Some methods utilized the causal relations between terms as evidence for finding answers (i.e., matching a cause term with an answer text and its effect term with a question) (Girju, 2003; Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008).",
        "Other approaches utilized such clue terms for causality as ?because?",
        "as evidence for finding answers (Mu-rata et al., 2007).",
        "However, these algorithms did not check whether an answer candidate, i.e., a text fragment that may be provided as an answer, explicitly contains a complex causal relation sen",
        "tence with the effect part that resembles a question.",
        "For example, A5 in Table 1 is an incorrect answer to ?Why are tsunamis generated?",
        "?, but these previous approaches would probably choose it as a proper answer due to ?because?",
        "and ?earthquake?",
        "(i.e., a cause of tsunamis).",
        "At least in our experimental setting, our approach outperformed these simpler causality-based QA systems.",
        "Perhaps this approach was previously deemed infeasible due to two non-trivial technical challenges.",
        "The first challenge is to accurately identify a wide range of causal relations like those in Table 1 in answer candidates.",
        "To meet this challenge, we developed a sequence labeling method that identifies not only intra-sentential causal relations, i.e., the causal relations between two terms/phrases/clauses expressed in a single sentence (e.g., A1 in Table 1), but also the inter-sentential causal relations, which are the causal relations between two terms/phrases/clauses expressed in two adjacent sentences (e.g., A2) in a given text fragment.",
        "The second challenge is assessing the appropriateness of each identified causal relation as an answer to a given question.",
        "This is important since the causal relations identified in the answer candidates may have nothing to do with a given question.",
        "In this case, we have to reject these causal relations because they are inappropriate as an answer to the question.",
        "When a single answer candidate contains many causal relations, we also have to select the appropriate ones.",
        "Consider the causal relations in A1?A4.",
        "Those in A1?A3 are appropriate answers to ?Why are tsunamis generated?",
        "?, but not the one in A4.",
        "To assess the appropriateness, the system must recognize textual entailment, i.e., ?tsunamis (are) generated?",
        "in the question is entailed by all ?tsunamis are generated?",
        "in A1, ?cause a tsunami?",
        "in A2 and ?tsunamis are caused?",
        "in A3 but not by ?tsunamis weaken?",
        "in A4.",
        "This quite difficult task is currently being studied by many researchers in the RTE field (An-droutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010; Dagan et al., 2010; Shima et al., 2011; Bentivogli et al., 2011).",
        "To meet this challenge, we developed a relatively simple method that can be seen as a lightweight approximation for this difficult RTE task, using excitation polarities (Hashimoto et al., 2012).",
        "Through our experiments on Japanese why-QA, we show that a combination of the above methods can improve why-QA accuracy.",
        "In addition, our proposed method can be successfully combined with other approaches to why-QA and can contribute to higher accuracy.",
        "As a final result, we improved the precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-the-art system of Japanese why-QA (Oh et al., 2012).",
        "The difference in the performance became much larger when we only compared the highly confident answers of each system.",
        "When we made our system provide only its confident answers according to their confidence score given by our system, the precision of these confident answers was 83.2% for 25% of all the questions in our test set.",
        "In the same setting, the precision of the state-of-the-art system (Oh et al., 2012) was only 62.4%."
