        "Open-domain question answering (QA), which fulfills a user's information need by outputting direct answers to natural language queries, is a challenging but important problem (Etzioni, 2011).",
        "State-of-the-art QA systems often implement a complicated pipeline architecture, consisting of question analysis, document or passage retrieval, answer selection and verification (Ferrucci, 2012; Moldovan et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper, we focus on one of the key subtasks ?",
        "answer sentence selection.",
        "Given a question and a set of candidate sentences, the task is to choose the correct sentence that contains the exact answer and can sufficiently support the answer choice.",
        "For instance, although both of the following sentences contain the answer ?Jack Lemmon?",
        "to the question ?Who won the best actor Oscar in 1973??",
        "only the first sentence is correct.",
        "A1: Jack Lemmon won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Save the Tiger (1973).",
        "A2: Oscar winner Kevin Spacey said that Jack Lemmon is remembered as always making time for other people.",
        "One of the benefits of answer sentence selection is that the output can be provided directly to the user.",
        "Instead of outputting only the answer, returning the whole sentence often adds more value as the user can easily verify the correctness without reading a lengthy document.",
        "Answer sentence selection can be naturally reduced to a semantic text matching problem.",
        "Conceptually, we would like to measure how close the question and sentence can be matched semantically.",
        "Due to the variety of word choices and inherent ambiguities in natural languages, bag-of-words approaches with simple surface-form word matching tend to produce brittle results with poor prediction accuracy (Bilotti et al., 2007).",
        "As a result, researchers put more emphasis on exploiting both the syntactic and semantic structure in questions/sentences.",
        "Representative examples include methods based on deeper semantic analysis (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Moldovan et al., 2007) and on tree edit-distance (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Heilman and Smith, 2010) and quasi-synchronous grammar (Wang et al., 2007) that match the dependency parse trees of questions and sentences.",
        "However, such approaches often require more computational resources.",
        "In addition to applying a syntactic or semantic parser during run-time, finding the best matching between structured representations of sentences is not trivial.",
        "For example, the computational complexity of tree matching is O(V 2L4), where V is the number of nodes and L is the maximum depth (Tai, 1979).",
        "Instead of focusing on the high-level semantic representation, we turn our attention in this work to improving the shallow semantic compo",
        "nent, lexical semantics.",
        "We formulate answer selection as a semantic matching problem with a latent word-alignment structure as in (Chang et al., 2010) and conduct a series of experimental studies on leveraging recently proposed lexical semantic models.",
        "Our main contributions in this work are two key findings.",
        "First, by incorporating the abundant information from a variety of lexical semantic models, the answer selection system can be enhanced substantially, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms and settings.",
        "Compared to the previous work, our latent alignment model improves the result on a benchmark dataset by a wide margin ?",
        "the mean average precision (MAP) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores are increased by 25.6% and 18.8%, respectively.",
        "Second, while the latent alignment model performs better than unstructured models, the difference diminishes after adding the enhanced lexical semantics information.",
        "This may suggest that compared to introducing complex structured constraints, incorporating shallow semantic information is both more effective and computationally inexpensive in improving the performance, at least for the specific word alignment model tested in this work.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first survey the related work in Sec. 2.",
        "Sec.",
        "3 defines the problem of answer sentence selection, along with the high-level description of our solution.",
        "The enhanced lexical semantic models and the learning frameworks we explore are presented in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5, respectively.",

        "This may suggest that adding shallow semantic information is more effective than introducing complex structured constraints, at least for the specific word alignment model we experimented with in this work.",
        "In the future, we plan to explore several directions.",
        "First, although we focus on improving TREC-style open-domain question answering in this work, we would like to apply the proposed technology to other QA scenarios, such as community-based QA (CQA).",
        "For instance, the sentence matching technique can help map a given question to some questions in an existing CQA database (e.g., Yahoo!",
        "Answers).",
        "Moreover, the answer sentence selection scheme could also be useful in extracting the most related sentences from the answer text to form a summary answer.",
        "Second, because the task of answer sentence selection is very similar to paraphrase detection (Dolan et al., 2004) and recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2006), we would like to investigate whether systems for these tasks can be improved by incorporating enhanced lexical semantic knowledge as well.",
        "Finally, we would like to improve our system for the answer sentence selection task and for question answering in general.",
        "In addition to following the directions suggested by the error analysis presented in Sec. 6.4, we plan to use logic-like semantic representations of questions and sentences, and explore the role of lexical semantics for handling questions that require inference."
