        "Entity linking or disambiguation has recently received much attention in natural language processing community (Bunescu and Paşca, 2006; Han et al., 2011; Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012).",
        "It is an essential first step for succeeding subtasks in knowledge base construction (Ji and Grishman, 2011) like populating attribute to entities.",
        "Given a sentence with four mentions, ?The [[Python]] of [[Delphi]] was a creature with the body of a snake.",
        "This creature dwelled on [[Mount Parnassus]], in central [[Greece]].?",
        "How can we determine that Python is an earth-dragon in Greece mythology and not the popular programming language, Delphi is not the auto parts supplier, and Mount Parnassus is in Greece, not in Colorado?",
        "A most straightforward method is to compare the context of the mention and the definition of candidate entities.",
        "Previous work has explored many ways of measuring the relatedness of context ?Corresponding author d and entity e, such as dot product, cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jaccard distance, or more complicated ones (Zheng et al., 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Hoffart et al., 2011; Bunescu and Paşca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "However, these measures are often duplicate or over-specified, because they are disjointly combined and their atomic nature determines that they have no internal structure.",
        "Another line of work focuses on collective disambiguation (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011).",
        "Ambiguous mentions within the same context are resolved simultaneously based on the coherence among decisions.",
        "Collective approaches often undergo a non-trivial decision process.",
        "In fact, (Ratinov et al., 2011) show that even though global approaches can be improved, local methods based on only similarity sim(d, e) of context d and entity e are hard to beat.",
        "This somehow reveals the importance of a good modeling of sim(d, e).",
        "Rather than learning context entity association at word level, topic model based approaches (Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012) can learn it in the semantic space.",
        "However, the one-topic-per-entity assumption makes it impossible to scale to large knowledge base, as every entity has a separate word distribution P (w|e); besides, the training objective does not directly correspond with disambiguation performances.",
        "To overcome disadvantages of previous approaches, we propose a novel method to learn context entity association enriched with deep architecture.",
        "Deep neural networks (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007) are built in a hierarchical manner, and allow us to compare context and entity at some higher level abstraction; while at lower levels, general concepts are shared across entities, resulting in compact models.",
        "Moreover, to make our model highly correlated with disambiguation performance, our method directly optimizes doc",
        "ument and entity representations for a fixed similarity measure.",
        "In fact, the underlying representations for computing similarity measure add internal structure to the given similarity measure.",
        "Features are learned leveraging large scale annotation of Wikipedia, without any manual design efforts.",
        "Furthermore, the learned model is compact compared with topic model based approaches, and can be trained discriminatively without relying on expensive sampling strategy.",
        "Despite its simplicity, it beats all complex collective approaches in our experiments.",
        "The learned similarity measure can be readily incorporated into any existing collective approaches, which further boosts performance."
