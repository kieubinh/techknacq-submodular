        "Discourse relations such as contrast and causality are part of what makes a text coherent.",
        "Being able to automatically identify these relations is important for many NLP tasks such as generation, question answering and textual entailment.",
        "In some cases, discourse relations contain an explicit marker such as but or because which makes it easy to identify the relation.",
        "Prior work (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009) showed that where explicit markers exist, the class of the relation can be disambiguated with f-scores higher than 90%.",
        "Predicting the class of implicit discourse relations, however, is much more difficult.",
        "Without an explicit marker to rely on, work on this task initially focused on using lexical cues in the form of word pairs mined from large corpora where they appear around an explicit marker (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "The intuition is that these pairs will tend to represent semantic relationships which are related to the discourse marker (for example, word pairs often appearing around but may tend to be antonyms).",
        "While this approach showed some success and has been used extensively in later work, it has been pointed out by multiple authors that many of the most useful word pairs are pairs of very common functional words, which contradicts the original intuition, and it is hard to explain why these are useful.",
        "In this work we focus on the task of identifying and disambiguating implicit discourse relations which have no explicit marker.",
        "In particular, we present a reformulation of the word pair features that have most often been used for this task in the past, replacing the sparse lexical features with dense aggregated score features.",
        "This is the main contribution of our paper.",
        "We show that our formulation outperforms the original one while requiring less features, and that using a stop list of functional words does not significantly affect performance, suggesting that these features indeed represent semantically related content word pairs.",
        "In addition, we present a system which combines these word pairs with additional features to achieve near state of the art performance without the use of syntactic parse features and of context outside the arguments of the relation.",
        "Previous work has attributed much of the achieved performance to these features, which are easy to get in the experimental setting but would be less reliable or unavailable in other applications.1"

        "This line of research began with (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), who used a small number of unambiguous explicit markers and patterns involving them, such as [Arg1, but Arg2] to collect sets of word pairs from a large corpus using the crossproduct of the words in Arg1 and Arg2.",
        "The authors created a feature out of each pair and built a naive bayes model directly from the unannotated corpus, updating the priors and posteriors using maximum likelihood.",
        "While they demonstrated 1Reliable syntactic parses are not always available in domains other than newswire, and context (preceding relations, especially explicit relations) is not always available in some applications such as generation and question answering.",
        "some success, their experiments were run on data that is unnatural in two ways.",
        "First, it is balanced.",
        "Second, it is constructed with the same unsupervised method they use to extract the word pairs - by assuming that the patterns correspond to a particular relation and collecting the arguments from an unannotated corpus.",
        "Even if the assumption is correct, these arguments are really taken from explicit relations with their markers removed, which as others have pointed out (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007; Pitler et al., 2009) may not look like true implicit relations.",
        "More recently, implicit relation prediction has been evaluated on annotated implicit relations from the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "PDTB uses hierarchical relation types which abstract over other theories of discourse such as RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987) and SDRT (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "It contains 40, 600 annotated relations from the WSJ corpus.",
        "Each relation has two arguments, Arg1 and Arg2, and the annotators decide whether it is explicit or implicit.",
        "The first to evaluate directly on PDTB in a realistic setting were Pitler et al. (2009).",
        "They used word pairs as well as additional features to train four binary classifiers, each corresponding to one of the high-level PDTB relation classes.",
        "Although other features proved to be useful, word pairs were still the major contributor to most of these classifiers.",
        "In fact, their best system for comparison included only the word pair features, and for all other classes other than expansion the word pair features alone achieved an f-score within 2 points of the best system.",
        "Interestingly, they found that training the word pair features on PDTB itself was more useful than training them on an external corpus like Marcu and Echihabi (2002), although in some cases they resort to information gain in the external corpus for filtering the word pairs.",
        "Zhou et al. (2010) used a similar method and added features that explicitly try to predict the implicit marker in the relation, increasing performance.",
        "Most recently to the best of our knowledge, Park and Cardie (2012) achieved the highest performance by optimizing the feature set.",
        "Another work evaluating on PDTB is (Lin et al., 2009), who are unique in evaluating on the more fine-grained second-level relation classes."

        "While Marcu and Echihabi (2002)'s approach of training a classifier from an unannotated corpus provides a relatively large amount of training data, this data does not consist of true implicit relations.",
        "However, the approach taken by Pitler et al. (2009) and repeated in more recent work (training directly on PDTB) is problematic as well: when training a model with so many sparse features on a dataset the size of PDTB (there are 22, 141 non-explicit relations overall), it is likely that many important word pairs will not be seen in training.",
        "In fact, even the larger corpus of Marcu and Echihabi (2002) may not be quite large enough to solve the sparsity issue, given that the number of word pairs is quadratic in the vocabulary.",
        "Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) report that using even a very small stop list (25 words) significantly reduces performance, which is counter-intuitive.",
        "They attribute this finding to the sparsity of the feature space.",
        "An analysis in (Pitler et al., 2009) also shows that the top word pairs (ranked by information gain) all contain common functional words, and are not at all the semantically-related content words that were imagined.",
        "In the case of some reportedly useful word pairs (the-and; in-the; the-of...) it is hard to explain how they might affect performance except through overfitting."

        "Representing each word pair as a single feature has the advantage of allowing the weights for each pair to be learned directly from the data.",
        "While powerful, this approach requires large amounts of data to be effective.",
        "Another possible approach is to aggregate some of the pairs together and learn weights from the data only for the aggregated sets of words.",
        "For this approach to be effective, the pairs we choose to group together should have similar meaning with regard to predicting the relation.",

        "They used aggregated word pair set features to predict whether or not a sentence is argumentative.",
        "Their method is to group together word pairs that have been collected around the same explicit discourse marker: for every discourse marker such as therefore or however, they have a single feature whose value depends only on the word pairs",
        "collected around that marker.",
        "This is reasonable given the intuition that the marker pattern is unambiguous and points at a particular relation.",

        "Our approach is similar in that we choose to aggregate word pairs that were collected around the same explicit marker.",
        "We first assembled a list of all 102 discourse markers used in PDTB, in both explicit and implicit relations.2 Next, we extract word pairs for each marker from the Gigaword corpus by taking the cross product of words that appear in a sentence around that marker.",
        "This is a simpler approach than using patterns - for example, the marker because can appear in two patterns: [Arg1 because Arg2] and [because Arg1, Arg2], and we only use the first.",
        "We leave the task of listing the possible patterns for each of the 102 markers to future work because of the significant manual effort required.",
        "Meanwhile, we rely on the fact that we use a very large corpus and hope that the simple pattern [Arg1 marker Arg2] is enough to make our features useful.",
        "There are, of course, markers for which this pattern does not normally apply, such as by comparison or on one hand.",
        "We expect these features to be down-weighted by the final classifier, as explained at the end of this section.",
        "When collecting the pairs, we stem the words and discard pairs which appear only once around the marker.",
        "We can think of each discourse marker as having a corresponding unordered ?document?, where each word pair is a term with an associated frequency.",
        "We want to create a feature for each marker such that for each data instance (that is, for each potential relation in the PDTB data) the value for the feature is the relevance of the marker document to the data instance.",
        "2in implicit relations, there is no marker in the text but the implicit marker is provided by the human annotators Each data instance in PDTB consists of two arguments, and can therefore also be represented as a set of word pairs extracted from the crossproduct of the two arguments.",
        "To represent the relevance of the instance to each marker, we set the value of the marker feature to the cosine similarity of the data instance and the marker's ?document?, where each word pair is a dimension.",
        "While the terms (i.e. word pairs) of the data instance are weighted by simple occurence count, we weight the terms in each marker's document with tf-idf, where tf is defined in one of two ways: normalized term frequency ( count(t)max{count(s,d):s?d}) and pointwise mutual information (log count(t)count(w1)?count(w2)), where w1 and w2are the member words of the pair.",
        "Idf is calculated normally given that the set of all documents is defined as the 102 marker documents.",
        "We then train a binary classifier (logistic regression) using these 102 features for each of the four high-level relations in PDTB: comparison, contingency, expansion and temporal.",
        "To make sure our results are comparable to previous work, we treat EntRel relations as instances of expansion and use sections 2-20 for training and sections 21- 22 for testing.",
        "We use a ten fold stratified cross-validation of the training set for development.",
        "Explicit relations are excluded from all data sets.",
        "As mentioned earlier, there are markers that do not fit the simple pattern we use.",
        "In particular, some markers always or often appear as the first term of a sentence.",
        "For these, we expect the list of word pairs to be empty or almost empty, since in most sentences there are no words on the left (and recall that we discard pairs that appear only once).",
        "Since the features created for these markers will be uninformative, we expect them to be weighted down by the classifier and have no significant effect on prediction."
