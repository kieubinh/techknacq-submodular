        "Little computational linguistics research has been done for anaphora resolution (AR) in Indic languages.",
        "Notable research efforts in this area are conducted by Shobha et al. (2000), Prasad et al. (2000), Jain et al. (2004), Agrawal et al. (2007), Uppalapu et al. (2009).",
        "These works address AR problem in language like Hindi, some South Indian languages including Tamil.",
        "Dhar et al. (2008) reported a research on Bengali.",
        "Progress of the research through these works was difficult to quantify as most of the authors used their self-generated datasets and in some cases algorithms lack in required details to make them reproducible.",
        "First rigorous effort was taken in ICON 2011 (ICON 2011) where a shared task was conducted on AR in three Indic languages (Hindi, Bengali, and Tamil).",
        "Training and test datasets were provided, both the machine learning (WEKA and SVM based classification) and rule-based approaches are used and the participating systems (4 teams for Bengali, and 2 teams each for Hindi and Tamil) were evaluated using five different metrics (MUC, B3, CEAFM, CEAFE, and BLANC).",
        "However, no team attempted to reuse any of the off-the-shelf AR systems.",
        "This paper aims to explore this issue to investigate how far useful such a system is for AR in Indic languages.",
        "Bengali has been taken as the reference language and GuiTAR (Poesio, 2004) has been considered as the reference off-the-shelf system.",
        "GuiTAR is primarily designed for English language and therefore, its direct application for Bengali is not possible for grammatical variations and resource limitations.",
        "Therefore, the central contribution of this paper is to develop required resources for Bengali and thereby providing them to GuiTAR for anaphora resolution.",
        "Our contribution also includes extension of the ICON2011 AR dataset for Bengali so that evaluation could be done on a bigger sized dataset.",
        "Finally, GuiTAR anaphora resolution module is replaced by a previously developed approach (which is primarily rule-based, Senapati, 2011; Senapati, 2012a) and performances of different configurations are compared.",
        "2 Language specific issues in GuiTAR GuiTAR has two major modules namely, preprocessing and anaphora resolution (Kabadjov, 2007).",
        "In both of these modules modifications are required to fit it to Bengali.",
        "Let's first identify the components in both of these two modules where replacement/modifications are needed.",
        "Pre-processing: The purpose of this module is to make GuiTAR independent from input format specifications and variations.",
        "It takes as input in XML or text format.",
        "In case of text input, XML file generated by the LT-XML tool.",
        "The XML file contains the information like word boundaries (tokens), grammatical classes (part-of-speech), and chunking information.",
        "From the XML format MAS-XML (Minimum Anaphoric Syntax - XML) is produced to include minimal information namely, noun phrase boundaries, utterance boundaries, categories of pronoun, number information, gender information, etc.",
        "All these aspects are to be addressed for Bengali so that for a given input discourse in Bengali, MAS-XML file can be generated correctly.",
        "Next section explains how this issue.",
        "Anaphora resolution: The GuiTAR system resolves four types of anaphoras.",
        "The pronouns (personal and possessive) are resolved by using",
        "an implementation of MARS (Mitkov, 2002), whereas different algorithms are used for resolving definite descriptions, and proper nouns.",
        "In Mitkov's algorithm whenever a pronoun is to be resolved, it finds a list of potential antecedents within a given ?window?",
        "and checks three types of syntactic agreements (i.e., person, number and gender) between an antecedent and the pronoun.",
        "In case of more than one potential antecedent exists in the list it would be recursively filtered applying sequentially five different antecedent indicators (aggregate score, immediate reference, collocational pattern, indicating verbs and referential distance) until there is only one element in the list, i.e., the selected antecedent.",
        "We introduce suitable modifications in this module so that the same implementation of MARS can work for Bengali.",
        "This is explained in Sec. 4."
