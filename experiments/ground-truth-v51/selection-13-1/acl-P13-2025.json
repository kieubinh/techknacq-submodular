        "Human assessment is often considered as the best, if not the only, way to evaluate ?subjective?",
        "NLP tasks like MT or speech generation.",
        "However, human evaluations are doomed to be noisy and, sometimes, even contradictory as they depend on individual perception and understanding of the score scale that annotators generally use in remarkably different ways (Koehn and Monz, 2006).",
        "Moreover, annotation is known to be a long and frustrating process and annotator fatigue has been identified as another source of noise (Pighin et al., 2012).",
        "In addition to defining and enforcing stricter guidelines, several solutions have been proposed to reduce the annotation effort and produce more reliable ratings.",
        "For instance, to limit the impact of the score scale interpretation, in the WMT evaluation campaign (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), annotators are asked to rank translation hypotheses from best to worst instead of providing absolute scores (e.g. in terms of adequacy or fluency).",
        "Generalizing this approach, several works (Pighin et al., 2012; Lopez, 2012) have defined novel annotation protocols to reduce the number of judgments that need to be collected.",
        "However, all these methods suffer from several limitations: first, they provide no interpretable information about the quality of the system (only a relative comparison between two systems is possible); second, (Koehn, 2012) has recently shown that the ranking they induce is not reliable.",
        "In this work, we study an alternative approach to the problem of collecting reliable human assessments.",
        "Our basic assumption, motivated by the success of ensemble methods, is that having several judgments for each example, even if they are noisy, will result in a more reliable decision than having a single judgment.",
        "An evaluation campaign should therefore aim at gathering a score matrix, in which each example is rated by all judges instead of having each judge rate only a small subset of examples, thereby minimizing redundancy.",
        "Obviously, the former approach requires a large annotation effort and is, in practice, not feasible.",
        "That is why, to reduce the number of judgments that must be collected, we propose to investigate the possibility of using matrix completion techniques to recover the entire score matrix from a sample of its entries.",
        "The question we try to answer is whether the missing scores of one judge can be predicted knowing only scores of other judges and some shared ratings.",
        "The contributions of this paper are twofold: i) we show how knowing the full score matrix instead of a single score for each example provides a more reliable estimation of a system quality (Section 3); ii) we present preliminary experiments",
        "showing that missing data techniques can be used to recover the score matrix from a sample of its entries despite the low inter-rater agreement (Section 4)."

        "The recovering of a matrix from a sampling of its entries is a task of considerable interest (Cande`s and Recht, 2012).",
        "It can be used, for instance, in recommender systems: rows of the matrix represent users that are rating movies (columns of the matrix); the resulting matrix is mostly unknown (each user only rates a few movies) and the task consists in completing the matrix so that movies that any user is likely to like can be predicted.",
        "Matrix completion generally relies on the low rank hypothesis: because of hidden factors between the observations (the columns of the matrix), the matrix has a low rank.",
        "For instance, in recommender systems it is commonly believed that only a few factors contribute to an individual's tastes.",
        "Formally, recovering a matrix M amounts at solving: minimize rank X subject to Xij = Mij (i, j) ?",

        "This optimization problem seeks the simplest explanation fitting the observed data.",
        "Solving the rank minimization problem has been proved to be NP-hard (Chistov and Grigor?ev, 1984).",
        "However several convex relaxations of this program have been proposed.",
        "In this work, we will consider the relaxation of the rank by the nuclear norm1 that can be efficiently solved by semidefinite programming (Becker et al., 2011).",
        "This relaxation enjoys many theoretical guarantees with respect to the optimality of its solution (under mild assumptions its solution is also the solution of the original problem), the conditions under which the matrix can be recovered and the number of entries that must be sampled to recover the original matrix.",

        "For our experiments we considered two publicly available corpora in which multiple human ratings (i.e. scores on an ordinal scale) were available.",
        "The CECorpus The first corpus of human judgments we have considered has been collected for the WMT12 shared task on quality estimation (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).3 The data set is made of 2, 254 English sentences and their automatic translations in Spanish predicted by a standard Moses system.",
        "Each sentence pair is accompanied by three estimates in the range 1 to 5 of its translation quality expressed in terms of post-editing effort.",
        "These human grades are in the range 1 to 5, the latter standing for a very good translation that hardly requires post-editing, while the former identifies very poor automatic translations that are not deemed to be worth the post-editing effort.",
        "As pointed out by the task organizers, despite the special care that was taken to ensure the quality of the data, the inter-raters agreement was much lower than what is typically observed in NLP tasks (Artstein and Poesio, 2008): the weighted ?",
        "ranged from 0.39 to 0.50 depending on the pair of annotators considered4; the Fleiss coefficient (a generalization of ?",
        "to multi-raters) was 0.25 and the Kendall ?b correlation coefficient5 between 0.64 and 0.68, meaning that, on average, two raters do not agree on the relative order of two translations almost two out of five times.",
        "In fact, as often observed for the sentence level human evaluation of MT outputs, the different judges have used the score scale differently: the second judge had a clear tendency to give more ?medium?",
        "scores than the others, and the variance of her scores was low.",
        "Because theirs distributions are different, standardizing the scores has only a very limited impact on the agreement.",
        "If, as in many manual evaluations, each example had been rated by a single judge chosen randomly, the resulting scores would have been only moderately correlated with the average of the three scores which is, intuitively, a better estimate of the ?true?",

        "score is 0.754?0.755.",
        "TIDES The second corpus considered was collected for the DARPA TIDES program: a team of human judges provided multiple assessments of adequacy and fluency for Arabic to English and Chinese to English automatic translations.6 For space reasons, only results on the Chinese to English fluency corpus will be presented; similar results were achieved on the other corpora.",
        "In the considered corpus, 31 sets of automatic translations, generated by three systems, have been rated by two judges on a scale of 1 to 5.",
        "The inter-rater agreement is very low: depending on the pair of judges, the weighted ?",
        "is between -0.05 and 0.2, meaning that agreement occurs less often than predicted by chance alone.",
        "More importantly, if the ratings of a pair of judges were used to decide which is the best system among two, the two judges will disagree 36% of the time.",
        "This ?agreement?",
        "score is computed as follows: if mA,i is the mean of the scores given to system A by the i-th annotator, we say that there is no agreement in a pairwise comparison if mA,i > mB,i and mA,j < mB,j , i.e. if two judges rank two systems in a different order; the score is then the percentage of agreement when considering all pairs of systems and judges.",
        "Considering the full scoring matrix instead of single scores has a large impact: if each example is rated by a single judge (chosen randomly), the resulting comparison between the two systems will be different from the decision made by averaging the two scores of the full score matrix in almost 20% of the comparisons."
