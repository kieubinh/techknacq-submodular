        "Unsupervised object matching (UOM) is a promising approach to cross-language natural language processing such as bilingual lexicon acquisition, parallel corpus construction, and cross-language text categorization, because it does not require labor-intensive linguistic resources.",
        "However, UOM only finds one-to-one correspondences from data sets with the same number of instances in source and target domains, and this prevents us from applying UOM to real-world cross-language natural language processing tasks.",
        "To alleviate these limitations, we proposes latent semantic matching, which embeds objects in both source and target language domains into a shared latent topic space.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on cross-language text categorization.",
        "The results show that our method outperforms conventional unsupervised object matching methods."

        "Unsupervised object matching is a method for finding one-to-one correspondences between objects across different domains without knowledge about the relation between the domains.",
        "Kernel-ized sorting (Novi et al., 2010) and canonical correlation analysis based methods (Haghighi et al., 2008; Tripathi et al., 2010) are two such examples of unsupervised object matching, which have been shown to be quite useful for cross-language natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "One of the most important properties of the unsupervised object matching is that it does not require any linguistic resources which connects between the languages.",
        "This distinguishes it from other cross-language NLP methods such as machine translation based and projection based approaches (Du-mais et al., 1996; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005; Platt et al., 2010), which we need bilingual dictionaries or parallel sentences.",
        "When we apply unsupervised object matching methods to cross-language NLP tasks, there are two critical problems.",
        "The first is that they only find one-to-one matching.",
        "The second is they require the same size of source-and target-data.",
        "For example, the correct translation of a word is not always unique.",
        "French words ?maison?, ?appart-ment?",
        "and ?domicile?",
        "can be regarded as translation of an English word ?home?.",
        "In addition, English vocabulary size is not equal to that of French.",
        "These discussions motivate us to introduce a shared space in which both source and target domain objects will reside.",
        "If we can obtain such a shared space, we can match objects within the space, because we can use standard distance metrics on this space.",
        "This will also enable us to use various kinds of non-strict matching.",
        "For example, k-nearest objects in the source domain will be retrieved for a query object in the target domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to find the shared space by assuming that two languages have common latent topics, which we call latent semantic matching.",
        "With latent semantic matching, we first find latent topics in two domains independently.",
        "Then, the topics in two domains are aligned by kernelized sorting, and objects are embedded in a shared latent topic space.",
        "Latent topic representations are successfully used in a wide range of NLP tasks, such as information retrieval and text classification, because they represent intrinsic information of documents (Deer-wester et al., 1990).",
        "By matching latent topics, we can find relation between source and target domains, and additionally we can handle different numbers of objects in two domains.",
        "We compared latent semantic matching with conventional unsupervised object matching meth",
        "ods on the task of cross-language text categorization, i.e. classifying target side unlabeled documents by label information obtained from source side documents.",
        "The results show that, with more source side documents, our method achieved the highest classification accuracy."
