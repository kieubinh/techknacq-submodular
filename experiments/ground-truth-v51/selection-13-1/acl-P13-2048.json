        "These resources vary significantly in structure and representation formalism.",
        "In order to develop applications that can make use of different resources, it is essential to link these heterogeneous resources and develop a common representation framework.",
        "However, the differences in encoding of knowledge and multilinguality are the major road blocks in development of such a framework.",
        "Particularly, in a multilingual country like India, information is available in many different languages.",
        "In order to exchange information across cultures and languages, it is essential to create an architecture to share various lexical resources across languages.",
        "In this paper we present IndoNet, a lexical resource created by merging wordnets of 18 different Indian languages1, Universal Word Dictionary (Uchida et al., 1999) and an upper ontology, SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001).",
        "Universal Word (UW), defined by a headword and a set of restrictions which give an unambiguous representation of the concept, forms the vocabulary of Universal Networking Language.",
        "Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) is the largest freely available ontology which is linked to the entire English WordNet (Niles and Pease, 2003).",
        "Though UNL is a graph based representation and SUMO is a formal ontology, both provide language independent conceptualization.",
        "This makes them suitable candidates for interlin-gua.",

        "ILI consists of English synsets and serves as a pivot to link other wordnets.",

        "two basic drawbacks as described in Fellbaum and Vossen (2012), 1.",

        "The semantic space covered by a word in one language often overlaps only partially with a similar word in another language, resulting in less than perfect mappings.",
        "Subsequently in KYOTO project2, ontologies are preferred over ILI for linking of concepts of different languages.",

        "Top level ontology SUMO is used to link common base concepts across languages.",
