        "In our framework, the translation process mainly includes three steps: 1) Source RST-tree acquisition: a source sentence is parsed into an RST tree; 2) Rule extraction: translation rules are extracted from the source tree and the target string via bilingual word alignment; 3) RST-based translation: the source RST-tree is translated with translation rules.",

        "For statistical machine translation (SMT), a crucial issue is how to build a translation model to extract as much accurate and generative translation knowledge as possible.",
        "The existing SMT models have made much progress.",
        "However, they still suffer from the bad performance of unnatural or even unreadable translation, especially when the sentences become complicated.",
        "We think the deep reason is that those models only extract translation information on lexical or syntactic level, but fail to give an overall understanding of source sentences on semantic level of discourse.",
        "In order to solve such problem, (Gong et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011; Wong and Kit, 2012) build discourse-based translation models to ensure the lexical coherence or consistency.",
        "Although some lexicons can be translated better by their models, the overall structure still remains unnatural.",
        "Marcu et al. (2000) design a discourse structure transferring module, but leave much work to do, especially on how to integrate this module into SMT and how to automatically analyze the structures.",
        "Those reasons urge us to seek a new translation framework under the idea of ?translation with overall understanding?.",
        "Rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) provides us with a good perspective and inspiration to build such a framework.",
        "Generally, an RST tree can explicitly show the minimal spans with semantic functional integrity, which are called elementary discourse units (edus) (Marcu et al., 2000), and it also depicts the hierarchical relations among edus.",
        "Furthermore, since different languages?",
        "edus are usually equivalent on semantic level, it is intuitive to create a new framework based on RST by directly mapping the source edus to target ones.",
        "Taking the Chinese-to-English translation as an example, our translation framework works as the following steps: 1) Source RST-tree acquisition: a source sentence is parsed into an RST-tree; 2) Rule extraction: translation rules are extracted from the source tree and the target string via bilingual word alignment; 3) RST-based translation: the source RST-tree is translated into target sentence with extracted translation rules.",
        "Experiments on Chinese-to-English sentence-level discourses demonstrate that this method achieves significant improvements."
