        "We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation.",
        "Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferredMEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire -- even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language.",
        "We argue that by preserving the meaning of the translations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules.",
        "As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate.",

        "We present the first ever results of tuning a statistical machine translation (SMT) system against a semantic frame based objective function in order to produce a more adequate output.",
        "We compare the performance of our system with that of two baseline SMT systems tuned against BLEU and TER, the commonly used n-gram and edit distance based metrics.",
        "Our system performs better than the baseline across seven commonly used evaluation metrics and subjective human evaluation on adequacy.",
        "Surprisingly, tuning against a semantic MT evaluation metric also significantly outperforms the baseline on the domain of informal web forum data wherein automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse.",
        "These results strongly indicate that using a semantic frame based objective function for tuning would drive development of MT towards direction of higher utility.",
        "Glaring errors caused by semantic role confusion that plague the state-of-the-art MT systems are a consequence of using fast and cheap lexical n-gram based objective functions like BLEU to drive their development.",
        "Despite enforcing fluency it has been established that these metrics do not enforce translation utility adequately and often fail to preservemeaning closely (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006).",
        "We argue that instead of BLEU, a metric that focuses on getting the meaning right should be used as an objective function for tuning SMT so as to drive continuing progress towards higher utility.",
        "MEANT (Lo et al., 2012), is an automatic semantic MT evaluation metric that measures similarity between the MT output and the reference translation via semantic frames.",
        "It correlates better with human adequacy judgment than other automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Since a high MEANT score is contingent on correct lexical choices as well as syntactic and semantic structures, we believe that tuning against MEANT would improve both translation adequacy and fluency.",
        "Incorporating semantic structures into SMT by tuning against a semantic frame based evaluation metric is independent of the MT paradigm.",
        "Therefore, systems from different MT paradigms (such as hierarchical, phrase based, transduction grammar based) can benefit from the semantic information incorporated through our approach."

        "Relatively little work has been done towards biasing the translation decisions of an SMT system to produce adequate translations that correctly pre-servewho did what to whom, when, where and why (Pradhan et al., 2004).",
        "This is because the development of SMT systemswas predominantly driven by tuning against n-gram based evaluation metrics such as BLEU or edit distance based metrics such as TER which do not sufficiently bias SMT system's decisions to produce adequate translations.",
        "Although there has been a recent surge of work aimed towards incorporating semantics into the SMT pipeline, none attempt to tune against a semantic objective function.",
        "Below, we describe some of the attempts to incorporate semantic information into the SMT and present a brief survey on evaluation metrics that focus on rewarding semantically valid translations.",
        "Utilizing semantics in SMT In the past few years, there has been a surge of work aimed at incorporating semantics into various stages of the SMT.",
        "Wu and Fung (2009) propose a two-pass model that reorders the MT output to match the SRL of the input, which is too late to affect the translation decisions made by the MT system during decoding.",
        "In contrast, training against a semantic objective function attempts to improve the decoding search strategy by incorporating a bias towards meaningful translations into the model instead of postprocessing its results.",
        "Komachi et al. (2006) and Wu et al. (2011) pre-process the input sentence to match the verb frame alternations in the output side.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2010) and Aziz et al. (2011) use input side SRL to train a tree-to-string SMT system.",
        "Xiong et al. (2012) trained a discriminative model to predict the position of the semantic roles in the output.",
        "All these approaches are orthogonal to the present question of whether to train toward a semantic objective function.",
        "Any of the above models could potentially benefit from tuning with semantic metrics.",
        "MT evaluation metrics As mentioned previously, tuning against n-gram based metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Dod-dington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) does not sufficiently drive SMT into making decisions to produce adequate translations that correctly preserve 'who did what to whom, when, where and why'.",
        "In fact, a number of large scale meta-evaluations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006) report cases where BLEU strongly disagrees with human judg-ments of translation accuracy.",
        "Tuning against edit distance based metrics such as CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) also fails to sufficiently bias SMT systems towards producing translations that preserve semantic information.",
        "We argue that an SMT system tuned against an adequacy-oriented metric that correlates well with human adequacy judgement produces more adequate translations.",
        "For this purpose, we choose MEANT, an automatic semantic MT evaluation metric that focuses on getting the meaning right by comparing the semantic structures of the MT output and the reference.",
        "We briefly describe some of the alternative semantic metrics below to justify our choice.",
        "ULC (Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2007, 2008) is an aggregated metric that incorporates several semantic similarity features and shows improved correlation with human judgement on translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Gim?nez and M?rquez, 2008) but no work has been done towards tuning an MT system against ULC perhaps due to its expensive running time.",
        "Lambert et al. (2006) did tune on QUEEN, a simplified version of ULC that discards the semantic features and is based on pure lexical features.",
        "Although tuning on QUEEN produced slightly more preferable translations than solely tuning on BLEU, themetric does not make use of any semantic features and thus fails to exploit any potential gains from tuning to semantic objectives.",
        "Although TINE (Rios et al., 2011) is an recall-oriented automatic evaluation metric which aims to preserve the basic event structure, no work has been done towards tuning an SMT system against it.",
        "TINE performs comparably to BLEU andworse than METEOR on correlation with human adequacy judgment.",
        "In contrast to TINE, MEANT (Lo et al., 2012), which is the weighted f-score over the matched semantic role labels of the automatically aligned semantic frames and role fillers, outperforms BLEU, NIST, METEOR, WER, CDER and TER.",
        "This makes it more suitable for tuning SMT systems to produce much adequate translations."
