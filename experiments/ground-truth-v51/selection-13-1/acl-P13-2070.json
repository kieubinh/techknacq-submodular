        "We propose a novel coupled Dirichlet process mixture model (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters and bilingually aligns transliteration data within a single unified model.",

        "Machine transliteration methods can be categorized into phonetic-based models (Knight et al., 1998), spelling-based models (Brill et al., 2000), and hybrid models which utilize both phonetic and spelling information (Oh et al., 2005; Oh et al., 2006).",
        "Among them, statistical spelling-based models which directly align characters in the training corpus have become popular because they are language-independent, do not require phonetic knowledge, and are capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance (Zhang et al., 2012b).",
        "A major problem with real-word transliteration corpora is that they are usually not clean, may contain name pairs with various linguistic origins and this can hinder the performance of spelling-based models because names from different origins obey different pronunciation rules, for example:",
        "The same Chinese character ???",
        "should be aligned to different romanized character sequences: ?Kim?, ?Kana?, ?King?, ?Jin?.",
        "To address this issue, many name classification methods have been proposed, such as the supervised language model-based approach of (Li et al., 2007), and the unsupervised approach of (Huang et al., 2005) that used a bottom-up clustering algorithm.",
        "(Li et al., 2007) proposed a supervised transliteration model which classifies names based on their origins and genders using a language model; it switches between transliteration models based on the input.",
        "(Hagiwara et al., 2011) tackled the issue by using an unsupervised method based on the EM algorithm to perform a soft classification.",
        "Recently, non-parametric Bayesian models (Finch et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; Hagiwara et al., 2012) have attracted much attention in the transliteration field.",
        "In comparison to many of the previous alignment models (Li et al., 2004; Jiampojamarn et al., 2007; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), the non-parametric Bayesian models allow unconstrained monotonic many-to-many alignment and are able to overcome the inherent over-fitting problem.",
        "Until now most of the previous work (Li et al., 2007; Hagiwara et al., 2011) is either affected by the multi-origins factor, or has issues with over-fitting.",
        "(Hagiwara et al., 2012) took these two factors into consideration, but their approach still operates within an EM framework and model order selection by hand is necessary prior to training.",
        "We propose a simple, elegant, fully-unsupervised solution based on a single generative model able to both cluster and align simultaneously.",
        "The coupled Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (cDPMM) integrates a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) (Antoniak, 1974) and a Bayesian Bilingual Alignment Model (BBAM) (Finch et al., 2010).",
        "The two component models work synergistically to support one another: the clustering model sorts the data into classes so that self-consistent alignment models can be built using data of the same type, and at the same time the alignment probabilities from the alignment models drive the clustering process.",
