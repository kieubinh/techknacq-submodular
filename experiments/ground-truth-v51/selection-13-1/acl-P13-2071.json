        "Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) learn local dependencies such as reorderings, idiomatic collocations, deletions and insertions by memorization.",
        "A fundamental drawback is that phrases are translated and reordered independently of each other and contextual information outside of phrasal boundaries is ignored.",
        "The monolingual language model somewhat reduces this problem.",
        "However i) often the language model cannot overcome the dispreference of the translation model for nonlocal dependencies, ii) source-side contextual dependencies are still ignored and iii) generation of lexical translations and reordering is separated.",
        "The N-gram-based SMT framework addresses these problems by learning Markov chains over sequences of minimal translation units (MTUs) also known as tuples (Marin?o et al., 2006) or over operations coupling lexical generation and reordering (Durrani et al., 2011).",
        "Because the models condition the MTU probabilities on the previous MTUs, they capture non-local dependencies and both source and target contextual information across phrasal boundaries.",
        "In this paper we study the effect of integrating tuple-based N-gram models (TSM) and operation-based N-gram models (OSM) into the phrase-based model in Moses, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.",
        "Rather than using POS-based rewrite rules (Crego and Marin?o, 2006) to form a search graph, we use the ability of the phrase-based system to memorize larger translation units to replicate the effect of source linearization as done in the TSM model.",
        "We also show that using phrase-based search with MTU N-gram translation models helps to address some of the search problems that are non-trivial to handle when decoding with minimal translation units.",
        "An important limitation of the OSM N-gram model is that it does not handle unaligned or discontinuous target MTUs and requires post-processing of the alignment to remove these.",
        "Using phrases during search enabled us to make novel changes to the OSM generative story (also applicable to the TSM model) to handle unaligned target words and to use target linearization to deal with discontinuous target MTUs.",
        "We performed an extensive evaluation, carrying out translation experiments from French, Spanish, Czech and Russian to English and in the opposite direction.",
        "Our integration of the OSM model into Moses and our modification of the OSM model to deal with unaligned and discontinuous target tokens consistently improves BLEU scores over the",
        "baseline system, and shows statistically significant improvements in seven out of eight cases."
