        "In question answering (QA), as in most Natural Language Processing domains, English is the best resourced language, in terms of corpora, lexicons, or systems.",
        "Many methods are based on supervised machine learning which is made possible by the great amount of resources for this language.",
        "While developing a question answering system for French, we were thus limited by the lack of resources for this language.",
        "Some were created, for example for answer validation (Grappy et al., 2011).",
        "Yet, for question classification, although question corpora in French exist, only a small part of them is annotated with question classes, and such an annotation is costly.",
        "We thus wondered if it was possible to use existing English corpora, in this case the data used in (Li and Roth, 2002), to create a classification module for French.",
        "Transfering knowledge from one language to another is usually done by exploiting parallel corpora; yet in this case, few such corpora exists (CLEF QA datasets could be used, but question classes are not very precise).",
        "We thus investigated the possibility of using machine translation to create a parallel corpus, as has been done for spoken language understanding (Jabaian et al., 2011) for example.",
        "The idea is that using machine translation would enable us to have a large training corpus, either by using the English one and translating the test corpus, or by translating the training corpus.",
        "One of the questions posed was whether the quality of present machine translation systems would enable to learn the classification properly.",
        "This paper presents a question classification transfer method, which results are close to those of a monolingual system.",
        "The contributions of the paper are the following: ?",
        "comparison of train-on-target and test-on-source strategies for question classification; ?",
        "creation of an effective question classification system for French, with minimal annotation effort.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: The problem of Question Classification is defined in section 2.",
        "The proposed methods are presented in section 3, and the experiments in section 4.",
        "Section 5 details the related works in Question Answering.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes with a summary and a few directions for future work."

        "Most systems include a question classification step which determines the expected answer type, for example area in the previous case.",
        "This type can then be used to extract the correct answer in documents.",

        "Table 1 shows the results obtained with the basic configuration, for both transfer methods.",
        "Results are given in precision, i.e. the proportion of correctly classified questions among the test questions 3.",
        "Using word n-grams, monolingual English classification obtains .798 correct classification for the fine grained classes, and .90 for the coarse grained classes, results which are very close to those obtained by (Zhang and Lee, 2003).",
        "On French, we obtain lower results: .769 for fine grained classes, and .84 for coarse grained classes, probably mostly due to the smallest size of the training corpus: (Zhang and Lee, 2003) had a precision of .65 for the fine grained classification with a 1,000 questions training corpus.",
        "When translating test questions from French to English, classification precision decreases, as was expected from (Cumbreras et al., 2006).",
        "Yet, when translating the training corpus from English to French and learning the classification model 3We measured the significance of precision differences (Student t test, p=.05), for each level of the hierarchy between each test, and, unless indicated otherwise, comparable results are significantly different in each condition.",
        "levels of the hierarchy (features = word n-grams with abbreviations, classifier = libsvm) on this translated corpus, precision is close to the French monolingual one for coarse grained classes and a little higher than monolingual for fine grained classification (and close to the English monolingual one): this method gives precisions of .794 for fine grained classes and .828 for coarse grained classes.",
        "One possible explanation is that the condition when test questions are translated is very sensitive to translation errors: if one of the test questions is not correcly translated, the classifier will have a hard time categorizing it.",
        "If the training corpus is translated, translation errors can be counterbalanced by correct translations.",
        "In the following results, we do not consider the ?en to en (trans)?",
        "method since it systematically gives lower results.",
        "As results were lower than our existing rule-based method, we added parts-of-speech as features in order to try to improve them, as well as semantic classes: the classes are lists of words related to a particular category; for example ?president?",
        "usually means that a person is expected as an answer.",
        "Table 2 shows the classification performance with this additional information.",
        "Classification is slightly improved, but only for coarse grained classes (the difference is not significant for fine grained classes).",
        "When analyzing the results, we noted that most confusion errors were due to the type of features given as inputs: for example, to correctly classify the question ?What is BPH??",
        "as a question expecting an expression corresponding to an abbreviation (ABBR:exp class in the hierarchy), it is necessary to know that ?BPH?",
        "is an abbreviation.",
        "We thus added a specific feature to detect if a question word is an abbreviation, simply by test",
        "levels of the hierarchy (features = word n-grams with abbreviations, classifier = libsvm) ing if it contains only upper case letters, and normalizing them.",
        "Table 3 gives the results with this additional feature (we only kept the method with translation of the training corpus since results were much higher).",
        "Precision is improved for both levels of the hierarchy: for fine grained classes, results increase from .794 to .837, and for coarse grained classes, from .828 to .869.",
        "Remaining classification errors are much more disparate."

        "Finally, as interrogative forms occur rarely is corpora, their translation is usually of a slightly lower quality.",
        "A possible future direction for this work could be to use a specific model of translation for questions in order to learn question classification on higher quality translations."
