        "Insightful analysis of literary fiction often challenges trained human readers let alne machines.",
        "In fact, some humanists believe literary analysis is so closely tied to the human condition that it is impossible for computers to perform.",
        "In his book Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism, Stephen Ramsay (2011) states: Tools that can adjudicate the hermeneu-tical parameters of human reading ex-periences...stretch considerably beyond the most ambitious fantasies of artificial intelligence.",
        "Antonio Roque (2012) has challenged Ramsay's claim, and certainly there has been successful work done in the computational analysis and mod-eling of narratives, as we will review in the next section.",
        "However, we believe that most previous work (except possibly (Elsner, 2012)) has failed to directly address the root cause of Ramsay's skep-ticism: can computers extract the emotions encoded in a narrative?",
        "For example, can the love that Shakespeare's Juliet feels for Romeo be computationally tracked?",
        "Empathizing with characters along their journeys to emotional highs and lows is often what makes a narrative compelling for a reader, and therefore we believe mapping these journeys is the first step in capturing the human reading experience.",
        "Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, computational modeling of the emotional relationships described in natural language text remains a daunting technical challenge.",
        "The reason this task is so difficult is that emotions are indistinct and often subtly conveyed, especially in text with literary merit.",
        "Humans typically achieve no greater than 80% accuracy in sentiment classification experiments involving product reviews (Pang et al., 2002) (Ga-mon, 2004).",
        "Similar experiments on fiction texts would presumably yield even higher error rates.",
        "In order to attack this open problem and make further progress towards refuting Ramsay's claim, we turn to shallow statistical approaches.",
        "Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) has been successfully applied to mine social media data for emotional responses to events, public figures, and consumer products just by using emotion lexicons?lists that map words to polarity values (+1 for positive sentiment, 1 for negative) or valence values that try to capture degrees of polarity.",
        "In the following paper, we describe our attempts to use modern sentiment lexicons and dialogue structure to algorithmically track and model?with no domain-specific customization'the emotion dynamics between characters in Shakespeare's plays.1"

        "Sentiment analysis (SA) is now widely used commercially to infer user opinions from product reviews and social-media messages (Pang and Lee,",
        "2008).",
        "Traditional machine learning techniques on n-grams, parts of speech, and other bag of words features can be used when the data is labeled (e.g. IMDB's user reviews are labeled with one to ten stars, which are assumed to correlate with the text's polarity) (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "But text annotated with its true sentiments is hard to come by so often labels must be obtained via crowdsourcing.",
        "Knowledge-based methods (which also typically rely on crowdsourcing) provide an alternative to using labeled data (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2007).",
        "These methods are driven by sentiment lexicons, fixed lists associating words with ?valences?",
        "(signed integers representing positive and negative feelings) (Kim and Hovy, 2004).",
        "Some lexicons allow for analysis of specific emotions by associating words with degrees of fear, joy, surprise, anger, anticipation, etc.",
        "(Strappar-ava and Valitutti, 2004) (Mohammad and Turney, 2008).",
        "Unsurprisingly, methods which, like these, lack deep understanding often work more reliably as the length of the input text increases.",
        "Turning our attention now to automatic semantic analysis of fiction, it seems that narrative mod-eling and summarization has been the most intensively studied application.",
        "Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) described a system that can learn (without supervision) the sequence of events described in a narrative, and Elson and McKeown (2009) created a platform that can symbolically represent and reason over narratives.",
        "Narrative structure has also been studied by representing character interactions as networks.",
        "Mutton (2004) adapted methods for extracting social networks from Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to mine Shakespeare's plays for their networks.",
        "Extending this line of work to novels, Elson and McKeown (2010) developed a reliable method for speech attribution in unstructured texts, and then used this method to successfully extract social networks from Victorian novels (Elson et al., 2010)(Agar-wal et al., 2012).",
        "While structure is undeniably important, we believe analyzing a narrative's emotions is essential to capturing the ?reading experience,?",
        "which is a view others have held.",
        "Alm and Sproat (2005) analyzed Brothers Grimm fairy tales for their ?emotional trajectories,?",
        "finding emotion typically increases as a story progresses.",
        "Mohammad (2011) scaled-up their work by using a crowd-sourced emotion lexicon to track emotion dynamics over the course of many novels and plays, including Shakespeare?s.",
        "In the most recent work we are aware of, Elsner (2012) analyzed emotional trajectories at the character level, showing how Miss Elizabeth Bennet's emotions change over the course of Pride and Prejudice.",
        "by Hamet's sentiment towards them.",
        "Expectedly, Claudius draws the most negative emotion.",
        "We attempt to further Elsner's line of work by leveraging text structure (as Mutton and Elson did) and knowlege-based SA to track the emotional trajectories of interpersonal relationships rather than of a whole text or an isolated character.",
        "To extract these relationships, we mined for character-to-character sentiment by summing the valence values (provided by the AFINN sentiment lexicon (Nielsen, 2011)) over each instance of continuous speech and then assumed that sentiment was directed towards the character that spoke immediately before the current speaker.",
        "This assumption doesn't always hold; it is not uncommon to find a scene in which two characters are expressing feelings about someone offstage.",
        "Yet our initial results on Shakespeare's plays show that the instances of face-to-face dialogue produce a strong enough signal to generate sentiment rankings that match our expectations.",
        "For example, Hamlet's sentiment rankings upon the conclusion of his play are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Not surprisingly, Claudius draws the most negative sentiment from Hamlet, receiving a score of -27.",
