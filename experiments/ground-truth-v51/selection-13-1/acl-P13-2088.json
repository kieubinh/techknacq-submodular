        "Most of the current research has focused on building sentiment analysis applications for the English language (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010; Korayem et al., 2012), with much less work on other languages.",
        "In particular, there has been little work on sentiment analysis in Arabic (Ab-basi et al., 2008; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b; Korayem et al., 2012), and very few, considerably small-sized, datasets to work with (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b; Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011a; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012a; Elar-naoty et al., 2012).",
        "In this work, we try to address the lack of large-scale Arabic sentiment analysis datasets in this field, in the hope of sparking more interest in research in Arabic sentiment analysis and related tasks.",
        "Towards this end, we introduce LABR, the Large-scale Arabic Book Review dataset.",
        "It is a set of over 63K book reviews, each with a rating of 1 to 5 stars.",
        "We make the following contributions: (1) We present the largest Arabic sentiment analysis dataset to-date (up to our knowledge); (2) We provide standard splits for the dataset into training and testing sets.",

        "It is divided into 250 positive and 250 negative reviews, although the division is not standard in that there is no rating for neutral reviews i.e. for 10-star rating systems, ratings above and including 5 are considered positive and those below 5 are considered negative.",
