        "We focus on direct quotes as expressions of opinion, as they can be accurately extracted and attributed to a speaker (O?Keefe et al., 2012).",
        "Characterising the opinions in quotes remains challenging.",
        "In sentiment analysis over product reviews, polarity labels are commonly used because the target, the product, is clearly identified.",
        "However, for quotes on topics of debate, the target and meaning of polarity labels is less clear.",
        "For example, labelling a quote about abortion as simply positive or negative is uninformative, as a speaker can use either positive or negative language to support or oppose either side of the debate.",
        "Previous work (Wiebe et al., 2005; Balahur et al., 2010) has addressed this by giving each expression of opinion a textually-anchored target.",
        "While this makes sense for named entities, it does not apply as obviously for topics, such as abortion, that may not be directly mentioned.",
        "Our solution is to instead define position statements, which are Abortion: Women should have the right to choose an abortion.",
        "Carbon tax: Australia should introduce a tax on carbon or an emissions trading scheme to combat global warming.",
        "Immigration: Immigration into Australia should be maintained or increased because its benefits outweigh any negatives.",
        "Reconciliation: The Australian government should formally apologise to the Aboriginal people for past injustices.",
        "Republic: Australia should cease to be a monarchy with the Queen as head of state and become a republic with an Australian head of state.",
        "Same-sex marriage: Same-sex couples should have the right to attain the legal state of marriage as it is for heterosexual couples.",
        "Work choices: Australia should introduce WorkChoices to give employers more control over wages and conditions.",
        "clear statements of a viewpoint or position on a particular topic.",
        "Quotes related to this topic can then be labelled as supporting, neutral, or opposing the position statement.",
        "This disambiguates the meaning of the polarity labels, and allows us to determine the side of the debate that the speaker is on.",

        "In these cases, labels like positive and negative are appropriate as they align well with the overall communicative goal of the text.",
        "Later work established aspect-oriented opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 2004), where the aim is to find features or aspects of products that are discussed in a review.",
        "The reviewer's position on each aspect can then be classified as positive or negative, which results in a more fine-grained classification that can be combined to form an opinion summary.",

        "In all of these studies the authors have textually-anchored the target of the sentiment.",

        "Work on debate summarisation and subgroup detection (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2012) has often used data from online debate forums, particularly those forums where users are asked to select whether they support or oppose a given proposition before they can participate.",
