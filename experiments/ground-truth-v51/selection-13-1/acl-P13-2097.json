        "The purpose of machine translation (MT) quality estimation (QE) is to provide a quality prediction for new, unseen machine translated texts, without relying on reference translations (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "This task is usually addressed with machine learning models trained on datasets composed of source sentences, their machine translations, and a quality label assigned by humans.",
        "A common use of quality predictions is the decision between post-editing a given machine translated sentence and translating its source from scratch, based on whether its post-editing effort is estimated to be lower than the effort of translating the source sentence.",
        "Since quality scores for the training of QE models are given by human experts, the annotation process is costly and subject to inconsistencies due to the subjectivity of the task.",
        "To avoid inconsistencies because of disagreements among annotators, it is often recommended that a QE model is trained for each translator, based on labels given by such a translator (Specia, 2011).",
        "This further increases the annotation costs because different datasets are needed for different tasks.",
        "Therefore, strategies to reduce the demand for annotated data are needed.",
        "Such strategies can also bring the possibility of selecting data that is less prone to inconsistent annotations, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions.",
        "In this paper we investigate Active Learning (AL) techniques to reduce the size of the dataset while keeping the performance of the resulting QE models.",
        "AL provides methods to select informative data points from a large pool which, if labelled, can potentially improve the performance of a machine learning algorithm (Settles, 2010).",
        "The rationale behind these methods is to help the learning algorithm achieve satisfactory results from only on a subset of the available data, thus incurring less annotation effort."

        "For three datasets, the AL methods significantly outperformed the random selection baseline, while no improvement was observed on the ar-en-1 dataset.",
        "Results are summarised in Table 1.",
        "The learning curves in Figure 1 show an interesting behaviour for most AL methods: some of them were able to yield lower MAE scores than models trained on the full dataset.",

        "Best scores are shown in bold and are significantly better (paired t-test, p < 0.05) than both their randomly selected counterparts and the full dataset MAE.",
        "datasets than those used currently can be sufficient for machine translation QE.",
        "The best MAE scores achieved for each dataset are shown in Table 2.",
        "The figures were tested for significance using pairwise t-test with 95% confidence,3 with boldfaced values in the table indicating significantly better results.",
        "The lower bounds in MAE given by the oracle curves show that AL methods can indeed improve the performance of QE models: an ideal query method would achieve a very large improvement in MAE using fewer than 200 instances in all datasets.",
        "The fact that different datasets present similar oracle curves suggests that this is not related for a specific dataset but actually a common behaviour in QE.",
        "Although some of this gain in MAE may be due to overfitting to the test set, the results obtained with the fr-en and ar-en-2 datasets are very promising, and therefore we believe that it is possible to use AL to improve QE results in other cases, as long as more effective query techniques are designed.",
        "5 Further analysis on the oracle behaviour By analysing the oracle curves we can observe another interesting phenomenon which is the rapid increase in error when reaching the last ?200 instances of the training data.",
        "A possible explana3We took the average of the MAE scores obtained from the 20 runs with each query method for that.",
        "tion for this behaviour is the existence of erroneous, inconsistent or contradictory labels in the datasets.",
        "Quality annotation is a subjective task by nature, and it is thus subject to noise, e.g., due to misinterpretations or disagreements.",
        "Our hypothesis is that these last sentences are the most difficult to annotate and therefore more prone to disagreements.",
        "To investigate this phenomenon, we performed an additional experiment with the en-es dataset, the only dataset for which multiple annotations are available (from three judges).",
        "We measure the Kappa agreement index (Cohen, 1960) between all pairs of judges in the subset containing the first 300 instances (the 50 initial random instances plus 250 instances chosen by the oracle).",
        "We then measured Kappa in windows of 300 instances until the last instance of the training set is selected by the oracle method.",
        "We also measure variances in sentence length using windows of 300 instances.",
        "The idea of this experiment is to test whether sentences that are more difficult to annotate (because of their length or subjectivity, generating more disagreement between the judges) add noise to the dataset.",
        "The resulting Kappa curves are shown in Figure 2: the agreement between judges is high for the initial set of sentences selected, tends to decrease until it reaches ?1000 instances, and then starts to increase again.",
        "Figure 3 shows the results for source sentence length, which follow the same trend (in a reversed manner).",
        "Contrary to our hy",
        "horizontal axis shows the number of instances and the vertical axis shows the kappa values.",
        "Each point in the curves shows the kappa index for a window containing the last 300 sentences chosen by the oracle.",
        "pothesis, these results suggest that the most difficult sentences chosen by the oracle are those in the middle range instead of the last ones.",
        "If we compare this trend against the oracle curve in Figure 1, we can see that those middle instances are the ones that do not change the performance of the oracle.",
        "The resulting trends are interesting because they give evidence that sentences that are difficult to annotate do not contribute much to QE performance (although not hurting it either).",
        "However, they do not confirm our hypothesis about the oracle behaviour.",
        "Another possible source of disagreement is the feature set: the features may not be discriminative enough to distinguish among different instances, i.e., instances with very similar features but different labels might be genuinely different, but the current features are not sufficient to indicate that.",
        "In future work we plan to further investigate this by hypothesis by using other feature sets and analysing their behaviour."
