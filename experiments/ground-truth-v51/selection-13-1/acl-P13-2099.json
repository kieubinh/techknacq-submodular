        "Faced with thousands of news articles, people usually try to ask the general aspects such as the beginning, the evolutionary pattern and the end.",
        "General search engines simply return the top ranking articles according to query relevance and fail to trace how a specific event goes.",
        "Timeline summarization, which aims at generating a series of concise summaries for news collection published at different epochs can give readers a faster and better access to understand the evolution of news.",
        "The key of timeline summarization is how to select sentences which can tell readers the evolutionary pattern of topics in the event.",
        "It is very common that the themes of a corpus evolve over time, and topics of adjacent epochs usually exhibit strong correlations.",
        "Thus, it is important to model topics across different documents and over different time periods to detect how the events evolve.",
        "The task of timelime summarization is firstly proposed by Allan et al(2001) by extracting clusters of noun phases and name entities.",
        "Chieu et al.",
        "(2004) built a similar system in unit of sentences with interest and burstiness.",
        "However, these methods seldom explored the evolutionary characteristics of news.",
        "Recently, Yan et al(2011) extended the graph based sentence ranking algorithm used in traditional multi-document summarization (MDS) to timeline generation by projecting sentences from different time into one plane.",
        "They further explored the timeline task from the optimization of a function considering the combination of different respects such as relevance, coverage, coherence and diversity (Yan et al., 2011b).",
        "However, their approaches just treat timeline generation as a sentence ranking or optimization problem and seldom explore the topic information lied in the corpus.",
        "Recently, topic models have been widely used for capturing the dynamics of topics via time.",
        "Many dynamic approaches based on LDA model (Blei et al., 2003) or Hierarchical Dirichelt Pro-cesses(HDP) (Teh et al., 2006) have been proposed to discover the evolving patterns in the corpus as well as the snapshot clusters at each time epoch (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Chakrabarti et al., 2006; Wang and McCallum, 2007; Caron et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2008; Ahmed and Xing, 2008; Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we propose EHDP: a evolutionary hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model for timeline summarization.",
        "In EHDP, each HDP is built for multiple corpora at each time epoch, and the time dependencies are incorporated into epochs under the Markovian assumptions.",
