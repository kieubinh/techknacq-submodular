        "Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic trees, capturing the predicate-argument structure of natural language sentences (de Marn-effe et al., 2006).",
        "The SD representation proved useful in a range of downstream tasks, including Textual Entailments (Dagan et al., 2006) and BioNLP (Fundel and Zimmer., 2007), and in recent years SD structures have also become a de-facto standard for parser evaluation in English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008a; Cer et al., 2010; Nivre et al., 2010).",
        "Efforts now commence towards extending SD for cross-lingual annotation and evaluation (McDonald et al., 2013; Che et al., 2012; Haverinen et al., 2011).",
        "By and large, these efforts aim to remain as close as possible to the original SD scheme.",
        "However, the original SD design emphasizes word-tokens and configurational structures, and consequently, these schemes overlook properties and realization patterns observed in a range of languages known as Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).",
        "MRLs use word-level affixes to express grammatical relations that are typically indicated by structural positions in English.",
        "By virtue of word-level morphological marking, word-order in MRLs may be flexible.",
        "MRLs have been a focal point for the parsing community due to the challenges that these phenomena pose for systems originally developed for English.1 Here we argue that the SD hierarchy and design principles similarly emphasize English-like structures and under-represent morphosyntactic argument-marking alternatives.",
        "We define an extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally and morphologically marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy.",
        "We extend SD with a functional branch, and provide a principled treatment of morpho-syntactic argument marking.",
        "Based on the U-SD scheme we create a new parallel resource for the MRL Modern Hebrew, whereby aligned constituency and dependency trees reflect equivalent U-SD annotations (cf. Rambow (2010)) for the same set of sentences.",
        "We present two systems that can automatically learn U-SD annotations, from the dependency and the constituency versions respectively, delivering high baseline accuracy on the prediction task."

        "Stanford Dependencies (SD) (de Marneffe et al., 2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008b) deliver a functional representation of natural language sentences, inspired by theoretical linguistic work such as studies on Relational Grammars (Postal and Perlmutter, 1977), Lexical Functional Grammars (LFG) (Bresnan, 2000) and the PARC dependency scheme (King et al., 2003).",
        "At the same time, the scheme is designed with end-users in mind, allowing them to utilize parser output in a form which is intuitively interpretable and easily processed.",
        "SD basic trees represent sentences as binary relations between word tokens.",
        "These relations are labeled using traditional grammatical concepts (subject, object, modifier) that are arranged into an inheritance hierarchy (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008a, Sec. 3).",
        "There are different versions of SD annotations: the basic SD scheme, which annotates surface dependency relations as a tree spanning all word tokens in the sentence, and the collapsed SD version, in which function words (such as prepositions) are collapsed and used for specifying a direct relation between content words.",
        "The SD scheme defines a core set of labels and principles which are assumed to be useful for different languages.",
        "However, a close examination of the SD label-set and inheritance hierarchy reveals that some of its design principles are geared towards English-like (that is, configu-rational) phenomena, and conflict with basic properties of MRLs.",
        "Let us list three such design principles and outline the challenges that they pose.",
        "2.1.",
        "SD relate input-tokens.",
        "In MRLs, substantial information is expressed as word affixes.",
        "One or more morphemes may be appended to a content word, and several morphemes may be contained in a single space-delimited token.",
        "For example, the Hebrew token wkfraiti2 in (1) includes the morphemes w (and), kf (when) and raiti (saw); the latter segment is a content word, and the former two are functional morphemes.",
        "orated with function labels as dash features.",
        "Na?",
        "?vely taking input tokens as words fails to capture meaningful relations between morphological segments internal to space-delimited tokens.",
        "2.2.",
        "SD label structurally-marked relations.",
        "Configurational languages like English use function words such as prepositions and auxiliaries to indicate relations between content words and to mark properties of complete structures.",
        "In MRLs, such relations and properties may be indicated by word-level morphological marking such as case (Blake, 1994) and agreement (Corbett, 2006).",
        "In (1), for instance, the case marker at indicates an accusative object relation between ?see?",
        "and ?movie?, to be distinguished from, e.g, a dative object.",
        "Moreover, the agreement in (1) on the definite morpheme signals that ?old?",
        "modifies ?movie?.",
        "While the original SD scheme label-set covers function words (e.g. auxpass, expl, prep), it misses labels for bound morphemes that mark grammatical relations across languages (such as accusative, dative or genitive).",
        "Explicit labeling of such relational morphemes will allow us to benefit from the information that they provide.",
        "2.3.",
        "SD relations may be inferred using structural cues.",
        "SD relations are extracted from different types of trees for the purpose of, e.g., cross-framework evaluation (Cer et al., 2010).",
        "Insofar, recovering SD relations from phrase-structure (PS) trees have used a range of structural cues such as positions and phrase-labels (see, for instance, the software of de Marneffe and Manning (2008a)).",
        "In MRLs, positions and phrase types may not suffice for recovering SD relations: an NP under S in Hebrew, for instance, may be a subject or an object, as shown in Figure 1, and morphological information then determines the function of these constituents.",
        "Automatically inferring predicate-argument structures across treebanks thus must rely on both structural and morphological marking, calling for a single annotation scheme that interrelate the marking alternatives.",

        "The U-SD scheme provides the syntactic representation of S by means of a set of triplets (l, si, sj) consisting of a label l, a head si and a dependent sj (i 6= j).",
        "The segments are assumed to be numbered x.y where x is the position of the input token, and y is the position of the segment inside the token.",

        "The U-SD Hierarchy.",
        "Figure 3 shows our proposed U-SD hierarchy.",
        "Everything in the ontology is of type gf (grammatical function).",
        "We define five ontological sub-types: root, hd, dep, func, punct.",
        "The root marks a special root dependency.",
        "The dep branch is used for dependent types, and it retains much of the structure in the original SD scheme (separating sbj types, obj types, mod types, etc.).",
        "The new func branch contains argument-marking elements, that is, function words and morphemes that play a role in indicating properties or grammatical relations in the syntactic representation.",
        "These functional elements may be of types marker (prepositions and case), aux (auxiliary verbs and copular elements) and sub (subordination/conjunction markers).",
        "All inherited func elements may be consumed (henceforth, collapsed) in order to infer grammatical properties and relations between content words.",
        "Head types are implicit in dependency triplets, however, when decorating PS trees with dependency labels as dash features or edge features (as in TigerXML formats (Brants et al., 2002) or via unification-based formalisms) both heads and dependents are labeled with their grammatical types (see Figure 2(a)).",
        "The hd branch extends the scheme with an inventory of argument-taking elements, to be used when employing SD inside constituency treebanks.",
        "The punct branch is reserved for punctuation, prosody and other non-verbal speech acts.",

        "Annotation Guidelines.",

        "Structural properties (e.g., case) are marked on a content word to indicate its rela",
        "tion to other parts of the sentence.",
        "Inherent properties (gender, number, etc.)",
        "indicate inherent semantic properties of nominals.",
        "Agreement properties indicate the semantic properties of nominals on top of other elements (verbs, adjectives, etc.",
        "), in order to indicate their relation to the nominals.",
        "We define annotation guidelines that reflect these different properties.",
        "Structural morphemes (case) connect words in the arc-structure, linking a head to its semantic dependent, like the case marker ?at?-ACC in Figure 2(b).",
        "Inherent / agreement properties are annotated as dependents of the content word they add properties to, for instance, the prefixes def in Figure 2(b) hang under the modified noun and adjective.",
        "Collapsed U-SD structures interpret func elements in order to refine the representation of relations between content words.",
        "Case markers can be used for refining the relation between the content words they connect by labeling their direct relation, much like prep in the original SD scheme (see, e.g., the ACC-obj in Figure 2c).",
        "Inherent/agreement features are in fact features of their respective head word (as the X.DEF nodes in Figure 2c).3 Auxiliaries may further be used to add tense/aspect to the main predicate, and subordina-tors may propagate information inside the structure (much like conjunction is propagated in SD).",
        "Universal Aspects of U-SD.",
        "The revised U-SD ontology provides a typological inventory of labels that describe different types of arguments (dep), argument-taking elements (hd), and argument-marking elements (func) in the grammar of different languages.",
        "Abstract (universal) concepts reside high in the hierarchy, and more specific distinctions, e.g., morphological markers of particular types, are daughters within more specific branches.",
        "Using U-SD for evaluating monolingual parsers is best done with the complete label set relevant for that language.",
        "For cross-language evaluation, we can limit the depth of the hierarchy, and convert the more specific notions to their most-specific ancestor in the evaluation set.",
