        "We describe a translation model adaptation approach for conversational spoken language translation (CSLT), which encourages the use of contextually appropriate translation options from relevant training conversations.",
        "Our approach employs a monolingual LDA topic model to derive a similarity measure between the test conversation and the set of training conversations, which is used to bias translation choices towards the current context.",
        "A significant novelty of our adaptation technique is its incremental nature; we continuously update the topic distribution on the evolving test conversation as new utterances become available.",
        "Thus, our approach is well-suited to the causal constraint of spoken conversations.",
        "On an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the proposed approach gives significant improvements over a baseline system as measured by BLEU, TER, and NIST.",
        "Interestingly, the incremental approach outperforms a non-incremental oracle that has upfront knowledge of the whole conversation."

        "The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government.",
        "Distribution Statement A (Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited) conversations typically revolve around a set of central topics, which may not be evident at the beginning of the interaction.",
        "As the conversation progresses, however, the gradual accumulation of contextual information can be used to infer the topic(s) of discussion, and to deploy contextually appropriate translation phrase pairs.",
        "For example, the word ?drugs?",
        "will predominantly translate into Spanish as ?medicamentos?",
        "(medicines) in a medical scenario, whereas the translation ?drogas?",
        "(illegal drugs) will predominate in a law enforcement scenario.",
        "Most CSLT systems do not take high-level global context into account, and instead translate each utterance in isolation.",
        "This often results in contextually inappropriate translations, and is particularly problematic in conversational speech, which usually exhibits short, spontaneous, and often ambiguous utterances.",
        "In this paper, we describe a novel topic-based adaptation technique for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) of spoken conversations.",
        "We begin by building a monolingual latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA) topic model on the training conversations (each conversation corresponds to a ?document?",
        "in the LDA paradigm).",
        "At run-time, this model is used to infer a topic distribution over the evolving test conversation up to and including the current utterance.",
        "Translation phrase pairs that originate in training conversations whose topic distribution is similar to that of the current conversation are given preference through a single similarity feature, which augments the standard phrase-based SMT log-linear model.",
        "The topic distribution for the test conversation is updated incrementally for each new utterance as the available history grows.",
        "With this approach, we demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline phrase-based SMT system as measured by BLEU, TER and NIST scores on an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task."

        "Domain adaptation to improve SMT performance has attracted considerable attention in recent years (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Finch and Sumita, 2008; Matsoukas et al., 2009).",
        "The general theme is to divide the training data into partitions representing different domains, and to prefer translation options for a test sentence from training domains that most resemble the current document context.",
        "Weaknesses of this approach include (a) assuming the existence of discrete, non-overlapping domains; and (b) the unreliability of models generated by segments with little training data.",

        "(Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "In contrast to our source language approach, these authors use both source and target information.",
        "Perhaps most relevant are the approaches of Gong et al. (2010) and Eidelman et al. (2012), who both describe adaptation techniques where monolingual LDA topic models are used to obtain a topic distribution over the training data, followed by dynamic adaptation of the phrase table based on the inferred topic of the test document.",
        "While our proposed approach also employs monolingual LDA topic models, it deviates from the above methods in the following important ways.",
        "First, the existing approaches are geared towards batch-mode text translation, and assume that the full document context of a test sentence is always available.",
        "This assumption is incompatible with translation of spoken conversations, which are inherently causal.",
        "Our proposed approach infers topic distributions incrementally as the conversation progresses.",
        "Thus, it is not only consistent with the causal requirement, but is also capable of tracking topical changes during the course of a conversation.",
        "Second, we do not directly augment the translation table with the inferred topic distribution.",
        "Rather, we compute a similarity between the current conversation history and each of the training conversations, and use this measure to dynamically score the relevance of candidate translation phrase pairs during decoding."
