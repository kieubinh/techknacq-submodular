        "Recently there are great efforts on building large structural knowledge bases (KB) such as Freebase, Yago, etc.",

        "(Bill Gates, BornIn, Seattle)?.",
        "An important task is to enrich such KBs by extracting more facts from text.",
        "Specifically, this paper focuses on extracting facts for existing relations.",
        "This is different from OpenIE (Banko et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010) which needs to discover new relations.",
        "Given large amounts of labeled sentences, supervised methods are able to achieve good performance (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).",
        "However, it is difficult to handle large scale corpus due to the high cost of labeling.",
        "Recently an approach called distant supervision (DS) (Mintz et al., 2009) was proposed, which does not require any labels on the text.",
        "It treats the extraction problem as classifying ?",
        "The contact author.",
        "a candidate entity pair to a relation.",
        "Then an existing fact in a KB can be used as a labeled example whose label is the relation name.",
        "Then the features of all the sentences (from a given text corpus) containing the entity pair are merged as the feature of the example.",
        "Finally a multi-class classifier is trained.",
        "However, the accuracy of DS is not satisfying.",
        "Some variants have been proposed to improve the performance (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Takamatsu et al., 2012).",
        "They argue that DS introduces a lot of noise into the training data by merging the features of all the sentences containing the same entity pair, because a sentence containing the entity pair of a relation may not talk about the relation.",
        "Riedel et al. (2010) and Hoffmann et al. (2011) introduce hidden variables to indicate whether a sentence is noise and try to infer them from the data.",
        "Takamatsu et al. (2012) design a generative model to identify noise patterns.",
        "However, as shown in the experiments (Section 4), the above variants do not lead to much improvement in accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we point out and analyze some critical factors in DS which have great impact on the accuracy but has not been touched or well handled before.",
        "First, each relation has its own schema definition, i.e., the source entity and the destination entity should be of valid types, which is overlooked in DS.",
        "Therefore, we propose a component of entity type detection to check it.",
        "Second, DS introduces many false negative examples into the training set and we propose a new method to construct negative training examples.",

        "We argue that the first type of noise is very difficult to be inferred just from the noisy relational labels.",
        "Instead, we decouple the two types of noise, and utilize external labeled data, i.e., the Wikipedia anchor links, to train an entity type detection module to handle the first type of noise.",
