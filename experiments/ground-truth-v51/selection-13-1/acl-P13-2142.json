        "Debate stance classification is potentially more interesting and challenging than polarity classification for at least two reasons.",
        "First, while in polarity classification sentiment-bearing words and phrases have proven to be useful (e.g., ?excellent?",
        "correlates strongly with the positive polarity), in debate stance classification it is not uncommon to find debate posts where stances are not expressed in terms of sentiment words, as exemplified in Figure 1, where the author is for abortion.",
        "Second, while customer reviews are typically written independently of other reviews in an online forum, the same is not true for debate posts.",
        "In The fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights.",
        "Also I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand ?",
        "namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.",

        "Previous approaches to debate stance classification have focused on three debate settings, namely congressional floor debates (Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Balahur et al., 2009; Yesse-nalina et al., 2010; Burfoot et al., 2011), company-internal discussions (Murakami and Raymond, 2010), and online social, political, and ideological debates in public forums (Agrawal et al., 2003; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Wang and Rose?, 2010; Biran and Rambow, 2011; Hasan and Ng, 2012).",
