        "As of January 2012, the number of Arabic-speaking internet users was 86 millions.",
        "The recent political and civic movements in the Arab World resulted in a revolutionary growth in the number of Arabic users on social networking sites.",
        "For example, Arabic is the fastest growing language in Twitter history 1.",
        "This growth in the presence of Arab users on social networks and all the interactions and discussions that happen among them led to a huge amount of opinion-rich Arabic text being available.",
        "Analyzing this text could reveal the different viewpoints of Arab users with respect to the topics that they discuss online.",
        "When a controversial topic is discussed, it is normal for the discussants to adopt different viewpoints towards it.",
        "This usually causes rifts in discussion groups and leads to the split of the discussants into subgroups with contrasting opinions.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to use natural language processing techniques to detect opinion subgroups in Arabic discussions.",
        "Our approach starts by identifying opinionated (subjective) text and determining its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).",
        "Next, we determine the target of each opinion expression.",
        "The target of opinion can be a named entity mentioned in the discussion or an aspect of the discussed topic.",
        "We use the identified opinion-target relations to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations.",
        "In the first representation, each discussant is represented by a vector that encodes all his or her opinion information towards the discussion topic.",
        "In the second representation, each discussant is represented by a node in a signed graph.",
        "A positive edge connects two discussants if they have similar opinion towards the topic, otherwise the sign of the edge is nega",
        "tive.",
        "To identify opinion subgroups, we cluster the vector space (the first representation) or partition the signed network (the second representation).",
        "We evaluate this system using a data set of Arabic discussions collected from an Arabic debating site.",
        "We experiment with several variations of the system.",
        "The results show that the clustering the vector space representation achieves better results than partitioning the signed network representation."

        "Pang & Lee (2008) and Liu & Zhang (2012) wrote two recent comprehensive surveys about sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques and applications.",
        "Previous work has proposed methods for identifying subjective text that expresses opinion and distinguishing it from objective text that presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzi-vassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al., 2008; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "Subjective text may express positive, negative, or neutral opinion.",
        "Previous work addressed the problem of identifying the polarity of subjective text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006).",
        "Many of the proposed methods for text polarity identification depend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e. lists of positive and negative words).",
        "Several approaches have been devised for building such lexicons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al., 2005; Hassan and Radev, 2010).",
        "Other research efforts focused on identifying the holders and the targets of opinion (Zhai et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007; Bethard et al., 2004).",
        "Opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques have been used in various applications.",
        "One example of such applications is identifying perspectives (Grefenstette et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2006) which is most similar to the topic of this paper.",

        "Anand et al. (2011) present a supervised method for stance classification.",
        "They use a number of linguistic and structural features such as unigrams, bigrams, cue words, repeated punctuation, and opinion dependencies to build a stance classification model.",
        "In previous work, we proposed a method that uses participant-to-participant and participant-to-topic attitudes to identify subgroups in ideological discussions using attitude vector space clustering (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we extend this method by adding latent similarity features to the attitude vectors and applying it to Arabic discussions.",
        "In another previous work, our group proposed a supervised method for extracting signed social networks from text (Hassan et al., 2012a).",
        "The signed networks constructed using this method were based only on participant-to-participant attitudes that are expressed explicitly in discussions.",
        "We used this method to extract signed networks from discussions and used a partitioning algorithm to detect opinion subgroups (Hassan et al., 2012b).",
