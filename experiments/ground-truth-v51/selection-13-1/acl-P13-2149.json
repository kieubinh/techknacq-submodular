        "Although much research has been done in the field of sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2012), thwarting and sarcasm are not addressed, to the best of our knowledge.",
        "Thwarting has been identified as a common phenomenon in sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002, Ohana et al., 2009, Brooke, 2009) in various forms of texts but no previous work has proposed a solution to the problem of identifying thwarting.",
        "We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews.",
        "The definition of an opinion as specified in Liu (2012) is ?An opinion is a quintuple, ( , , , , ), where is the name of an entity, is an aspect of , is the sentiment on aspect of entity , is the opinion holder, and is the time when the opinion is expressed by .?",
        "If the sentiment towards the entity or one of its important attribute contradicts the sentiment towards all other attributes, we can say that the document is thwarted.",
        "A domain ontology is an ontology of various features pertaining to a domain, arranged in a hierarchy.",
        "Subsumption in this hierarchy implies that the child is a part or feature of the parent.",
        "Domain ontology has been used by various works in NLP (Saggion et al., 2007 and Polpinij et al., 2008).",
        "In our work, we use domain ontology of camera.",
        "We look upon thwarting as the phenomenon of reversal of polarity from the lower level of the ontology to the higher level.",
        "At the higher level of ontology the entities mentioned are the whole product or a large critical part of the product.",
        "So while statements about entities at the lower level of the ontology are on ?details?, statements about entities at higher levels are on the ?big picture?.",
        "Polarity reversal from details to the big picture is at the heart of thwarting.",
        "The motivation for our study on thwarting comes from the fact that: a) Thwarting is a challenging NLP problem and b) Special ML machinery is needed in view of the fact that the training data is so skewed.",
        "Additionally large amount of world and domain knowledge maybe called for to solve the problem.",
        "In spite of the relatively fewer occurrence of the thwarting phenomenon the problem poses an intellectually stimulating exercise.",
        "We may also say that in the limit, thwarting approaches the very difficult problem of sarcasm detection (Tsur et al. 2010).",
        "We start by defining and understanding the problem of thwarting in section 2.",
        "In section 3, we describe a method to create the domain ontology.",
        "In section 4, we propose a naive rule based approach to detect thwarting.",
        "In section 5 we discuss a machine learning based approach which could be used to identify whether a document is thwarted or not.",
        "This is followed by experimental results in section 6.",

      "heading": "3 Definition",
      "text": [
        "Thwarting is defined by Pang et al., (2008) as follows: ?Thwarted expectations basically refer to the phenomenon wherein the author of the text first builds up certain expectations for the topic, only to produce a deliberate contrast to the earlier discussion.\" For our computational purposes, we define thwarting as: ?The phenomenon wherein the overall polarity of the document is in contrast with the polarity of majority of the document.?",
        "This definition emphasizes thwarting as piggybacking on sentiment analysis to improve the latter's performance.",
        "The current work however only addresses the problem of whether a document is thwarted or not and does not output the sentiment of the document.",
        "The basic block diagram for our system is shown in figure 1.",
        "An example of a thwarted document is: ?I love the sleek design.",
        "The lens is impressive.",
        "The pictures look good but, somehow this camera disappoints me.",
        "I do not recommend it.?",
        "While thwarting occurs in various forms of sentiment bearing texts, it is not a very frequent one.",
        "It accounts for hardly 1-2% of any given corpus.",
        "Thus, it becomes hard to find sufficient number of examples of thwarting to train a classifier.",
        "Since thwarting is a complex natural language phenomenon we require basic NLP tools and resources, whose accuracy in turn can affect the overall performance of a thwarting detection system.",
        "4 Building domain ontology Domain ontology comprises of features and entities from the domain and the relationships between them.",
        "The process thus has two steps, viz. (a) identify the features and entities, and (b) connect them in the form of a hierarchy.",
        "We decided to use a combination of review corpora mining and manual means for identifying key features.",
        "Our approach to building the domain ontology is as follows: Step 1: We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) on a corpus containing reviews of a particular product (camera, in our case) to identify key features from the domain.",
        "The output is then analyzed manually to finally select the key features.",
        "Some additional features get added by human annotator to increase the coverage of the ontology.",
        "For Example, in the camera domain, the corpus may include words",
        "like memory, card, gb, etc.",
        "but, may not contain the word storage.",
        "The abstract concept of storage is contributed by the human annotator through his/her world knowledge.",
        "Step 2: The features thus obtained are arranged in the form of a hierarchy by a human"

        "From the perspective of the domain ontology, the sentiment towards the overall product or towards some critical feature mentioned near the root of the ontology should be opposite to the sentiment towards features near the leaves.",
