        "A metaphor is a literary figure of speech that describes a subject by asserting that it is, on some point of comparison, the same as another otherwise unrelated object.",
        "Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance including allegory, hyperbole, and simile.",
        "Rhetorical theorists and other scholars of language have discussed numerous dimensions of metaphors, though these nomenclatures are by no means universal nor necessarily mutually exclusive.",
        "A very challenging task in linguistics is the metaphor identification and the its interpretation.",
        "Metaphor identification procedure (MIP) is a method for identifying metaphorically used words in discourse.",
        "It can be used to recognize metaphors in spoken and written language.",
        "The procedure aims to determine the relationship of a particular lexical unit in the discourse and recognize its use in a particular context as possibly metaphorical.",
        "Since many words can be considered metaphorical in different contexts, MIP requires a clear distinction between words that convey metaphorical meaning and those that do not, despite the fact that language generally differs in the degrees of metaphoricity.",
        "In this paper we propose a method for identifying metaphorical usage in verbs.",
        "Our method is looking for semantic analogies in the context of a verb by comparing it against prior known instances of literal and non-literal usage of the same verb in different contexts.",
        "After discussing the metaphor identication literature (Section 2), we proceed to present our research proposal (Section 3) and to present and discuss our first experiments based on WordNet similarity measures (Section 4).",
        "Experiment results help us to draw conclusions and insights about analogical reasoning and memory-based learning for this task and to outline promising research paths (Section 5)."

        "According to Lakoff and Johnson (1980), metaphor is a productive phenomenon that operates at the level of mental processes.",
        "Metaphor is thus not merely a property of language, but rather a property of thought.",
        "This view was subsequently acquired and extended by a multitude of approaches (Grady, 1997; Narayanan, 1997; Fauconnier and Tuner, 2002; Feldman, 2006; Pinker, 2007) and the term conceptual metaphor was adopted to describe it.",
        "In cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor, or cognitive metaphor, refers to the understanding of an idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another, for example, understanding quantity in terms of directionality as in, for example, ?prices are rising?.",
        "A conceptual metaphor uses an idea and links it to another in order to better understand something.",
        "It is generaly accepted that the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a conduit is a large theory explained with a metaphor.",
        "These metaphors are prevalent in communication and everyone actually perceives and acts in accordance with the metaphors."

        "Automatic processing of metaphor can be clearly divided into two subtasks: metaphor identifica",
        "tion (distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language in text) and metaphor interpretation (identifying the intended literal meaning of a metaphorical expression).",
        "Both of them have been repeatedly attempted in NLP.",
        "The most influential account of metaphor identification is that of Wilks (1978).",
        "According to Wilks, metaphors represent a violation of selectional restrictions in a given context.",
        "Consider an example such as My car drinks gasoline; the verb drink normally takes an animate subject and a liquid object.",
        "This approach was automated by Fass (1991) in his MET* system.",
        "However, Fass himself indicated a problem with the method: it detects any kind of non-literalness or anomaly in language (metaphors, metonymies and others), i.e., it overgenerates with respect to metaphor.",
        "The techniques MET* uses to differentiate between those are mainly based on hand-coded knowledge, which implies a number of limitations.",
        "First, literalness is distinguished from non-literalness using selectional preference violation as an indicator.",
        "In the case that non-literalness is detected, the respective phrase is tested for being a metonymic relation using hand-coded patterns.",
        "If the system fails to recognize metonymy, it proceeds to search the knowledge base for a relevant analogy in order to discriminate metaphorical relations from anomalous ones.",
        "Berber Sardinha (2002) describes a collocation-based method for spotting metaphors in corpora.",
        "His procedure is based on the notion that two words sharing collocations in a corpus may have been used metaphorically.",
        "The first step was to pick out a reasonable number of words that had an initial likelihood of being part of metaphorical expressions.",
        "First, words with marked frequency (in relation to a large general corpus of Portuguese) were selected.",
        "Then, their collocations were scored for closeness in meaning using a program called ?distance?",
        "(Padwardhan et al., 2003), under the assumption that words involved in metaphorical expressions tend to be denotationally unrelated.",
        "This program accesses WordNet in order to set the scores for each word pair.",
        "The scores had to be adapted in order for them to be useful for metaphor analysis.",
        "Finally, those words that had an acceptable semantic distance score were evaluated for their metaphoric potential.",
        "The results indicated that the procedure did pick up some major metaphors in the corpus, but it also captured metonyms.",
        "Another approach to finding metaphor in corpora is CorMet, presented by Mason (2004).",
        "It works by searching corpora of different domains for verbs that are used in similar patterns.",
        "When the system spots different verbs with similar selectional preferences (i.e., with similar words in subject, object and complement positions), it considers them potential metaphors.",
        "CorMet requires specific domain corpora and a list of verbs for each domain.",
        "The specific domain corpora are compiled by searching the web for domain-specific words.",
        "These words are selected by the author, based on his previous knowledge of subject areas and are stemmed.",
        "The most typical verbs for each specific corpus are identified through frequency markedness, by comparing the frequencies of word stems in the domain corpus with those of the BNC.",
        "The resulting words have a frequency that is statistically higher in the domain corpus than in the reference corpus.",
        "These stems are then classified according to part of speech by consulting WordNet.",
        "Alternative approaches search for metaphors of a specific domain defined a priori in a specific type of discourse.",
        "The method by Gedigian et al. (2006) discriminates between literal and metaphorical use.",
        "They trained a maximum entropy classifier for this purpose.",
        "They obtained their data by extracting the lexical items whose frames are related to MOTION and CURE from FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "Then, they searched the PropBank Wall Street Journal corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) for sentences containing such lexical items and annotated them with respect to metaphoricity.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) present a sentence clustering approach for non-literal language recognition implemented in the TroFi system (Trope Finder).",
        "This idea originates from a similarity-based word sense disambiguation method developed by Karov and Edelman (1998).",
        "The method employs a set of seed sentences, where the senses are annotated, computes similarity between the sentence containing the word to be disambiguated and all of the seed sentences and selects the sense corresponding to the annotation in the most similar seed sentences.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) adapt this algorithm to perform a two-way classification: literal vs. non-literal, and they do not clearly de",
        "fine the kinds of tropes they aim to discover.",
        "They attain a performance of 53.8% in terms of f-score.",
        "Both Birke and Sarkar (2006) and Gedigian et al. (2006) focus only on metaphors expressed by a verb.",
        "As opposed to that the approach of Kr-ishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) deals with verbs, nouns and adjectives as parts of speech.",
        "They use hyponymy relation in WordNet and word bi-gram counts to predict metaphors at the sentence level.",
        "Given an IS-A metaphor (e.g.",
        "The world is a stage) they verify if the two nouns involved are in hyponymy relation in WordNet, and if this is not the case then this sentence is tagged as containing a metaphor.",
        "Along with this they consider expressions containing a verb or an adjective used metaphorically.",
        "Hereby they calculate bigram probabilities of verb-noun and adjective-noun pairs (including the hyponyms/hypernyms of the noun in question).",
        "If the combination is not observed in the data with sufficient frequency, the system tags the sentence containing it as metaphorical.",
        "This idea is a modification of the selectional preference view of Wilks (1978).",
        "Berber Sardinha (2010) presents a computer program for identifying metaphor candidates, which is intended as a tool that can help researchers find words that are more likely to be metaphor vehicles in a corpus.",
        "As such, it may be used as a device for signalling those words that the researcher might want to focus on first, because these have a higher probability of being metaphors in their corpus, or conversely, it may indicate those words that are worth looking at because of their apparent low probability of being metaphors.",
        "The program is restricted to finding one component of linguistic metaphors and has been trained on business texts in Portuguese, and so it is restricted to that kind of text.",
        "Shutova et al. (2012) present an approach to automatic metaphor identification in unrestricted text.",
        "Starting from a small seed set of manually annotated metaphorical expressions, the system is capable of harvesting a large number of metaphors of similar syntactic structure from a corpus.",
        "Their method captures metaphoricity by means of verb and noun clustering.",
        "Their system starts from a seed set of metaphorical expressions exemplifying a range of source-target domain mappings; performs unsupervised noun clustering in order to harvest various target concepts associated with the same source domain; by means of unsupervised verb clustering creates a source domain verb lexicon; searches the BNC for metaphorical expressions describing the target domain concepts using the verbs from the source domain lexicon.",
        "According to Shutova et al. (2012), abstract concepts that are associated with the same source domain are often related to each other on an intuitive and rather structural level, but their meanings, however, are not necessarily synonymous or even semantically close.",
        "The consensus is that the lexical items exposing similar behavior in a large body of text most likely have the same meaning.",
        "They tested their system starting with a collection of metaphorical expressions representing verb-subject and verb-object constructions, where the verb is used metaphorically.",
        "They evaluated the precision of metaphor identification with the help of human judges.",
        "Shutova's system employing unsupervised methods for metaphor identification operates with precision of 0.79.",
        "For verb and noun clustering, they used the sub-categorization frame acquisition system by Preiss et al. (2007) and spectral clustering for both verbs and nouns.",
        "They acquired selectional preference distributions for Verb-Subject and Verb-Object relations from the BNC parsed by RASP; adopted Resnik's selectional preference measure; and applied to a number of tasks in NLP including word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1997)."
