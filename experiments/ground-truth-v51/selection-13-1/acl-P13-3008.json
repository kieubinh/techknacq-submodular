        "Other studies have tried to offer better coverage by automatically deriving paraphrases from parallel corpora (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011), but similar to Chang et al.

        "Another problem is that most research does not actually take the learners' tendency of collocation errors into account; instead, their systems are trained only on well-formed text corpora.",
        "Our work follows the general approach, that is, uses similarity measures for generating the confusion set and association measures for ranking the best candidates.",
