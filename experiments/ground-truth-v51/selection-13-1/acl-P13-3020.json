        "A good accuracy of GBSSL depends on success in dealing with three crucial issues: graph construction, selection of high-quality training data, and categorization algorithm.",
        "We particularly focus on the former two issues in our study.",
        "In a graph-based categorization of documents, a graph is constructed based on a certain relation between nodes (i.e. documents).",
        "It is similarity that is often used to express the relation between nodes in a graph.",
        "We think of two types of similarity: the one is between surface information obtained by document vector (Salton and McGill, 1983) and the other is between latent information obtained by word probabilistic distribution (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003)).",

        "The more the training data are, the better the accuracy becomes.",
        "We do not always, however, have a large quantity of training data.",
        "In such a case, the quality of training data is generally a key for better accuracy.",
        "It is required to assess the quality of training data exactly.",
        "Now, we propose another method.",
        "We use the PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) to select high-quality data, which have a high centrality in a similarity graph of training data (i.e. labeled data) in each category.",
        "We apply our methods to solving the problem of a multi-class document categorization.",
