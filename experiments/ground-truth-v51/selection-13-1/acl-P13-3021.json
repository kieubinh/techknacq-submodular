        "As a field of research in NLP, text simplification (TS) has gained increasing attention recently, primarily for English text, but also for Brazilian Portuguese (Specia, 2010; Alu?sio et al., 2008), Dutch (Daelemans et al., 2004), Spanish (Drndarevic and Saggion, 2012), Danish (Klerke and S?gaard, 2012), French (Seretan, 2012) and Swedish (Ry-bing and Smith, 2009; Decker, 2003).",
        "Our experiments use Danish text which is similar to English in that it has a deep orthography making it hard to map between letters and sounds.",
        "Danish has a relatively free word order and sparse morfology.",
        "TS can help readers with below average reading skills access information and may supply relevant training material, which is crucial for developing reading skills.",
        "However, manual TS is as expensive as translation, which is a key limiting factor on the availability of easy-to-read material.",
        "One of the persistent chalenges of TS is that different interventions are called for depending on the target reader population.",
        "Automatic TS is an effective way to counter these limitations."

        "Definitions of TS typically reflect varying target reader populations and the methods studied.",
        "For our purposes we define TS to include any operation on the linguistic structure and content of a text, intended to produce new text, which",
        "1. has semantic content similar to (a part of) the original text 2. requires less cognitive effort to decode and understand by a target reader, compared to",
        "the original text.",
        "Operations on linguistic content may include deletion, reordering and insertion of content, paraphrasing concepts, resolving references, etc., while typography and layout are excluded as non-linguistic properties.",
        "We cast the problem of generating a more readable sentence from an input as a problem of choosing a reasonable sub-sentence from the words present in the original.",
        "The corpus-example below illustrates how a simplified sentence can be embedded as scattered parts of a non-simplified sentence.",
        "The words in bold are the common parts which make up almost the entire human generated simplification and constitutes a suitable simplification on its own.",
        "Original : Der er m?lt hvad der bliver betegnet som abnormt store m?ngder af radioaktivt materiale i havvand n?r det jordsk?lvsramte atomkraftv?rk i Japan .",

        "A large amount of radioactivity has been measured in the sea near the nuclear power plant Fukushima in Japan To generate candidate sub-sentences we use a random deletion procedure in combination with",
        "general dependency-based heuristics for conserving main sentence constituents, and then introduce a loss-function for choosing between candidates.",
        "Since we avoid relying on a specialized parallel corpus or a simplification grammar, which can be expensive to create, the method is especially relevant for under-resourced languages and organizations.",
        "Although we limit rewriting to deletions, the space of possible candidates grows exponentially with the length of the input sentence, prohibiting exhaustive candidate generation, which is why we chose to sample the deletions randomly.",
        "However, to increase the chance of sampling good candidates, we restrict the search space under the assumption that some general patterns apply, namely, that the main verb and subject should always be kept, negations should be kept and that if something is kept that originally had objects, those objects should also be kept.",
        "Another way in which we restrict the candidate space is by splitting long sentences.",
        "Some clauses are simple to identify and extract, like relative clauses, and doing so can dramatically reduce sentence length.",
        "Both simple deletions and extraction of clauses can be observed in professionally simplified text.",

        "Approaches for automatic TS traditionally focus on lexical substitution (De Belder and Moens, 2012; Specia et al., 2012; Yatskar et al., 2010), on identifying rewrite rules at sentence level either manually (Chandrasekar et al., 1996; Carroll et al., 1999; Canning et al., 2000; Siddharthan, 2010; Siddharthan, 2011; Seretan, 2012) or automatically from parallel corpora (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Zhu et al., 2010) and possibly learning cues for when to apply such changes (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007; Medero, 2011; Bott et al., 2012).",
        "Chandrasekar et al. (1996) propose a structural approach, which uses syntactic cues to recover relative clauses and appositives.",
        "Sentence level syntactic rewriting has since seen a variety of manually constructed general sentence splitting rules, designed to operate both on dependencies and phrase structure trees, and typically including lexical cues (Siddharthan, 2011; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Canning et al., 2000).",
        "Similar rules have been created from direct inspection of simplification corpora (Decker, 2003; Seretan, 2012) and discovered automatically from large scale aligned corpora (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Zhu et al., 2010).",
        "In our experiment we apply few basic sentence splitting rules as a preprocessing technique before using an over-generating random deletion approach.",

        "Their system further include compound sentence splitting and rewriting of passive sentences to active ones (Canning et al., 2000).",
        "Research into lexical simplification remains an active topic.",

        "Annotator agreement and comparisons so far shows that it is easy to over-fit to reflect individual annotator and domain differences that are not of relevance to generalized systems.",
        "In a minimally supervised setup, our TS approach can be modified to include lexical simplifications as part of the random generation process.",
        "This would require a broad coverage list of words and simpler synonyms, which could for instance be extracted from a parallel corpus like the DSim corpus.",
        "For the majority of research in automatic TS the question of what constitutes cognitive load is not discussed.",
        "An exception is Siddharthan and Katsos (2012), who seek to isolate the psycho-linguistically motivated notions of sentence comprehension from sentence acceptability by actually measuring the effect of TS on cognition on a small scale.",

        "More recent methods promise to be applicable to unassessed text.",
        "Language modeling in particular has shown to be a robust and informative component of systems for assessing text readability (Schwarm and Osten-dorf, 2005; Vajjala and Meurers, 2012) as it is better suited to evaluate grammaticality than standard metrics.",
