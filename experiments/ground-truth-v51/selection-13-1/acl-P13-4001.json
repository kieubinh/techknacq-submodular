        "The creation of training data precedes any statistical approach to natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Linguistic annotation is a process whereby linguistic information is added to a document, such as part-of-speech, lemmata, named entities, or dependency relations.",
        "In the past, platforms for linguistic annotations were mostly developed ad-hoc for the given annotation task at hand, used proprietary formats for data exchange, or required local installation effort.",
        "We present WebAnno, a browser-based tool that is immediately usable by any annotator with internet access.",
        "It supports annotation on a variety of linguistic levels (called annotation layers in the remainder), is interoperable with a variety of data formats, supports annotation project management such as user management, offers an adjudication interface, and provides quality management using inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Furthermore, an interface to crowdsourcing platforms enables scaling out simple annotation tasks to a large numbers of micro-workers.",
        "The added value of WebAnno, as compared to previous annotation tools, is on the one hand its web-based interface targeted at skilled as well as unskilled annotators, which unlocks a potentially very large workforce.",
        "On the other hand, it is the support for quality control, annotator management, and adjudication/curation, which lowers the entrance barrier for new annotation projects.",
        "We created WebAnno to fulfill the following requirements:",
        "?",
        "Web-based: Distributed work, no installation effort, increased availability.",

        "Flexibility: Support of multiple annotation layers, pluggable import and export formats, and extensibility to other front ends.",

        "An interface to crowdsourcing platforms is missing.",

        "It sets a focus on the integration of automatic annotation components rather than on the interface for manual annotation.",

        "General-purpose annotation tools like MMAX2 (Mu?ller and Strube, 2006) or WordFreak (Morton and LaCivita, 2003) are not web-based and do not provide annotation project management.",
        "They are also not sufficiently flexible regarding different annotation layers.",
        "The same holds for specialized tools for single annotation layers, which we cannot list here for the sake of brevity.",
        "With the brat rapid annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012), for the first time a web-based open-source annotation tool was introduced, which supports collaborative annotation for multiple annotation layers simultaneously on a single copy of the document, and is based on a client-server architecture.",
        "However, the current version of brat has limitations such as: (i) slowness for documents of more than 100 sentences, (ii) limits regarding file formats, (iii) web-based configuration of tagsets/tags is not possible and (iv) configuring the display of multiple layers is not yet supported.",
        "While we use brat's excellent visualization front end in WebAnno, we decided to replace the server layer to support the user and quality management, and monitoring tools as well as to add the interface to crowdsourcing."
