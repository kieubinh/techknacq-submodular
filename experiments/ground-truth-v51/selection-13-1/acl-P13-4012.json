        "With numerous advances in information construction, people increasingly aim to communicate with computers using natural language.",
        "For example, chatterbots in some e-commerce Web sites can interact with customers and provide help similar to a real-life secretary (DeeAnna Merz Nagel, 2011; Yvette Col?n, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we propose PAL (Psychologist of Artificial Language), a chatterbot system for answering non-obstructive psychological questions.",
        "Non-obstructive questions refer to problems on family, human relationships, marriage, life pressure, learning, work and so on.",
        "In these cases, we expect the chatterbot to play an active role by providing tutoring, solution, support, advice, or even sympathy depending on the help needed by its users.",
        "The difference of PAL from existing chatterbots lies not only in the specific research focus of this paper but also in the strategies we designed, such as P-XML templates for storing a knowledge base, comprehensive question matching method by considering both index and semantic similarities, and solution management by considering personal information.",
