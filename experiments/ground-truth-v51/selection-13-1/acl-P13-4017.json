        "Semantic Inference is the process by which machines perform reasoning over natural language texts.",
        "A semantic inference system is expected to be able to infer the meaning of one text from the meaning of another, identify parts of texts which convey a target meaning, and manipulate text units in order to deduce new meanings.",
        "Semantic inference is needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",
        "For instance, a Question Answering (QA) system may encounter the following question and candidate answer (Example 1): Q: which explorer discovered the New World?",
        "A: Christopher Columbus revealed America.",
        "As there are no overlapping words between the two sentences, to identify that A holds an answer for Q, background world knowledge is needed to link Christopher Columbus with explorer and America with New World.",
        "Linguistic knowledge is also needed to identify that reveal and discover refer to the same concept.",
        "Knowledge is needed in order to bridge the gap between text fragments, which may be dissimilar on their surface form but share a common meaning.",
        "For the purpose of semantic inference, such knowledge can be derived from various resources (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and others, detailed in Section 2.1) in a form which we denote as inference links (often called inference/entailment rules), each is an ordered pair of elements in which the first implies the meaning of the second.",
        "For instance, the link ship?vessel can be derived from the hypernym relation of WordNet.",
        "Other applications can benefit from utilizing inference links to identify similarity between language expressions.",
        "In Information Retrieval, the user's information need may be expressed in relevant documents differently than it is expressed in the query.",
        "Summarization systems should identify text snippets which convey the same meaning.",
        "Our work addresses a generic, application independent, setting of lexical inference.",
        "We therefore adopt the terminology of Textual Entailment (Dagan et al., 2006), a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference which captures inference needs of many NLP applications in a common underlying task: given two textual fragments, termed hypothesis (H) and text (T ), the task is to recognize whether T implies the meaning of H , denoted T?H.",
        "For instance, in a QA application, H represents the question, and T a candidate answer.",
        "In this setting, T is likely to hold an answer for the question if it entails the question.",
        "It is challenging to properly extract the needed inference knowledge from available resources, and to effectively utilize it within the inference process.",
        "The integration of resources, each has its own format, is technically complex and the quality",
        "by the Lexical Integrator which uses a set of lexical resources to extract inference chains which connect the two.",
        "The Lexical Inference component provides probability estimations for the validity of each level of the process.",
        "of the resulting inference links is often unknown in advance and varies considerably.",
        "For coping with this challenge we developed PLIS, a Probabilistic Lexical Inference System1.",
        "PLIS, illustrated in Fig 1, has two main modules: the Lexical Integrator (Section 2) accepts a set of lexical resources and a text-hypothesis pair, and finds all the lexical inference relations between any pair of text term ti and hypothesis term hj , based on the available lexical relations found in the resources (and their combination).",
        "The Lexical Inference module (Section 3) provides validity scores for these relations.",
        "These term-level scores are used to estimate the sentence-level likelihood that the meaning of the hypothesis can be inferred from the text, thus making PLIS a complete lexical inference system.",
        "Lexical inference systems do not look into the structure of texts but rather consider them as bag of terms (words or multi-word expressions).",
        "These systems are easy to implement, fast to run, practical across different genres and languages, while maintaining a competitive level of performance.",
        "PLIS can be used as a standalone efficient inference system or as the lexical component of any NLP application.",
        "PLIS is a flexible system, allowing users to choose the set of knowledge resources as well as the model by which inference",
        "cs.biu.ac.il/nlp-net/PLIS.html.",
        "is done.",
        "PLIS can be easily extended with new knowledge resources and new inference models.",
        "It comes with a set of ready-to-use plug-ins for many common lexical resources (Section 2.1) as well as two implementation of the scoring framework.",
        "These implementations, described in (Shnarch et al., 2011; Shnarch et al., 2012), provide probability estimations for inference.",
        "PLIS has an interactive online viewer (Section 4) which provides a visualization of the entire inference process, and is very helpful for analysing lexical inference models and lexical resources usability."

        "Adding a new lexical resource and integrating it with the others only demands the implementation of the plug-in interface.",

        "We provide PLIS with two implemented baseline lexical inference models which are mathematically based.",
        "These are two Probabilistic Lexical Models (PLMs), HN-PLM and M-PLM which are described in (Shnarch et al., 2011; Shnarch et al., 2012) respectively.",

        "hj), the probability of each hypothesis term to be inferred by the entire text P (T ?",
        "hj) (term-level probability), and the probability of the entire hypothesis to be inferred by the text P (T ?",

        "Its performance on the recognizing textual entailment task, RTE (Bentivogli et al., 2009; Bentivogli et al., 2010), are in line with the state of the art inference systems, including complex systems which perform syntactic analysis.",

        "This mode of operation is publicly available and provides a method for utilizing PLIS, without having to install it or the lexical resources it uses.",
