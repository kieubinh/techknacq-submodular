        "The query might contain keywords, wildcards, wild parts of speech (PoS), synonyms, and additional regular expression (RE) operators.",
        "In our approach, we incorporate inverted file in-dexing, PoS information from BNC, and semantic indexing based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Google Web 1T.",
        "The method involves parsing the query to transforming it into several keyword retrieval commands.",
        "Word chunks are retrieved with counts, further filtering the chunks with the query as a RE, and finally displaying the results according to the counts, similarities, and topics.",
        "Clusters of synonyms or conceptually related words are also provided.",
        "In addition, Linggle provides example sentences from The New York Times on demand.",
        "The current implementation of Linggle is the most functionally comprehen-sive, and is in principle language and dataset independent.",
        "We plan to extend Linggle to provide fast and convenient access to a wealth of linguistic information embodied in Web scale datasets including Google Web 1T and Google Books Ngram for many major languages in the world.",
        "1 Introduction As a non-native speaker writing in English, one encounters many problems.",
        "Doubts concerning the usage of a preposition, the mandatory presence of a determiner, the correctness of the association of a verb with an object, or the need for synonyms of a term in a given context are issues that arise frequently.",
        "Printed collocation dictionaries and reference tools based on compiled corpora offer limited coverage of word usage while knowledge of collocations is vital to acquire a good level of linguistic competency.",
        "We propose to address these limitations with a comprehensive system aimed at helping the learners ?know a word by the company it keeps?",
        "(Firth, 1957).",
        "Linggle (linggle.com).",
        "The system based on Web-scaled datasets is designed to be a broad coverage language reference tool for English Second Language learners (ESL).",
        "It is conceived to search information related to word usage in context under various conditions.",
        "First, we build an inverted file index for the Google Web 1T n-grams to support queries with RE-like patterns including PoS and synonym matches.",
        "For example, for the query ?$V $D +important role?, Linggle retrieves 4-grams that start with a verb and a determiner followed by a synonym of important and the keyword role (e.g., play a significant role 202,800).",
        "A natural language interface is also available for users who are less familiar with pattern-based searches.",
        "For example, the question ?How can I describe a beach??",
        "would retrieve two word chunks such as ?sandy beach 413,300?",
        "and ?rocky beach 16,800?.",
        "The n-gram search implementation is achieved through filtering, re-indexing, populating an HBase database with the Web 1T n-grams and augmenting them with the most frequent PoS for words (without disambiguation) derived from the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "The n-grams returned for a query can then be linked to examples extracted from the New York Times Corpus (Sandhaus, 2008) in order to provide full sentential context for more effective learning.",
        "In some situations, the user might need to search for words in a specific syntactic relation (e.g., Verb-Object collocation).",
        "The query absorb $N in n-grams display mode returns all the nouns that follow the verb ordered by decreasing n-gram counts.",

        "The idea is to consider the verbs in a corpus as the documents of a traditional LDA model.",
        "The arguments of the verb that are encountered in the corpus are treated as the words composing a document in the traditional model.",
        "The model seems to successfully infer the semantic classes that correspond to the preferred arguments of a verb.",
        "The topics are semi-automatically labeled with WordNet classes to produce a repository of human interpretable class-based selectional pref-erence.",
        "This choice might be due to the fact that if most LDA topic heads are usually reasonable upon human inspection, some topics are also incoherent (Newman 2010) and lower frequency words are not handled as successfully.",
        "We control the coherence of the topics and rearrange them into human interpretable clusters using a distributional similarity measure.",
        "Microsoft Sempute Project (Sempute Team 2013) also explores core technologies and applications of semantic computing.",
        "As part of Sempute project, NeedleSeek is aimed at automatically extracting data to support general semantic Web searches.",
        "While Linggle focuses on n-gram information for language learning, NeedleSeek also uses LDA to support question answering (e.g., What were the Capitals of ancient China?)",
        ".",
        "In contrast to the previous research in Web scale linguistic search engines, we present a system that supports queries with keywords, wild-card words, POS, synonyms, and additional regular expression (RE) operators and displays the results according the count, similarity, and topic with clusters of synonyms or conceptually related words.",
        "We exploit and combine the power of both LDA analysis and distributional similarity to provide meaningful semantic classes that are constrained with members of high simi-larity.",
        "Distributional similarity (Lin 1998) and LDA topics become two angles of attack to view language usage and corpus patterns.",
        "3 Linggle Functionalities The syntax of Linggle queries involves basic regular expression of keywords enriched with wildcard PoS and synonyms.",
        "Linggle queries can be either pattern-based commands or natural language questions.",

      "heading": "3.1 Natural language queries The handling of queries formulated in natural language has been implemented with handcrafted patterns refined from a corpus of questions found on various websites. Additionally, we asked both native and non-native speakers to use the system for text edition and to write down all the questions that arise during the exercise. Linggle transforms a question into commands for further processing based on a set of canned texts (e.g., ?How to describe a beach?? will be converted to ?$A beach?). We are in the process of gathering more examples of language-related question and answer pairs from Answers.com to improve the precision, versatility, and coverage. 3.2 Syntax of queries The syntax of the patterns for n-grams is shown in Table 1. The syntax supports two types of query functions: basic keyword search with regular expression capability and semantic search. Basic search operators enable the users to query zero, one or more arbitrary words up to five words. For example, the query ?set off ? $N? is intended to search for all nouns in the right context of set off, within a maximum distance of three words. In addition, the ??? operator in front of a word represents a search for n-grams with or without the word. For example, a user wanting to determine whether to use the word to between listen and music can formulate the query ?listen ?to music.? Yet another operation ?|? is provided to search for information related to word choice. For example the query ?build |construct ... dream? can be used to reveal that people build a dream much more often than they construct a dream. A set of PoS symbols (shown in Table 2) is defined to support queries that need more precision than the symbol *. More work might be needed to resolve PoS ambiguity for n-grams. Currently, any word that has been labeled with the requested PoS in the BNC more than 5% of the time is displayed. The ?+? operator is provided to support semantic queries. Placed in front of a word, it is intended to search for synonyms in the context. For example the query ?+sandy beach? would generate rocky beach, stony beach, barren beach in the top three results. The query ?+abandoned beach? generates deserted, destroyed and empty beach at the top of the list. To support conceptual clustering of collocational n-grams, we need to",

        "We use Pantel's dependencies repository to compute LDA models for subject-verbs, verbs-objects and adjective-nouns relations in both di-rections.",
        "Currently, we also use Pantel's similarity measure.",
        "It has a reasonable precision partly because it relies on parser information instead of bag of words windows.",
        "However the coverage of the available scores is lower than what would be needed for Linggle.",
        "We will address this issue in the near future by extending it with similarity scores computed from the n-grams.",
        "We combine the two distributional semantics approaches in a simple manner inspired by clustering by committee algorithm (CBC).",
        "The similarity measure is used to refine the LDA topics and to generate finer grain clusters.",
        "Conversely, LDA topics can also be seen as the seeds of our clustering algorithm.",
        "This algorithm intends to constrain the words that belong to a final cluster more strictly than LDA does in order to obtain clearly interpretable clusters.",
        "The exact same algorithm is applied to synonym models, for synonyms of nouns, adjectives and verbs (shown in Table 3).",
        "Table 4 shows the algorithm for constructing double layer clusters for a set S of objects of a verb v. The objects are first roughly split into classes, attributing a single topic to every object oi.",
        "The topic of a word oi is determined according to its per topic-word probability.",
        "More experiments could be done using the product of the per document-topic and the per topic-word LDA probabilities instead, in order to take into account the specific verb when assigning a topic to the object.",
        "Such a way of assigning topics should also be more sensitive to the LDA hyperparame-ters.",
        "At this stage, some classes are incoherent and that low frequency words that do not appear in the head of any topic are often misclassified.",
        "Words are rearranged between the classes and create new classes if necessary using the similarity measure.",
        "If any word of a class is not simi",
        "lar to any other word in this class (the threshold is set to s1 = 0.09), a new class is created for it.",
        "Any two classes are then merged if their similarity (computer accordingly to Table 5) is above s2=0.06, forming the level 2 clusters.",
        "Classes are then grouped together if the similarity between them is above s3 = 0.02 forming the level 1 clus-ters.",
        "Finally, the classes that contain less than three words are not displayed in Linggle and the predi-cate-arguments counts in the Web 1T are retrieved using a few hand crafted RE and morphological expansion of the nouns and the verbs.",
        "This algorithm appears to generate interpretable semantic classes and to be quite robust regarding the threshold parameters.",
        "More tests and rigorous evaluation are left to future work.",
        "6 Conclusion There are many different directions in which Linggle will be improved.",
        "The first one is to allow users to work with word forms and with multiword expressions.",
        "The second one concerns the extension of the coverage of the example base with several large corpora such as Wikipe-dia and the extension of the coverage of the similarity measure.",
        "The third direction concerns the development of automatic suggestions for text edition, such as suggesting a better adjective or a different preposition in the context of a sentence.",
        "Finally, Linggle is currently being extended to Chinese.",
        "We presented a prototype that gives access to Web Scale collocations.",
        "Linggle displays both word usage and word similarity information.",
        "Depending on the type of the input query, the results are displayed under the form of lists or clusters of n-grams.",
        "The system is designed to become a multilingual platform for text edition and can also become a valuable resource for natural language processing research.",
