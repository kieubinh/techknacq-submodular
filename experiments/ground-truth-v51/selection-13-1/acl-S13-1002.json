        "This suggests that distributional models and logic-based representations of natural language meaning are complementary in their strengths (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Garrette et al., 2011), which encourages developing new techniques to combine them.",

        "Distributional similarity between pairs of words is converted into weighted inference rules that are added to the logical form, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Finally, Markov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) (MLNs) are used to perform weighted inference on the resulting knowledge base.",

        "At the sentence level, however, we hold that a stricter, logic-based view of entailment is beneficial, and we even model sentence similarity (in STS) as entailment.",
        "There are two main innovations in the formalism that make it possible for us to work with naturally occurring corpus data.",
        "First, we use more expressive distributional inference rules based on the similarity of phrases rather than just individual words.",
        "In comparison to existing methods for creating textual inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001b; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), these rules are computed on the fly as needed, rather than pre-compiled.",
        "Second, we use more flexible probabilistic combinations of evidence in order to compute degrees of sentence similarity for STS and to help compensate for parser errors.",
        "We replace deterministic conjunction by an average combiner, which encodes causal independence (Natarajan et al., 2010).",
        "We show that our framework is able to handle both sentence similarity (STS) and textual entailment (RTE) by making some simple adaptations to the MLN when switching between tasks.",
        "The framework achieves reasonable results on both tasks.",
        "On STS, we obtain a correlation of r = 0.66 with full logic, r = 0.73 in a system with weakened variable binding, and r = 0.85 in an ensemble model.",

        "As an alternative to re-ranking, one could obtain logical forms for each of the top-n parses, and create an MLN that integrates all of them (together with their certainty) as an underspecified meaning representation that could then be used to directly support inferences such as STS and RTE.",
        "We also plan to exploit a greater variety of distributional inference rules.",
