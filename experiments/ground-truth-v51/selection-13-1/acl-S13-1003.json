        "In particular, the user contributed link structure of Wikipedia has been shown to provide useful supervision for training named entity disambiguation (Bunescu and Pa≈üca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007) and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2007; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) systems.",
        "Articles in Wikipedia often contain mentions of concepts or entities that already have a corresponding article.",

        "Based on these Wiki processing rules, the text that is rendered for the aforementioned example is: The capital of Georgia is Atlanta.",
        "Since many words and names mentioned in Wikipedia articles are inherently ambiguous, their corresponding links can be seen as a useful source of supervision for training named entity and word sense disambiguation systems.",
        "For example, Wikipedia contains articles that describe possible senses of the word ?capital?, such as CAPITAL CITY, CAPITAL (ECONOMICS), FINANCIAL CAPITAL, or HUMAN CAPITAL, to name only a few.",
        "When disambiguating a word or a phrase in Wikipedia, a contributor uses the context to determine the appropriate Wikipedia title to include in the link.",
        "In the example above, the editor of the article determined that the word ?capital?",
        "was mentioned with the political center meaning, consequently it was mapped to the article CAPITAL CITY through a piped link.",

        "To check whether this is the case, we have also run experiments where we used only half of the available positive examples for the word president and one tenth of the positive examples for the word dollar, such that the positive datasets became comparable in size with the unlabeled datasets.",
        "The results for these experiments are shown in Tables 4 and 5 in the rows labeled presidentS and dollarS .",
        "As expected, the difference between the performance of Naive SVM and Biased SVM gets larger on these smaller datasets, especially for the word dollar.",
        "The Weighted SVM outperforms the Naive SVM on five out of the six words, the exception being the word president.",
        "Comparatively, the Biased SVM has a more stable behavior and overall results in a more substantial improvement over the Naive SVM.",
        "Based on these initial results, we see the Biased SVM as the method of choice for learning with positive and unlabeled examples in the task of coarse to fine grained sense disambiguation in Wikipedia.",
        "In a final set of experiments, we compared the traditional flat classification approach and our proposed hierarchical classifier in terms of their overall disambiguation accuracy.",
        "In these experiments, the sense repository contains all the leaf nodes as distinct sense categories.",
        "For example, the word atmosphere would correspond to the sense repository R = {ATMOSPHERE (G), ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH, ATMOSPHERE OF MARS, ATMOSPHERE OF VENUS, STELLAR ATMOSPHERE, ATMOSPHERE (UNIT), ATMOSPHERE (MUSIC GROUP)}.",
        "The overall accuracy results are shown in Table 6 and confirm the utility of using the LPU framework in the hierarchical model, which outperforms the traditional flat model, especially on words with low ratio of positive to unlabeled examples.",

        "Furthermore, we showed that the true accuracy of a decision function can be optimized using only positive and unlabeled examples.",
        "For testing purposes, we manually annotated 7,079 links belonging to six ambiguous words 3.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate that accounting for annotation ambiguity in Wikipedia links leads to consistent improvements in disambiguation accuracy.",
        "The manual annotations were only used for testing and were ignored during training and development.",
        "Consequently, the proposed framework of learning with positive and unlabeled examples for sense disambiguation could be applied on the entire Wikipedia without any manual annotations.",
        "By augmenting general sense links with links to more specific articles, such an application could have a significant impact on Wikipedia itself."
