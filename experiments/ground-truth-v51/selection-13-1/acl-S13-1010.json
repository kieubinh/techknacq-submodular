        "Some nouns are homographs (they have the same written form, but different meaning) which can be used to denote either a common or proper noun, for example the word apple in the following examples: (1) Apple designs and creates iPod (2) The Apple II series is a set of 8-bit home computers (3) The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree (4) For apple enthusiasts ?",
        "tasting notes and apple identification.",
        "The common and proper uses are not always as clearly distinct as in this example; for example, a specific instance of a common noun, e.g., District Court turns court into a proper noun.",
        "While heuristically, proper nouns often start with a capital letter in English, capitalization can be inconsistent, incorrect or omitted, and the presence or absence of an article cannot be relied on.",
        "The problem of distinguishing between common and proper usages of nouns has not received much attention within language processing, despite being an important component for many tasks including machine translation (Lopez, 2008; Hermjakob et al., 2008), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Wilson et al., 2009) and topic tracking (Petrovic?",
        "et al, 2010).",
        "Approaches to the problem also have applications to tasks such as web search (Chen et al., 1998; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 2011), and case restoration (e.g., in automatic speech recognition output) (Baldwin et al., 2009), but frequently involve the manual creation of a gazeteer (a list of proper nouns), which suffer not only from omissions but also often do not allow the listed words to assume their common role in text.",
        "This paper presents methods for generating lists of nouns that have both common and proper usages (Section 2) and methods for identifying the type of usage (Section 3) which are evaluated using data derived automatically from the BNC (Section 4) and on two applications (Section 5).",
        "It shows that it is difficult to automatically construct lists of ambiguous nouns but also that they can be distinguished effectively using standard features from Word Sense Disambiguation."

        "To our knowledge, no comprehensive list of common nouns with proper noun usage is available.",

        "Ambiguous nouns are identified by tagging a corpus and extracting those that have had both tags assigned, together with the frequency of occurrence of the common/proper usage.",
        "The CLAWS (Garside, 1987) and the RASP taggers",
        "(Briscoe et al., 2006) were applied to the British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992) to generate the lists BNCclaws and BNCrasp respectively.",
        "In addition the RASP tagger was also run over the 1.75 billion word Gigaword corpus (Graff, 2003) to extract the list Gigaword.",
        "Capitalization Nouns appearing intra-sententially with both lower and upper case first letters are assumed to be ambiguous.",

        "Named entity recognition The Stanford Named Entity Recogniser (Finkel et al., 2005) was run over the BNC and any nouns that occur in the corpus with both named entity and non-named entity tags are extracted to form the list Stanford.",
        "WordNet The final heuristic makes use of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) which lists nouns that are often used as proper nouns with capitalisation.",
        "Nouns which appeared in both a capitalized and lowercased form were extracted to create the list WordNet.",
        "Table 1 shows the number of nouns identified by each technique in the column labeled words which demonstrates that the number of nouns identified varies significantly depending upon which heuristic is used.",
        "A pairwise score is also shown to indicate the consistency between each list and two example lists, BNCclaws and Gigaword.",
        "It can be seen that the level of overlap is quite low and the various heuristics generate quite different lists of nouns.",
        "In particular the recall is low, in almost all cases less than a third of nouns in one list appear in the other.",
        "One possible reason for the low overlap between the noun lists is mistakes by the heuristics used to extract them.",
        "For example, if a PoS tagger mistakenly tags just one instance of a common noun as proper then that noun will be added to the list extracted by the part of speech heuristic.",
        "Two filtering schemes were applied to improve the accuracy of the lists: (1) minimum frequency of occurrence, the noun must appear more than a set number of times",
        "lists.",
        "Results are computed for P(recision) and R(ecall).",
        "in the corpus and (2) bias, the least common type of noun usage (i.e., common or proper) must account for more than a set percentage of all usages.",
        "We experimented with various values for these filters and a selection of results is shown in Table 2, where freq is the minimum frequency of occurrence filter and bias indicates the percentage of the less frequent noun type.",
        "bias freq words BNCclaws Gigaword",
        "Precision (against BNCclaws) increased as the filters become more aggressive.",
        "However comparison with Gigaword does not show such high precision and recall is extremely low in all cases.",
        "These experiments demonstrate that it is difficult to automatically generate a list of nouns that exhibit both common and proper usages.",
        "Manual analysis of the lists generated suggest that the heuristics can identify ambiguous nouns but intersecting the lists results in the loss of some obviously ambiguous nouns (however, their union introduces a large amount of noise).",
        "We select nouns from the lists created by these heuristics (such that the distribution of either the common or proper noun sense in the data was not less than 45%) for experiments in the following sections.1"
