        "The SemEval 2012 competition initiated a task targeted at Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between sentence pairs (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Given a set of sentence pairs, participants are required to assign to each sentence pair a similarity score.",
        "Because a sentence has only a limited amount of content words, it is difficult to determine sentence similarities.",
        "To solve this problem, Hatzivassiloglou et al. (1999) proposed to use linguistic features as indicators of text similarity to address the problem of sparse representation of sentences.",
        "Mihalcea et al. (2006) measured sentence similarity using component words in sentences.",
        "Li et al. (2006) proposed to incorporate the semantic vector and word order to calculate sentence similarity.",
        "Biemann et al. (2012) applied the log-linear regression model by combining the simple string based measures, for example, word ngrams and semantic similarity measures, for example, textual entailment.",
        "Similarly, Saric et al. (2012) used a support vector regression model which incorporates features computed from sentence pairs.",
        "The features are knowledge-and corpus-based word similarity, ngram overlaps, WordNet augmented word overlap, syntactic features and so on.",
        "Xu et al. (2012) combined semantic vectors with skip bigrams to determine sentence similarity, whereas the skip bigrams take into the sequential order between words.",
        "In our approach to the STS task, words in sentences are assigned with appropriate senses using their contexts.",
        "Sentence similarity is computed by calculating the number of shared senses in both sentences since it is reasonable to assume that similar sentences should have more overlapping senses.",
        "For the STS-TYPED task, variations might occur in author names, people involved, time expression and location.",
        "Thus, string kernel is applied to compute similarity between entities because it can capture variations between entities.",
        "Moreover, for the event similarity in STS-TYPED task, semantic relatedness between verbs is derived the WordNet.",

        "In WordNet, a word sense is represented by a synset which has a gloss that defines the concept that it represents.",
        "For example, the words walking, afoot, ambulate constitute a single synset which has gloss representations as follows, walking: the act of traveling by foot afoot: traveling by foot ambulate: walk about To lift the limitations of dictionary glosses which are fairly short with insufficient vocabulary, we utilize the glosses of related senses since we assume that words co-occur in one sentence share related senses and the more glosses two senses share, the more similar they are.",
        "Therefore, we extract not only glosses of target synset, but also the glosses of the hypernym, hyponym, meronym, holonym and troponym synsets of the target synset to form a synset context.",
        "Finally, we compare the sentence contexts with different synset contexts to determine which sense should be assigned to the words.",
