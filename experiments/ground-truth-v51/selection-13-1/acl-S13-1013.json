        "This paper describes a system for automatically measuring the semantic similarity between two texts, which was the aim of the 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "For the 2012 STS task, Heilman and Madnani (2012) submitted the PERP system, which performed competitively in relation to other submissions.",
        "However, approaches including word and n-gram features also performed well (Ba?r et al., 2012; S?aric?",
        "et al, 2012), and the 2013 STS task focused more on predicting similarity for text pairs from new domains.",
        "Therefore, for the three variations of our system that we were allowed to submit, we used stacking (Wolpert, 1992) to combine PERP with word and n-gram features and applied the domain adaptation approach outlined by Daumé III (2007) to facilitate generalization to new domains.",
        "Our submissions performed well at most subtasks, particularly at measuring the similarity of news headlines, where one of our submissions ranked 2nd among 89 from 34 teams, but there is still room for improvement."

        "In this paper, we describe our submissions to the 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2013), which evaluated implementations of text-to-text similarity measures.",

        "A weighted mean of the correlations was also computed as an overall evaluation metric (the OnWn and FNWN datasets were smaller than the headlines and SMT datasets).",

        "PERP measures the similarity of a sentence pair by finding a sequence of edit operations (e.g., insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) that converts one sentence to the other.",
        "It then uses various features of the edits, with weights learned from labeled sentence pairs, to assign a similarity score.",
        "PERP performed well, ranking 7th out of 88 submissions from 35 teams according to the weighted mean correlation.",
        "However, PERP lacked some of the useful word and n-gram overlap features included in some of the other top-performing submissions.",
