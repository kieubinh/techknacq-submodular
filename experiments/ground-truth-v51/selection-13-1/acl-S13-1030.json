        "Two short texts are considered similar if they both convey similar messages.",
        "Often it is the case that similar texts will have a high degree of lexical overlap, although this isn't always so.",
        "For example, SC dismissed government's review plea in Vodafone tax case and SC dismisses govt's review petition on Vodafone tax verdict are semantically similar.",
        "These texts have matches in terms of exact words (SC, Vodafone, tax), morphologically-related words (dismissed and dismisses), and abbreviations (government's and govt?s).",
        "However, the usages (senses) of plea and petition, and case and verdict are also similar.",
        "One straightforward way of estimating semantic similarity of two texts is by using approaches based on the similarity of the surface forms of the words they contain.",
        "However, such methods are not capable of capturing similarity or relatedness at the lexical level, and moreover, they do not exploit the context in which individual words are used in a target text.",
        "Nevertheless, a variety of knowledge sources ?",
        "including part-of-speech, collocations, syntax, and domain ?",
        "can be used to identify the usage or sense of words in context (McRoy, 1992; Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Stevenson, 2006) to address these issues.",
        "Despite their limitations, string similarity measures have been widely used in previous semantic similarity tasks (Agirre et al., 2012; Islam and Inkpen, 2008).",
        "Latent variable models have also been used to estimate the semantic similarity between words, word usages, and texts (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007; Lui et al., 2012; Guo and Diab, 2012; Dinu and Lapata, 2010).",

        "In this paper we described our approach to the STS SemEval-2013 shared task.",
        "While we did not achieve high scores relative to the other submitted systems on any of the datasets or overall, we have identified some novel feature sets which we show to have utility for the STS task.",
        "We have also compared our proposed method's performance with a larger training dataset.",
        "In future work, we intend to consider alternative ways for combining features learned from different domains and training datasets.",
        "Given the strong performance of our string similarity features on particular datasets, we also intend to consider combining string and distributional similarity to capture elements of the texts that are not currently captured by our string similarity features."
