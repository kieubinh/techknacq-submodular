        "On the one hand, vector space models (see Turney and Pantel (2010) and Erk (2012) for two recent surveys) have been exploited in psycholinguistic (Lund and Burgess, 1996) and computational linguistic research (Schu?tze, 1992) to explore the notion of ?similarity?",
        "between a set of target objects within a geometric setting.",

        "While the emergence of vector space models is increasingly pervasive within data-intensive lexical semantics, and even though useful features have been identified in general terms:1 when it comes to a specific semantic phenomenon, we need to explore the relevant distributional features in order to investigate the respective phenomenon.",
        "Our research is interested in the meaning of German compounds.",
        "More specifically, we aim to predict the degrees of compositionality of German noun-noun compounds (e.g., Feuerwerk ?fire works?)",

        "and Werk ?opus?).",
        "This prediction uses vector space models, and our goal is to identify salient features that determine the degree of compositionality of the compounds by relying on the distributional similarities between the compounds and their constituents.",
        "In this vein, we systematically explore window-based and syntax-based contextual clues.",
        "Since the targets in our vector space models are all nouns (i.e., the compound nouns, the modifier nouns, and the head nouns), our hypothesis is that adjectives and verbs are expected to provide salient distributional properties, as adjective/verb meaning and noun meaning are in a strong interdependent relationship.",
        "Even more, we expect adjectives and verbs that are syntactically bound to the nouns under consideration (syntax-based, i.e., attributive adjectives and subcategorising verbs) to outperform those that ?just?",
        "appear in the window contexts of the nouns (window-based).",
        "In order to investigate this first",
        "hypothesis, we compare window-based and syntax-based distributional features across parts-of-speech.",
        "Concerning a more specific aspect of compound meaning, we are interested in the contributions of the modifier noun versus head noun properties with regard to the meaning of the noun-noun compounds.",
        "While there has been prior psycholinguistic research on the constituent contributions (e.g., Gagne?",
        "and Spalding (2009; 2011)), computational linguistics has not yet paid much attention to this issue, as far as we know.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the distributional properties of the head constituents are more salient than the distributional properties of the modifier constituents in predicting the degree of compositionality of the compounds.",
        "In order to assess this second hypothesis, we compare the vector space similarities between the compounds and their modifier constituents with those of the compounds and their head constituents, with regard to the overall most successful features.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the compound data that is relevant for this paper, i.e., the noun-noun compounds and the compositionality ratings.",

        "This analysis is in accordance with the upper bound in Section 3.1, where the compound?constituent ratings were correlated with the compound whole ratings.",
        "Figure 6 presents the correlation values when determining the compound whole ratings by only compound?modifier predictions, or only compound?head predictions, or by adding or multiplying the modifier and head predictions.",
        "The underlying features rely on a 20-word window (adjectives, verbs, nouns, and across parts-of-speech).",
        "It is striking that in three out of four cases the predictions of the compound whole ratings were performed similarly well (i) by only the compound?modifier predictions, and (ii) by multiplying the compound?",
        "modifier and the compound?head predictions.",
        "So, as in the calculation of the upper bound, the distributional semantics of the modifiers had a much stronger impact on the semantics of the compound than the distributional semantics of the heads did."

        "The vector space models explored two hypotheses to predict the compositionality of German noun-noun compounds by distributional features.",
        "Regarding hypothesis 1, we demonstrated that ?against our intuitions?",
        "not adjectives or verbs whose meanings are strongly interdependent with the meanings of nouns provided the most salient distributional information, but that relying on nouns was the best choice, in combination with a 20-word window, reaching state-of-the-art ?",
        "= 0.6497.",
        "The larger but less clean web corpus WebKo outperformed the smaller but cleaner successor sdeWaC.",
        "Furthermore, the syntax-based predictions by adjective/preposition modification and by verb subcategorisation (as well as various concatenations of syntactic VSMs) were all worse than the predictions by the respective window-based parts-of-speech.",
        "Regarding hypothesis 2, we distinguished the contributions of modifiers vs. heads to the compound meaning from two perspectives.",
        "(i) The predictions of the compound?modifier vs. compound?",
        "head ratings did not differ significantly when using features from increasing window sizes, but with small window sizes the compound?head ratings were predicted better than the compound?modifier ratings.",
        "This insight fits well to the stronger impact of syntax-based features on compound?head in comparison to compound?modifier predictions because ?even though German is a language with comparably free word order?",
        "we can expect many syntax-based features (especially attributive adjectives and prepositions) to appear in close vicinity to the nouns they depend on or subcategorise.",
        "We conclude that the features that are salient to predict similarities between the compound?modifier vs. the compound?head pairs are different, and that based on small windows the distributional similarity between compounds and heads is stronger than between compounds and modifiers, but based on larger contexts this difference vanishes.",
        "(ii) With regard to the overall meaning of the compound, the influence of the modifiers was not only much stronger in the human ratings (cf.",
        "Section 2) and in the upper bound (cf.",
        "Section 3.1), but also in the vector space models (cf.",
        "Figure 6).",
        "While this insight contradicts our second hypothesis (that the head properties are more salient than the modifier properties in predicting the compositionality of the compound), it fits into a larger picture that has primarily been discussed in psycholinguistic research on compound meaning, where various factors such as the semantic relation between the modifier and the head (Gagne?",
        "and Spalding, 2009) and the modifier properties, inferential processing and world knowledge (Gagne?",
        "and Spalding, 2011) were taken into account.",
        "However, also in psycholinguistic studies that explore the semantic role of modifiers and heads in noun compounds there is no agreement about which constituent properties are inherited by the compound."
