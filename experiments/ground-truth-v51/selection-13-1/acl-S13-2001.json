        "However, since addressing this aim in a first evaluation challenge was deemed too difficult a staged approach was suggested.",
        "TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1) was an initial evaluation exercise focusing only on the categorization of temporal relations and only in English.",
        "It included three relation types: event-timex, event-dct,1 and relations between main events in consecutive sentences.",

        "Temporal annotation is a time-consuming task for humans, which has limited the size of annotated data in previous TempEval exercises.",
        "Current systems, however, are performing close to the inter-annotator reliability, which suggests that larger corpora could be built from automatically annotated data with minor human reviews.",
        "We want to explore whether there is value in adding a large automatically created silver standard to a hand-crafted gold standard.",
        "End-to-end temporal relation processing task: the temporal relation classification tasks are performed from raw text, i.e. participants need to extract their own events and temporal expressions first, determine which ones to link and then obtain the relation types.",
