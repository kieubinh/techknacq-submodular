        "The cross-lingual textual entailment task (Mehdad et al., 2010) addresses textual entailment (TE) recognition (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) under the new dimension of cross-linguality, and within the new challenging application scenario of content synchronization.",
        "Given two texts in different languages, the cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) task consists of deciding if the meaning of one text can be inferred from the meaning of the other text.",
        "Cross-linguality represents an interesting direction for research on recognizing textual entailment (RTE), especially due to its possible application in a variety of tasks.",
        "Among others (e.g. question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, and document summarization), multilingual content synchronization represents a challenging application scenario to evaluate CLTE recognition components geared to the identification of sentence-level semantic relations.",
        "Given two documents about the same topic written in different languages (e.g. Wikipedia pages), the content synchronization task consists of automatically detecting and resolving differences in the information they provide, in order to produce aligned, mutually enriched versions of the two documents (Monz et al., 2011; Bronner et al., 2012).",
        "Towards this objective, a crucial requirement is to identify the information in one page that is either equivalent or novel (more informative) with respect to the content of the other.",
        "The task can be naturally cast as an entailment recognition problem, where bidirectional and unidirectional entailment judgements for two text fragments are respectively mapped into judgements about semantic equivalence and novelty.",
        "The task can also be seen as a machine translation evaluation problem, where judgements about semantic equivalence and novelty depend on the possibility to fully or partially translate a text fragment into the other.",
        "The recent advances on monolingual TE on the one hand, and the methodologies used in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) on the other, offer promising solutions to approach the CLTE task.",
        "In line with a number of systems that model the RTE task as a similarity problem (i.e. handling similarity scores between T and H as features contributing to the entailment decision), the standard sentence and word alignment programs used in SMT offer a strong baseline for CLTE (Mehdad et al., 2011;",
        "Mehdad et al., 2012).",
        "However, although representing a solid starting point to approach the problem, similarity-based techniques are just approximations, open to significant improvements coming from semantic inference at the multilingual level (e.g. cross-lingual entailment rules such as ?perro???animal?).",
        "Taken in isolation, similarity-based techniques clearly fall short of providing an effective solution to the problem of assigning directions to the entailment relations (especially in the complex CLTE scenario, where entailment relations are multi-directional).",
        "Thanks to the contiguity between CLTE, TE and SMT, the proposed task provides an interesting scenario to approach the issues outlined above from different perspectives, and offers large room for mutual improvement.",
        "Building on the success of the first CLTE evaluation organized within SemEval-2012 (Negri et al., 2012a), the remainder of this paper describes the second evaluation round organized within SemEval2013.",
