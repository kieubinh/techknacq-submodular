        "Numerous past tasks have focused on leveraging the meaning of word types or words in context.",
        "Examples of the former are noun categorization and the TOEFL test, examples of the latter are word sense disambiguation, metonymy resolution, and lexical substitution.",
        "As these tasks have enjoyed a lot success, a natural progression is the pursuit of models that can perform similar tasks taking into account multiword expressions and complex compositional structure.",
        "In this paper, we present two subtasks designed to evaluate such phrasal models: a. Semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases b.",
        "Evaluating the compositionality of phrases in context For example, the first subtask addresses computing how similar the word ?valuation?",
        "is to the compositional sequence ?price assessment?, while the second subtask addresses deciding whether the phrase ?piece of cake?",
        "is used literally or figuratively in the sentence ?Labour was a piece of cake!?.",
        "The aim of these subtasks is two-fold.",
        "Firstly, considering that there is a spread interest lately in phrasal semantics in its various guises, they provide an opportunity to draw together approaches to numerous related problems under a common evaluation set.",
        "It is intended that after the competition, the evaluation setting and the datasets will comprise an ongoing benchmark for the evaluation of these phrasal models.",
        "Secondly, the subtasks attempt to bridge the gap between established lexical semantics and full-blown linguistic inference.",
        "Thus, we anticipate that they will stimulate an increased interest around the general issue of phrasal semantics.",
        "We use the notion of phrasal semantics here as opposed to lexical compounds or compositional semantics.",
        "Bridging the gap between lexical semantics and linguistic inference could provoke novel approaches to certain established tasks, such as lexical entailment and paraphrase identification.",
        "In addition, it could ul",
        "timately lead to improvements in a wide range of applications in natural language processing, such as document retrieval, clustering and classification, question answering, query expansion, synonym extraction, relation extraction, automatic translation, or textual advertisement matching in search engines, all of which depend on phrasal semantics.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents details about the data sources and the variety of sources applicable to the task.",
        "Section 3 discusses the first subtask, which is about semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases.",
        "In subsection 3.1 the subtask is described in detail together with some information about its background.",
        "Subsection 3.2 discusses the data creation process and subsection 3.3 discusses the participating systems and their results.",
        "Section 4 introduces the second subtask, which is about evaluating the compositionality of phrases in context.",
        "Subsection 4.1 explains the data creation process for this subtask.",
        "In subsection 4.2 the evaluation statistics of participating systems are presented.",
        "Section 5 is a discussion about the conclusions of the entire task.",
        "Finally, in section 6 we summarize this presentation and discuss briefly our vision about challenges in distributional semantics."

        "Several versions of the WaCky corpora, with various extra annotations or modifications are also available1.",
        "We ensured that data instances occur frequently enough in the WaCky corpora, so that participating systems could gather statistics for building distributional vectors or other uses.",
        "As the evaluation data only contains very small annotated samples from freely available web documents, and the original source is provided, we could provide them without violating copyrights.",
        "The size of the WaCky corpora is suitable for training reliable distributional models.",
        "Sentences are already lemmatized and part-of-speech tagged.",
        "Participating approaches making use of distributional methods, part-of-speech tags or lemmas, were strongly encouraged to use these corpora and their shared preprocessing, to ensure the highest possible comparability of results.",

        "For the first subtask, data were provided in English, German and Italian and for the second subtask in English and German.",
        "The range of methods applicable to both subtasks was deliberately not limited to any specific branch of methods, such as distributional or vector models of semantic compositionality.",
        "We believe that the subtasks can be tackled from different directions and we expect a great deal of the scientific benefit to lie in the comparison of very different approaches, as well as how these approaches can be combined.",
        "An exception to this rule is the fact that participants in the first subtask were not allowed to use directly definitions extracted from dictionaries or lexicons.",

        "For compositional distributional semantics, the need for these basic functions is discussed in Mitchell and Lapata (2008).",
        "Since then, many models have been proposed for addressing the task (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Guevara, 2010), but still comparative analysis is in general based on comparing sequences that consist of two words.",
        "As in Zanzotto et al. (2010), this subtask proposes to compare the similarity of a 2-word sequence and a single word.",
        "This is important as it is the basic step to analyse models that can compare any word sequences of different length.",
        "The development and testing set for this subtask were built based on the idea described in Zanzotto et al. (2010).",
        "Dictionaries were used as sources of contact/[kon-takt]",

        "The similarity values are used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).",
        "The first approach (run 1) of CLaC (Siblini and Kosseim, 2013) is based on a weighted semantic network to measure semantic relatedness between the word and the components of the phrase.",

        "This approach was used in conjunction with the first one as a backup method (run 2).",

        "The system computes the similarity between the first noun and the head noun of the second phrase, which was weighted according to the semantics of the modifier.",
        "The second approach, called dm, used a dependency-based vector space model, but, unlike the first approach, disregarded the modifier in the defining sequence.",
        "Since both systems are unsupervised, the training data was used to train a similarity threshold parameter, only.",
        "UMCC DLSI-(EPS) (Da?vila et al., 2013) locates the synsets of words in data instances and computes the semantic distances between each synset of the word under definition and each synsets of the defining sequence words.",

        "In this paper we have presented the 5th task of SemEval 2013, ?Evaluating Phrasal Semantics?, which consists of two subtasks: (1) semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases, and (2) compositionality of phrases in context.",
        "The former subtask, which focussed on the first step of composing the meaning of phrases of any length, is less complex than the latter subtask, which considers the effect of context to the semantics of a phrase.",
        "The paper presents details about the background and importance of these subtasks, the data creation process, the systems that took part in the evaluation and their results.",
        "In the future, we expect evaluation challenges on phrasal semantics to progress towards two directions: (a) the synthesis of semantics of sequences longer than two words, and (b) aiming to improve the performance of systems that determine the compositionality of previously unseen phrases in context.",
        "The evaluation results of the first task suggest that state-of-the-art systems can compose the semantics of two word sequences with a promising level of success.",
        "However, this task should be seen as the first step towards composing the semantics of sentence-long sequences.",
        "As far as subtask 5b is concerned, the accuracy achieved by the participating systems on unseen testing data was low, only slightly better than the most frequent class baseline, which assigns the figurative use to all test phrases.",
        "Thus, the subtask cannot be considered well addressed by the state-of-the-art and further progress should be sought."
