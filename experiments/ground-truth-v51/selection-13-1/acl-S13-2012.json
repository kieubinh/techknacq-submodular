        "The SemEval-2013 Task 1 (TempEval-3) contest is the third instantiation of an event ordering challenge.",
        "However, it is the first to start from raw text with the challenge to create an end-to-end algorithm for event ordering.",
        "Previous challenges included the individual aspects of such a system, including event extraction, timex extraction, and event/time ordering (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010).",
        "However, neither task was dependent on the other.",
        "This paper presents NavyTime, a system inspired partly by this previous breakup of the tasks.",
        "We focus on breaking up the event/time ordering task further, and show that 5 classifiers yield better performance than the traditional 3 (or even 1).",
        "The first required steps to annotate a document are to extract its events and time expressions.",
        "This paper describes a new event extractor with a rich set of contextual features that is a top performer for event attributes at Tempeval-3.",
        "We then explore additions to SUTime, a top rule-based extractor for time expressions (Chang and Manning, 2012).",
        "However, the core challenge is to link these extracted events and times together.",
        "We describe new models for these difficult tasks: (1) identifying ordered pairs, and (2) labeling the ordering relations.",
        "Relation identification is rarely addressed in the literature.",
        "Given a set of events, which pairs of events are temporally related?",
        "Almost all previous work assumes we are given the pairs, and the task is to label the relation (before, after, etc.).",
        "Raw text presents a new challenge: extract the relevant pairs before labeling them.",
        "We present some of the first results that compare rule-based approaches to trained probabilistic classifiers.",
        "These are the first such comparisons to our knowledge.",
        "Finally, after relation identification, we label relations between the pairs.",
        "This is the traditional event ordering task, although we now start from noisy pairs.",
        "Our main contribution is to build independent classifiers for intra-sentence event/time pairs.",
        "We show improved performance when training these split classifiers.",
        "NavyTime's approach is highly competitive, achieving 2nd place in relation labeling (and overall)."
