        "The goal of task 11 of SemEval?2013 was to cluster Web search results (Navigli and Vannella, 2013).",
        "The test data consisted of the top 64 Google results for each of 100 potentially ambiguous queries, for a total of 6,400 test instances.",
        "The Web snippets returned for each query were clustered and evaluated separately, with an overall evaluation score provided for each system.",
        "The problem of Web page clustering is one of the use cases envisioned for SenseClusters (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2007; Pedersen, 2010a), a freely available open source software package developed at the University of Minnesota, Duluth starting in 2002.",
        "It supports first and second?order clustering of contexts using both co?occurrence matrices (Pu-randare and Pedersen, 2004; Kulkarni and Pedersen, 2005) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "SenseClusters has participated in various forms at different SenseEval and SemEval shared tasks, including SemEval-2007 (Pedersen, 2007), SemEval2010 (Pedersen, 2010b) and also in an i2b2 clinical medicine task (Pedersen, 2006)."

        "While we refer to three Duluth systems (sys1, sys7, and sys9), in reality these are all variations of the same overall system.",
        "All three are based on second?",
        "order context clustering as provided in SenseClusters.",
        "The query terms are treated exactly like any other word in the snippets, which is called headless clustering in SenseClusters.",
        "2.1 Common aspects to all systems The input to sys1, sys7, and sys9 consists of 64 Web search snippets, each approximately 25 words in length.",
        "All text was converted to upper case prior to processing.",
        "The goal was to group the 64 snippets for each query into k distinct clusters, where k was automatically determined by the PK2 method of SenseClusters (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006a; Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006b).",
        "Each discovered cluster represents a different underlying meaning of the given query term that resulted in those snippets being returned.",
        "Word sense induction was carried out separately on the Web snippets associated with each query term, meaning that the algorithm was run 100 times and clustered 64 Web page snippets each time.",
        "In second?order context clustering, the words in a context (i.e., Web snippet) to be clustered are replaced by vectors that are derived from some corpus of text.",
        "The corpora used are among the main differences in the Duluth systems.",
        "Once the words in a context are replaced by vectors, those vectors are averaged together to create a new representation of the context.",
        "That representation is said to be second?order because each word is represented by its direct or first order co?occurrences, and simi",
        "larities between words in the same Web snippet are captured by the set of words that mutually co?occur with them.",
        "If car is represented by the vector [motor, magazine, insurance], and if life is represented by the vector [sentence, force, insurance], then car and life are said to be second?order co-occurrences because they both occur with insurance.",
        "A second?order co-occurrence can capture more indirect relationships between words, and so these second?order connections tend to be more numerous and more subtle than first?order co?occurrences (which would require that car and life co?occur near or adjacent to each other in a Web snippet to establish a relationship).",
        "The co-occurrence matrix is created by finding bi-grams that occur more than a given number of times (this varies per system) and have a log-likelihood ratio greater than 3.84.1 Then, the first word in a bi-gram is represented in the rows of the matrix, the second word is represented in the columns.",
        "The value in the corresponding cell is the log-likelihood score.",
        "This matrix is therefore not symmetric, and has different entries for old age and age old.",
        "Also, any bigram that includes one or two stop words (e.g., to fire, running to, for the) will be excluded and not included in the co-occurrence matrix and will not be included in the overall sample count used for computing the log?likelihood ratio.",
        "To summarize then, words in a Web snippet are represented by the words with which they occur in bigrams, where the context word is the first word in the bigram, and the vector is the set of words that follow it in bigrams.",
        "Once the co?occurrence matrix is created, it may be optionally reduced by Singular Value Decomposition.",
        "The result of this will be a matrix with the same number of rows prior to SVD, but a reduced number of columns.",
        "The goal of SVD is to compress together columns of words with similar co?",
        "occurrence patterns, and thereby reduce the size and noisiness of the data.",
        "Whether the matrix is reduced or not, then each word in each snippet to be clustered is replaced by a vector from that matrix.",
        "A word is 1This value corresponds with a p-value of 0.05 when testing for significance, meaning that bigrams with log-likelihood at least equal to 3.84 have at least a 95% chance of having been drawn from a population where their co-occurrence is not by chance.",
        "replaced by the row in the co-occurrence matrix to which it corresponds.",
        "Any words that do not have an entry in the co-occurrence matrix will not be represented.",
        "Then, the contexts are clustered using the method of repeated bisections (Zhao and Karypis, 2004), where the number of clusters is automatically discovered using the PK2 method."

      "heading": "2.2 Differences among systems",
      "text": [
        "The main difference among the systems was the corpora used to create their co-occurrence matrices.",
        "The smallest corpus was used by sys7, which simply treated the 64 snippets returned by each query as the corpus for creating a co?occurrence matrix.",
        "Thus, each query term had a unique co-occurrence matrix that was created from the Web snippets returned by that query.",
        "This results in a very small amount of data per query (approx.",
        "25 words/snippet * 64 snippets = 1600 words), and so bigrams were allowed to have up to three intervening words that were skipped (in order to increase the number of bigrams used to create the co?occurrence matrix).",
        "Bigrams were excluded if they only occurred 1 time, had a log?likelihood ratio of less than 3.84, or were made up of one or two stop words.",
        "Even with this more flexible definition of bigram, the resulting co?occurrence matrices were still quite small.",
        "The largest resulting co?occurrence matrix for any query was 221 x 222, with 602 non?zero values (meaning there were 602 different bigrams used as features).",
        "The smallest of the co-occurrence matrices was 102 x 113 with 242 non?zero values.",
        "Given these small sizes, SVD was not employed in sys7.",
        "sys1 and sys9 used larger corpora, and therefore required bigrams to be made up of adjacent words that occurred 5 or more times, had log?likelihood ratio scores of 3.84 or above, and contained no stop words.",
        "Rather than having a different co?occurrence matrix for each query, sys1 and sys9 created a single co-occurrence matrix for all queries.",
        "In sys1, all the Web snippet results for all 100 queries were combined into a single corpus.",
        "Thus, the co?occurrence matrix was based on bigram features found in a corpus of 6,400 Web snippets that consisted of approximately 160,000 words.",
        "This resulted in a co?occurrence matrix of size 771 x 952 with 1,558 non?zero values prior to SVD.",
        "After SVD the matrix was 771 x 90, and all cells had non",
        "zero values (as a result of SVD).",
        "Note that if there are less than 3,000 columns in a co-occurrence matrix, the columns are reduced down to 10% of their original size.",
        "If there are more than 3,000 columns then it is reduced to 300 dimensions.",
        "This follows recommendations for SVD given for Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Rather than using task data, sys9 uses the first 10,000 paragraphs of Associated Press newswire (APW) that appear in the English Gigaword corpus (1st edition) (Graff and Cieri, 2003).",
        "This created a corpus of approximately 3.6 million words which resulted in a co-occurrence matrix prior to SVD of 9,853 x 10,995 with 43,199 non-zero values.",
        "After SVD the co?occurrence matrix was 9,853 by 300."

        "In word sense induction, the labels assigned to discovered clusters are arbitrary, so a random baseline is a convenient sanity check.",
        "MFS replicates the most frequent sense baseline from supervised learning by simply assigning all instances for a word to a single cluster.",

        "We have argued previously (Pedersen, 2010a) that any evaluation measure used for word sense induction needs to be able to expose random baselines and distinguish them from more systematic results.",
        "By this standard a number of measures are found to be lacking.",
        "In SemEval?",
        "2010 we demonstrated that the V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) had an overwhelming bias towards systems that produce larger numbers of clusters ?",
        "as a result it scored random baselines that generated larger number of clusters (like Rand25 and Rand50) very highly.",
        "The Rand Index (RI), which does not correct for chance agreement, also scores random baselines higher than both non?random systems and MFS.",
        "The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) corrects for chance and scores random systems near 0, but it also scores MFS near 0.",
        "According to ARI, random systems and MFS perform at essentially the same level.",
        "This is a troublesome tendency when evaluating word sense induction systems, since MFS is often considered a reasonable baseline that provides useful results.",
        "Many words have relatively skewed distributions where they are mostly used in one sense, and this is exactly what is approximated by MFS.",
        "Of the measures included in Table 1, the paired FScore (F-10), the F-Measure (F-SC), and the Jaccard Coefficient provide results that seem most appropriate for word sense induction.",
        "This is because these measures score random baselines lower than MFS, and that RandX scores lower than RandY, when (X > Y).",
        "The paired FScore (F-10) and the Jaccard Coefficient arrived at similar results, where Rand50 received an extremely low score, and MFS scored the highest.",
        "The F-measure (F-SC) had a similar profile, except that the decline in evaluation scores as X grows in RandX is somewhat less.",
        "The paired F-Score (F-10), the F-Measure (F-SC), and F1 (F1-13) all score MFS at approximately 54%, which is intuitively appealing since that is the percentage of instances correctly clustered if all instances are placed into a single cluster.",
        "However, in",
        "other cases these measures begin to diverge.",
        "F1 (F113) tends to score random baselines even higher than MFS, and Rand50 gets a higher score than Rand2, which is somewhat counter intuitive.",
        "In fact according to F1 (F1-13), Rand50 would have been the top ranked system in task 11.",
        "It appears that F1 (F113) is strongly influenced by cluster purity, but does not penalize a system for creating too many clusters.",
        "Thus, as the number of clusters increases, F1 (F113) will consistently improve since smaller clusters are nearly always more pure than larger ones.",
        "Interestingly enough, the Rand Index (RI) and the Jaccard Coefficient both score MFS at 39%.",
        "This number does not have an intuitively appealing interpretation, and thereafter RI and Jaccard diverge.",
