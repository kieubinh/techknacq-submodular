        "Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a research field in the area of text mining and natural language processing, which investigates the automated detection of opinions in language.",
        "In written text, an opinion is a person's attitude towards some topic, pronounced by verbal (e.g. choice of words, rhetorical figures) or non-verbal means (e.g. emoticons, emphatic spelling).",
        "More formally, Liu (2012) defines an opinion as the quintuple (ei, aij , sijkl, hk, tl) where ?ei is the name of an entity, aij is an aspect of ei, sijkl is the sentiment on aspect aij of entity ei, hk is the opinion holder, and tl is the time when the opinion is expressed by hk.",
        "The sentiment sijkl is positive, negative, or neutral, or expressed with different strength/intensity levels [...].",
        "When an opinion is on the entity itself as a whole, the special aspect GENERAL is used to denote it.",
        "[...] ei and aij together represent the opinion target?",
        "(Liu, 2012).",
        "With the massively growing importance of social media in everyday life, being able to automatically find and classify attitudes in written text allows for estimating the mood of a large group of people, e.g. towards a certain event, service, product, matter of fact or the like.",
        "As working with the very short and informal texts typical for social networks poses challenges not encountered in more traditional text genres, the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) 2013 has a shared task on sentiment analysis in microblogging texts, which is detailed in Wilson et al. (2013).",
        "The task requires sentiment analysis of Twitter1 and SMS messages and comprises two subtasks, one of which deals with determining the sentiment of a given message fragment depending on its context (Task A) and one on overall message polarity classification (Task B).",
        "We treat both tasks as document-level sentiment classification tasks, which we define according to Liu (2012) as determining the opinion ( ,GENERAL, s, , ) of a given message, where s ?",
        "{positive, negative, neutral} and ?the entity e, opinion holder h, and time of opinion t are assumed known or irrelevant?",
        "(Liu, 2012).",
        "For Task A we only consider the marked fraction of the message to be given.",
        "This introduction is followed by sections discussing related work (2), details of our system (3), experiments (4) and results and conclusion (5)."

        "While this strategy performed reasonably well for us, more sophisticated tokenizers for social media messages",
        "that handle more special cases like emoticons including letters are thinkable.",
        "To address the large variety in spelling typical for social networks we store three different variants of each token: a) The raw token found in the message b) A normalized version, in which all characters are converted to lowercase and all digits to 0 c) A collapsed version, in which all adjacent duplicate characters are removed from the normalized version, if it is not present in an English word list.",
