        "The detection of DDIs is an important research area in patient safety since these interactions can become very dangerous and increase health care costs.",
        "Drug interactions are frequently reported in journals, making medical literature the most effective source for their detection (Aronson, 2007).",
        "Therefore, Information Extraction (IE) can be of great benefit in the pharmaceutical industry allowing identification and extraction of relevant information on DDIs and providing an interesting way of reducing the time spent by health care professionals on reviewing the literature.",
        "The DDIExtraction 2013 follows up on a first event organized in 2011, DDIExtraction 2011 (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011b) whose main goal was the detection of drug-drug interactions from biomedical texts.",
        "The new edition includes in addition to DDI extraction also a supporting task, the recognition and classification of pharmacological substances.",
        "DDIExtraction 2013 is designed to address the extraction of DDIs as a whole, but divided into two subtasks to allow separate evaluation of the performance for different aspects of the problem.",

        "This shared task has been conceived with a dual objective: advancing the state-of-the-art of text-mining techniques applied to the pharmacological domain, and providing a common framework for evaluation of the participating systems and other researchers interested in the task.",

        "Regarding the classification of each entity type, we observed that brand drugs were easier to recognize than the other types.",

        "Also, this may indicate that this type is less clearly defined than the others in the annotation guidelines.",
        "Another possible reason is that the presence of such substances in this dataset is very scarce (less than 1%).",
