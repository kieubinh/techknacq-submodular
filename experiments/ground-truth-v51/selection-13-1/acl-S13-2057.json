        "This paper presents the multiphase relation extraction (RE) approach which was used for the DDI Extraction task of SemEval 2013.",
        "As a preliminary step, the proposed approach indirectly (and automatically) exploits the scope of negation cues and the semantic roles of involved entities for reducing the skewness in the training data as well as discarding possible negative instances from the test data.",
        "Then, a state-of-the-art hybrid kernel is used to train a classifier which is later applied on the instances of the test data not filtered out by the previous step.",
        "The official results of the task show that our approach yields an F-score of 0.80 for DDI detection and an F-score of 0.65 for DDI detection and classification.",
        "Our system obtained significantly higher results than all the other participating teams in this shared task and has been ranked 1st."

        "DDI classification will be described in Section 3.",
        "There are three phases for DDI detection: (i) discard less informative sentences, (ii) discard less informative instances, and (iii) train the system (a single model regardless of DDI types) on the remaining training instances and identify possible DDIs from the remaining test instances.",

        "We hypothesize that a classifier trained solely on features related to the scope of negations can be used to pro-actively filter groups of instances which are less informative and mostly negative.",
        "To be more precise, we propose to train a classifier (which will be applied before using the kernel based RE classifier mentioned in Section 2.3) that would check whether all the target entity mentions inside a sentence along with possible relation clues (or trigger words), if any, fall (directly or indirectly) under the scope of a negation cue.",
        "If such a sentence is found, then it would be identified as less informative and discarded (i.e. the candidate mention pairs inside such sentence would not be considered).",

        "The remaining sentences are considered as negative instances.",

        "Interested readers are referred to Chowdhury and Lavelli (2013).",

        "If the classifier finds such a sentence, then it is assigned the negative class label.",
        "At present, we focus only on the first occurrence of the negation cues ?no?, ?n't?",
