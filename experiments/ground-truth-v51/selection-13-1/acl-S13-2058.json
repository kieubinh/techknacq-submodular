        "a property that is rarely stated along with the entity mention and can thus often only be determined with domain-knowledge.",
        "We think it is also important to point to the large difference between results obtained by 10-fold CV on the training corpus and test results (e.g. up to 17.6 pp F1 for Run 1).",
        "One reason might be the large fraction (?",
        "83%) of entity mentions that appear more than once in the training corpus compared to presumably many unseen entities in the test corpus.",
        "For 10-fold CV this means that an entity in the evaluation fold has already been seen with a high probability in one of the nine training folds, yielding results that overestimate the generalization performance.",
        "Moreover, our results indicate that identifying and classifying pharmacological substances is much harder for MEDLINE documents than for DrugBank documents with a difference of up to 31.5 pp F1 (cf. the last two rows of Table 4).",
        "Hence, another apparent reason for the performance differences is the substantial skew in the ratio of DrugBank to MEDLINE documents in the training corpus (roughly 4:1) compared to the test corpus (roughly 1:1).",
        "Since both sets of documents stem from different resources, this can be referred to as domain-adaptation problem.",
