        "These sentiments can be used to provided targeted advertising, automatically generate reviews, and make various predictions, such as political outcomes.",
        "In this paper we develop a sentiment detection algorithm for social media that classifies the polarity of sentence phrases as positive, negative, or neutral and test its performance in Twitter through the participation in the expression level task (subtask A) of the SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al., 2013) which the authors helped organize.",
        "To do so, we build on previous work on sentiment detection algorithms for the more formal news genre, notably the work of Agarwal et al. (2009), but adapt it for the language of social media, in particular Twitter.",
        "We show that exploiting lexical-stylistic features and dictionaries geared toward social media are useful in detecting sentiment.",
        "In this rest of this paper, we discuss related work, including the state of the art sentiment system (Agarwal et al., 2009) our method is based on, the lexicons we used, our method, and experiments and results."
