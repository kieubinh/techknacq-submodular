        "Sentiment Analysis is a growing research field, especially on web social networks.",

        "The ability to tap on a vast repository of opinions, such as Twitter, where there is great diversity of topics, has become an important goal for many different applications.",
        "However, due to the nature of the text, NLP systems face additional challenges in this context.",
        "Shared messages, such as tweets, are very short and users tend to resort to highly informal an noisy speech.",
        "Following this trend, the 2013 edition of SemEval1 included a sentiment analysis on Twitter task (SemEval-2013 Task 2).",
        "Participants were asked to implement a system capable of determining whether a given tweet expresses positive, negative or neutral sentiment.",
        "To help in the development of the system, an annotated training corpus was released.",
        "Systems that used only the given corpus for training were considered constrained, while others were considered unconstrained.",
        "The submitted prototypes were evaluated in a dataset consisting of around 3700 tweets of several topics.",
        "The metric used was the average F-score between the positive and negative classes.",
        "Our goal with this participation was to create a baseline system from which we can build upon and perform experiments to compare new approaches with the state-of-the-art."

        "The uneven distribution of classes in the data may have also contributed to the low performance of the classifier.",
        "Although the neutral class was not considered in the evaluation, the datasets had a great predominance of neutral messages whereas the negative examples only accounted for 15% of the corpus.",
        "This suggests that it could be useful to use a minority class oversampling method, such as SMOTE (Chawla, 2002), to reduce the effect of this imbalance on the data.",
        "We used n-grams to model the words that compose each message.",
        "However, this approach leads to very sparse representations, thus becoming important to consider techniques that reduce feature space.",
        "We experimented with PCA, without success, but we still believe that applying feature selection algorithms or denser word representations (Turian et al., 2010) could improve performance in this task.",
        "We find that our classifier performs better on the SMS dataset.",
        "This might be explained by the fact that SMS messages tend to be more direct, whereas the same tweet can express, or show signs of, contradictory sentiments.",
        "In fact, our naive approach outperforms other systems that had better results in the Twitter dataset, but it is difficult to say why, given that we do not have access to the SMS test set annotations.",
        "Despite the poor ranking results, we achieved our goal of performing basic experiments in the task of sentiment analysis in Twitter and developed a baseline system that will serve as a starting point for future research."
