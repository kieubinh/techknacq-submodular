        "SAS taxonomies for sentiment analysis are primarily topic-focused.",
        "They are designed to track sentiment around brands, entities, or other topics and subtopics in a domain (Lange and Sethi, 2011; Lakkaraju and Sethi, 2012; Albright and Lakkaraju, 2011).",
        "Domain-independent taxonomies have a second function.",
        "In addition to performing topic-focused tasks, they can be set up to perform sentiment analysis at the document level, classifying the whole document as positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "In this task all sentiment expressions are taken into account, rather than only those which are related to the tracked topic.",
        "This second function is becoming increasingly important.",
        "It allows for a broader perspective that is complementary to topic-focused opinion mining.",
        "We participated in both subtask A and B of SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al., 2013) with an adaptation of our existing system.",
        "For task B, identifying the overall sentiment of a tweet, our taxonomy mainly needed some fine-tuning to specifically accommodate Twitter data.",
        "(Normally tweets only make up a small part of the data we work with.)",
        "We also made a few adaptations to focus entirely on document level sentiment, whereas originally the main focus of our system was on tracking sentiment around products.",
        "For task A, identifying the sentiment of ambiguous phrases in a tweet, a few more modifications were needed.",
        "Our system is entirely rule-based, and the rules are hand-written.",
        "In some cases, statistical text mining approaches are used for the discovery of topics and terms to facilitate rule writing.",
        "Our sentiment analysis software does offer a statistical component, but our experience is that purely rule-based models work better for our typical sentiment analysis tasks.",
        "Advantages of rules are that problems observed in the output can be targeted directly, and the model can become more and more refined over time.",
        "Also, they allow for simple customization.",
        "In our brand-centered work, we customize our taxonomies for one or more brands that we want to track.",
        "When we build a taxonomy for a new domain, we build upon work we have done before in other domains.",
        "The assignment of sentiment to certain phrases can be sensitive to context where it needs to be.",
        "The canceled task C, identifying sentiment related to a topic, could have been approached successfully with a rule-based approach, as our rules are specifically designed to connect sentiment to targeted topics.",
        "Section 2 describes the basic architecture of our system, followed by a section on related work.",
        "Then sections 4 and 5 describe the adaptations made for",
        "each subtask and present the results.",

        "We build the taxonomy with the terms we encounter in those documents, and test on a new set of documents.",
        "The Domain Independent taxonomy started out as the common base derived from several of these taxonomies, and was then built out and tested using a wider range of English-language documents.",
        "Since we used some other tweets in the development of the original system, our submission is considered unconstrained.",
        "Our rules are patterns that match words or sequences of words, which makes our approach essentially lexicon-based.",

        "rules at that level that block the assignment of positive or negative sentiment in certain cases.",
        "A positive or negative sequence can consist of a single word from the positive or negative word-lists, or a spelled out phrase from the positive or negative phrase-lists.",
        "Alternatively, it can be built up out of multiple components, for example an emphatic modifier and a sentiment term, or a negation and a sentiment term.",

        "[sic], ?not exactly the most?, etc., and PositiveAdjectives contains a rule that matches words in PositiveWords if they are also tagged as adjectives.",
        "For efficiency reasons the dependencies cannot be circular, hence not allowing for recursion.",
        "Distance rules can be used to capture a longer span, matching a specified pattern at the beginning and at the end, including arbitrary intervening words up to a specified number.",
        "They can also be used to make matching a term dependent on specified terms in the context.",

        "a{ def{HigherIsBetter}}?, ?",
