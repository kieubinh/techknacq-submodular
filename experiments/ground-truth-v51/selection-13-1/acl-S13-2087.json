        "In recent years there has been a huge growth in popularity of vaious social media microblogging platforms like Twitter.",
        "Users freely share their personal opinions on various events and entities on these platforms.",
        "However, while character constraints make sure the opinions are short and to the point, they also contribute to the noisy nature of Twitter data.",
        "The contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity.",
        "Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa.",
        "Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment.",
        "This is evident from the example of underlined phrase in the following tweet: Lana Del Rey at Hammersmith Apollo in May...Very badly want tickets In a technique with large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity, badly would have a negative score making the whole sentence with negative sentiment.",
        "Even if we perform phrase-level analysis for the phrase ?Very badly?, Very only acts as an intensifier for badly and the whole sentence is still marked negative.",
        "It's only when we look further from the underlined phrase that we realize that ?Very badly?",
        "in the context of wanting something shows positive sentiment.",
        "Early work on sentiment analysis is based on document-level analysis of reviews (Pang, B., and Lee, L., 2004).",
        "This approach isn't feasible for mi-croblogging data due to the extremely small size of individual documents.",
        "The results on the effectiveness of part-of-speech features are mixed.",
        "While most regard POS features helpful in subjectivity classification (Barbosa, L. and Feng, J., 2010), some report very insignificant improvement on using them (Kouloumpis, E., Wilson, T. and Moore, J., 2011).",
        "However, most phrase-level approaches began with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (Kim, S. M., and Hovy, E., 2004; Hu, M., and Liu, B, 2004).",
        "Wilson, Wiebe and Hoffman (2005) sought to include contextual polarity in the foray by using various dependency relation based features for subjectivity and polarity classification.",
        "Our goal is to perform contextual sentiment polarity classification in the domain of noisy expressions from tweets and SMS messages."
