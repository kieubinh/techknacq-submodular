        "During the last years, Twitter has become a very popular microblogging service.",
        "Millions of users publish messages every day, often expressing their feelings or opinion about a variety of events, topics, products, etc.",
        "Analysing this kind of content has drawn the attention of many companies and researchers, as it can lead to useful information for fields, such as personalized marketing or social profiling.",
        "The informal language, the spelling mistakes, the slang and special abbreviations that are frequently used in tweets differentiate them from traditional texts, such as articles or reviews, and present new challenges for the task of sentiment analysis.",
        "The Message Polarity Classification is defined as the task of deciding whether a message M conveys a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.",
        "For instance M1 below expresses a positive sentiment, M2 a negative one, while M3 has no sentiment at all.",
        "M1: GREAT GAME GIRLS!!",
        "On to districts Monday at Fox!!",
        "Thanks to the fans for coming out :) M2: Firework just came on my tv and I just broke down and sat and cried, I need help okay M3: Going to a bulls game with Aaliyah & hope next Thursday As sentiment analysis in Twitter is a very recent subject, it is certain that more research and improvements are needed.",
        "This paper presents our approach for the subtask of Message Polarity Classification (Wilson et al., 2013) of SEMEVAL 2013.",
        "We used a 2-stage pipeline approach employing a linear SVM classifier at each stage and several features including bag of words (BOW) features, part-of-speech (POS) based features and lexicon based features.",
        "We have also experimented with Naive Bayes classifiers trained with BOW features.",

        "Section 2 provides a short analysis of the data used while section 3 describes our approach.",

        "In order to address privacy concerns, rather than releasing the original Tweets, the organisers chose to provide a python script for downloading the data.",

        "unavailable due to a number of reasons.",
        "Concerning the development and test sets the organisers downloaded and provided the tweets.",
        "1 A first analysis of the data indicates that they suffer from a class imbalance problem.",
        "Specifically the training data we have downloaded contain 8730 tweets (3280 positive, 1289 negative, 4161 neutral), while the development set contains 1654 tweets (575 positive, 340 negative, 739 neutral).",

        "The system we propose is a 2?stage pipeline procedure employing SVM classifiers (Vapnik, 1998) to detect whether each message M expresses positive, negative or no sentiment (figure 2).",

        "If so, M is called ?subjective?, otherwise it is called ?objective?",
        "or ?neutral?.2 Each subjective message is then classified in a second stage as ?positive?",
        "or ?negative?.",
        "Such a 2?stage approach has also been suggested in (Pang and Lee, 2004) to improve sentiment classification of reviews by discarding objective sentences, in (Wilson et al., 2005a) for phrase-level sentiment analysis, and in (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) for sentiment analysis on Twitter messages.",

        "No training and development data were provided for this set.",

      "text": [
        "Before we could proceed with feature engineering, we performed several preprocessing steps.",
        "To be more precise, a twitter specific tokeniser and part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Ritter et al., 2011) were used to obtain the tokens and the corresponding POS tags which are necessary for a particular set of features to be described later.",
        "In addition to these, six lexicons, originating from Wilson's (2005b) lexicon, were created.",
        "This lexicon contains expressions that given a context (i.e., surrounding words) indicate subjectivity.",
        "The expression that in most context expresses sentiment is considered to be ?strong?",
        "subjective, otherwise it is considered weak subjective (i.e., it has specific subjective usages).",
        "So, we first split the lexicon in two smaller, one containing strong and one containing weak subjective expressions.",
        "Moreover, Wilson also reports the polarity of each expression out of context (prior polarity) which can be positive, negative or neutral.",
        "As a consequence, we further split each of the two lexicons into three smaller according to the prior polarity of the expression, resulting to the following six lexicons: S+ : Contains strong subjective expressions with positive prior polarity.",
        "S?",
        ": Contains strong subjective expressions with negative prior polarity.",
        "S0 : Contains strong subjective expressions with neutral prior polarity.",

        "W?",
        ": Contains weak subjective expressions with negative prior polarity.",
        "W0 : Contains weak subjective expressions with neutral prior polarity.",
        "Adding to these, three more lexicons were created, one for each class (positive, negative, neutral).",
        "In particular, we employed Chi Squared feature selection (Liu and Setiono, 1995) to obtain the 100 most important tokens per class from the training set.",
        "Very few tokens were manually erased to result to the following three lexicons.",

        "We employed three types of features, namely boolean features, POS based features and lexicon based features.",
        "Our goal is to build a system that is not explicitly based on the vocabulary of the training set, having therefore better generalisation capability.",
        "Bag of words (BOW): These features indicate the existence of specific tokens in a message.",
        "We used feature selection with Info Gain to obtain the 600 most informative tokens of the training set and we then manually removed 19 of them",
        "to result in 581 tokens.",
        "As a consequence we get 581 features that can take a value of 1 if a message contains the corresponding token and 0 otherwise.",
        "Time and date: We observed that time and date often indicated events in the train data and such messages tend to be objective.",
        "Therefore, we added two more features to indicate if a message contains time and/or date expressions.",
        "Character repetition: Repetitive characters are often added to words by users, in order to give emphasis or to express themselves more intensely.",
        "As a consequence they indicate subjectivity.",
        "So we added one more feature having a value of 1 if a message contains words with repeating characters and 0 otherwise.",
        "Negation: Negation not only is a good subjectivity indicator but it also may change the polarity of a message.",
        "We therefore add 5 more features, one indicating the existence of negation, and the remaining four indicating the existence of negation that precedes (in a distance of at most 5 tokens) words from lexicons S+, S?, W+ and W?.",
        "Hash-tags with sentiment: These features are implemented by getting all the possible sub-strings of the string after the symbol # and checking if any of them match with any word from S+, S?, W+ and W?",
        "(4 features).",
        "A value of 1 means that a hash-tag containing a word from the corresponding lexicon exists in a message.",
        "Specific POS tags might be good indicators of subjectivity or objectivity.",
        "For instance adjectives often express sentiment (e.g., beautiful, frustrating) while proper nouns are often reported in objective messaged.",
        "We, therefore, added 10 more features based on the following POS tags:",
        "1. adjectives, 2. adverbs, 3. verbs, 4. nouns, 5. proper nouns, 6. urls, 7. interjections, 8. hash-tags, 9. happy emoticons, and 10. sad emoticons.",
        "We then constructed our features as follows.",
        "For each message we counted the occurrences of tokens with these POS tags and we divided this number with the number of tokens having any of these POS tags.",
        "For instance if a message contains 2 adjectives,",
        "and 14 respectively while all the remaining features will be 0.",
        "These features can be thought of as a way to express how much specific POS tags affect the sentiment of a message.",
        "Going a step further we calculate precision (P (b, c)), recall (R(b, c)) and F ?",
        "measure (F1(b, c)) of POS tags bigrams with respect to each class (equations 4, 5 and 6 respectively).",

        "#tweets that contain bigram b and belong to class c #tweets that belong to class c",
        "For each bigram (e.g., adjective-noun) in a message we calculate F1(b, c) and then we use the average, the maximum and the minimum of these values to create 9 additional features.",
        "We did not experiment over measures that weight differently Precision and Recall (e.g., Fb for b = 0.5) or with different combinations (e.g., F1 and P ).",
        "3.2.3 Lexicon based features This set of features associates the words of the lexicons described earlier with the three classes.",
        "Given a message M , similarly to the equations 4 and",
        "6 above, we calculate P (t, c) and F1(t, c) for every token t ?",
        "M with respect to a lexicon.",
        "We then obtain the maximum, minimum and average values of P (t, c) and F1(t, c) in M .",

        "Also, similarly to section 3.2.2 we did not experiment over measures that weight differently Precision and Recall (e.g., Fb for b = 0.5).",

        "(b) Using words and priors: The same as (a) but adding to the calculated metrics a prior value.",
        "This value is calculated on the entire lexicon, and roughly speaking it is an indicator of how much we can trust L to predict class c. In cases that a token t of a message M does not appear in a lexicon L the corresponding scores of the metrics will be 0.",
        "(c) Using words and their POS tags: The values of the metrics consider the words of the message along with their POS tags.",
        "(d) Using words, their POS tags and priors: The same as (c) but adding to the calculated metrics an apriori value.",
