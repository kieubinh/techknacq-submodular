        "Automatically assessing student answers is a challenging natural language processing task (NLP).",

        "More specifically, given a question, a known correct ?reference answer?",
        "and a 1 or 2-sentence student answer, the goal is to determine the student's answer accuracy (Dzikovska et al., 2013).",
        "This can be seen as a paraphrase identification problem between student answers and reference answers.",
        "Paraphrase identification searches whether two sentences have essentially the same meaning (Culi-cover, 1968).",
        "Automatically generating or extracting semantic equivalences for the various units of language ?",
        "words, phrases, and sentences ?",
        "is an important problem in NLP and is being increasingly employed to improve the performance of several NLP applications (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), like question-answering and machine translation.",
        "Paraphrase identification would benefit from a precise and broad-coverage semantic language model.",
        "This is unfortunately difficult to obtain to its full extent for any natural language, due to the size of a typical lexicon and the complexity of grammatical constructions.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the simpler the language lexicon is, the easier it will be to access and compare meaning of sentences.",
        "This assumption is justified by the multiple attempts at controlled natural languages (Schwitter, 2010) and especially simplified forms of English.",
        "One of them, Basic English (Ogden, 1930), has been adopted by the Wikipedia Project as the preferred language of the Simple English Wikipedia1 and its sister project the Simple English Wiktionary2.",
        "Our method starts with acquiring paraphrases from the Simple English Wiktionary's definitions.",
        "Using those, we generate variants of both sentences whose meanings are to be compared.",
        "Finally, we compute traditional lexical and semantic similarity measures on those two sets of variants to produce features to train a classifier on the SemEval 2013 datasets in order to take the final decision.",
        "simplified language, they often prefer to give a complete sentence where the word ?",
        "e.g. a verb ?",
        "is used in context, along with an explanation of what it means.",
        "To define the verb link, Simple Wiktionary states that If you link two or more things, you make a connection between them (1), whereas the standard Wiktionary uses the shorter and more cryptic To connect two or more things.",
        "We notice in this example that the definition from Simple Wiktionary consists of two clauses, linked by a subordination relation.",
        "It's actually the case for a lot of verb definitions: a quick statistical study shows that 70% of these definitions are composed of two clauses, an independent clause, and a subordinate clause (often an adverbial clause).",
        "One clause illustrates how the verb is used, the other gives the explanation and the actual dictionary definition, as in example (1).",
