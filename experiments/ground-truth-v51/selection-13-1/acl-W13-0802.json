        "The present finding is due to some issue of sociolinguistics phenomenon called digraphia - a case of Manipuri language (a resource constrained Indian languages spoken mainly in the state of Manipur) using two different scripts namely Bengali script1",
        "and Meetei Mayek2.",
        "Meetei Mayek (MM) is the original script which was used until the 18th century to represent Manipuri text.",
        "Its earliest use is dated between the 11th and 12th centuries CE3.",
        "Manipuri language is recognized by the Indian Union and has been included in the list of 8th scheduled languages by the 71st amendment of the constitution in 1992.",
        "In the recent times, the Bengali script is getting replaced by Meetei Mayek at schools, government departments and other administrative activities.",
        "It may be noted that Manipuri is the only Tibeto-Burman language which has its own script.",
        "Digraphia has implications in language technology as well despite the issues of language planning, language policy and language ideology.",
        "There are several examples of languages written in one script that was replaced later by another script.",
        "Some of the examples are Romanian which originally used Cyrillic then changed to Latin; Turkish and Swahili began with the Arabic then Latin, and many languages of former Soviet Central Asia, which abandoned the Cyrillic script after the dissolution of the USSR.",
        "The present study is a typical case where the natural language processing of an Indian language is affected in case of switching script.",
        "Manipuri is a monosyllabic, morphologically rich and highly agglutinative in nature.",
        "Tone is very prominent.",
        "So, a special treatment of these tonal words is absolutely necessary.",
        "Manipuri language has 6 vowels and their tone counterparts and",
        "Manipuri learner should know its tone system and the corresponding word meaning.",
        "Natural language processing tasks for Manipuri language is at the initial phase.",
        "We use a small parallel corpus and a sizable monolingual corpus collected from Manipuri news to develop English-Manipuri statistical machine translation system.",
        "The Manipuri news texts are in Bengali script.",
        "So, we carry out transliteration from Bengali script to Meetei Mayek as discussed in section 3.",
        "Typically, transliteration is carried out between two different languages ?one as a source and the other as a target.",
        "But, in our case, in order to kick start the MT system development, Bengali script (in which most of the digital Manipuri text are available) to Meetei Mayek transliteration is carried out using different models.",
        "The performance of the rule based transliteration is improved by integrating the conjunct and syllable handling module in the present rule based task along with transliteration unit (TU).",
        "However, due to the tonal characteristic of this language, there is loss of accents for the tonal words when getting translated from Bengali script.",
        "In other words, there is essence of intonation in Manipuri text; the differentiation between Bengali characters such as ?",
        "(i) and ?",
        "(ee) or ?",
        "(u) and ?",
        "(oo) cannot be made using Meetei Mayek.",
