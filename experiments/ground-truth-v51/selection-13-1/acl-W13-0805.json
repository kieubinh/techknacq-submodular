        "One of the main difficulties in statistical machine translation (SMT) is presented by the different word orders between languages.",
        "Most state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems handle it within phrase pairs or during decoding by allowing words to be swapped while translation hypotheses are generated.",
        "An additional reordering model might be included in the log-linear model of translation.",
        "However, these methods can cover reorderings only over a very limited distance.",
        "Recently, reordering as preprocessing has drawn much attention.",
        "The idea is to detach the reordering problem from the decoding process and to apply a reordering model prior to translation in order to facilitate a monotone translation.",
        "Encouraged by the improvements that can be achieved with part-of-speech (POS) reordering rules (Niehues and Kolss, 2009; Rottmann and Vogel, 2007), we apply such rules on a different linguistic level.",
        "We abstract from the words in the sentence and learn reordering rules based on syntactic constituents in the source language sentence.",
        "Syntactic parse trees represent the sentence structure and show the relations between constituents in the sentence.",
        "Relying on syntactic constituents instead of POS tags should help to model the reordering task more reliably, since sentence constituents are moved as whole blocks of words, thus keeping the sentence structure intact.",
        "In addition, we combine the POS-based and syntactic tree-based reordering models and also add a lexicalized reordering model, which is used in many state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems nowadays."

        "Long-range reorderings are addressed by manual rules (Collins et al., 2005) or using automatically learned rules (Niehues and Kolss, 2009).",
