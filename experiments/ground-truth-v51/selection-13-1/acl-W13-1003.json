        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) cause particular lexical choice problems in machine translation (MT), but can also be seen as an opportunity to both generalize outside the bilingual corpora often used as training data in statistical machine translation approaches and as a method to adapt to specific domains.",
        "The identification of MWEs is in general important for many language processing tasks (Sag et al., 2002), but can be crucial in MT: since the semantics of many MWEs are non-compositional, a suitable translation cannot be constructed by translating the words in isolation.",
        "Identifying MWEs can help to identify idiomatic or otherwise fixed language usage, leading to more fluent translations, and potentially reduce the amount of lexical choice an MT system faces during target language generation.",
        "In any translation effort, automatic or otherwise, the selection of target language lexical items to include in the translation is a crucial part of the final translation quality.",
        "In rule-based systems lexical choice is derived from the semantics of the source words, a process which often involves complex semantic composition.",
        "Data-driven systems on the other hand commonly base their translations nearly exclusively on cooccurrences of bare words or phrases in bilingual corpora, leaving the responsibility of selecting lexical items in the translation entirely to the local context found in phrase translation tables and language models with no explicit notion of the source or target language semantics.",
        "Still, systems of this type have been shown to produce reasonable translation quality without explicitly considering word translation disambiguation.",
        "Bilingual corpora are scarce, however, and unavailable for most language pairs and target domains.",
        "An alternative approach is to build systems based on large monolingual knowledge sources and bilingual lexica, as in the hybrid MT system PRE-SEMT (Sofianopoulos et al., 2012).",
        "Since such a system explicitly uses a translation dictionary, it must at some point in the translation process decide which lexical entries to use; thus a separate word translation disambiguation module needs to be incorporated.",
        "To research available methods in such a module we have identified a task where we can use public datasets for measuring how well a method is able to select the optimal of many translation choices from a source language sentence.",
        "In phrase-based statistical MT systems, the translation of multiword expressions can be a notable source of errors, despite the fact that those systems explicitly recognize and use alignments of sequential chunks of words.",
        "Several researchers have approached this problem by adding MWE translation tables to the systems, either through expanding the phrase tables (Ren et al., 2009) or by injecting the MWE translations into the decoder (Bai et al., 2009).",
        "Furthermore, there has been some interest in automatic mining of MWE pairs from bilingual corpora as a task in itself: Caseli et al. (2010) used a dictionary for evaluation of an automatic MWE extraction procedure using bilingual corpora.",
        "They also argued for the filtering of stopwords, similarly to the procedure described in the present paper.",
        "Sharoff et al. (2006) showed how MWE pairs can be extracted from comparable monolingual corpora instead of from a parallel bilingual corpus.",
        "The methodology introduced in this paper employs bilingual dictionaries as a source of multiword expressions.",
        "Relationships are induced between the source sentence and candidate translation lexical items based on their correspondence in the dictionary.",
        "Specifically, we use a deterministic multiword expression disambiguation procedure based on translation dictionaries in both directions (from source to target language and vice versa), and a baseline system that ranks target lexical items based on their immediate context and an n-gram language model.",
        "The n-gram model represents a high-coverage, low-precision companion to the dictionary approach (i.e., it has complementary properties).",
        "Results show that the MWE dictionary information substantially improves the baseline system.",
        "The 2010 Semantic Evaluation exercise (SemEval?10) featured a shared task on Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (CL-WSD), where the focus was on disambiguating the translation of a single noun in a sentence.",
        "The participating systems were given an English word in its context and asked to produce appropriate substitutes in another language (Lefever and Hoste, 2010b).",
        "The CL-WSD data covers Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian and German; however, since the purpose of the experiments in this paper just was to assess our method's ability to choose the right translation of a word given its context, we used the English-to-German part only.",
        "The next section details the employed disambiguation methodology and describes the data sets used in the experiments.",
        "Section 3 then reports on the results of experiments applying the methodology to the SemEval datasets, particularly addressing the impact of the dictionary MWE correspondences.",
        "Finally, Section 4 sums up the discussion and points to issues that can be investigated further."

        "The core of the disambiguation model introduced in this paper is dictionary-based multiword extraction.",
        "Multiword extraction is done in both a direct and indirect manner: Direct extraction uses adjacent words in the source language in combination with the word to be translated, if the combination has an entry in the source-to-target language (SL?TL) dictionary.",
        "Indirect extraction works in the reverse direction, by searching the target-to-source (TL?SL) dictionary and looking up translation candidates for the combined words.",
        "Using a dictionary to identify multiword expressions after translation has a low recall of target language MWEs, since often there either are no multiword expressions to be discovered, or the dictionary method is unable to find a translation for an MWE.",
        "Nevertheless, when an MWE really is identified by means of the dictionary-based method, the precision is high.",
        "Due to the low recall, relying on multiword expressions from dictionaries would, however, not be sufficient.",
        "Hence this method is combined with an n-gram language model (LM) based on a large target language corpus.",
        "The LM is used to rank translation candidates according to the probability of the n-gram best matching the context around the translation candidate.",
        "This is a more robust but less precise approach, which servers as the foundation for the high-precision but low-recall dictionary approach.",
        "In the actual implementation, the n-gram method thus first provides a list of its best suggestions (currently top-5), and the dictionary method then prepends its candidates to the top of this list.",
        "Consequently, n-gram matching is described before dictionary-based multiword extraction in the following section.",

        "As can be seen in Table 7, the vector space model produced the overall best score for a single term.",
        "However, the method combining a 5-gram language model with the dictionary approach was best both at avoiding really low scores for any single term and when comparing the mean scores for all the terms."

        "The extended use of dictionaries proves a valuable source of information for disambiguation, and can introduce low-cost phrase-level translation to quantitative Word Sense Disambiguation approaches such as N-gram or Vector Space Model methods, often lacking the phrases-based dimension.",
        "The results show clear differences between the source and target language methods of using dictionary lookups, where the former has very high precision (0.84) but low coverage, while the TL method compensates lower precision (0.51) with markedly better coverage.",
        "The SL dictionary method provided answers to only between 1.5 and 3.25 of 50 instances per word on average, depending on the dictionary.",
        "This owes largely to the differences in algorithms, where the TL method matches any adjacent lemma to the focus word with the translation of the predefined translation candidates, whereas the SL method matches dictionaries of the combined lemmata of the focus word and its adjacent words to the same list of translation candidates.",
        "False positives are expected with lower constraints such as these.",
        "On the SemEval data, the contribution of the dictionary methods to the n-grams is mostly in improving the average score.",
        "The idea of acquiring lexical information from corpora is of course not new in itself.",
        "So did, e.g., Rapp (1999) use vector-space models for the purpose of extracting ranked lists of translation candidates for extending a dictionary for word translation disambiguation.",
        "Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) tried to identify translational equivalences by investigating the relations between target and source language word distributions in a restricted domain, and also applied reverse-translation filtering for improved performance, while Sadat et al. (2003) utilised non-aligned, comparable corpora to induce a bilingual lexicon, using a bidirectional method (SL?TL, TL?SL, and a combination of both).",
        "Extending the method to use an arbitrary size window around all words in the context of each focus word (not just the word itself) could identify more multiword expressions and generate a more accurate bag-of-words for a data-driven approach.",
        "Differences between dictionaries could also be explored, giving more weight to translations found in two or more dictionaries.",
        "Furthermore, the differences between the SL and TL methods could explored further, investigating in detail the consequences of using a symmetrical dictionary, in order to study the effect that increased coverage has on results.",
        "Testing the idea on more languages will help verify the validity of these findings."
