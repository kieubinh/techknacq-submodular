        "In the broadest sense a cliche?",
        "is a tired, overused, unoriginal idea, whether it be in music, in the visual arts, in the plot of a novel or drama, or in the language of literature, journalism, or rhetoric.",
        "Here, we are interested only in cliche's of linguistic form.",
        "Cliche's are overused, unoriginal expressions that appear in a context where something more novel might have reasonably been expected, or which masquerade as something more original, more novel, or more creative than they actually are.",
        "A cliche?",
        "is a kind of ersatz novelty or creativity that is, ipso facto, unwelcome or deprecated by the reader.",
        "Cliche's appear to be intuitively recognized by readers, but are difficult to define more formally.",
        "Cliche's are predominantly multiword expressions (MWEs) and are closely related to the idea of formulaic language, which for Wray (2002, 2008, summarized in 2009) is a psycholinguistic phenomenon: a formula is stored and retrieved as a single prefabricated unit, without deeper semantic analysis, even if it is made up of meaningful smaller units and regardless of whether it is or isn't semantically transparent.",
        "She demonstrates that formulaic language is a heterogeneous phenomenon, encompassing many types of MWEs including fixed expressions (Sag et al., 2002, e.g., whys and wherefores), semi-fixed expressions (e.g., hoist with/by his own petard ?injured by that with which he would injure others?",
        "), and syntactically-flexible expressions (e.g., sb1 haul sb2 over the coals ?reprimand severely?, allowing also the passive sb2 was hauled over the coals (by sb1)).",
        "Formulaic language can exhibit any of the types of idiomaticity required by Baldwin and Kim (2010) for an expression to be considered an MWE, i.e., lexical (de rigueur), syntactic (time and again), semantic (fly off the handle ?lose one's temper?",
        "), pragmatic (nice to see you), and statistical idiomaticity (which many of the previous examples also exhibit).",
        "Another theme relating formulaic language to MWEs is that of a common or preferred (though not necessarily invariable) way for native speakers to express an idea, i.e., institutionalization; for example, felicitations to someone having a birthday are usually expressed as happy birthday or (largely in British English) many happy returns rather than any of the many other semantically similar possibilities (#merry birthday; cf. merry Christmas).",
        "However, formulaic language, including cliche?s, goes beyond the typical view of MWEs in that it has a cultural aspect as well as a purely linguistic aspect, as it includes catchphrases and allusions to language in popular culture, such as well-known",
        "lines from songs, jokes, advertisements, books, and movies (curiouser and curiouser from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; go ahead, make my day ?I dare you to attack me or do something bad, for if you do I will take great pleasure in defeating and punishing you?",
        "from the 1983 Clint Eastwood movie Sudden Impact).",
        "Furthermore, not all formulaic language is cliche?d; a weather forecast, for example, has no pretensions of being linguistically creative or original, but it would be a mistake to think of it as cliche?d, no matter how formulaic it might be.",
        "Conversely, a cliche?",
        "might not be formulaic from Wray's psycholinguistic perspective ?",
        "stored and recognized as a single unit ?",
        "even if its occurrence is at least frequent enough in relevant contexts for it to be recognized as familiar, trite, and unoriginal.",
        "Finally, not all MWEs are cliche?s.",
        "Verb?particle constructions such as look up (?seek information in a resource?)",
        "and clear out are common expressions, but aren't unoriginal in the sense of being tired and over-used.",
        "Moreover, they are not attempts at creativity.",
        "On the other hand, cliche's are typically MWEs.",
        "Some particularly long cliche?s, however, are more prototypical of proverbs than MWEs (e.g., the grass is always greener on the other side).",
        "Single words can also be trite and over-used, although this tends to be strongly context dependent.",
        "This paper identifies cliche's as an understudied problem closely related to many issues of interest to the MWE community.",
        "We propose a preliminary method for assessing the degree to which a text is cliche?d, and then show how such a method can contribute to literary analysis.",
        "Specifically, we apply this approach to James Joyce's novel Ulysses to offer insight into the ongoing literary debate about the use of cliche's in this work."

        "Their method combines information about rhymes and the df-idf of trigrams (tf-idf, but using document frequency instead of term frequency) in song lyrics.",
        "However, this method isn't applicable for our goal of determining how cliche?d an arbitrary text is with a focus on literary analysis, because in this case rhyming is not a typical feature of the texts.",

        "lexicon would be required for this approach.",

        "Methods based on strength of association ?",
        "applied to n-grams or words co-occurring through some other relation such as syntactic dependency (see Evert, 2008, for an overview) ?",
        "could be applied to extract a wider range of MWEs, although here most research has focused on two-word co-occurrences, with considerably less attention paid to longer MWEs.",
        "Even if general-purpose MWE extraction were a solved problem, methods would still be required to distinguish between MWEs that are and aren't cliche?s."

        "Frequency per se is not a necessary or defining criterion of formulaic language.",

        "Nevertheless in a very large corpus we?d expect a formulaic expression to be more frequent than a more-creative expression suitable in the same context.",
        "Viewing cliche's as a type of formulaic language, we hypothesized that a highly-cliche?d text will tend to contain more n-grams whose frequency in an external corpus is medium or high than a less-cliche?d text of the same size.",
        "We compared a text known to contain many cliche's to more-standard text.",

        "For each 1?5-gram type in each document (i.e., in the sample of cliche's and in the sample of sentences from the BNC), we counted its frequency in an external corpus, the Web 1T 5-gram Corpus (Web 1T, Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "Histograms for the frequencies are shown in Figure 1.",

        "not merely due to simple differences in word frequency.",
        "For the 3?5-grams, the light areas show that the cliche's contain many more n-gram types with medium or high frequency in Web 1T than the sample of sentences from the BNC.",
        "For each of the 3?5- grams, the types in the sample of cliche's are significantly more frequent than those in the BNC using a Wilcoxon rank sum test (p 0.001).",
