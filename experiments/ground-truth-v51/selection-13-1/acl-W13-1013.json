        "As it is widely known, the lexicon does not consist mainly of simple lexical items but appears to be populated with numerous chunks, more or less predictable, though not fixed (Firth, 1955).",
        "In fact, the development of computer technologies and corpus-based approaches has enabled the identification of complex patterns of word associations, proving that the speakers use a large number of preconstructed phrases that constitute single choices (Sinclair, 1991:110).",
        "Several studies have also shown that great part of a speaker's lexicon is composed by these word associations (Jackendoff, 1997; Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "These multiword expressions (MWE)1 appear in every kind of spoken and",
        "The term multiword expression will be used to refer to any sequence of words that act as a single unit, embracing all different types of word combinations (collocations, compound nouns, light verbs, institutionalized phrases, idioms, etc.).",
        "written discourse and, despite the fact that they don't pose any problems from the speaker's point of view (we easily recognize that they function as a single unit that may have a specific meaning), natural language processing (NLP) applications, on the other hand, find notorious difficulties when dealing with them (Sag et al., 2000).",
        "Bearing in mind the extreme importance of the study of this linguistic phenomenon for the improvement of NLP systems, this paper will address an ongoing analysis that aims to create a typology for MWE in Portuguese (based on a MWE lexicon previously extracted from a 50 million word written corpus) that will be used to enrich that lexicon with extensive information regarding these expressions.",
        "This annotated lexicon will be a resource that will allow for the annotation of these expressions in running text (Hendrickx et al., 2010a).",
        "This presentation will briefly discuss compilation of the lexicon and the methodology adopted for MWE selection and organization (section 2), the typology based on syntactic, semantic and statistic criteria (section 3), the annotation proposal of the lexicon (section 4) and applications of the work (section 5)."

        "Regarding the latest aspect, the expressions may be: (i) fixed (no variation); (ii) semi-fixed (nominal/verbal inflection)7; (iii) with variation: lexical (permutation, replacement of elements, insertion of modifiers) and/or syntactic (constructions with passives, relatives, pronouns, extraction, adjectival vs. prepositional modifiers).",
