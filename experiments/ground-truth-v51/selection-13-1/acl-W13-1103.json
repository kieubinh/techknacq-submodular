        "SumBasic (Vanderwende et al., 2007) is a simple and effective summarization approach based on term frequency, which we use as our baseline.",
        "It uses word probabilities with an update function to avoid redundancy to select sentences or posts in a social media setting.",
        "It is shown to outperform three other well-known multi-document summarization methods, namely LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and MEAD (Radev et al., 2004) on tweets in (Inouye and Kalita, 2011), possibly because that the relationship between tweets is much simpler than between sentences in news articles and can be well captured by simple frequency methods.",
        "The improvement over the LexRank model on tweets is gained by considering the number of retweets and influential users is another side-proof (Wei et al., 2012) of the effectiveness of frequency.",

      "text": [
        "We performed a human evaluation in which two annotators were asked to rate the system on a five-point scale (1=very poor, 5=very good) for completeness and compactness.",
        "Completeness refers to how well the summary cover the important content in the tweets.",
        "Compactness refers to how much meaningful and non-redundant information is in the summary.",
        "Because the tweets were collected according to information extraction results and ranked by salience, the readability of summaries generated by different systems are generally very good.",
        "The top 38 events of January 16, 2013 are used as test set.",
        "The aggregate results of the human evaluation are displayed in Figure 5.",
        "Agreement between annotators measured using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is 0.59, 0.62, 0.62 respectively for compactness, completeness and overall judgements.",
        "Results suggest that the models described in this paper produce more satisfactory results as the baseline approaches.",
        "The improvement of EventRank-Flexible over SumBasic is significant (two-tailedp < 0.05) for all three metrics according to student's t test.",
        "Example summaries of the events in Figure 2, 3 and 4 are presented respectively in Table 3.",
        "The advantages of our method are the following: 1) it finds important facts of real-world events 2) it prefers tweets with good readability 3) it includes the right amount of information with diversity and without redundancy.",
        "For example, our system picked only one tweet about ?West Ham -1/16/2013?",
        "that convey the same message as the three tweets to",
        "gether of the baseline system.",
        "For another example, among the tweets about Google around 1/16/2013, users intensively talk about the Google doodle game with a very wide range of words creatively, giving word-based methods a hard time to pick up the diverse and essential event information that is less frequent."

        "The evaluation shows that information extraction techniques are helpful to generate newsworthy summaries of good readability from tweets.",
        "In the future, we are interested in improving the approach and evaluation, studying automatic metrics to evaluate summarization of variable length and getting involved in developing a standard evaluation for tweet summarization tasks.",
        "We wonder whether other graph partitioning algorithms may improve the performance.",
        "We also consider extending this graph-based approach to disambiguate named entities or resolve event coreference in Twitter data.",
        "Another direction of future work is to extend the proposed approach to different data, for example, temporal-aware clustered tweets etc."
