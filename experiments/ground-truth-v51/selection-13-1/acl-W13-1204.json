        "The focus of this paper is collecting data about certain characteristics of events found in text, in order to improve the performance of an Information Extraction (IE) system.",
        "IE is a technology used for locating and extracting specific pieces of information?or ?facts?",
        "?from unstructured natural-language text, by transforming the facts into abstract, structured objects, called events.",
        "In IE we assume that events represent real-world facts and the main objective is to extract them from plain text; the nature of the events themselves rarely receives in-depth attention in current research.",
        "Events may have various relationships to real-world facts, and different sources may have contradictory views on the facts, (Saur??",
        "and Pustejovsky, 2012).",
        "Similarly to many other linguistic units, an event is a combination of meaning and form; the structure and content of an event is influenced by both the structure of the corresponding real-world fact and by the properties of the surrounding text.",
        "We use the notion of scenario to denote a set of structured events of interest in a real-world domain: e.g., the MUC Management Succession scenario, (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), within the broader Business domain.",
        "The representation and the structure of events in text depends on the scenario.",
        "For example, Huttunen et al. (2002a; Huttunen et al. (2002b) points out that ?classic?",
        "MUC scenarios, such as Management Succession or Terrorist Attacks, describe events that occur in a specific point in time, whereas other scenarios like Natural Disaster or Disease Outbreak describe processes that are spread out across time and space.",
        "As a consequence, events in the latter, ?nature?-related scenarios are more complex, may have a hierarchical structure, and may overlap with each other in text.",
        "Linguistic cues that have been proposed in Huttunen et al. (2002a) to identify the overlapping or partial events include specific lexical items, locative and temporal expressions, and usage of ellipsis and anaphora.",
        "Grishman (2012) has emphasized that for fully unsupervised event extraction, extensive linguistic analysis is essential; such analysis should be able to capture ?modifiers on entities, including quantity and measure phrases and locatives; modifiers on predicates, including negation, aspect, quantity, and temporal information; and higher-order predicates, including sequence and causal relations and verbs of belief and reporting.?",
        "It is clear that such sophisticated linguistic analysis increases the importance of text style and genre for Information Extraction.",
        "The idea of statistical comparison between text types goes back at least as far as (Biber, 1991).",
        "It was subsequently used in a number of papers on automatic text categorization (Kessler et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2000; Petrenz and Webber, 2011).",
        "Szarvas et al. (2012) studied the linguistic cues indicating uncertainty of events in three genres: news, scientific papers and Wikipedia articles.",
        "They demonstrate significant differences in lexical usage across the genres; for example, such words as fear or worry may appear relatively often in news and Wikipedia, but almost never in scientific text.",
        "They also investigate differences in syntactic cues: for example, the relation between a proposition and a real-word fact is more likely to be expressed in the passive voice in scientific papers (it is expected), whereas in news the same words are more likely appear in the active.",
        "Because events are not only representations of facts but also linguistic units, an investigation of events should take into account the particular language, genre, scenario and medium of the text?i.e., events should be studied in the context of a particular corpus.",
        "Hence, the next question is how corpus-driven study of events should be organized in practice, or, more concretely, what particular statistics are needed to capture the scenario-specific characteristics of event representation in a particular corpus, and what kind of markup is necessary to solve this task.",
        "We believe that answers to these questions will likely depend on the ultimate goals of event detection.",
        "We investigate IE in the business domain?",
        "thus, we believe that preliminary study of the corpus should use exactly the same depth of linguistic analysis as would be later utilized by the IE system."

        "An ontology and lexicons are necessary to perform domain-specific analysis.",
        "We have discussed how the results of such analysis can be exploited for fine-tuning of a practical IE scenario.",

        "The approach outlined here for analyzing the distributions of features in documents is useful for studying events within the context of a corpus.",
        "It demonstrates that event structure depends on the text genre, and that genre differences can be easily captured and measured.",
        "By analyzing document statistics and the output of the pattern-mining, we can demonstrate significant differences between the genres of analyst reports and general news, such as: sentence length, distribution of the domain vocabulary in the text, selectional preference in domain-specific verbs, word co-occurrences, usage of pronouns and proper names.",
        "The pattern mining collects other statistical features, beyond those that have been discussed in detail above.",
        "For example, it showed that active voice is used in 95% of the cases in the news corpus in comparison to 88% in the analyst report corpus.",
        "It is also possible to count and compare the usage of other grammatical cues, such as verb tense, modality, etc.",
        "Thus, we should investigate not only lexical and semantic cues, but also broader syntactic preferences and selectional constrains in the corpora.",
        "In further research we plan to study how the formal representation of the genre differences can be used in practice, that is, for obtaining directly measurable improvements in the quality of event extraction.",
        "Taking into account the particular genre of the corpora from which documents are drawn will also have implications for the work on performance improvements via cross-document merging and inference, (Ji and Grishman, 2008; Yangarber, 2006).",
        "The frequency-based analysis described in Section 4.2 seems to be effective.",
        "Sharpening the results of the analysis as well as putting it to use in practical IE applications will be the subject of further study."
