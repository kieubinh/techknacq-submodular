        "Searching for poetry instances on the web, as well as identifying and extracting them, is a challenging problem.",
        "Contributing to the difficulty are the following: creators of web content do not usually follow a fixed standard format when publishing poetry content; there is no special HTML tags that can be used to identify and format poetry content; and finally poetry content is usually intermixed with other content published on the web.",
        "In this paper, a classical Arabic poetry recognition and extraction method has been proposed.",
        "The method utilizes poem features and writing styles to identify and isolate one or more poem text bodies in a given piece of text.",
        "As an implementation of the poetry recognition and extraction method, a prototype Arabic poetry search engine was developed.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, the related works are briefly discussed.",
        "Section 3 gives a general overview of Arabic poems features.",
        "Section 4 discusses the methodology used to identify and extract poem content from a given text.",

        "Work on poem processing has been also conducted on other topics such as poem style and meter classification, rhyme matching, poem generation and quality evaluation.",
        "For example, Yi",
        "et al (2004) used a technique based on term connection for poetry stylistics analysis.",
        "He et al. (2007) used Support Vector Machines to differentiate bold-and-unconstrained styles from graceful-and-restrained styles of poetry.",
        "Hamidi et al. (2009) proposed a meter classification system for Persian poems based on features that are extracted from uttered poems.",

        "Manurung (2004) and Netzer et al. (2009) proposed two poem generation methods using hill-climbing search and word associations norms, respectively.",
        "In a recent work, Kao and Jurafsky (2012) proposed a method to evaluate poem quality for contemporary English poetry.",
        "Their proposed method computes 16 features that describe poem style, imagery, and sentiment.",
