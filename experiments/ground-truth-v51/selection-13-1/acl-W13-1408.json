        "Repetition, that is, the reuse of a finite number of elements, is a fundamental characteristic of natural language.",
        "Thus, the words of a language are composed of a small number of phonemes or letters, sentences are constructed from repeated words, as well as larger collocational or syntactic chunks, and so on.",
        "Most work on repetition has been concerned with the study of such recurring formal elements, typically ?This research was supported in part by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",
        "from the perspective of their frequency.",
        "However, it is important to recognize that a text can present not only cases in which some form recurs, as in 1(a) below, but also instances where meaning recurs, with",
        "out any formal element being necessarily repeated, as in 1(b).",
        "(1) (a) Brutus has killed Caesar!",
        "He has killed him!",
        "(b) Brutus has killed Caesar!",
        "He plunged his",
        "knife into him and our beloved leader is dead!",
        "It is such semantic repetition that concerns us here: that is, the repetition of some semantic content within a text, without there being necessarily a formal element which recurs.",
        "In particular, we wish to study semantic repetition in literary texts.",
        "This is important, since literature often brings with it the expectation that repetition is significant.",
        "To put this another way, repetition tends to be semanticized: its very existence ?means?",
        "something.",
        "Consider this first at the formal level.",
        "It is well-known that human language processing tends to extract meaning from sequences of forms and retain the forms themselves for only a limited time.",
        "Literary texts counteract this fading effect by several linguistic means, including physical proximity of repeated items, stress, and syntactic position.",
        "Devices such as these often carry additional information on importance or some other factor, as when an orator repeats the same word or sequence.",
        "This has been much discussed.",
        "To mention several examples among many, Jakobson (1960) refers to this as the poetic function of language, Genette (1972) provides a typology of narrative repetition, Tsur (2008) argues",
        "that repetition is one of the devices which ?slows down?",
        "processing of text and contributes to poetic effects, Tannen (1989) gives examples of the usage of repetition in oral discourse, Okpewho (1992) shows its importance in folk literature, and Johnstone (1991) examines the role of repetition in Arabic discourse.",
        "As we will see below, semantic repetition in literature also lends itself to semanticization.",
        "In other words, the fact that events are repeated in a narrative can be, and often is, seen not as the product of chance but rather as part of a larger pattern.",
        "The potential for this is supported by several features of meaning.",
        "First, as Stanhope et al. (1993) have shown in their work on the long-term retention of a novel, unlike formal elements, at least some semantic elements are extremely resistant to decay and can be recalled weeks and even many months later.",
        "As a result, the fading effects observed earlier for formal repetition cannot be assumed to apply in exactly the same fashion to semantic repetition: items remain accessible across entire texts and even across different texts.",
        "Second, there is in principle no upper limit on the size of semantic elements which may be repeated.",
        "At one extreme, a single character from a novel may remain in memory, along with some of the items associated with him or her.",
        "If one hears the single word Hamlet, what comes to mind?",
        "At the other, entire plots may be recalled.",
        "If asked to summarize the plot of A Christmas Carol in 100 words, most native speakers would have no difficulty in doing this.",
        "And third, by their tendency to exploit and semanticize repetition, literary texts differ from other genres, such as expository texts, whose goal is typically to present some set of information in a coherent fashion such that the same element not be repeated.",
        "In light of this, our goal here is threefold: to give a sense of the diversity of semantic repetition in literary texts, including its various granularities; to propose a formal model capable of dealing with these various dimensions of semantic repetition; and to test this model against an actual text of some considerable length."

      "text": [
        "Let us assume for the moment that semantic repetition is limited to repeated events, leaving aside issues of repeated qualities, entities and so on.",
        "A number of formal and semantic tools suggest themselves for dealing with this case.",
        "Within a single utterance, a neo-Davidsonian event semantics might be used, as shown in (2), where e represents the ?glue?",
        "which ties together the action and the agent.",
        "This places the event at the centre of focus.",
        "The logical machinery behind this has been extended in various ways.",
        "For example, Hewitt (2012) proposes the use of serial logic to capture ordered sets of events.",
        "In addition, since events are also repeated across utterances and related to other events, as in conversations, Asher and Lascarides (2003) provides an extended logical formalism to begin to deal with this and Helbig (2006) proposes several specific functions for linking propositions, including CAUS (causality), CONTR (contrast), and CONF (conformity with an abstract frame).",
        "However, both approaches are applied to short spans of text and neither deals explicitly with repetition.",
        "At a slightly higher level of granularity, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) provides a set of frameworks to describe relationships among elements of a paragraph, some of which, Restatement and Elaboration in particular, have the potential to deal with elements of repetition.1 Work in Natural Language Generation, which has often focused on the production of longer expository texts, has also typically paid more attention to the reduction of repetition than to its production.2 Even work on narrative generation has tended to concentrate mostly on reduction of repetition (Callaway and Lester, 2001; Callaway and Lester, 2002).",
        "Several attempts have been made to deal with longer spans of texts, typically based on the markup of elements within a text.",
        "Most recently, Mani (2012) proposes a Narrative Markup Language capable of dealing with elements of repetition, but this markup is anchored to the text itself and it is unclear how such an approach could capture more abstract elements of semantic repetition.",
        "In fact, the fundamental issue",
        "is that semantic repetition exists across a wide range of spans, from the very smallest (both across different events and within elements of some inherently repeated activity (Tovena and Donazzan, 2008)), to the very largest, spanning multiple texts.",
        "To illustrate this, consider the following cases.",
        "(a) A single event and the memory of the event in the mind of the perpetrator.",
        "For example, Brutus stabs Caesar, and then the next day replays the stabbing in his memory.",
        "(b) A single event seen from the point of view of two different characters.",
        "For example, Livia sees Brutus stab Caesar, and so does Cassius.",
        "(c) A single, perhaps complex, event, whose dif",
        "ferent facets are represented, perhaps in an interspersed fashion.",
        "Good examples of this are found in cinema, such as Eisenstein's famous bridge scene in October, or the Odessa steps scene in Battleship Potemkin, where the same images recur (such as the opening bridge, the dead horse, or the baby carriage tipping on the end of a stairway).",
        "Examples such as these illustrate what might be called representational repetition, in which the same (perhaps complex) event is shown from different points of view.",
        "However, we also find examples of what might be called class-based repetition, in which various simple examples share a common abstract structure, as the following examples illustrate.",
        "(d) Two sets of events in the same text represent instantiations of the same topos, or recurring narrative structure.",
        "For example, the Hebrew Bible contains multiple instances in which a parent favours a younger sibling over an older one.",
        "Thus, the Deity favours Abel over Cain, Abraham favours Isaac over Ishmael, Isaac favours Jacob over Esau, and so on.",
        "In these cases, we are actually faced with an abstract framework which is instantiated with different actual parameters.",
        "(e) Two different texts represent the same abstract plot.",
        "Thus, Pyramus and Thisbe and Romeo and Juliet may both be represented by the same abstract formula, which we captures the story of star-crossed lovers whose feuding families lead to their demise.",
        "Examples such as (d) and (e) show that at least some elements of literary repetition may only be captured by some device which permits a greater degree of abstraction than is provided by traditional devices like predicate calculus or instance-based markup.",
        "From the literary perspective, they are sometimes referred to as topoi, that is, recurring narrative sequences.3 However, as formulated in most literary analyses, the notion of topos has several shortcomings.",
        "First, definitions tend to be informal.4 Second, the granularity of topoi is unclear.",
        "One might express a given topos in very general terms or quite specifically.",
        "Our goal here is to build on the insights of literary theory regarding the meaning of literary texts, while retaining some level of formalism.",
        "To do this, we need first to respect the empirical richness of literary texts.",
        "As the examples above show, simple two-line examples are not sufficient to show the true complexity of semantic repetition.",
        "Accordingly, we have chosen as our corpus an entire movie script, described below.",
        "Second, in the case of semantic repetition, we need a formalism capable of capture-ing various levels of granularity, from quite fine to very general, and which shows not just differences of point of view, but elements of class inclusion.",
        "To do accomplish this, we have adopted the formalism described in Levison et al. (2012), based on a functional representation of meaning elements by means of semantic expressions.5 When combined with the use of threaded Directed Acyclic Graphs, discussed below, this formalism permits the representation of elements of meaning at various levels of granularity,"

        "Such shortcuts may be found in most narratives.",
        "For example, subsequent references to a known character or event may be reduced to the minimum, since a simple mention reactivates the entire reference.",
        "Conversely, the exploration of interior nodes rather than higher-level ones (in other words, providing more detail) may produce an effect of slowdown (Bal, 1985).",
        "In the case of semantic repetition, shortcuts like those just described demonstrate that not only can repetition occur in the absence of repeated formal elements, but even in the absence of explicitly repeated semantic elements.",
        "At the extreme, the activation of a higher-level node by reference to an interior node provides a model for literary allusions, perhaps the most subtle type of repetition, where some element in one text activates a reference to another."

        "The series of examples presented here provide evidence for the existence of semantic repetition at both the atomic and structural levels.",
        "They also show that these can be captured by a model which permits various levels of granularity, from atomic semantic expressions to higher-level subDAGs and DAGs.",
        "It must be admitted however that, at this stage of the research, only human intelligence has permitted the identification of semantic repetition in its various forms.",
        "In an ideal world, a computer program might be capable of arriving at the same judgments.",
        "Work such as Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) or Hobbs et al. (1993) might provide a good starting point for this.",
        "In the meantime, we believe that there is value in continuing the meaning-first perspective illustrated here, as a complement to the more usual text-first analyses.",
        "When combined with a user-friendly formalism, this approach would go some way to bridging the divide between computer scientists and literary specialists in their analysis of literary texts."
