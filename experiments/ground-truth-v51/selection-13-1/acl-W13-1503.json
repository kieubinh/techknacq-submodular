        "Seen from the perspective of the non-native as an ever-learning reader, we show how translation may be of more harm than help in understanding and retaining the meaning of a word while simplification holds promise.",
        "We conclude that if reading everyday documents can be considered as a learning activity as well as a practical necessity, then our study reinforces the arguments that defend the use of simplification to make documents that non-natives need to read more accessible."

        "There are many tools that natural language processing (NLP) can offer disadvantaged readers to aid them in understanding a document.",

        "This paper addresses that last case.",
        "For non-native readers, there are a number of aids that could be made available to them.",
        "Some aids help on the word level, assuming that the understanding of a specific word is what is impeding comprehension.",
        "Others address a more global level, presuming that the understanding blockage is due lack of comprehension of the meaning of a group of words.",
        "Our work addresses learning English vocabulary, for which we have conducted studies on both word-level and higher-level aids.",
        "We argue that our findings can inform what can be done to make documents more understandable in general for non-natives.",
        "In the past, we have studied the effect of aids such as ordered definitions (Dela Rosa and Eskenazi, 2011) and synthesized speech (Dela Rosa et al., 2010) on learning vocabulary from web documents.",
        "These aids have been aimed at the word level and have been shown to help learning.",
        "We explored the wider context around an unknown word in an effort to give the non-native reader an understanding of the several-word context around an unknown word in order to help understanding of the meaning of the text.",
        "Reading documents to learn a language is a very different activity from reading an everyday document (like a rental agreement) out of necessity.",
        "Yet we find that there are similarities between the two activities.",
        "We believe that, unlike for some other categories of disadvantaged readers, each document that a non-native reads is a learning moment and that they learn the target language more with each encounter.",
        "These incremental additions to the readers?",
        "knowledge enable them to be increasingly capable of tackling future unknown documents.",
        "It also reflects on the manner with",
        "which readers tackle a document since some understanding of the words has to take place in order for the document to be understood.",
        "We believe that these similarities warrant using learning findings to guide the choice of NLP tools used in document processing for non-native readers.",

        "Using learning as a means of estimating the usefulness of NLP techniques in making texts more accessible, we can examine the positions that the learning community has taken on the educational value of several of these techniques.",
        "Translation (the use of L1 in second language (L2) vocabulary acquisition) is the area in which we find the greatest controversy.",
        "Models of L2 lexical acquisition represent acquisition of new L2 words as an assimilation through an L1 lemma that is generalized and applied to concepts in L2 (Jiang, 2000; Kroll and Sunderman, 2003).",
        "Excessive use of L1 is believed to reduce L2 fluency and to fossilize errors.",
        "Context, dictionary definitions and examples of other sentences in which a word could be used are commonly considered to be the most effective tools since students can interiorize the concept of the new word without reliance on L1.",
        "This implies that the use of such techniques can lead to better learning and improved fluency than direct use of L1 translation.",
        "This claim has been challenged by Grace (1998), showing that that when translation is provided, there are higher scores on vocabulary tests both in the short-term and long-term use of the new words.",
        "Prince (1996) also claimed that the more proficient students benefit more from translation on short-term lexical recall tasks, since it is easier for them to get rid of the L1 scaffolding.",
        "These studies and others have been hampered by the ability to accurately measure the extent of the subjects?",
        "use of translation.",
        "The REAP software described below has afforded a more precise estimate of use and of retention of vocabulary items.",
        "Simplification has had more widespread acceptance.",
        "Simplified texts have often been provided to language learners either along with the original text or alone (Burstein et al. 2007, Peter-sen and Ostendorf, 2007).",
        "These texts have been used as reading comprehension exercises or textbook reading materials (Crossley, et al. 2007).",
        "According to Oh (2008), simplification typically uses shorter sentences, simpler grammar and controlled vocabulary.",
        "The use of simplified texts has been shown to significantly help students?",
        "reading comprehension (Yano, et al. 1994, Oh 2008).",
        "However, there has not been any research specifically about whether reading the simplified texts, rather than the original ones, will affect the students?",
        "vocabulary acquisition.",
        "There are a few disadvantages related to simplifying texts for ESL students.",
        "Yano et al. (1994) note that simplified texts may appear unnatural, giving them a lack of flow, thus making them difficult to read.",
        "They may also lack the complex grammar structures that commonly exist in the real world (that students should be exposed to).",
        "The simplified texts used in these studies were created by hand and are usually written with the express intention of featuring certain vocabulary and/or syntactic elements for the purpose of being used by a non-native learner.",
        "To address the link between vocabulary and comprehension of a text, the literature often reveals mastery of vocabulary as the key.",
        "Perfetti (2010) emphasized the vocabulary-comprehension link.",
        "Increased vocabulary has been shown to increase comprehension.",
        "Thus text comprehension for non-natives could depend on either presenting only words that they can understand or offering an aid for understanding any challenging words that they may encounter."

        "We can help the student both on the word level and on a more global (contextual) level.",
        "On the word level, the one aid that does not appear to need any processing is dictionary definitions.",
        "Access to an online dictionary would give the student definitions to any word in question.",
        "However, many words are polysemous, often having several meanings for the same part of speech (like ?bank?).",
        "In that case, the reader has to choose which one of the meanings is the right one for the context of the text at hand.",
        "This dilemma (and possible incorrect choice) can be avoided by using word sense disambiguation (Dela Rosa and Eskenazi 2011).",
        "We showed that when definitions",
        "are presented in an ordered list, according to the best fit in the context, students learned words better.",
        "Another word-level aid is the use of speech synthesis to speak the word to the reader (Dela Rosa 2010).",
        "Non-natives know some words aurally, but have never seen them in written form.",
        "This aid is especially helpful when the orthography of an unknown word makes it difficult to deduce the pronunciation (as in ?thought?).",
        "Another aid presents a word in other contexts.",
        "Giving the student the ability to compare several contexts with their contrasting meanings is helpful for learning.",
        "These contexts can be found by searching for sentences with a target word and a set of commonly co-occurring context words.",
        "While research in vocabulary acquisition over the years has shown positive results for many word-centric learning aids, it is interesting to expand the offerings to context-level aids.",
        "We were also curious to see if the use of the REAP platform (Brown and Eskenazi, 2005) could help add to the knowledge of the role of translation in L2 vocabulary learning.",
        "This is what brought us to examine the effect of translation and simplification on learning.",
        "These two techniques, thanks to the use of NLP, could be totally automated in the future.",
        "Research in machine translation (MT) goes back several decades and many types of statistical models have been employed (Koehn, 2010).",
        "If all of the documents to be translated are in one given domain, then sufficiently good automatically translations can be obtained.",
        "Automated simplification is a newer domain.",
        "There has been significant progress in simplifying documents for use by specific disadvantaged populations (Alusio et al2010, Bach et al. 2011, Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997, Inui et al. 2003, Medero and Ostendorf, 2011, Yaskar et al2010).",
        "Like Alusio and colleagues, who work with low-literacy populations, and a few other authors, we are concerned not only about the quality of the simplification, but also about whether the simplified documents actually help disadvantaged readers.",
        "We could have also looked at summariza-tion, which uses some of the same techniques that are used for simplification.",
        "In some early unpublished studies, we found that students experienced difficulty when asked to summarize a passage.",
        "They usually responded by simply cutting and pasting the first sentence of that passage.",
        "This could have meant that students just could not produce a well-structured sentence and thus avoided doing so.",
        "But non-natives, who are asked to identify the appropriate summary out of four possibilities in a multiple choice question, also had much difficulty.",
        "Thus, rather than giving a very high-level overview of a passage through summariza-tion, we chose to look at the intermediate level aids that would also contribute to vocabulary understanding: translation and simplification of local contexts.",
        "Translation and simplification can both be characterized as relating to overall context, operating effectively on a string of several words rather than on only one word.",
        "They both aid in understanding the meaning of the whole string as opposed to just one target word, and their help for unknown words is through making the context of the word clear enough to surmise the meaning of the word.",
        "Besides its controversial status, translation had also attracted our interest when we observed the students?",
        "efforts to get translations for tasks in class.",
        "We wanted to find out if translation had different properties from all other aids.",
        "Translation is different from the aids that we had used in the past in two ways:",
        "?",
        "it uses L1 ?",
        "it covers several-word contexts, rather than just one word.",
