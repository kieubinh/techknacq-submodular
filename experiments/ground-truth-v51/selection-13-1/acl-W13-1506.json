        "This paper introduces TextEvaluator, a fully-automated text analysis system designed to facilitate such work.1 Our approach for addressing these differences can be summarized as follows.",
        "First, a large set of lexical, syntactic and discourse features is extracted from each text.",

        "Despite the large numbers of text features that may potentially contribute to the ease or difficulty of comprehending complex text, many widely-used readability metrics are based on extremely limited feature sets.",
        "For example, the Flesch-Kincaid GL score (Kincaid, et al., 1975), the FOG Index (Gunning, 1952), and the Lexile Framework (Stenner, et al., 2006) each consider just two features: a single measure of syntactic complexity (average sentence length) and a single measure of lexical difficulty (either average word length in syllables, average frequency of multi-syllable words, or average word familiarity estimated via a word frequency, WF, index).",
        "Recently, more computationally sophisticated modeling techniques such as Statistical Language Models (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004, Heilman, et al., 2007, Pitler and Nenkova, 2008), Support Vector Machines (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), Principal Components Analyses (Sheehan, et al., 2010) and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers (Vajjala and Meurers, 2012) have enabled researchers to investigate a broader range of potentially useful features.",
        "For example: Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) demonstrated that vocabulary measures based on trigrams were effective at distinguishing articles targeted at younger and older readers; Pitler and Nenkova (2008) reported improved validity for measures based on the likelihood of vocabulary and the likelihood of discourse relations; and Vaj-jala and Meurers (2012) demonstrated that features inspired by Second Language Acquisition research also contributed to validity improvements.",
        "Importantly, however, while this research has contributed to our understanding of the types of text features that may cause texts to be more or less comprehensible, evaluations focused on the presence and degree of genre bias have not been reported."

        "This paper considers the more challenging task of predicting human-assigned GL classifications in a corpus of texts constructed to be representative of the broad range of reading materials considered by teachers and students in U.S. classrooms.",
        "Two approaches for modeling the complexity characteristics of these passages were compared.",
        "In Approach #1, a single, non-genre specific prediction equation is estimated, and that equation is then applied to texts in all genres.",
        "Two measures developed via this approach were evaluated: the Lexile Framework and the REAP system.",
        "Approach #2 differs from Approach #1 in that genre-specific prediction equations are used, thereby ensuring that important genre effects are accommodated.",
        "This approach is currently only available via the TextEvaluator system.",
        "Measures developed via each approach were evaluated on a held-out sample.",
        "Results confirmed that complexity classifications obtained via TextEvaluator are significantly more highly correlated with the human grade band classifications in the held-out sample than are classifications obtained via the Lexile Framework or REAP system.",
        "This study also demonstrated that, when genre effects are ignored, readability scores for informational texts tend to be overestimated, while those for literary texts tend to be underestimated.",
        "Note that this finding significantly complicates the process of using readability metrics to generate valid cross-genre comparisons.",
        "For example, Stajner, et al. (2012) conclude that SimpleWiki may not serve as a ?gold standard?",
        "of high accessibility because comparisons based on readability metrics suggest that it is more complex than Fiction.",
        "We intend to further investigate this finding using TextEvaluator since conclusions that are not impacted by genre bias can then be reported.",
        "Additional planned work involves investigating additional measures of genre, and incorporating these into our genre classifier."
