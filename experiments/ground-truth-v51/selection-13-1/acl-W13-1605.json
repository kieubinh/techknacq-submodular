        "In this paper we introduce a sarcasm detection system for tweets, messages on the microblogging service offered by Twitter.1 In doing this we are helped by the fact that sarcasm appears to be a well-understood concept by Twitter users, as seen by the relatively accurate use of an explicit marker of sarcasm, the hashtag ?#sarcasm?.",

        "We are interested in sarcasm as a linguistic phenomenon, and how we can detect it in social me",

        "Yet, Brown (1980) warns that sarcasm ?is not a discrete logical or linguistic phenomenon?",
        "(p. 111), while verbal irony is; we take the liberty of using the term sarcasm while verbal irony would be the more appropriate term.",
        "Even then, according to Gibbs and Colston (2007) the definition of verbal irony is still a ?problem that surfaces in the irony literature?",
        "(p. 584).",
        "There are many different theoretical approaches to verbal irony.",
        "Burgers (2010), who provides an overview of approaches, distinguishes a number of features in ironic utterances that need to be included in an operational definition of irony: (1) irony is always implicit (Giora, 1995; Grice, 1978), (2) irony is evaluative (Attardo, 2000; Kotthoff, 2003; Sper-ber and Wilson, 1995), it is possible to (3) distinguish between a non-ironic and an ironic reading of the same utterance (Grice, 1975; Grice, 1978), (4) between which a certain type of opposition may be observed (see also Kawakami, 1984, 1988, summarized in (Hamamoto, 1998; Partington, 2007; Seto, 1998).",
        "Burgers?",
        "own definition of verbal irony is ?an evaluative utterance, the valence of which is implicitly reversed between the literal and intended evaluation?",
        "(Burgers, 2010, p. 19).",
        "Thus, a sarcastic utterance involves a shift in evaluative valence, which can go two ways: it could be a shift from a literally positive to an intended negative meaning, or a shift from a literally negative to an intended positive evaluation.",

        "(2012b) also argue that users of social media often use irony in utterances that involve a shift in evaluative valence, we use Burgers?",

        "Around 8% of conversational turns between American college friends contains irony (Gibbs, 2007).",

        "When an individual sees a group's normative standards violated, he uses sarcasm to vent frustration.",
        "Sarcasm is also used when someone finds a situation or object offensive (Gibbs, 2007).",
        "Sarcasm or irony is always directed at someone or something; its target.",
        "A target is the person or object against whom or which the ironic utterance is directed (Liv-nat, 2004).",
        "Targets can be the sender himself, the addressee or a third party (or a combination of the three).",
        "Burgers (2010) showed that in Dutch written communication, the target of the ironic utterance is often a third party.",
        "These findings may be interesting for our research, in which we study microtexts of up to 140 characters from Twitter.",
        "Sarcasm in written and spoken interaction may work differently (Jahandarie, 1999).",
        "In spoken interaction, sarcasm is often marked with a special intonation (Attardo et al., 2003; Bryant and Tree, 2005; Rockwell, 2007) or an incongruent facial expression (Muecke, 1978; Rockwell, 2003; Attardo et al., 2003).",

        "Since sarcasm is more difficult to comprehend than a literal utterance (Gibbs, 1986; Giora, 2003; Burgers, 2010), it is likely that addressees do not pick up on the sarcasm and interpret the utterances literally.",
        "Acoording to Gibbs and Izett (2005), sarcasm divides its addressees into two groups; a group of people who understand sarcasm (the so-called group of wolves) and a group of people who do not understand sarcasm (the so-called group of sheep).",
        "In order to ensure that the addressees detect the sarcasm in the utterance, senders use linguistic markers in their utterances.",

        "Although in this research we focused on the Dutch language, our findings may also apply to languages similar to Dutch, such as English and German.",
        "Future research would be needed to chart the prediction of sarcasm in languages that are more distant to Dutch.",
        "Sarcasm may be used differently in other cultures (Goddard, 2006).",
        "Languages may use the same type of marker in different ways, such as a different intonation in spoken sarcasm by English and Cantonese speakers (Cheang and Pell, 2009).",
        "Such a difference between languages in the use of the same marker may also apply to written sarcastic utterances.",
        "Another strand of future research would be to expand our scope from sarcasm to other more subtle variants of irony, such as understatements, euphemisms, and litotes.",
        "Based on Giora et al. (2005), there seems to be a spectrum of degrees of irony from the sarcastic ?Max is exceptionally bright?",
        "via the ironic ?Max is not exceptionally bright?, the understatement ?Max is not bright?",
        "to the literal ?Max is stupid?.",
        "In those utterances, there is a gap between what is literally said and the intended meaning of the sender.",
        "The greater the gap or contrast, the easier it is to perceive the irony.",
        "But the negated not bright is still perceived as ironic; more ironic than the literal utterance (Giora et al., 2005).",
        "We may need to combine the sarcasm detection task with the problem of the detection of negation and hedging markers and their scope (Morante et al., 2008; Morante and Daelemans, 2009) in order to arrive at a comprehensive account of polarity-reversing mechanisms, which in sentiment analysis is still highly desirable."
