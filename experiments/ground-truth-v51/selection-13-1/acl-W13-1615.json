        "An important component of these methods is the feature extraction process.",
        "We focused on analysis of informative features that improve the accuracy of the systems with no language-specific constraints.",

        "When comparing the current system with others, it is necessary to emphasize that the use of linguistic knowledge does improve accuracy.",
        "Since we do not use such knowledge, our results should only be compared with other methods having similar constraints, such as those which use features based on bags of words that are tested on the same data set.",
