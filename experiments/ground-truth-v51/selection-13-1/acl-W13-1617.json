        "Sentiment analysis is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) task dealing with the detection and classification of sentiments in texts.",
        "Usually, the classes considered are ?positive?, ?negative?",
        "and ?neutral?, although in some cases finer-grained categories are added (e.g. ?very positive?",
        "and ?very negative?)",
        "or only the ?positive?",
        "and ?negative?",
        "classes are taken into account.",
        "Another related task - emotion detection - concerns the classification of text into several classes of emotion, usually the basic ones, as described by Paul Ekman (Ekman, 1992).",
        "Although different in some ways, some of the research in the field has considered these tasks together, under the umbrella of sentiment analysis.",
        "This task has received a lot of interest from the research community in the past years.",
        "The work done regarded the manner in which sentiment can be classified from texts pertaining to different genres and distinct languages, in the context of various applications, using knowledge-based, semi-supervised and supervised methods (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "The result of the analyses performed have shown that the different types of text require specialized methods for sentiment analysis, as, for example, sentiments are not conveyed in the same manner in newspaper articles and in blogs, reviews, forums or other types of user-generated contents (Balahur et al., 2010).",
        "In the light of these findings, dealing with sentiment analysis in Twitter requires an analysis of the characteristics of such texts and the design of adapted methods.",
        "Additionally, the sentiment analysis method employed has to consider the requirements of the final application in which it will be used.",
        "There is an important difference between deploying a system working for languages such as English, for which numerous linguistic resources and analysis tools exist and a system deployed for languages with few such tools or one that is aimed at processing data from a large set of languages.",
        "Finally, a sentiment analysis system working with large sets of data (such as the one found in Twitter) must be able to process texts fast.",
        "Therefore, using highly complex methods may delay producing useful results.",
        "In the light of these considerations, this paper",
        "presents a method for sentiment analysis that takes into account the special structure and linguistic content of tweets.",
        "The texts are preprocessed in order to normalize the language employed and remove noisy elements.",
        "Special usage of language (e.g. repeated punctuation signs, repeated letters) are marked as special features, as they contribute to the expressivity of the text in terms of sentiment.",
        "Further on, sentiment-bearing words, as they are found in three highly-accurate sentiment lexicons - General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al., 1966), Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010) and MicroWNOp (Cerini et al., 2007) - are replaced with unique labels, correspod-ing to their polarity.",
        "In the same manner, modifiers (negations, intensifiers and diminishers) are also replaced with unique labels representing their semantic class.",
        "Finally, we employ supervised learning with Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization (SVM SMO) (Platt, 1998) using a simple, linear kernel (to avoid overfitting of data) and the unigrams and bigrams from the training set as features.",
        "We obtain the best results by using unique labels for the affective words and the modifiers, unigrams and bigrams as features and posing the condition that each feature considered in the supervised learning process be present in the training corpora at least twice.",
        "The remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we present the motivations and describe the contributions of this work.",
        "In the following section, we describe in detail the process followed to pre-process the tweets and build the classification models.",
        "In Section 5, we present the results obtained using different datasets and combinations of features and discuss their causes and implications.",
        "Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main findings of this work and sketches the lines for future work."

        "One of the first studies on the classification of polarity in tweets was (Go et al., 2009).",

        "?",
        ":)?, ?",
        ":(?, etc.)",
        "as markers of positive and negative tweets.",

        ":)?, and negative tweets with negative emoticons ?:(?.",
        "Subsequently, they employ different supervised approaches (SVM, Na?",
        "?ve Bayes and Maximum Entropy) and various sets of features and conclude that the simple use of unigrams leads to good results, but it can be slightly improved by the combination of unigrams and bigrams.",
        "In the same line of thinking, (Pak and Paroubek, 2010) also generated a corpus of tweets for sentiment analysis, by selecting positive and negative tweets based on the presence of specific emoticons.",
        "Subsequently, they compare different supervised approaches with n-gram features and obtain the best results using Na?",
        "?ve Bayes with unigrams and part-of-speech tags.",
        "Another approach on sentiment analysis in tweet is that of (Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "Here, the authors employ a hybrid approach, combining supervised learning with the knowledge on sentiment-bearing words, which they extract from the DAL sentiment dictionary (Whissell, 1989).",
        "Their preprocessing stage includes the removal of retweets, translation of abbreviations into original terms and deleting of links, a tokenization process, and part-of-speech tagging.",
        "They employ various supervised learning algorithms to classify tweets into positive and negative, using n-gram features with SVM and syntactic features with Partial Tree Kernels, combined with the knowledge on the polarity of the words appearing in the tweets.",
        "The authors conclude that the most important features are those corresponding to sentiment-bearing words.",
        "Finally, (Jiang et al., 2011) classify sentiment expressed on previously-given ?targets?",
        "in tweets.",
        "They add information on the context of the tweet to its text (e.g. the event that it is related to).",
        "Subsequently, they employ SVM and General Inquirer and perform a three-way classification (positive, negative, neutral)."

        "As we have seen in the previous section, several important steps have already been taken into analyzing the manner in which sentiment can be automatically detected and classified from Twitter data.",
        "The research we described in previous section has already dealt with some of the issues that are posed by short,",
        "informal texts, such as the tweets.",
        "However, these small snippets of text have several liguistic peculiarities that can be employed to improve the sentiment classification performance.",
        "We describe these peculiarities below: ?",
        "Tweets are short, user-generated text that may contain no more than 140 characters (strongly related to the standard 160-character length of SMS 1).",
        "Users are marked with the ?@?",
        "sign and topics with the ?#?",
        "(hashtag) sign.",
        "?",
        "In general, the need to include a large quantity of information in small limit of characters leads to the fact that tweets sometimes have no grammatical structure, contain misspellings and abbreviations.",
        "?",
        "Some of the tweets are simply posted from the websites of news providers (news agencies, newspapers) and therefore they contain only titles of news.",
        "However, subjective tweets, in which users comment on an event, are highly marked by sentiment-bearing expressions, either in the form of affective words, or by em-ployins specific modalities - e.g. the use of capital letters or repeated punctuation signs to stress upon specific words.",
        "Most of the times, these words are sentiment-bearing ones.",
        "?",
        "The language employed in subjective tweets includes a specific slang (also called ?urban expressions?",
        "2) and emoticons (graphical expressions of emotions through the use of punctuation signs).",
        "?",
        "Most of the times, the topic that is discusses in the tweets is clearly marked using hashtags.",
        "Thus, there is no need to employ very complex linguistic tools to determine it.",
        "?",
        "In major events, the rate of tweets per minute commenting or retweeting information surpasses the rate of thousands per minute.",
        "?",
        "Twitter is available in more than 30 languages.",
        "However, users tweet in more than 80 languages.",
        "The information it contains can be useful to obtain information and updates about, for",
        "example, crisis events 3, in real time.",
        "In order to benefit from this, however, a system processing these texts has to be easily adaptable to other languages and it has to work in near real time.",
        "Bearing this in mind, the main contributions we bring in this paper are: 1.",
        "The preprocessing of tweets to normalize the language and generalize the vocabulary employed to express sentiment.",
        "At this stage, we take into account the linguistic peculiarities of tweets, regarding spelling, use of slang, punctuation, etc., and also replace the sentiment-bearing words from the training data with a unique label.",
        "In this way, the sentence ?I love roses.?",

        "The use of minimal linguistic processing, which makes the approach easily portable to other languages.",
        "We employ only tokenization and do not process texts any further.",

        "3.",
        "The inclusion of bigrams to spot modifications in the polarity of the sentiment expressed.",

        "Interesting bigrams that were discovered using these generalizations are, e.g. ?negative multiexclamation?, ?positive multiexclamation?, ?positive multistop?",
        "- which is more often found in negative tweets -,?negator positive?, ?diminisher positive?, ?mostly diminisher?, ?hnegative feeling?, ?hnegative day?, ?eat negative?,?intensifier hnegative?.",
        "All these extracted features are very useful to detect and classify sentiment in tweets and most of them would be ignored if the vocabulary were different in the train",
        "ing and test data or if, for example, a stressed word would be written under different forms or a punctuation sign would be repeated a different number of times.",
        "We can see that the method employed obtains good results, above the ones reported so far with the state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "We have seen that the use of affect and modifier lexica generalization has an impact on both the quantitative performance of the classification, as well as on the quality of the results, making the classifier less biased towards the class with a significantly larger number of examples.",
        "In practice, datasets are not balanced, so it is imporant that a classifier is able to assign (even incorrectly) an example to a class that is semantically similar and not to a class with totally opposite affective orientation.",
        "In this sense, as we have seen in the detailed results obtained on the TweetEm dataset, it is preferable that, e.g. the examples pertaining to the emotion classes of anger and sadness are mistakenly classified as the other.",
        "However, it is not acceptable to have such a high number of examples from these classes labeled as ?joy?.",
        "Finally, by inspecting some of the examples in the three datasets, we noticed that a constant reason for error remains the limited power of the method to correctly spot the scope of the negations and modifiers.",
        "As such, we plan to study the manner in which skip-bigrams (bigrams made up of non-consecutive tokens) can be added and whether or not they will contribute to (at least partially) solve this issue."

        "In this article, we presented a method to classify the sentiment in tweets, by taking into account their peculiarities and adapting the features employed to their structure and content.",
        "Specifically, we employed a preprocessing stage to normalize the language and generalize the vocabulary employed to express sentiment.",
        "This regarded spelling, slang, punctuation, etc., and the use of sentiment dictionaries and modifier lists to generalize the patterns of sentiment expression extracted from the training data.",
        "We have shown that the use of such generalized features significantly improves the results of the sentiment classification,when compared to the best-performing approaches that do not use affect dictionaries.",
        "Additionally, we have shown that we can obtain good results even though we employ minimal linguistic processing.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it makes the method easily applicable to other languages.",
        "Finally, we have shown that the use of a simple heuristic, concerning filtering out features that appear only once, improves the results.",
        "As such, the method is less dependent on the dataset on which the classification model is trained and the vocabulary it contains.",
        "Finally, we employed a simple SVM SMO linear classifier to test our approach on three different data sets.",
        "Using such an approach avoids overfitting the data and, as we have shown, leads to comparable performances on different datasets.",
        "In future work, we plan to evaluate the use of higher-order n-grams (3-grams) and skip-grams to extract more complex patterns of sentiment expressions and be able to identify more precisely the scope of the negation.",
        "Additionally, we plan to evaluate the influence of deeper linguistic processing on the results, by performing stemming, lemmatizing and POS-tagging.",
        "Further on, we would like to extend our approach on generalizing the semantic classes of words and employing unique labels to group them (e.g. label mouse, cat and dog as ?animal?).",
        "Finally, we would like to study the performance of our approach in the context of tweets related to specific news, in which case these short texts can be contextualized by adding further content from other information sources."
