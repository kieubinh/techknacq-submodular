        "Native Language Identification, or NLI, is the task of automatically classifying the L1 of a writer based solely on his or her essay written in another language.",
        "This problem area has seen a spike in interest in recent years as it can have an impact on educational applications tailored towards non-native speakers of a language, as well as authorship profiling.",
        "While there has been a growing body of work in NLI, it has been difficult to compare methodologies because of the different approaches to preprocessing the data, different sets of languages identified, and different splits of the data used.",
        "In this shared task, the first ever for Native Language Identification, we sought to address the above issues by providing a large corpus designed specifically for NLI, in addition to providing an environment for systems to be directly compared.",
        "In this paper, we report the results of the shared task.",
        "A total of 29 teams from around the world competed across three different sub-tasks."

        "One quickly growing subfield in NLP is the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a writer based solely on a sample of their writing in another language.",
        "The task is framed as a classification problem where the set of L1s is known a priori.",
        "Most work has focused on identifying the native language of writers learning English as a second language.",
        "To date this topic has motivated several papers and research projects.",
        "Native Language Identification (NLI) can be useful for a number of applications.",
        "NLI can be used in educational settings to provide more targeted feedback to language learners about their errors.",
        "It is well known that speakers of different languages make different kinds of errors when learning a language (Swan and Smith, 2001).",
        "A writing tutor system which can detect the native language of the learner will be able to tailor the feedback about the error and contrast it with common properties of the learner's language.",
        "In addition, native language is often used as a feature that goes into authorship profiling (Estival et al., 2007), which is frequently used in forensic linguistics.",
        "Despite the growing interest in this field, development has been encumbered by two issues.",
        "First is the issue of data.",
        "Evaluating an NLI system requires a corpus containing texts in a language other than the native language of the writer.",
        "Because of a scarcity of such corpora, most work has used the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLEv2) (Granger et al., 2009) for training and evaluation since it contains several hundred essays written by college-level English language learners.",
        "However, this corpus is quite small for training and testing statistical systems which makes it difficult to tell whether the systems that are developed can scale well to larger data sets or to different domains.",
        "Since the ICLE corpus was not designed with the task of NLI in mind, the usability of the corpus for this task is further compromised by idiosyncrasies in the data such as topic bias (as shown by Brooke and Hirst (2011)) and the occurrence of characters which only appear in essays written by speakers of certain languages (Tetreault et al., 2012).",
        "As a result, it is hard to draw conclusions about which features",
        "actually perform best.",
        "The second issue is that there has been little consistency in the field in the use of cross-validation, the number of L1s, and which L1s are used.",
        "As a result, comparing one approach to another has been extremely difficult.",
        "The first Shared Task in Native Language Identification is intended to better unify this community and help the field progress.",
        "The Shared Task addresses the two deficiencies above by first using a new corpus (TOEF11, discussed in Section 3) that is larger than the ICLE and designed specifically for the task of NLI and second, by providing a common set of L1s and evaluation standards that everyone will use for this competition, thus facilitating direct comparison of approaches.",
        "In this report we describe the methods most participants used, the data they evaluated their systems on, the three subtasks involved, the results achieved by the different teams, and some suggestions and ideas about what we can do for the next iteration of the NLI shared task.",
        "In the following section, we provide a summary of the prior work in Native Language Identification.",
        "Next, in Section 3 we describe the TOEFL11 corpus used for training, development and testing in this shared task.",
        "Section 4 describes the three subtasks of the NLI Shared Task as well as a review of the timeline.",
        "Section 5 lists the 29 teams that participated in the shared task, and introduce abbreviations that will be used throughout this paper.",
        "Sections 6 and 7 describe the results of the shared task and a separate post shared task evaluation where we asked teams to evaluate their system using cross-validation on a combination of the training and development data.",
        "In Section 8 we provide a high-level view of the common features and machine learning methods teams tended to use.",
        "Finally, we offer conclusions and ideas for future instantiations of the shared task in Section 9."

        "In this section, we provide an overview of some of the common approaches used for NLI prior to this shared task.",
        "While a comprehensive review is outside the scope of this paper, we have compiled a bibliography of related work in the field.",
        "It can be downloaded from the NLI Shared Task website.1 To date, nearly all approaches have treated the task of NLI as a supervised classification problem where statistical models are trained on data from the different L1s.",
        "The work of Koppel et al. (2005) was the first in the field and they explored a multitude of features, many of which are employed in several of the systems in the shared tasks.",
        "These features included character and POS n-grams, content and function words, as well as spelling and grammatical errors (since language learners have tendencies to make certain errors based on their L1 (Swan and Smith, 2001)).",
        "An SVM model was trained on these features extracted from a subsection of the ICLE corpus consisting of 5 L1s.",
        "N-gram features (word, character and POS) have figured prominently in prior work.",
        "Not only are they easy to compute, but they can be quite predictive.",
        "However, there are many variations on the features.",
        "Past reseach efforts have explored different n-gram windows (though most tend to focus on unigrams and bigrams), different thresholds for how many n-grams to include as well as whether to encode the feature as binary (presence or absence of the particular n-gram) or as a normalized count.",
        "The inclusion of syntactic features has been a focus in recent work.",
        "Wong and Dras (2011) explored the use of production rules from two parsers and Swanson and Charniak (2012) explored the use of Tree Substitution Grammars (TSGs).",
        "Tetreault et al.",
        "(2012) also investigated the use of TSGs as well as dependency features extracted from the Stanford parser.",
        "Other approaches to NLI have included the use of Latent Dirichlet Analysis to cluster features (Wong et al., 2011), adaptor grammars (Wong et al., 2012), and language models (Tetreault et al., 2012).",
        "Additionally, there has been research into the effects of training and testing on different corpora (Brooke and Hirst, 2011).",
        "Much of the aforementioned work takes the perspective of optimizing for the task of Native Language Identification, that is, what is the best way of modeling the problem to get the highest system accuracy?",
        "The problem of Native Language Identifica",
        "tion is also of interest to researchers in Second Language Acquisition where they seek to explain syntactic transfer in learner language (Jarvis and Cross-ley, 2012)."

        "The dataset for the task was the new TOEFL11 corpus (Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "TOEFL11 consists of essays written during a high-stakes college-entrance test, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL R?).",
        "The corpus contains 1,100 essays per language sampled as evenly as possible from 8 prompts (i.e., topics) along with score levels (low/medium/high) for each essay.",
        "The 11 native languages covered by our corpus are: Arabic (ARA), Chinese (CHI), French (FRE), German (GER), Hindi (HIN), Italian (ITA), Japanese (JAP), Korean (KOR), Spanish (SPA), Telugu (TEL), and Turkish (TUR).",
        "The TOEFL11 corpus was designed specifically to support the task of native language identification.",
        "Because all of the essays were collected through ETS's operational test delivery system for the TOEFL R?",
        "test, the encoding and storage of all texts in the corpus is consistent.",
        "Furthermore, the sampling of essays was designed to ensure approximately equal representation of native languages across topics, insofar as this was possible.",
        "For the shared task, the corpus was split into three sets: training (TOEFL11-TRAIN), development (TOEFL11-DEV), and test (TOEFL11-TEST).",
        "The train corpus consisted of 900 essays per L1, the development set consisted of 100 essays per L1, and the test set consisted of another 100 essays per L1.",
        "Although the overall TOEFL11 corpus was sampled as evenly as possible with regard to language and prompts, the distribution for each language is not exactly the same in the training, development and test sets (see Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c).",
        "In fact, the distribution is much closer between the training and test sets, as there are several languages for which there are no essays for a given prompt in the development set, whereas there are none in the training set, and only one, Italian, for the test set.",
        "It should be noted that in the first instantiation of the corpus, presented in Tetreault et al. (2012), we used TOEFL11 to denote the body of data consisting of TOEFL11-TRAIN and TOEFL11-DEV.",
        "However, in this shared task, we added 1,100 sentences for a test set and thus use the term TOEFL11 to now denote the corpus consisting of the TRAIN, DEV and TEST sets.",
