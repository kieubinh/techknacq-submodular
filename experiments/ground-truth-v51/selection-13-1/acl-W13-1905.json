        "A dimensionality of 3000 is likely insufficient to ensure that each term type has an initial distinct and uncorrelated representation.",
        "In the evaluation, there were several examples where two groups of terms ?",
        "semantically homogenous within each group, but semantically heterogenous across groups ?",
        "co-existed in the same term list: these ?topics?",
        "had seemingly collapsed into the same subspace.",
        "Despite these problems, it should be recognized that the Multiword Term Space is, in fact, able to retrieve 23 synonymous relations that involve at least one multiword term.",
        "The Unigram Word Space cannot retrieve any such relations.",
        "The ability to extract high-quality terms would seem to be an important prerequisite for this approach to modeling multiword terms in a distributional framework.",
        "However, despite employing a rather simple means of extracting terms ?",
        "without using any syntactic information ?",
        "the terms that actually appeared in the lists of semantically related terms were mostly reasonable.",
        "This perhaps indicates that the term recognition task does not need to be perfect: terms of interest, of course, need to be identified, but some noise in the form of bad terms might be acceptable.",
        "A weakness of the term recognition part is, however, that too many terms were identified, which in turn led to the aforementioned inflation in vocabulary size.",
        "Limiting the number of multiword terms in the initial term list ?",
        "for instance by extracting syntactic phrases as candidate terms ?",
        "could provide a possible solution to this problem.",
        "Overall, more synonyms were identified for the semantic type finding than for disorder.",
        "One possible explanation for this could be that there are more ways of describing a finding than a disorder ?",
        "not all semantic types can be assumed to have the same number of synonyms.",
        "The same holds true for all other semantic relations except for disorder-finding, where disorders generated a much larger number of distributionally similar findings than vice versa.",
        "This could perhaps also be explained by the possible higher number of synonyms for finding than disorder.",
        "When this method was evaluated using the English version of SNOMED CT, 16-24% of known synonyms were identified (Henriksson et al., 2013).",
        "In this case, however, we extracted synonym candidates for terms that may or may not have synonyms.",
        "This is thus a scenario that more closely resembles how this method would actually be used in a real-life setting to populate a terminology with synonyms.",
        "Although the comparison with MeSH showed that terms with many synonyms in English also tend to have at least one synonym in Swedish, approximately 40% of them did not have any synonyms.",
        "It is thus not certain that the terms used in this evaluation all have at least one synonym, which was also noted by the evaluator in this study."

        "In this study, we have demonstrated a method that could potentially be used to expedite the language porting process of terminologies such as SNOMED CT. With access to a large corpus of clinical text in the target language and an initial set of terms, this language-independent method is able to extract and present candidate synonyms to the lexicographer, thereby providing valuable support for semi-automatic terminology development.",
        "A means to model multiword terms in a distributional framework is an important feature of the method and is crucial for the synonym extraction task."
