        "This paper describes the technical contribution of the supporting resources provided for the BioNLP Shared Task 2013.",
        "Following the tradition of the previous two BioNLP Shared Task events, the task organisers and several external groups sought to make system development easier for the task participants by providing automatically generated analyses using a variety of automated tools.",
        "Providing analyses created by different tools that address the same task also enables extrinsic evaluation of the tools through the evaluation of their contributions to the event extraction task.",
        "Such evaluation can improve understanding of the applicability and benefits of specific tools and representations.",

        "The BioNLP Shared Task (ST), first organised in 2009, is an ongoing series of events focusing on novel challenges in biomedical domain information extraction.",
        "In the first BioNLP ST, the organisers provided the participants with automatically generated syntactic analyses from a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (Kim et al., 2009) and similar syntactic analyses have since then been a key component of the best performing systems participating in the shared tasks.",
        "This initial work was followed up by a similar effort in the second event in the series (Kim et al., 2011), extended by the inclusion of software tools and contributions from the broader BioNLP community in addition to task organisers (Stenetorp et al., 2011).",
        "Although no formal study was carried out to estimate the extent to which the participants utilised the supporting resources in these previous events, we note that six participating groups mention using the supporting resources in published descriptions of their methods (Emadzadeh et al., 2011; McClosky et al., 2011; McGrath et al., 2011; Nguyen and Tsuruoka, 2011; Bjo?rne et al., 2012; Vlachos and Craven, 2012).",
        "These resources have been available also after the original tasks, and several subsequent studies have also built on the resources.",
        "Van Landeghem et al. (2012) applied a visualisation tool that was made available as a part of the supporting resources, Vlachos (2012) employed the syntactic parses in a follow-up study on event extraction, Van Landeghem et al. (2013) used the parsing pipeline created to produce the syntactic analyses, and Stenetorp et al. (2012) presented a study of the compatibility of two different representations for negation and speculation annotation included in the data.",
        "These research contributions and the overall positive reception of the supporting resources prompted us to continue to provide supporting resources for the BioNLP Shared Task 2013.",
        "This paper presents the details of this technical contribution."

      "text": [
        "Following the practice established in the BioNLP ST 2011, the organisers issued an open call for supporting resources, welcoming contributions relevant to the task from all authors of NLP tools.",
        "In the call it was mentioned that points such as availability for research purposes, support for well-established formats and access",
        "to technical documentation would considered favourable (but not required) and each supporting resource provider was asked to write a brief description of their tools and how they could potentially be applied to aid other systems in the event extraction task.",
        "This call was answered by three research groups that offered to provide a variety of semantic and syntactic analyses.",
        "These analyses were provided to the shared task participants along with additional syntactic analyses created by the organisers.",
        "However, some of the supporting resource providers were also participants in the main event extraction tasks, and giving them advance access to the annotated texts for the purpose of creating the contributed analyses could have given those groups an advantage over others.",
        "To address this issue, the texts were made publicly available one week prior to the release of the annotations for each set of texts.",
        "During this week, the supporting analysis providers annotated the texts using their automated tools and then handed the analyses to the shared task organisers, who made them available to the task participants via the shared task homepage."

        "This section describes the tools that were applied to create supporting resources by the three external groups.",
        "These contributions are summarised in",
        "Liu and John Wilbur of the National Center for Biotechnology Information provided the output of the shallow parser MedPost (Smith et al., 2004) and the BioLemmatizer tool (Liu et al., 2012), supplied in the BioC XML format1 for annotation interchange (Comeau et al., 2013).",
        "The BioC format address the problem of interoperability between different tools and platforms by providing a unified format for use by various tools.",
        "Both MedPost and BioLemmatizer are specifically designed",
        "for biomedical texts.",
        "The former annotates parts-of-speech and performs sentence splitting and to-kenisation, while the latter performs lemmatisation.",
        "In order to make it easier for participants to get started with the BioC XML format, the providers also supplied example code for parsing the format in both the Java and C++ programming languages.",
        "BioYaTeA Wiktoria Golik of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) and Thierry Hamon of University Paris 13 provided analyses created by BioYaTeA2 (Golik et al., 2013).",
        "BioYaTeA is a modified version of the YaTeA term extraction tool (Aubin and Hamon, 2006) adapted to the biomedical domain.",
        "Working on a noun-phrase level, BioYaTeA provides annotations such as lemmas, parts-of-speech, and constituent analysis.",
        "The output formats used were a simple tabular format as well as BioYaTeA-XML, an XML representation specific to the tool.",
        "Cocoa S. V. Ramanan of RelAgent Private Ltd provided the output of the Compact cover annotator (Cocoa) for biological noun phrases.3 Cocoa provides noun phrase-level entity annotations for over 20 different semantic categories such as macromolecules, chemicals, proteins and organisms.",
        "These annotations were made available for the annotated texts for the shared task along with the opportunity for the participants to use the Cocoa web API to annotate any text they may consider beneficial for their system.",
        "The data format used by Cocoa is a subset of the standoff format used for the shared task entity annotations, and it should thus be easy to integrate into existing event extraction systems."

        "Enju analyses its input in terms of phrase structure trees with predicate-argument structure links, represented in a specialised XML-format.",
        "To make the analyses of the parser more accessible to participants, we converted its output into the Penn Treebank (PTB) format using tools included with the parser.",
        "The use of the PTB format also allow for its output to be exchanged freely for that of the other two syntactic parsers and facilitates further conversions into dependency representations.",
        "McCCJ The BLLIP Parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), also variously known as the Charniak parser, the Charniak-Johnson parser, or the Brown reranking parser, has been applied in numerous biomedical domain NLP efforts, frequently using the self-trained biomedical model of McClosky (2010) (i.e. the McClosky-Charniak-Johnson or McCCJ parser).",
        "The BLLIP Parser is a constituency (phrase structure) parser and the applied model produces PTB analyses as its native output.",
        "These analyses were made available to participants without modification.",
        "Stanford The Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2002) is a widely used publicly available syntactic parser.",
        "As for the Enju and BLLIP parsers, a model trained on a dataset incorporating biomedical domain annotations is available also for the Stanford parser.",

        "To create the syntactic analyses from the Enju, BLLIP and Stanford Parser systems, we first applied a uniform set of preprocessing steps in order to normalise over differences in e.g. tokenisation and thus ensure that the task participants can easily swap the output of one system for another.",
        "This preprocessing was identical to that applied in the BioNLP 2011 Shared Task, and included sentence splitting of the annotated texts using the Genia Sentence Splitter,4 the application of a set of post-processing heuristics to correct frequently occurring sentence splitting errors, and Genia Treebank-like tokenisation (Tateisi et al., 2004) using a tokenisation script created by the shared task organisers.",
        "5 Since several studies have indicated that representations of syntax and aspects of syntactic dependency formalism differ in their applicability to support information extraction tasks (Buyko and Hahn, 2010; Miwa et al., 2010; Quirk et al., 2011), we further converted the output of each of the parsers from the PTB representation into three other representations: CoNNL-X, Stanford Dependencies and Stanford Collapsed Dependencies.",
        "For the CoNLL-X format we employed the conversion tool of Johansson and Nugues (2007), and for the two Stanford Dependency variants we used the converter provided with the Stanford CoreNLP tools (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "These analyses were provided to participants in the output formats created by the respective tools, i.e. the TAB-separated column-oriented format CoNLL and the custom text-based format of the Stanford Dependencies."

        "This level of usage of the supporting resources by the participants is thus comparable to what was observed for the 2011 shared task.",

        "ing resources, to aim for reproducibility, the processing pipeline containing pre/post-processing and conversion scripts for all the syntactic parses has been made publicly available under an open licence.",
        "The repository containing the pipeline also contains detailed instructions on how to reproduce the output and how it can potentially be applied to other texts.",
        "Given the experience of the organisers in analysing medium-sized corpora with a variety of syntactic parsers, many applied repeatedly over several years, we are also happy to report that the robustness of several publicly available parsers has recently improved noticeably.",
        "Random crashes, corrupt outputs and similar failures appear to be transitioning from being expected to rare occurrences.",
        "In this paper, we have introduced the supporting resources provided for the BioNLP 2013 Shared Task by the task organisers and external groups.",
        "These resources included both syntactic and semantic annotations and were provided to allow the participants to focus on the various novel challenges of constructing event extraction systems by minimizing the need for each group to separately perform standard processing steps such as syntactic analysis."
