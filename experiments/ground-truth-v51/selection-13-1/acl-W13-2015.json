        "Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is one of the most important goals of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Resources in the internet are expanding at an exponential speed, especially in the biomedical domain.",
        "Due to the astronomical growth of biomedical scientific literature, it is very important and urgent to develop automatic methods for knowledge extraction system.",
        "In the past few years, most researchers in the field of Biomedical Natural Language Processing focused on extracting information with simple structure, such as named entity recognition (NER), protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (Air-ola et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2009) and disease-gene association (Chun et al., 2006).",
        "While PPIs concern the flat relational schemas with no nested structures, bio-molecular events describe the detailed behavior of bio-molecules, which capture the biomedical phenomena from texts well.",
        "The BioNLP?09 shared task (Kim et al., 2009) provides the first entry to bio-event extraction.",
        "As described in BioNLP?09, a bio-event consists of a trigger and one or more arguments, where a trigger is a contiguous textual string containing one or more tokens and an argument is a participant (event or protein) with a corresponding type.",
        "For example, in the snippet ?interferon regulatory factor 4 gene expression?, the event trigger is ?expression?",
        "which is tagged by the event type ?Gene_expression?",
        "and the event argument is ?interferon regulatory factor 4?.",
        "Notably, bio-events may have arbitrary arguments and even contain other events as arguments, resulting in nested events.",
        "The complex event structure makes this task particularly attractive, drawing initial interest from many researchers.",
        "Bj?rne et al's (2009) system (referred to hereinafter as Uturku system) was the best pipeline system in BioNLP?09, achieving an F-score of 51.95% on the test data sets.",
        "After that, Miwa et al. (2010a, 2010b) compared different parsers and dependency representations on bio-event extraction task and obtained an F-score of 57.79% on development data sets and 56.00% on test data sets with parser ensemble.",
        "In contrast to the pipeline system which divided the event process into three stages, triggers detection, arguments detection and post processing, Poon and Vanderwende's (2010) and Riedel et al's (2009) joint models combined trigger recognition and argument detection by using a Markov logic network learning approach.",
        "After the BioNLP?09, the Genia event task (BioNLP?11 task 1, hereafter) in the BioNLP?11 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2011) introduced a same event extraction task on a new dataset.",
        "There were still some pipeline systems applied to Genia task 1, e.g. Bj?rne et al's (2011) system and Quirk et al's (2011) system.",
        "To the best of",
        "our knowledge, Miwa et al's (2012) pipeline system incorporating domain adaptation and co-reference resolution, is the best biomedical event extraction system on BioNLP'11 task 1 so far.",
        "The Genia event extraction task (BioNLP'13 task 1, hereafter) (Kim et al., 2013) in Bi-oNLP'13 Shared Task is consistent with the Genia task in BioNLP'11 Shared task.",
        "Nevertheless, BioNLP'13 task 1 focuses on event extraction from full texts while BioNLP?11 task 1 contains abstracts and full texts.",
        "Furthermore, the corefe-rence resolution task separated from event extraction task in BioNLP'11 is integrated to Bi-oNLP'13 task 1, and there are more event types in the BioNLP'13 task 1 than those in BioNLP'11 task 1.",
        "The BioNLP?13 shared task contains three parts, the training corpus, the development corpus and the test corpus.",
        "The training corpus consists of 10 full texts containing 2792 events.",
        "The development corpus for optimizing the parameters involves 10 full texts containing 3184 events, while the test corpus is composed of 14 full texts including 3301 events.",
        "To avoid the researchers optimizing parameters on the test corpus, it is not published, and we have the permission to combine the training corpus and the development corpus as training set.",
        "However, we extend BioNLP'13 training set by adding the abstracts of training set and development set in Bi-oNLP'11 task 1 rather than merging the development set of BioNLP'13 into the training set.",
        "Our system generally follows the Uturku system reported by Bj?rne et al. (2009), and uses a simple but efficient way to reduce the cascading errors.",
        "The Uturku system was a pipeline of trigger detection, argument detection and post-processing.",
        "Each of its components was simple to implement by reducing event extraction task into independent classification of triggers and arguments.",
        "Moreover, the Uturku system developed rich features and made extensive use of syntactic dependency parse graphs, and the rules in the post-processing step were efficient and simple.",
        "However, the stages of the pipeline introduced cascading errors, meaning that the trigger missed in the trigger detection would never be recalled in the following stages.",
        "By changing the pipeline and adding argument information in trigger detection, we construct a model for extracting complex events using rich features and achieve better performance than the baseline system implemented according to Bj?rne et al's (2009) paper."
