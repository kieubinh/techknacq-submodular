        "Most of them are binary relation such as protein-protein interactions, gene-disease and drug-protein relations.",
        "However there are more complex events in origin biomedical data.",
        "The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST) is one of the efforts to promote extracting fine-grained and complex relations in biomedical domain.",
        "BioNLP Shared Task 2013 has the six event extraction tasks such as GENIA Event Extraction (GE), Cancer Genetics (CG), Pathway Curation (PC), Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO), Gene Regulation Network (GRN) and Bacteria Biotopes (BB).",
        "The GE task has three subtasks, task 1 is detection of events with their main arguments, task 2 extends this to detection of sites defining the exact molecular location of interactions, and task 3 adds the detection of whether",
        "events are stated in a negated or speculative context.",
        "In event extraction, common approaches use Rule-based (Kaljurand et al., 2009; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011), Machine Learning (ML)-based (Bj?rne at al., 2009; Miwa et al., 2010) and hybrid methods (Ahmed et al., 2009; Riedel, McClosky et al., 2011).",
        "Recently, (Riedel et al., 2011) present an approach based on optimization of scoring sets of binary variables.",
        "The model and a variant model (hybrid model) gained the second and first place in BioNLP-ST 2011, proving the effect of their approach.",
        "According to the summaries of BioNLP-ST 2009 and 2011 (Kim., 2011), the results of ML-based method are better than the rule-based method.",
        "However ML is non-trivial to apply.",
        "The summary also indicates that high precision, for simple events, can be achieved by Rule-based approach.",
