        "The BioNLP 2013 Shared Task focuses on information extraction in the biomedical domain and comprises of a range of extraction tasks.",
        "Our system was developed to participate within the Genia Event Extraction task (GE), which focuses on the detection of gene events and their regulation.",
        "The task considers 13 different types of events which can be divided into four groups: simple events, bindings, protein modifications and regulations.",
        "All events consist of a core event, which contains a trigger word and a theme.",
        "With the exception of regulation events, the theme always refer to a protein.",
        "A regulation event theme can either refer to a protein or to another event.",
        "Binding events can include up to two proteins as themes.",
        "In addition to the core event, events may include additional arguments such as ?cause?",
        "or ?to location?.",
        "Figure 1 shows examples of events from the BioNLP 2013 corpus.",
        "More details about the Genia Event task can be found in Kim et al. (2011).",
        "Previous editions of the BioNLP Shared Task took place in 2009 (Kim et al., 2009) and 2011",
        "task: a phosphorylation event consisting of a trigger and a protein and a positive-regulation event consisting of a trigger, a theme referring to an event and a cause argument.",
        "(Kim et al., 2011).",
        "Promising approaches in the most recent competition were event parsing (Mc-Closky et al., 2011) and dual decomposition models (Riedel and McCallum, 2011).",
        "The winner of the GE task 2011, FAUST (Riedel et al., 2011), combined these two approaches by using result from the event parser as an additional input feature for the dual decomposition.",
        "The UTurku system of Bjo?rne et al. (2009) was the winner of the GE task in 2009.",
        "The system was based on a pipeline containing three main stages: trigger detection, argument detection and post-processing.",
        "Bjo?rne and Salakoski (2011) improved the performance of this system for BioNLP 2011, but was outperformed by FAUST.",
        "Our approach to the BioNLP Shared Task relies on separating the process of event classification into multiple stages and creates separate classifiers for each event type.",
        "Our system begins by preprocessing the input text, followed by multiple classification stages and a post-processing stage.",
        "The preprocessing applies tokenization, sentence splitting and dictionary-based trigger detection, similar to Bui and Sloot (2011).",
        "Classification is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and uses three main stages: trigger-protein detection, trigger-event detection and event-cause detection.",
        "Post-processing is a combination of classification and rule-based approaches.",
        "We train a separate classifier for each event type, rather that relying on a single classifier to recognise trigger-theme rela",
        "tionships for all event types.",
        "In addition, we also optimise the SVM's parameters and apply feature selection for each event type.",
        "Our system participated in subtask 1 of the GE task, which involves the recognition of core events, including identification of their ?cause?.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes our system in detail (Section 2), presents results from the Genia Event Extraction task (Section 3) and draws the conclusions of this work (Section 4)."

        "Tokens containing punctuation marks are split, as are tokens containing a protein or suffixes which could be utilised as a trigger word.",

        "will be split into ?Foxp3 - expression?, since ?Foxp3?",
        "is as a protein and ?expression?",
        "a suffix often used as trigger word.",

        "The Stanford Parser3 is used to extract part-of-speech tags, syntax trees and dependency trees.",
        "The names of proteins in the text are provided in the GE task, however the trigger words that form part of the relation have to be identified.",
        "Our system uses a dictionary-based approach to trigger detection.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it is easy to implement and allows us to easily identify as many potential trigger words as possible.",
        "However, it will also match many words which are not true triggers.",
        "We rely on the classification stage later in our approach to identify the true trigger words.",
        "A training corpus was created by combining the training data from the 2013 Shared Task with all of the data from the 2011 task.",
        "All words that are used as a trigger in this corpus are extracted and stored in a set of dictionaries.",
        "Separate dictionaries are created for different event types (e.g. localization, binding).",
        "Each type has its own dictionary,",
        "with the exception of protein modification events (protein modification, phosphorylation, ubiquiti-nation, acetylation, deacetylation).",
        "The corpus did not contain enough examples of trigger terms for these events and consequently they are combined into a single dictionary.",
        "The words in the dictionaries are stemmed and sorted by their frequency.",
        "Irrelevant words (such as punctuations) are filtered out.",
        "Trigger detection is carried out by matching the text against each of the trigger dictionaries, starting with the trigger words with the highest frequency.",
        "A word may be annotated as a trigger word by different dictionaries.",
        "If a word is annotated as a trigger word for a specific event then it may not be annotated as being part of another trigger word from the same dictionary.",
        "This restriction prevents the generation of overlapping trigger words for the same event as well as preventing too many words being identified as potential triggers."

        "The second takes all classified events and tries to detect regulation events consisting of a trigger and a theme that refers to one of these events (see positive-regulation event in figure 1).",
        "In addition to a trigger and theme, regulation and protein modification events may also include a cause argument.",
        "The third stage is responsible for identifying this additional argument for events detected in the previous two stages.",
        "Classification in each stage is always between pairs of object: trigger-protein (stage 1), trigger-event (stage 2), event-protein (stage 3) or event-event (stage 3).",
        "At each stage the role of the classifier is to determine whether there is in fact a relation between a given pair of objects.",
        "This approach is unable to identify binding events involving two themes.",
        "These are identified in a post-processing step (see Section 2.3) which considers binding events involving the same trigger word and decides whether they should be merged or not.",
        "The classification process uses a wide range of features constructed from words, stemmed words, part of speech tags, NE tags and syntactic analysis.",
        "Object Features: The classification process always considers a pair of objects (e.g. trigger-protein, trigger-event, event-protein).",
        "Object features are derived from the tokens (words, stemmed words etc.)",
        "which form the objects.",
        "We consider the head of this object, extracted from the dependency tree, as a feature and all other tokens within that object as bag of word features.",
        "We also consider the local context of each object and include the three words preceding and following the objects as features.",
        "Sentence Features: The tokens between the two objects are also used to form features.",

        "These features are formed from the paths between the the objects within dependency tree, collapsed dependency tree and phrase-structure tree.",
        "The paths are formed from tokens, stemmed tokens etc.",
        "The features are organised into 57 groups for use in the feature selection process described later.",
        "For example all of the features relating to the bag of words between the two objects in the dependency tree are treated as a single group, as are all of the features related to the POS tags in the three word range around one of the objects.",
        "Using the training data, a set of positive and negative examples were generated to train our classifiers.",
        "Pairs of entities which occur in a specific relation in the training data are used to generate positive examples and all other pairs used to generate negative ones.",
        "Since we do not attempt to resolve coreference, we only consider pairs of entities that occur within the same sentence.",
        "Due to the fact that we run a dictionary-based trigger detection on a stemmed corpus we might cover many trigger words, but unfortunately also many false ones.",
        "To handle this situation our classifier should learn whether a word serves as a trigger of an event or not.",
        "To generate sufficient negative examples we also run the trigger detection on the training data set, which already contains the right trigger words.",
        "Two optimisation steps were applied to the relation classifiers and found to improve their performance.",
        "SVM bias adjustment: The ratio of positive and negative examples differs in the training data generated for each relation.",
        "For instance the data for the protein catabolism event contains 156 positive examples and 643 negatives ones while the gene expression event has 3617 positive but 34544 negative examples.",
        "To identify the best configuration for two SVM parameters (cost and gamma), we ran a grid search for each classification step using 5-fold cross validation on the training set.",
        "Feature Selection: We also perform feature selection for each event type.",
        "We remove each feature in turn and carry out 5-fold cross validation on the training data to identify whether the F-measure improves.",
        "If improvement is found then the feature that leads to the largest increase in F-measure is removed from the feature set for that event type and the process repeated.",
        "The process is continued until no improvement in F-measure is observed when any of the features are removed.",
        "The set of features which remain are used as the final set for the classifier.",
        "The feature selection shows the more positive training examples we have for an event type the fewer features are removed.",
        "For example, gene expression events have the highest amount of positive examples (3617) and achieve the best F-measure score without removing any feature.",
        "On the other hand, there are just 156 training examples for protein catabolism events and the best results are obtained when 39 features are removed.",
        "On average we remove around 14 features for each event classifier.",
