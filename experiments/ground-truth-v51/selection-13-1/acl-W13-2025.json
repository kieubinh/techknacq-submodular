        "The Bacteria Biotope Task (Bossy et al., 2011; Bossy et al., 2012) is one of the new challenges in this domain, which was firstly presented in the BioNLP 2011 Shared Task.",

        "Such a resource would be of great value for research studies and applications in several fields such as microbiology, health sciences, and food processing.",
        "Three teams participated in the Bacteria Biotope Task using different methodologies (Bossy et al., 2011; Bossy et al., 2012).",
        "Bibliome INRA (Ratkovic et al., 2012), which achieved the best F-score (45%) among these teams, implemented a system which used both linguistic features and reasoning over an ontology to predict location boundaries and types.",

        "UTurku (Bjo?rne et al., 2012), presented a machine-learning based system which can be used to find solutions for all main tasks with a few alteration in the system.",
        "UTurku used this generic system with additional named entity recognition patterns and external resources, whereas JAIST (Nguyen and Tsuruoka, 2011) used CRFs in order to recognize entities and their types.",
        "UTurku and JAIST treated event extraction as a classification problem by using machine learning approaches, while Bibliome created and utilized a trigger-word list.",
        "Bibliome tried to find events by checking if a trigger-word and entities co-occur in the scope of the same sentence.",
        "Bibliome was the only team that considered coreference resolution.",

        "The Bacteria Biotope Task (BB) in the BioNLP 2013 Shared Task (Bossy et al., 2013) gives another opportunity to scientists to develop and compare their systems on a reliable platform.",
