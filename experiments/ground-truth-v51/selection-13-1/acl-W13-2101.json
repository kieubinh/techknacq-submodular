        "Surface Realization is the task of producing fluent text from some kind of formal, abstract representation of meaning (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "However, while it is obvious what the output of a natural language generation component should be, namely text, there is little to no agreement on what its input formalism should be (Evans et al., 2002).",
        "Since open-domain semantic parsers are able to produce formal semantic representations nowadays (Bos, 2008; Butler and Yoshimoto, 2012), it would be natural to see generation as a reversed process, and consider such semantic representations as input of a surface realization component.",
        "The idea of using large text corpora annotated with formal semantic representations for robust generation has been presented recently (Basile and Bos, 2011; Wanner et al., 2012).",
        "The need for formal semantic representations as a basis for NLG was expressed already much earlier by Power (1999), who derives semantic networks enriched with scope information from knowledge representations for content planning.",
        "In this paper we take a further step towards the goal of generating text from deep semantic representations, and consider the issue of aligning the representations with surface strings that capture their meaning.",
        "First we describe the basic idea of aligning semantic representations (logical forms) with surface strings in a formalism-independent way (Section 2).",
        "Then we apply our method to a well-known and widely-used semantic formalism, namely Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), first demonstrating how to represent Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) as graphs (Section 3) and showing that the resulting Discourse Representation Graphs (DRGs) are equivalent to DRSs but are more convenient to fulfill word-level alignment (Section 4).",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we present a method that generates partial surface strings for each discourse referent occurring in the semantic representation of a text, and composes them into a complete surface form.",
        "All in all, we think this would be a first and important step in surface realization from formal semantic representations."

        "Several different formal semantic representations have been proposed in the literature, and although they might differ in various aspects, they also have a lot in common.",
        "Many semantic representations (or logical forms as they are sometimes referred to) are variants of first-order logic and share basic building blocks such as entities, properties, and relations, complemented with quantifiers, negation and further scope operators.",
        "A simple snapshot of a formal meaning representation is the following (with symbols composed out of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) synset identifiers to abstract away from natural language): blue#a#1(x) ?",
        "cup#n#1(x) How could this logical form be expressed in natural language?",
        "Or put differently, how could we",
        "realize the variable x in text?",
        "As simple as it is, x describes ?a blue cup?, or if your target language is Italian, ?una tazza blu?, or variants hereof, e.g. ?every blue cup?",
        "(if x happens to be bound by universally quantified) or perhaps as ?una tazza azzurra?, using a different adjective to express blueness.",
        "This works for simple examples, but how does it scale up to larger and more complex semantic representations?",
        "In a way, NLG can be viewed as a machine translation (MT) task, but unlike translating from one natural language into another, the task is here to translate a formal (unambiguous) language into a natural language like English or Italian.",
        "Current statistical MT techniques are based on large parallel corpora of aligned source and target text.",
        "In this paper we introduce a method for precise alignment of formal semantic representations and text, with the purpose of creating a large corpus that could be used in NLG research, and one that opens the way for statistical approaches, perhaps similar to those used in MT.",
        "Broadly speaking, alignments between semantic representations and surface strings can be made in three different ways.",
        "The simplest strategy, but also the least informative, is to align a semantic representation with a sentence or complete text without further information on which part of the representation produces what part of the surface form.",
        "This might be enough to develop statistical NLG systems for small sentences, but probably does not scale up to handle larger texts.",
        "Alternatively, one could devise more complex schemes that allow for a more fine-grained alignment between parts of the semantic representation and surface strings (words and phrases).",
        "Here there are two routes to follow, which we call the minimal and maximal alignment.",
        "In maximal alignment, each single piece of the semantic representation corresponds to the words that express that part of the meaning.",
        "Possible problems with this approach are that perhaps not every bit of the semantic representation corresponds to a surface form, and a single word could also correspond to various pieces in the semantic representation.",
        "This is an interesting option to explore, but in this paper we present the alternative approach, minimal alignment, which is a method where every word in the surface string points to exactly one part of the semantic representation.",
        "We think this alignment method forms a better starting point for the development of a statistical NLG component.",
        "With sufficient data in the form of aligned texts with semantic representations, these alignments can be automatically learned, thus creating a model to generate surface forms from abstract, logical representations.",
        "However, aligning semantic representations with words is a difficult enterprise, primarily because formal semantic representations are not flat like a string of words and often form complex structures.",
        "To overcome this issue we represent formal semantic representations as a set of tu-ples.",
        "For instance, returning to our earlier example representation for ?blue cup?, we could represent part of it by the tuples ?blue#a#1,arg,x?",
        "and ?cup#n#1,arg,x?.",
        "For convenience we can display this as a graph (Figure 1).",
        "Note that in this example several tuples are not shown for clarity (such as conjunction and the quantifier).",
        "We show below that we can indeed represent every bit of semantic information in this format without sacrificing the capability of alignment with the text.",
        "The important thing now is to show how alignments between tuples and words can be realized, which is done by adding an element to each tuple denoting the surface string, for instance ?cup#n#1,arg,x,?tazza?",
        "?, as in Figure 2.",
        "face forms in two languages.",
        "We can further refine the alignment by saying something about the local order of surface expressions.",
        "Again, this is done by adding an element to the tuple, in this case one that denotes the local order of a logical term.",
        "We will make this clear by continuing with our example, where we add word order encoded as numerical indices in the tuple, e.g.",
        "?cup#n#1,arg,x,?tazza?,2?, as Figure 3 shows.",
        "From these graphs we can associate the term",
        "x with the surface strings ?a blue cup?",
        "and ?una tazza blu?.",
        "But the way we express local order is not limited to words and can be employed for partial phrases as well, if one adopts a neo-Davidsonian event semantics with explicit thematic roles.",
        "This can be achieved by using the same kind of numerical indices already used for the alignment of words.",
        "The example in Figure 4 shows how to represent an event ?hit?",
        "with its thematic roles, preserving their relative order.",
        "We call surface forms ?partial?",
        "or ?incomplete?",
        "when they contain variables, and ?complete?",
        "when they only contain tokens.",
        "The corresponding partial surface form is then ?y hit z?, where y and z are place-holders for surface strings.",
        "This is the basic idea of aligning surface strings with parts of a deep semantic representation.",
        "Note that precise alignment is only possible for words with a lexical semantics that include first-order variables.",
        "For words that introduce scope operators (negation particles, coordinating conjuncts) we can't have the cake and eat it: specifying the local order with respect to an entity or event variable directly and at the same time associating it with an operator isn't always possible.",
        "To solve this we introduce surface tuples that complement a semantic representation to facilitate perfect alignment.",
        "We will explain this in more detail in the following sections."

        "The choice of semantic formalism should ideally be independent from the application of natural language generation itself, to avoid bias and specific tailoring the semantic representation to one's (technical) needs.",
        "Further, the formalism should have a model-theoretic backbone, to ensure that the semantic representations one works with actually have an interpretation, and can consequently be used in inference tasks using, for instance, automated deduction for first-order logic.",
        "Given these criteria, a good candidate is Discourse Representation Theory, DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), that captures the meaning of texts in the form of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs).",
        "DRSs are capable of effectively representing the meaning of natural language, covering many linguistic phenomena including pronouns, quantifier scope, negation, modals, and presuppositions.",
        "DRSs are recursive structures put together by logical and non-logical symbols, as in predicate logic, and in fact can be translated into first-order logic formulas (Muskens, 1996).",
        "The way DRSs are nested inside each other give DRT the ability to explain the behaviour of pronouns and presuppositions (Van der Sandt, 1992).",
        "Aligning DRSs with texts with fine granularity is hard because words and phrases introduce different kinds of semantic objects in a DRS: discourse referents, predicates, relations, but also logical operators such as negation, disjunction and implication that introduce embedded DRSs.",
        "A precise alignment of a DRS with its text on the level of words is therefore a non-trivial task.",
        "To overcome this issue, we apply the idea presented in the previous section to DRSs, making all recursion implicit by representing them as directed graphs.",
        "We call a graph representing a DRS a Discourse Representation Graph (DRG, in short).",
        "DRGs encode the same information as DRSs, but are expressed as a set of tuples.",
        "Essentially, this is done by reification over DRSs ?",
        "every DRSs gets a unique label, and the arity of DRS conditions increases by one for accommodating a DRS label.",

        "DRS-conditions are basic (representing properties or relations) or complex (to handle negation and disjunction).",

        "?C,argument,A?",
        "means that C is a condition with argument A (argument tuples), with the subtypes internal, external, instance, scope, antecedent, and consequence.",
        "With the help of a concrete example, it is easy to see that DRGs have the same expressive power as DRSs.",
        "Consider for instance a DRS with negation, before and after labelling it (Figure 6):",
        "Now, from the labelled DRS we can derive the following three referent tuples: ?K1,referent,x?, ?K1,referent,y?, and ?K2,referent,z?",
        "; the following four condition tuples: ?K1,relation,c1:r?, ?K1,unary,c2:?",
        "?, ?K2,concept,c3:p?, and ?K2,relation,c4:s?",
        "; and the following argument tuples: ?c1:r,internal,x?, ?c1:r,external,y?, ?c2:?,scope,K2?, ?c3:p,instance,x?, ?c4:s,internal,z?, and ?c4:s,external,y?.",
        "From these tuples, it is straightforward to recreate a labelled DRS, and by dropping the labels subsequently, the original DRS resurfaces again.",
        "For the sake of readability we sometimes leave out labels in examples throughout this paper.",
        "In addition, we also show DRGs in graph-like pictures, where the tuples that form a DRG are the edges, and word-alignment information attached at the tuple level is shown as labels on the graph edges, as in Figure 9.",
        "In such graphs, nodes representing discourse referents are square shaped, and nodes representing conditions are oval shaped.",
        "Note that labelling conditions is crucial to distinguish between syntactically equivalent conditions occurring in different (embedded) DRSs.",
        "Unlike Power's scoped semantic network for DRSs, we don't make the assumption that conditions appear in the DRS in which their discourse referents are introduced (Power, 1999).",

        "Packed semantic representations (leaving scope underspecified) also resemble flat representations (Copestake et al., 1995; Reyle, 1993) and can be viewed as graphs, however they show less elaborated reification than the DRGs presented in this paper, and are therefore less suitable for precise alignment with surface strings."

        "We presented a formalism to align logical forms, in particular Discourse Representation Structures, with surface text strings.",
        "The resulting graph representations (DRGs), make recursion implicit by reification over nested DRSs.",

        "structure, DRGs can be precisely aligned with the text they represent at the word level.",
        "This is key to open-domain statistical Surface Realization, where words are learned from abstract, syntactic or semantic, representations, but also useful for other applications such as learning semantic representations directly from text (Le and Zuidema, 2012).",
        "The actual alignment between the tuples that form a DRG and the surface forms they represent is not trivial, and requires to make several choices.",
        "Given the alignment with text, we show that it is possible to directly generate surface forms from automatically generated word-aligned DRGs.",
        "To do so, a declarative procedure is presented, that generates complete surface forms from aligned DRGs in a compositional fashion.",
        "The method works in a bottom-up way, using discourse referents as starting points, then generating a surface form for each of them, and finally composing all of the surface form together into a complete text.",
        "We are currently building a large corpus of word-aligned DRSs, and are investigating machine learning methods that could automatically learn the alignments.",
        "Surprisingly, given that DRT is one of the best studied formalisms in formal semantics, there isn't much work on generation from DRSs so far.",
        "The contribution of this paper presents a method to align DRSs with surface strings, that paves the way for robust, statistical methods for surface generation from deep semantic representations."
