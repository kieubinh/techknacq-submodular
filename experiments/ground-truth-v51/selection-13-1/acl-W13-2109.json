        "However, the way gesture and speech should be combined in a referring act remains an open question.",
        "In particular, it is not clear whether, in planning a pointing gesture in conjunction with a description, an NLG system should seek to minimise the redundancy between them, e.g. by letting the pointing gesture indicate locative information, with other, non-locative properties of a referent included in the description.",
        "This question has a bearing on whether the gestural and spoken parts of referring acts are planned separately or arise from a common underlying computational mechanism.",

        "Referring Expression Generation (REG) is considered a core task in many NLG systems (Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012).",
        "Typically, the REG task is defined in terms of identification: a referent needs to be unambiguously identified in a discourse, enabling the reader or listener to pick it out from among its potential distractors.",
        "Most work in this area has focused on algorithms that select the content for definite descriptions (Dale, 1989; Dale and Reiter, 1995), or on the best form for a referring expression given the discourse context, for example, whether it should be a full definite description, a reduced one, or a pronoun (McCoy and Strube, 1999; Callaway and Lester, 2002; Krahmer and Theune, 2002).",
        "Less attention has been payed to the role of gestures in referring actions and the way these can be coupled with discursive strategies for referent identification.",
        "This question becomes particularly important in the context of multimodal systems, for example, those involving embodied conversational agents, where the ?naturalness?",
        "of an interaction hinges in part on the appropriate use of embodied actions, including referring actions.",
        "Multimodal strategies can also make communication more efficient.",
        "For example, Louwerse and Bangerter (2010) found that the use of pointing gestures resulted in significantly faster resolution of ambiguous referring expressions; crucially, this result was replicated when the pointing gesture was artificially generated, rather than made by a human.",
        "Like human communicators, embodied agents need the ability to plan multimodal referring acts, combining both linguistic reference and pointing.",
        "An important question is whether these two components of a referring act should be planned in order to minimise redundancy between them or not.",
        "For example, given that a pointing gesture can efficiently locate a target referent in a visual domain, should an accompanying description avoid mentioning locative properties, thereby minimising redundancy?",
        "This question is the main focus of this paper.",
        "However, it bears on a deeper issue, of relevance to the architecture of multimodal systems (and the cognitive architectures whose behaviours such systems seek to emulate): Should gestural and descriptive strategies be viewed as separate (implying that a REG module can plan its linguistic referring expressions more or less in",
        "dependently of whether a pointing gesture is also used) or should they be viewed as tightly coupled?",
        "If they are indeed coupled, are there any features of a linguistic description (for example, an object's location) which are excluded when a pointing gesture is used, or are linguistic features always redundant with pointing?",
        "The present paper addresses these questions in a data-driven fashion, using a multimodal corpus of dialogues collected specifically to study referring actions at both the linguistic and gestural levels.",
        "We focus on pointing (that is, deictic) gestures directed at an intended referent (as opposed to, say, iconic gestures) and investigate the extent to which pointing interacts with linguistic means for referent identification.",
        "Following an overview of previous work on pointing and reference (Section 2) and a description of the corpus (Section 3), we describe a number of machine-learning experiments that address the main empirical question (Section 4), concluding with a discussion."

        "There is a growing consensus in the psycholinguistic literature, especially following the work of McNeill (McNeill, 1985), that gesture and language share a number of underlying mental processes and are therefore coupled to a significant degree.",
        "This view is in part based on the observation that gestures are temporally coupled with speech and contribute meaningfully to the achievement of a communicative intention (McNeill and Duncan, 2000).",
        "For instance, in the example below, extracted from our corpus (see Section 3), a speaker identifies a landmark (composed of a collection of five circles) on a map through a combination of a pointing gesture and the mention of the size and colour of the elements making up the landmark.",
        "(1) there's a group of five large red ones [points] In this case, the pointing gesture further contributes to the communicative aim of identifying the cluster of five objects, in tandem with the visual features mentioned in the description.",
        "Mc-Neill's proposal (McNeill and Duncan, 2000) is that speech and gesture should be considered as the joint outcome of the language production process, rather than as outcomes of separate processes.",
        "Various models have been proposed which are more or less congruent with this view.",
        "For example, de Ruiter (2000) proposes that the two modalities are planned together at early stages of conceptualisation during speech production, while Kita and O?zyu?rek (2003) suggest that gestures are planned by spatio-motoric processes which differ from the planning of speech production, but interact with it at particular points.",
        "Recent computational work has also taken these ideas on board.",
        "For example, Kopp et.",
        "al.",
        "(2008) describe a system for the concurrent planning and generation of gesture and speech, whose architecture is inspired by Kita and O?zyu?rek (2003) and which makes use of ?multimodal concepts?",
        "(inspired by McNeill's ?growth points?)",
        "combining both propositional and visuo-spatial properties.",
        "This contrasts with earlier architectures, such as that proposed by Andre?",
        "and Rist (1996), where generation of text and gesture is undertaken by separate modules communicating with a central planner.",
        "The idea that the planning of language is tightly coupled with that of gesture raises the possibility that the two modalities may overlap to different degrees.",
        "Gesture may be completely redundant with speech, or may encode aspects of the communicative intention that are not included in the linguistic message itself.",
        "This raises an interesting question for multimodal REG: are there features of objects that tend to be mentioned in tandem with a pointing gesture; if so, which are they?",
        "For example, the reference in (1) mentions the size and colour of the landmark, but not its location, possibly suggesting that the speaker relied on pointing to convey the ?where?",
        "of the target referent, as opposed to the ?what?, which is conveyed by the description.",
        "This, however, is not the case in the example below, where pointing is accompanied by a mention of the referent's location.",
        "(2) [...] the red ones directly to the left [...] [points] There are at least two views on the relationship between pointing and describing (de Ruiter et al., 2012).",
        "On the one hand, the trade-off hypothesis holds that the decision to use a pointing gesture depends on the effort or ?cost?",
        "involved (the further away from the speaker and the smaller a referent is, the more costly it would be to point at it), compared to the effort involved in describing a referent linguistically.",
        "On the other hand, pointing and (some aspects of) describing might proceed hand in hand, so that",
        "there is some degree of redundancy between the two modalities.",
        "Under this view, pointing may be chosen not based on (low) cost assessment but as part of a specifically multimodal cognitive strategy.",
        "Evidence for the trade-off hypothesis is reported by Bangerter (2004), who found that, as pointing became easier in a task-oriented dialogue (because the distance between the speaker and the referent was shorter), there was a decrease in verbal effort, as measured by the number of words produced, as well as a decrease in the use of locative and visual features such as colour.",
        "Piwek (2007) also found that referring acts accompanied by pointing tended to include descriptions containing fewer properties than those which were not.",
        "These results are compatible with a view of the speaker/generator as essentially seeking to minimise effort in the communicative act, adopting the easiest available strategy that will not compromise communicative success (Beun and Cremers, 1998).",
        "Similar results are reported by van der Sluis and Krahmer (2007), who model the trade-off hypothesis in a multimodal REG algorithm based on the graph-based framework of Krahmer et.",
        "al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The algorithm chooses to use pointing gestures, with various degrees of precision, depending on their cost relative to that of features that can be used in a linguistic description.",
        "There is also evidence against the trade-off model.",
        "Recent experimental work by de Ruiter et.",
        "al.",
        "(2012) showed that the tendency for speakers to point was unaffected by the difficulty of referring to an object using linguistic features, although pointing did decrease with repeated reference to the same entities.",
        "Interestingly, the authors observed a correlation between the rate of pointing and the use of locative properties of objects.",
        "This would appear to favour a model in which the linguistically describable features of objects are differentiated: speakers may be using locative properties and pointing together as part of a strategy to identify the ?where?",
        "of an object.",
        "This is in line with the observation by Louwerse and Bangerter (2010) that, in visual domains, using pointing gestures with locative expressions increases the speed with which references are resolved.",
        "The evidence from de Ruiter et.",
        "al would seem to contradict the assumptions underlying current multimodal REG models.",
        "As we have seen, van der Sluis and Krahmer (van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2007) assume a trade-off between speech and gesture.",
        "A similar assumption is made by Kranstedt and Wachsmuth (2005), who view pointing ges-turs as mainly concerned with the ?where?",
        "of an object.",
        "Their algorithm, which underlies the planning of multimodal references by a virtual agent, extends the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) as follows.",
        "Given an object in a 3D space, the algorithm first considers the possibility of producing an unambiguous pointing gesture; failing this, a pointing gesture covering the intended referent and some of its surrounding distractors may be planned.",
        "In the latter case, the algorithm then integrates other features of the object (e.g. its colour), in an effort to exclude the distractors that remain within the scope of the ambiguous point.",
        "One of the claims underlying this model is that ?absolute?",
        "location, which is covered by pointing, is given first preference after pointing itself, with other features of a referent being considered afterwards, in a preference order that will only use relative location if all other options (such as colour) are exhausted.",
        "In summary, the empirical evidence for the relationship between pointing and describing is mixed.",
        "While the view that the planning of language in different modalities should be tightly coupled has proven useful and productive, the precise way in which the two interact in a referring act is still an open question, especially where the relationship between location and the other features of a target referent is concerned.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we report on an empirical study that used machine learning methods with a view to establishing the relationship between descriptive features and pointing in multimodal references.",
        "Our study is not committed to a specific architecture for multimodal reference planning; rather, our aim is to establish whether pointing and describing can partly overlap in the information that they convey about a referent.",

        "Utterances were annotated with the features displayed in Table 1.",
        "Broadly, features are divided into four types: (a) Deictic/Anaphoric, pertaining to the use of deictic demonstratives, and/or references to previously identified entities; (ii) Visual, that is, corresponding to a landmark's perceptual properties; (iii) Locative, involving a description of the object's location; and (iv) Action, pertaining to gesture and gaze.",

        "The corpus consists of a total of 2255 director's 3A number of other dialogues were recorded, but were not included in the corpus because participants focused on their own private maps and never used pointing gestures, making it impossible to study the conditions under which such gestures are produced.",

        "As expected, linguistic features are much more frequent than pointing gestures.",
        "In fact only 16.4% of the utterances in the corpus are accompanied by pointing gestures.",
        "Previous studies, such as that by Beun and Cremers (Beun and Cremers, 1998) report a higher incidence of pointing (48% overall).",
        "Note, however, that Beun and Cremers focussed exclusively on first mention descriptions (which numbered 145 in all), while our corpus includes subsequent mentions, as well as multiple consecutive references to the same object divided over several utterances (which are counted separately in our totals).",
        "Table 3 shows frequency figures for the pointing gestures in the corpus relative to the type of object they refer to (group vs. singleton): in accordance with the trade-off theory, which predicts that larger objects should be easier to point at, we see a significant difference (?2(1) = 4.769, p = 0.028) between the two types, with more pointing occurring with group objects (that is, in group maps)."

        "In much of the work discussed in Section 2, the generation of pointing gestures is viewed as dependent on physical characteristics of the referents, in other words on their being suitable for pointing.",

        "In the present paper, by contrast, we are interested in investigating the relation between pointing and linguistic means of referent identification.",
        "More specifically, we address the question to what degree the different linguistic expressions used by the speaker to refer to objects in",

        "Note that this question addresses the correlation between properties in a description and the occurrence of pointing, rather than the issue of how pointing and describing should be planned.",
        "Nevertheless, as we have emphasised in Section 2, the question of co-occurrence of the two referential strategies does have a bearing on architectural issues.",
        "A first set of experiments were run in order to test the general trade-off hypothesis.",
        "We tested a number of classifiers on the task of classifying the binary feature point, given all the linguistic features in the corpus.",

        "They are all explained and exemplified in Table 1 with the exception of MapConfl, which indicates whether a specific case in the data comes from a group or a singleton map.",
        "This feature was included because, as noted in the previous section, whether a target landmark was a singleton or a group made a difference, presumably because groups are larger and more visually salient.",
        "Note further that one of the Action features, GZ (gaze), is ignored in the experiments because it is an almost univocal predictor of pointing.",
        "Indeed, gazing is involved roughly every time Point has the value y (yes) (but not the other way round).",
        "The experiments were run using the Weka (Wit-ten and Frank, 2005) tool, which gives access to many different algorithms, and 10-fold cross-validation was used throughout.",

        "The F-measure obtained by this method is somewhat high at 0.761, because there are relatively few pointing gestures in the data.",
        "The second baseline, which provides a slightly more interesting result against which to evaluate the other classifiers, is provided by OneR.",
        "It achieves an F-measure of 0.765 by predicting a pointing gesture if DIR >= 2.5, in other words if there are at least 2.5 occurrences of direction expressions in the utterance.",

        "Indeed, it is possible to predict pointing gestures on the basis of the linguistic features used.",
        "In particular, the results suggest a difference between features that express locative properties and those having to do with the visual description of the same object (its colour, size and shape).",
        "More specifically, it would seem that locative features are more useful to the classifiers than visual properties.",
        "To test this second hypothesis, we ran a series of experiments where the task was still to predict pointing gestures, but different subsets of the linguistic features were tested one at the time.",
        "For each feature combination, we run the classification using J48, Naive Bayes and the Logistic regression algorithm.",

        "Note that the term Loc is used to refer to all the locative attributes AP, DIR, RP, AP and FP,",
        "while Visual refers to S, Sh and C. The best results are those obtained when the complete feature set is used in the training.",

        "The automatic classification experiments described above show that to a certain extent, the pointing gestures occurring in the MREDI corpus can be predicted based on the linguistic expressions used by the speaker in conjunction with pointing.",
        "More precisely, linguistic descriptions can be used to predict about one third of the pointing gestures that speakers have produced in the corpus.",
        "This is an interesting and novel result, which not only supports the general notion that gestures and speech should be seen as tightly coupled, but also suggests that this coupling does not result in a minimisation of redundancy between the two modalities.",
        "Rather, it appears that a number of pointing gestures accompanied descriptions containing locative properties, something that contradicts the predictions of models based on the trade-off hypothesis (Kranstedt and Wachsmuth, 2005; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2007).",
        "There are a number of limitations of the present study, which we plan to address in future work.",
        "First, pointing gestures in our corpus were relatively scarce (16.4% of utterances were accompanied by pointing).",
        "This in part explains the relative accuracy of our baselines: predicting the majority class (that is, no pointing) in every case will clearly yield reasonable results given that the size of the class is so large.",
        "On the other hand, the relative scarcity of pointing may also indicate that pointing is somewhat more costly than linguistic description, in cognitive and physical terms.",
        "In fact, the difference we see in the number of pointing gestures between singleton and group maps also seems to confirm this assumption: in the group maps, where objects are larger, and thus more easily pointed at according to the trade-off model, there are in fact significantly more pointing gestures.",
        "The incidence of pointing may also have been affected by the nature of the domains used: although the shared maps in the experiments were large and quite close to the interlocutors, the presence of objects of the same shape may have added to the general visual clutter of the maps, making pointing less likely.",
        "Another aspect of the data that we have not investigated is the presence of individual strategies.",
        "We know that speakers differ a lot in their use of gesturing as regards e.g. frequency, type of gesture and representation techniques.",
        "Recent models of gesture production for embodied agents are taking such differences into account (Neff et al., 2008; Bergmann and Kopp, 2009).",
        "Similarly, some speakers might have a greater preference for pointing than others.",
        "For example, Beun and Cremers (1998) note that certain speakers in their corpus explicitly stated that they had attempted to perform the task in their dialogues without pointing, in spite of their having been told that they could point.",
        "Recent data-driven experiments on referential descriptions by Dale and Viethen (Dale and Viethen, 2010), In a domain quite similar to the one used here, suggest that speakers do indeed cluster according to their preferred referential strategy.",
        "Similar assumptions have informed REG algorithms trained on the TUNA Corpus, in the context of the Generation Challenges (Gatt and Belz, 2010) (Bohnet, 2008; Di Fabbrizio et al., 2008).",
        "In future work, we plan to address this question in a multimodal context, where results by Piwek (2007) have already suggested that such individual strategies may play an important role.",
        "The hypothesis that specific combinations of pointing and linguistic descriptions (for example, an object's colour or size) can be excluded, is clearly not borne out by the data.",
        "There is, however, a tendency for locative features to act as stronger predictors of pointing gestures.",
        "Although the trend is not very strong, it is an interesting one since it confirms the experimental results by de Ruiter et.",
        "al.",
        "reviewed earlier (de Ruiter et al., 2012).",
        "This may suggest that a pointing gesture may ultimately be planned within the same system as locative features (i.e. the decision of whether or",
        "not to point is not dependent on the decision of whether or not to describe inherent, visual properties of the object, but on whether the object's location is to be indicated).",
        "Another feature that is worth exploring further is deixis, specifically the difference between proximal and distal deictic expressions and their interaction with pointing gestures.",
        "For example, Piwek et al. (2007) found that proximal deictic expressions tend to be associated with a more intensive attentional focusing mechanism, while Bangerter (2004) also observes an association between pointing and the use of deictic expressions.",
        "From an NLG perspective, our results suggest that decisions to generate a pointing gesture and those to select visual attributes might take place independently (perhaps in parallel, perhaps in different modules).",
        "From a cognitive perspective, it suggests two types of interaction between attention/vision and language/gesture, related to the description of the ?what?",
        "of an object and its ?where?",
        "(Landau and Jackendoff, 1993).",
        "Finally, our study focused on the relationship between the two modalities involved in a referential act, addressing the question of redundancy between them.",
        "We have not addressed the impact of the visual properties of a target referent in relation to its surrounding objects, on the choices speakers make in these two modalities.",
        "This is a priority for future work, given that the corpus was designed to balance the presence or absence of various visual properties of an object (see Section 3).",
        "Taking this even further, it remains to be investigated, for example, whether there would be interesting differences in the relationship betwene pointing and describing between 2D scenes of the kind used here, and 3D environments of the sort used by Kranstedt and Wachsmuth (2005).",
        "Another priority is to take into account the interactive nature of the dialogues, with particular focus on the follower's feedback to the director, as an indicator of the success of referential expressions.",
        "This is another aspect of the dialogue situation that may have an impact on planning multimodal referential acts."
