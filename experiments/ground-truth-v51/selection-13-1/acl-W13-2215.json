        "The approach first translates into Spanish simplified forms (de Gispert and Marin?o, 2008).",

        "These kind of morphology generation systems are trained with a relatively short amount of parallel data compared to standard SMT training corpora.",
        "Our main enhancement to this strategy is the",
        "addition of source-projected deep features to the target sentence in order to perform the morphology prediction.",
        "These features are Dependency Features and Semantic Role Labelling, obtained from the source sentence through Lund Dependency Parser2.",

        "Projected deep features are important to predict the correct verb morphology from clean and fluent text.",
        "However, the projection of deep features is sentence-fluency sensitive, making it unreliable when the baseline MT output is poor.",
