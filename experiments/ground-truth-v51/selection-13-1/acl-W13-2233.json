        "In this work, we consider the situation in which we have access to only a small amount of bitext for a given low resource language pair, and we wish to supplement an SMT model with additional translations and features estimated using comparable corpora in the source and target languages.",
        "Assuming access to a small amount ?Performed while faculty at Johns Hopkins University of parallel text is realistic, especially considering the recent success of crowdsourcing translations (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011; Ambati, 2011; Post et al., 2012).",
        "We frame the shortcomings of SMT models trained on limited amounts of parallel text1 in terms of accuracy and coverage.",
        "In this context, coverage refers to the number of words and phrases that a model has any knowledge of at all, and it is low when the training text is small, which results in a high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate.",
        "Accuracy refers to the correctness of the translation pairs and their corresponding probability features that make up the translation model.",
        "Because the quality of unsupervised automatic word alignments correlates with the amount of available parallel text and alignment errors result in errors in extracted translation pairs, accuracy tends to be low in low resource settings.",
        "Additionally, estimating translation probabilities2 over sparse training sets results in inaccurate feature scores.",
        "Given these deficiencies, we begin with a baseline SMT model learned from a small parallel corpus and supplement the model to improve its accuracy and coverage.",
