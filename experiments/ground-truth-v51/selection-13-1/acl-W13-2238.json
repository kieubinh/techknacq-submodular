        "Most state-of-the-art SMT systems get the statistics from which the different component models are estimated via heuristics using a Viterbi word alignment.",
        "The word alignment is usually generated with tools like GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), that apply the EM algorithm to estimate the alignment with the HMM or IBM-4 translation models.",
        "This is also the case for the phrases or rules which serve as translation units for the decoder.",
        "All phrases that do not violate the word alignment are extracted and their probabilities are estimated as relative frequencies (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "A number of different approaches have tried to do away with the heuristics and close this gap between the phrase table generation and translation decoding.",
        "However, most of these approaches either fail to achieve state-of-the-art performance or still make use of the word alignment or the extraction heuristics, e.g. as a prior in discriminative training or to initialize a generative or generatively inspired training procedure and are thus biased by their weaknesses.",
        "Here, we aim at moving towards the ideal situation, where a unified framework induces the phrases based on the same models as in decoding.",
        "We train the phrase table without using a word alignment or the extraction heuristics.",
        "Different from previous work, we are able to generate all possible phrase pairs on-the-fly during the training procedure.",
        "A further advantage of our proposed algorithm is that we use basically the same beam search as in translation.",
        "This makes it easy to reimplement by modifying any translation decoder, and makes sure that training and translation are consistent.",
        "In principle, we apply the forced decoding approach described in (Wuebker et al., 2010) with cross-validation to prevent over-fitting, but we initialize the phrase table with IBM-1 lexical probabilities (Brown et al., 1993) instead of heuristically extracted relative frequencies.",
        "The algorithm is extended with the concept of back-off phrases, so that new phrase pairs can be generated at training time.",
        "The size of the newly generated phrases is incremented over the training iterations.",
        "By introducing fallback decoding runs, we are able to successfully align the complete training data.",
        "Local language models are used for better phrase pair pre-selection.",
        "The experiments are carried out on the IWSLT 2011 Arabic-English shared task.",
        "We are able to show that it is possible and feasible to reach state-of-the-art performance without the need to word-align the bilingual training data.",
        "The small overlap of 18.5% between the trained and the heuristically extracted phrase table demonstrates the limitations of previous work, where training is initialized by the baseline phrase table or phrase selection is restricted by a word alignment.",
        "With a linear interpolation of phrase tables an improvement of 0.5% BLEU and 0.5% TER over the baseline can be achieved.",
        "The result in BLEU is statistically significant on the test set with 90% confidence.",
        "Further, we can confirm the observation of previous work, that phrases with near-zero entropies seem to be a disadvantage for translation quality.",
        "Although we use a phrase-based decoder here, the principles of our work can be applied to any statistical machine translation paradigm.",
        "The software used for our experiments is available under a non-commercial open source licence.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",

        "Only about 18.5% of the phrases from the trained table also appear in the heuristically extracted one.",

        "Then, we continue training in a more conventional fashion, allowing creation of new phrases only in fallback runs.",
        "As additional extensions to previous work we introduce fallback decoding runs for higher coverage of the data and local language models for better pre-selection of phrases.",

        "The small overlap of 18.5% between the trained and the heuristically extracted phrase table shows how initialization or restrictions based on word alignments would have biased the training procedure.",
        "We also analyzed the distribution of entropies within the phrase tables, confirming the previous observation that fewer near-zero entropy phrases are advantageous for decoding.",
        "We also showed that, in our setup, near-zero entropies are largely eliminated by phrase table interpolation.",
        "In future work we plan to apply this technique as a more principled way to train a wider range of models similar to (Duan et al., 2012).",
        "But even for the phrase models, we have only scratched the surface of its potential.",
