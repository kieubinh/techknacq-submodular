        "In the scope of Machine Translation (MT), Quality Estimation (QE) is the task consisting to evaluate the translation quality of a sentence or a document.",
        "This process may be useful for post-editors to decide or not to revise a sentence produced by a MT system (Specia, 2011; Specia et al., 2010).",
        "Moreover, it can be useful to decide if a translated document can be broadcasted or not (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010).",
        "The most obvious way to give a score to a translated sentence consists in using a machine learning approach.",
        "This approach is supervised: experts are asked to score translated sentences and with the obtained material, one learns a prediction model of scores.",
        "The main drawback of the machine learning approach is that it is supervised and requires huge data.",
        "To score a sentence is time-consuming.",
        "Moreau et al. in (Moreau and Vogel, 2012) dealt with this issue by proposing unsupervised similarity measures.",
        "In fact, the score of a translated sentence is defined by a measure giving the distance between it and the contents of an external corpus.",
        "The authors improve the results of the supervised approach but this method can be used only in the ranking task.",
        "Raybaud et al.",
        "(Raybaud et al., 2011) proposed a method to add errors in reference sentences (deletion, substitution, insertion).",
        "By this way, they build additional corpus in which each word can be associated with a label correct/not correct.",
        "But, it is not possible to predict the translation quality of sentences including these erroneous words.",
        "In this paper, we propose to increase the size of the training corpus.",
        "For that, we use the score given by experts to evaluate additional sentences from the post-edited and reference corpora.",
        "Practically, we extract from source and target sentences numerical vectors (features) and we learn a prediction model of the scores.",
        "Then, we apply this model to predict the scores of the post-edited and the reference sentences.",
        "And finally, we tune the predicted scores on a development corpus.",
        "The article is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we give an overview of our machine learning approach and of the features we use.",
        "Then, in Sections 3 and 4 we describe the corpora and how we increase the size of the training corpus by a partly-unsupervised approach.",
        "In section 5, we give results about this method and we end by a conclusion and perspectives.",
        "2 Overview of our quality estimation submission We submit a system for the task 1.1: one has to evaluate each translated sentence with a score between 0 and 1.",
        "This score is read as the HTER between the translated sentence and its post-edited version.",
        "Each translated sentence is assigned a",
        "score between 0 and 1.",
        "The score is calculated using several numerical or boolean features extracted according to the source and target sentences.",
        "We perform a regression of the feature space against [0..1].",
        "To this end, we use the Support Vector Machine algorithm (LibSVM toolkit (Chang and Lin, 2011)).",
        "We experimented only the linear kernel because our experience from last year (Langlois et al., 2012) showed that its performance are yet good while no parameters have to be tuned on a development corpus."

        "We extract information by the way of language model (perplexity, level of back-off, intra-lingual triggers) and translation table (IBM1 table, interlingual triggers).",
        "The features are defined at word level, and the features at sentence level are computed by averaging over each word in the sentence.",
        "In our system, we use, in addition to baseline features, ratio of source and target lengths; source and target likelihood computed with 5-gram language models (Duchateau et al., 2002) (in addition to 3-gram features from baseline); level of backoff n-gram based features (Uhrik and Ward, 1997).",
        "This feature indicates if the 3-gram, the 2-gram or the unigram corresponding to the word is in the language model.",
        "For likelihoods and levels of backoff, we use models trained on corpus read from left to right (classical way), and from right to left (sentences are reversed before training language models).",
        "This leads to two language models, and therefore to two values for each feature and side (source and target).",
        "Moreover, a common property of all n-gram and backoff based features is that a word can get a low score if it is actually correct but its neighbours are wrong.",
        "To compensate for this phenomenon we took into account the average score of the neighbours of the word being considered.",
        "More precisely, for every relevant feature x. defined at word level we also computed:",
        "The other features are intra-lingual features: each word is assigned its average mutual information with the other words in the sentence; interlingual features: each word in target sentence is assigned its average mutual information with the words in source sentence; IBM1 features: contrary to IBM1 based baseline features which take into account the number of translations, we use the probability values in the translation table between source and target words; basic parser (correction of bracketing, presence of end-of-sentence symbol); number and ratio of out-of-vocabulary words in source and target sentences.",
        "This leads to 49 features.",
        "A few ones are equivalent to or are strongly correlated to baseline ones.",
        "We remark that 27 features take into account the target sentence.",
