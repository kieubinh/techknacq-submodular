        "Discourse connectives should preserve their sense during translation, as they are often ambiguous and may convey more than one sense depending on the inter-sentential relation (causality, concession, contrast or temporal).",

        "In this paper, we present results of different Machine Translation systems for English-to-French and English-to-German pairs.",
        "More specifically, we measure the quality of machine translations of eight English discourse connectives: although, even though, meanwhile, since, though, while, however, and yet, adopting different approaches.",
        "This quality is measured using a dedicated metric named ACT (Accuracy of Connective Translation), a reference-based metric that assesses only connective translations.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present the ACT metric and its error rate.",
        "In section 3, we compare the ACT metric to previous machine translation evaluation metrics.",

        "We described the ACT metric in (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2013) and (Hajlaoui and Popescu-Belis, 2012).",
        "Its main idea is to detect, for a given explicit source discourse connective, its translation in a reference translation and in a candidate translation.",
        "ACT then compares and scores these translations.",
        "To identify the translations, ACT first uses a dictionary of possible translations of each discourse connective type, collected from training data and validated by humans.",
        "If a reference or a candidate translation contains more than one possible translation of the source connective, alignment information is used to detect the correct connective translation.",
        "If the alignment information is irrelevant (not equal to a connective), it then compares the word position (word index) of the source connective alignment with the index in the translated sentence (candidate or reference) and the set of candidate connectives to disambiguate the connective's translation.",
        "Finally, the nearest connective to the alignment is taken.",
        "ACT proceeds by checking whether the reference translation contains one of the possible translations of the connective in question.",
        "After that, it similarly checks if the candidate translation contains a possible translation of the connective.",
        "Fi",
        "nally, it checks if the reference connective found is equal (case 1), synonymous (case 2) or incompatible 1(case 3) to the candidate connective.",
        "Discourse relations can be implicit in the candidate (case 4), or in the reference (case 5) translation or in both of them (case 6).",
        "These different comparisons can be represented by the following 6 cases:",

        "ACT proposes a semi-automatic option by manually checking instances of case 5 and case 62.",
        "ACT returns the ratio of the total number of points to the number of source connectives according to the three versions: (1) ACTa counts only case 1 and case 2 as correct and all others cases as wrong, (2) ACTa5+6 excludes case 5 and case 6 and (3) ACTm considers the correct translations found by manual scoring of case 5 and case 6 noted respectively case5corr and case6corr to better consider these implicit cases.",

        "ACT is more accurate using the disambiguation module.",
        "We encourage to use the version without training since it only requires the installation of the GIZA++ tool.",

        "Estimating the effort that would have to be taken to port the ACT metric to new language pairs focusing on the same linguistic phenomena mainly depends on the size of parallel data sets containing the given source connective.",
