        "In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005), a probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) is induced from bilingual training corpora.",
        "In addition to continuous lexical phrases as in standard phrase-based translation, hierarchical phrases with usually up to two non-terminals are extracted from the word-aligned parallel training data.",
        "Hierarchical decoding is typically carried out with a parsing-based procedure.",
        "The parsing algorithm is extended to handle translation candidates and to incorporate language model scores via cube pruning (Chiang, 2007).",
        "During decoding, a hierarchical translation rule implicitly specifies the placement of the target part of a sub-derivation which is substituting one of its non-terminals in a partial hypothesis.",
        "The hierarchical phrase-based model thus provides an integrated reordering mechanism.",
        "The reorderings which are being conducted by the hierarchical decoder are a result of the application of SCFG rules, which generally means that there must have been some evidence in the training data for each reordering operation.",
        "At first glance one might be tempted to believe that any additional designated phrase orientation modeling would be futile in hierarchical translation as a consequence of this.",
        "We argue that such a conclusion is false, and we will provide empirical evidence in this work that lexicalized phrase orientation scoring can be highly beneficial not only in standard phrase-based systems, but also in hierarchical ones.",
        "The purpose of a phrase orientation model is to assess the adequacy of phrase reordering during search.",
        "In standard phrase-based translation with continuous phrases only and left-to-right hypothesis generation (Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2008), phrase reordering is implemented by jumps within the input sentence.",
        "The choice of the best order for the target sequence is made based on the language model score of this sequence and a distortion cost that is computed from the source-side jump distances.",
        "Though the space of admissible reorderings is in most cases contrained by a maximum jump width or coverage-based restrictions (Zens et al., 2004) for efficiency reasons, the basic approach of arbitrarily jumping to uncovered positions on source side is still very permissive.",
        "Lexicalized reordering models assist the decoder in taking a good decision.",
        "Phrase-based decoding allows for a straightforward integration of lexicalized reordering models which assign",
        "different scores depending on how a currently translated phrase has been reordered with respect to its context.",
        "Popular lexicalized reordering models for phrase-based translation distinguish three orientation classes: monotone, swap, and discontinuous (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008).",
        "To obtain such a model, scores for the three classes are calculated from the counts of the respective orientation occurrences in the word-aligned training data for each extracted phrase.",
        "The left-to-right orientation of phrases during phrase-based search can be easily determined from the start and end positions of continuous phrases.",
        "Approximations may need to be adopted for the right-to-left scoring direction.",
        "The utility of phrase orientation models in standard phrase-based translation is plausible and has been empirically established in practice.",
        "In hierarchical phrase-based translation, some other types of lexicalized reordering models have been investigated recently (He et al., 2010a; He et al., 2010b; Hayashi et al., 2010; Huck et al., 2012a), but in none of them are the orientation scores conditioned on the lexical identity of each phrase individually.",
        "These models are rather word-based and applied on block boundaries.",
        "Experimental results obtained with these other types of lexicalized reordering models have been very encouraging, though.",
        "There are certain reasons why assessing the adequacy of phrase reordering should be useful in hierarchical search: ?",
        "Albeit phrase reorderings are always a result of the application of SCFG rules, the decoder is still able to choose from many different parses of the input sentence.",
        "?",
        "The decoder can furthermore choose from many translation options for each given parse, which result in different reorderings and different phrases being embedded in the reordering non-terminals.",
        "?",
        "All other models only weakly connect an embedded phrase with the hierarchical phrase it is placed into, in particular as the set of non-terminals of the hierarchical grammar only contains two generic non-terminal symbols.",
        "We therefore investigate phrase orientation mod-eling for hierarchical translation in this work."

        "We first compare the performance of the phrase orientation model in left-to-right direction only with the performance of the phrase orientation model in left-to-right and right-to-left direction (bidirectional).",
        "In all experiments, monotone, swap, and discontinuous orientation costs are treated as being from different feature functions in the log-linear model combination: we assign a separate scaling factor to each of the orientations.",
        "We have three more scaling factors than in the baseline for left-to-right direction only, and six more scaling factors for bidirectional phrase orientation scoring.",
        "As can be seen from the results table, the left-to-right model already yields a gain of 1.1 %BLEU over the baseline on the unseen test set (MT08).",
        "The bidirectional model performs just slightly better (+1.2 %BLEU over the baseline).",
        "With both models, the TER is reduced significantly as well (-1.1 / -1.3 compared to the baseline).",
        "We adopted the discriminative lexicalized reordering model (discrim.",

        "supplementary to the initial rule and glue rule.",
        "The swap rule allows adjacent phrases to be transposed.",
        "The setup with swap rule and bidirectional phrase orientation model is about as good as the setup with just the bidirectional phrase orientation model and no swap rule.",
        "If we furthermore mark the swap rule with a binary feature (binary swap feature), we end up at an improvement of +1.4 %BLEU over the baseline.",
        "The phrase orientation model again provides higher translation quality than the discriminative reordering model.",
        "In a third experiment, we investigate whether the phrase orientation model also has a positive influence when integrated into a syntax-augmented hierarchical system.",
        "We configured a hierarchical setup with soft syntactic labels (Stein et al., 2010), a syntactic enhancement in the manner of preference grammars (Venugopal et al., 2009).",
        "On MT08, the syntax-augmented system performs 0.9 %BLEU above the baseline setup.",
        "We achieve an additional improvement of +0.7 %BLEU and -1.3 TER by including the bidirectional phrase orientation model.",
        "Interestingly, the translation quality of the setup with soft syntactic labels (but without phrase orientation model) is worse than of the setup with phrase orientation model (but without soft syntactic labels) on MT08.",
        "The combination of both extensions provides the best result, though.",
        "In a last experiment, we finally took a very strong setup which improves over the baseline by 2.5 %BLEU through the integration of phrase-level discriminative word lexicon (DWL) models and triplet lexicon models in source-to-target (s2t) and target-to-source (t2s) direction.",

        "In this strong setup, the discriminative reordering model gives gains on the development set which barely carry over to the test set.",
        "Adding the bidirectional phrase orientation model, in contrast, results in a nice gain of +0.7 %BLEU and a reduction of 1.3 points in TER on the test set, even on top of the DWL and triplet lexicon models."
