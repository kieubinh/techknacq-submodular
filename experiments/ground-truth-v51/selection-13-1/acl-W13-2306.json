        "Nevertheless, the inherent cognitive load associated with nested segmentation and the sufficiency of simpler annotation schemes for building NLP applications have often lead researchers to define non-hierarchical or flat annotation schemes.",
        "The flat annotation, in essence, is a ?flattened?",
        "version of the tree.",
        "For instance, chunking of Natural Language (NL) text, which is often considered an essential preprocessing step for many NLP applications (Abney, 1991; Abney, 1995), is, loosely speaking, a flattened version of the phrase structure tree.",

        "The task in both query and sentence chunking is to divide the string of words into contiguous sub-strings of words (commonly refered to as segments or chunks) such that the words from a segment are related to each other more strongly than words from different segments.",
        "It is typically assumed that the segments are syntactically and semantically coherent.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the concept of segmentation of a query.",
        "The crowdsourced annotations for this data were obtained from 10 annotators, the experimental details of which will be described in Sec. 5.",
        "We shall refer to this style of text chunking as flat segmentation.",
        "Nested segmentation of a query or a sentence, on the other hand, is a recursive application of flat segmentation, whereby the longer flat segments are further divided into smaller chunks recursively.",
        "The process stops when a segment consists of less than three words or is a multiword entity that cannot be segmented further.",
        "This style of segmentation can be represented through nested parenthesization of the text, as illustrated in Table 2.",

        "An important problem that arises in the context of flat segmentation is the issue of granular",

        "For instance, in the case of NL chunking, it is not clear whether the chunk boundaries should correspond to the innermost parentheses in the nested segmentation marking very short chunks, or should one annotate the larger chunks corresponding to clausal boundaries.",
        "For this reason, Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) for flat annotation tasks is often poor (Bali et al., 2009; Hagen et al., 2011; Saha Roy et al., 2012).",
        "However, low IAA does not necessarily imply low quality annotation, and could as well be due to the inherent ambiguity in the task definition with respect to granularity.",

        "How can we identify or construct the optimal or error-free flat annotations from a noisy mixture of nested and flat annotations?",
        "In this paper, we introduce the concept of ?entailment of a flat annotation by a nested annotation?.",
        "For a given linguistic unit (a query or a sentence, for example), a nested annotation is said to entail a flat annotation if the structure of the latter does not contradict the more specific structure represented by the former.",
        "Based on this simple notion, which will be formalized in Sec. 3, we develop effective techniques for comparing across and evaluating the quality of flat and nested annotations, and identifying the optimal flat annotation.",
        "We validate our theoretical framework on the tasks of query and sentence segmentation.",
        "In particular, we conduct crowdsourcing based flat and nested segmentation experiments for Web search queries and sentences using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)1.",
        "We also obtain annotations for the same datasets by trained experts which are expected to be of better quality than the AMT-based annotations.",

        "Segmentation or chunking of NL text is a well-studied problem.",
        "Abney (1991; 1992; 1995) defines a chunk as a sub-tree within a syntactic phrase structure tree corresponding to Noun, Prepositional, Adjectival, Adverbial and Verb Phrases.",
        "Similarly, Bharati et al(1995) define it as Noun Group and Verb Group based only on local surface information.",
        "Chunking is an important preprocessing step towards parsing.",
        "Like chunking, query segmentation is an important step towards query understanding and is generally believed to be useful for Web search",
        "(see Hagen et al. (2011) for a survey).",
        "Automatic query segmentation algorithms are typically evaluated against a small set of human-annotated queries (Bergsma and Wang, 2007).",
        "The reported low IAA for such datasets casts serious doubts on the reliability of annotation and the performance of the algorithms evaluated on them (Hagen et al., 2011; Saha Roy et al., 2012).",
        "To address the issue of data scarcity, Hagen et al. (2011) created a large set of manually segmented queries through crowdsourcing2.",
        "However, their approach has certain limitations because the crowd is already provided with a few possible segmentations of a query to choose from.",
        "Nevertheless, if large scale data has to be procured crowdsourcing seems to be the only efficient and effective model for the task, and has been proven to be so for other IR and linguistic annotations (see Lease et al. (2011) for examples).",
        "It should be noted that almost all the work on query segmentation, except (Huang et al., 2010), has considered only flat segments.",
        "An important problem that arises in the context of flat annotations is the issue of granularity.",
        "In the absence of a set of guidelines that explicitly state the granularity expected, Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) for flat annotation tasks are often poor.",
        "Bali et al. (2009) showed that for NL chunking, annotators typically agree on major (i.e., clausal) boundaries but do not agree on minor (i.e., phrasal or intra-phrasal) boundaries.",
        "Similarly, for query segmentation, low IAA remains an issue (Hagen et al., 2011; Saha Roy et al., 2012).",
        "The issue of granularity is effectively addressed in nested annotation, because the annotator is expected to mark the most atomic segments (such as named entities and multiword expressions) and then recursively combine them to obtain larger segments.",
        "Certain amount of ambiguity, that may arise because of lack of specific guidelines on the number of valid segments at the last level (i.e., topmost level of the nested segmentation tree), can also be resolved by forcing the annotator to recursively divide the sentence/query always into exactly two parts (Abney, 1992; Bali et al., 2009).",
        "The present study is an extension of our recent work (Ramanath et al., 2013) on analysis of the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for query and sentence segmentation.",
        "We introduced a novel IAA metric based on Kripendorff's ?, and showed that while the apparent agreement between the annota",
        "tors in a crowdsourced experiment might be high, the chance corrected agreement is actually low for both flat and nested segmentations (as compared to gold annotations obtained from three experts).",
        "The reason for the apparently high agreement is due to an inherent bias of the crowd to divide a piece of text in roughly two equal parts.",
        "The present study extends this work by introducing a metric to compare across flat and nested segmentations that enables us to further analyze the reliability of the crowdsourced annotations.",
        "This metric is then employed to identify the optimal flat segmentation(s) from a set of noisy annotations.",
        "The study uses the same experimental setup and annotated datasets as described in (Ramanath et al., 2013).",
        "Nevertheless, for the sake of readability and self-containedness, the relevant details will be mentioned here again.",
