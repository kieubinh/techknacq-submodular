        "The limited availability of training resources is a widely acknowledged bottleneck for machine learning approaches for Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "This is also the case of dependency treebanks within statistical dependency parsing.",
        "Moreover, the availability of a treebank in a standard format strongly improves its usefulness, increasing the number of tasks for which it can be exploited and allowing the application of a larger variety of tools.",
        "It also has an impact on the reliability of achieved results, and, last but not least, it permits comparability with other resources.",
        "This motivated a variety of initiatives devoted to the definition of standards for the linguistic annotation of corpora.",
        "Since the early 1990s, different initiatives have been devoted to the definition of standards for the linguistic annotation of corpora with a specific view to re?using and merging existing treebanks.",
        "The starting point is represented by the EAGLES (Expert Advisory Groups on Language Engineering Standards) initiative, which ended up with providing provisional standard guidelines (Leech et al., 1996), operating at the level of both content (i.e. the linguistic categories) and encoding format.",
        "More recent initiatives, e.g. LAF/GrAF (Ide and Romary, 2006; Ide and Suderman, 2007) and SynAF (Declerck, 2008) representing on?going ISO TC37/SC4 standardization activities1, rather focused on the definition of a pivot format capable of representing diverse annotation types of varying complexity without providing specifications for the annotation of content categories (i.e., the labels describing the associated linguistic phenomena), for which standardization appeared since the beginning to be a much trickier matter.",
        "Recently, other standardization efforts such as ISOCat (Kemps-Snijders et al., 2009) tackled this latter issue by providing a set of data categories at various levels of granularity, each accompanied by a precise definition of its linguistic meaning.",
        "Unfortunately, the set of dependency categories within ISOCat is still basic and restricted.",
        "We can thus conclude that as far as content categories are concerned de jure standards are not suitable at the moment for being used in the harmonization and merging of real dependency treebanks.",
        "The alternative to de jure standards is represented by de facto standards.",
        "For what concerns dependency?based annotation, which in the recent past has been increasingly exploited for a wide range of NLP?based information extraction tasks, the Stanford Dependency (SD) scheme (de Marn-effe et al., 2006) is gaining popularity as a de facto standard.",
        "Among the contexts where SD has been applied, we can observe e.g. parsers and corpora exploited in biomedical information extraction, where it has been suggested to be a suitable unifying syntax formalism for several incompatible syntactic annotation schemes (Pyysalo et al., 2007).",
        "SD has already been applied to different languages, e.g. Finnish in the Turku treebank (Haverinen et al., 2010), Swedish in the Talbanken",
        "treebank2, Chinese in the Classical Chinese Literature treebank (Seraji et al., 2012) or Persian in the Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank (Lee and Kong, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we describe the conversion of an existing Italian resource into the SD annotation scheme, with the final aim of developing a standard?compliant treebank, the Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank (ISDT).",
        "The reference resource, called Merged Italian Dependency Treebank (MIDT)3 (Bosco et al., 2012), is the result of a previous effort in the direction of improving interoperability of data sets available for Italian by harmonizing and merging two existing dependency?based resources, i.e. TUT and ISST?TANL, adopting incompatible annotation schemes.",
        "The two conversion steps are visualized in Figure 1: note that in both of them the focus is on the conversion and merging of the content of linguistic annotation; for what concerns the representation format, all involved treebanks follow the CoNLL tab?separated format (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) which nowadays represents a de facto standard within the international dependency parsing community.",
        "In this paper, we deal with the second step, focusing on the MIDT to ISDT conversion.",
        "Starting from a comparative analysis of the MIDT and SD annotation schemes, we developed a methodology for converting treebank annotations belonging to the same dependency?based family based on: ?",
        "a comparative analysis of the source and target annotation schemes, carried out with respect to different dimensions of variation, ranging from head selection criteria, dependency tagset granularity to defined annotation criteria; ?",
        "the analysis of the performance of a state?of?",
        "the?art dependency parser by using as training the source and the target treebanks; ?",
        "the mapping of the MIDT annotation scheme onto the SD data categories.",

        "TUT and ISST?TANL to MIDT and ISDT.",
        "In this conversion process, we had to deal with the peculiarities of the Italian language: the tackled issues range from morphological richness, presence of clitic pronouns to relatively free word order and pro?drop, all properties requiring specific annotation strategies to be dealt with.",
        "Therefore, a by product of this conversion process is represented by the specialization of the SD annotation scheme with respect to Italian.",
        "In the following sections, after briefly describing the methodology applied for the development of the MIDT resource (Section 2), we focus on a comparative analysis of the MIDT and SD annotation schemes (Section 3) followed by a description of the implemented conversion process (Section 4).",
        "Finally, we present the results obtained by training a parsing system on the newly developed resource (Section 5)."

(2012), harmonizing and converting annotation schemes can be quite a challenging task, even when this process is carried out within a same paradigm and with respect to the same language.",
        "In the case at hand, this task is made easier thanks to the fact that the MIDT and SD schemes share similar design principles: for instance, in both cases preference is given a) to relations which are semantically contentful and useful to applications, or b) to relations linking content words rather than being indirectly mediated via function words (see design principles 2 and 5 respectively in de Marneffe and Manning (2008a)).",

        "Interestingly however, it is not always the case that the finer grained annotation scheme ?",

        "In MIDT all these relation types are lumped together under the general heading of mod (modifier).",
        "To deal with these cases, the MIDT to SD conversion has to simultaneously combine dependency and morpho?syntactic information (e.g. the morpho?syntactic category of the nodes involved in the relation), which however is not always sufficient as in the case of appositive modifiers for which further evidence is needed.",
        "Let us consider now the reverse case, i.e. in which MIDT adopts finer?grained distinctions with respect to SD.",

        "?a?, ?di?, ?da?",
        "), which are selected by the governing head.",

        "Another interesting and more complex example can be found for what concerns the partitioning of the space of sentential complements.",
        "MIDT distinguishes between mod(ifiers) on the one hand and subcategorised arg(uments) on the other hand: note that whereas arg is restricted to clausal complements subcategorized for by the governing head, the mod relation covers different types of modifiers (nominal, adjectival, clausal, adverbial, etc.).",
        "By contrast, SD resorts to specific relations for dealing with sentential complements: in particular, distinct relation types are envisaged depending on e.g. whether the clause is a subcategorized complement or a modifier (see e.g. ccomp vs advcl), or whether the governor is a verb or a noun (see e.g. xcomp vs infmod), or whether the clausal complement is headed by a finite or non?finite verb (see e.g. ccomp vs xcomp).",

        "Other specializations are concerned with the use of underspecified categories: rather than resorting to the most generic relation, i.e. dep used when it is impossible to determine a more precise dependency relation, we exploited the hierarchical organization of SD typed dependencies, i.e. we used the comp and mod relations when we could not find an appropriate relation within the set of their dependency subtypes.",
        "5 Using ISDT as training corpus In this section, we report the results achieved by using ISDT for training a dependency parser, namely DeSR (Dependency Shift Reduce), a transition?based statistical parser (Attardi, 2006), where it is possible to specify, through a configuration file, the set of features to use (e.g. POS tag, lemma, morphological features) and the classification algorithm (e.g. Multi-Layer Perceptron (Attardi and Dell?Orletta, 2009), Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy).",
        "DeSR has been trained on TUT and ISST?TANL in the framework of the evaluation campaigns Evalita, for the last time in 2011 (Bosco and Mazzei, 2012; Dell?Orletta et al., 2012).",
        "More recently DeSR has been trained and tested on MIDT: the results ob",
        "tained on both the MIDT version of the individual TUT and ISST?TANL resources and the merged resource are reported in (Bosco et al., 2012): the best scores, achieved applying a parser combination strategy and training on TUT inMIDT format, are LAS 90.11% and LAS 91.58% without punctuation.",
        "For the experiments on the ISDT resource we used a basic and fast variant of the DeSR parser based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).",
        "In fact, the purpose of the experiment was not to optimize the parser for the new resource but to compare relative performances of the same parser on different versions of the same resources.",
        "As a result, the substantial drop in performance observed with respect to the MIDT resource is in part due to this factor, and cannot be totally attributed to the greater complexity of the SD scheme or quality of the conversion output.",
        "Table 1 reports, in the first two rows, the values of Labeled Attachment Score (LAS, with and without punctuation) obtained against the TUT?",
        "ISDT and ISST?TANL?ISDT datasets.",
        "The different performance of the parser on the two converted datasets (TUT?ISDT and ISST?TANL?ISDT) is in line with what was observed in previous experiments with native resources and MIDT (Bosco et al., 2010; Bosco et al., 2012); therefore, the composition of the training and test corpora can still be identified as possible causes for such a difference.",
        "The results reported in rows 3?5 have been obtained by training DeSR with the larger resource including both TUT?ISDT and ISST?",
        "TANL?ISDT.",
        "As test set, we used a combination of the two test sets (row 3) and test sets from the two data sets separately (rows 4 and 5).",
        "The preliminary results achieved by using ISDT are encouraging, in line with what was obtained on the WSJ for English and reported in (Cer et al., 2010), where the best results in labeled attachment precision, achieved by a fast dependency parser (Nivre Eager feature Extract), is 81.7.",
        "For the time being, training with the larger combined resource does not seem to provide a substantial advantage, confirming results obtained with MIDT, despite the fact that in the conversion from MIDT to ISDT a substantial effort was spent to further harmonize the two resources."

        "In this paper, we addressed the challenge of converting MIDT, an existing dependency?based Italian treebank resulting from the harmonization and merging of smaller resources adopting incompatible annotation schemes, into the Stanford Dependencies annotation formalism, with the final aim of constructing a standard?compliant resource for the Italian language.",
