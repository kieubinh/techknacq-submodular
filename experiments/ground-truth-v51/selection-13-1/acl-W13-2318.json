        "Present day researchers need services for searching research papers.",
        "Search engines and publishing companies provide specialized search services, such as Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and Science Direct.",
        "Academic societies provide archives of journal articles and/or conference proceedings such as the ACL Anthology.",
        "These services focus on simple keyword-based searches as well as extralinguistic relations among research papers, authors, and research topics.",
        "However, because contemporary research is becoming increasingly complicated and interrelated, intelligent content-based search systems are desired (Banchs, 2012).",
        "A typical query in computational linguistics could be what tasks have CRFs been used for?, which includes the elements of a typical schema for searching research papers; researchers want to find relationships between a technique and its applications (Gupta and Manning, 2011).",
        "Answers to this query can be found in various forms in published papers, for example,",
        "(1) CRF-based POS tagging has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "(2) CRFs have been successfully applied to sequence labeling problems including POS tagging and named entity recognition.",
        "(3) We apply feature reduction to CRFs and show its effectiveness in POS tagging.",
        "(4) This study proposes a new method for the ef",
        "ficient training of CRFs.",
        "The proposed method is evaluated for POS tagging tasks.",
        "Note that the same semantic relation, i.e., the use of CRFs for POS tagging, is expressed by various syntactic constructs: internal structures of the phrase in (1), clause-level structures in (2), inter-clause structures in (3), and discourse-level structures in (4).",
        "This implies that an integrated framework is required to represent semantic relations for phrase-level, clause-level, inter-clause level, and discourse-level structures.",
        "Another interesting fact is that we can recognize various fragments of information from single texts.",
        "For example, from sentence (1), we can identify CRF is applied to POS tagging, state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved for POS tagging, and CRFs achieve high POS tagging accuracy, all of which is valuable content for different search requests.",
        "This indicates that we need a framework that can cover (almost) all content in a text.",
        "In this paper we describe a new annotation scheme for formalizing typical schemas for representing relations among concepts in research papers, such as techniques, resources, and effects.",
        "Our study aims to establish a framework for representing the semantics of research papers to help construct intelligent search systems.",
        "In particular, we focus on the formalization of typical schemas that we believe exemplify common query characteristics.",
        "From the above observations, we have developed the following criteria for our proposed framework: use the same scheme for annotating contents in all levels of linguistic structures, annotate (almost) all contents presented in texts, and capture relations necessary for surveying research papers.",
        "We investigated 71 computer science abstracts (498 sentences) and defined an annotation",
        "scheme comprising 16 types of semantic relations.",
        "Computer science is particularly suitable for our purpose because it is primarily concerned with abstract concepts rather than concrete entities, which are typically the primary focus of empirical sciences such as physics and biology.",
        "In addition, computer and computational methods can be applied to an extraordinarily wide range of topics; computer science papers might discuss a bus timetable (for automatic optimization), a person's palm (as a device for projecting images), or looking over another person!Gs shoulder (to obtain passwords).",
        "Therefore, to annotate all computer science papers, we cannot develop predefined entity ontologies, which is the typical approach taken in biomedical text mining (Kim et al., 2011).",
        "However, most computer science papers have characteristic schemata: the papers describe a problem, postulate a method, apply the method to the problem using particular data or devices, and perform experiments to evaluate the method.",
        "The typical schemata clearly represent the structure of interests in this research field.",
        "Therefore, we can focus on typical schemata, such as application of a method to a problem and evaluation of a method for a task.",
        "As we will demonstrate in this paper, the proposed annotation scheme can cover almost all content, from phrase levels to discourse levels, in computer science papers.",
        "Note that this does not necessarily mean that our framework can only be applied to computer science literature.",
        "The characteristics of the schemata described above are universal in contemporary science and engineering, and many other activities in human society.",
        "Thus, the framework presented in this study can be viewed as a starting point for research focusing on representative schemata of human activities."

        "Recently, research on content-based analysis of research papers has been emerging.",
        "For example, methods of document zoning have been proposed for research papers in biomedicine (Mizuta et al., 2006; Agarwal and Yu, 2009; Li-akata et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2011; Varga et al., 2012), and chemistry and computational linguistics (Teufel et al., 2009).",
        "Zoning provides a sentence-based information structure of papers to help identify the components such as the proposed method and the results obtained in the study.",
        "As such, zoning can narrow down the sections of a paper in which the answer to a query can be found.",
        "However, zoning alone cannot always capture the relation between the concepts described in the sections as it focuses on relation at a sentence level.",
        "For example, the examples (1), (2), (3) in the previous section require intra-sentence analysis to capture the relation between CRF and POS tagging.",
        "Our annotation scheme, which can be seen as conplementary to zoning, attempts to provide a structure for capturing the relationship between concepts at a finer-grained level than a sentence.",
        "Establishing semantic relations among scientific papers has also been studied.",
        "For example, the ACL Anthology Searchbench (Scha?fer et al., 2011) provides querying by predicate-argument relations.",
        "The system accepts specifications of subject, predicate, and object, and searches for texts that semantically match the query using the results from an HPSG parser.",
        "It can also search by topics automatically extracted from the papers.",
        "Gupta and Manning (2011) proposed a method for extracting Focus, Domain, and Technique from papers in the ACL anthology: Focus is a research article's main contribution, Domain is an application domain, and Technique is a method or a tool used to achieve the Focus.",
        "The change in these aspects over time is traced to measure the influence of research communities on each other.",
        "Fukuda et al.",
        "(2012) developed a method of technical trend analysis that can be applied to both patent applications and academic papers, using the distribution of named entities.",
        "However, as processes and functions are key concepts in computer science, elements are often described in a unit with its own internal structures which include data, systems, and other entities as substructures.",
        "Thus, technical concepts such as technique cannot be captured fully by extracting named entities.",
        "Gupta and Manning (2011) analyzed the internal structures of concepts syntactically using a dependency parser, but did not further investigate the structure semantically.",
        "In addition to the methodological aspects of research, i.e., what techniques are applied to what domain, a research paper can include other infor",
        "mation that we also want to capture, such as how the author evaluates current systems and methods or the previous efforts of others.",
        "An attempt to identify the evaluation and other meta-aspects of scientific papers was made by Thompson et al. (2011), which, on top of the biomedical events annotated in the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008), annotated meta-knowledge such as the certainty level of the author, polarity (positive?",
        "negative), and manner (strong?weak) of events, as well as source (whether the event is attributed to the current study or previous studies), along with the clue mentioned in the text.",
        "For in-domain relations within and between the events, they relied on the underlying GENIA annotation, which maps events and their participants to a subset of Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000), a standard ontology in genome science.",
        "We cannot assume the existence of standard domain ontology in the variety of domains to which computer systems are applied, as was mentioned in Section 1.",
        "On the other hand, using domain-general linguistic frameworks, such as FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) or the Lexical Conceptual Structure (Jackendoff, 1990) is also not satisfactory for our purpose.",
        "These frameworks attempt to identify the relations lexicalized by verbs and their case arguments; however, they do not consider discourse or other levels of linguistic representation.",
        "In addition, relying on a linguistic theory requires that annotators understand linguistics.",

        "The annotated corpus can provide data for constructing comprehensive semantic relation extraction systems.",
        "This would be challenging but worthwhile since such systems are in great demand.",
        "Such relation extraction systems will be the basis for content-based retrieval and other applications, including paraphrasing and translation.",
        "The abstracts annotated in the course of the experiment have been cleaned up and are available on request.",
        "We are planning to increase the volume and make the corpus widely available.",
        "In the future, we will assess machine-learning performance and incorporate the relation extraction mechanisms into search systems.",
        "Comparison of the annotated structure and the structures that can be given by existing semantic theories could be an interesting theoretical subject for future research."
