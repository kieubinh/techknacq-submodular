        "There is also room for reducing the cost of the verification stage e.g. by automatically filtering out paraphrases before presenting them to a crowdworker using e.g. lexical divergence, length of the sentence or other measures as it was done by Burrows et al. (2013).",
        "Another interesting question we could not answer due to budget constraints is: Can the crowd replace the expert and if yes, how many crowdworkers are needed to do so reliably?",
        "One possible way to answer this question for paraphrase evaluation would be to collect semantic similarity judgements for the whole MSRPC and to see how many judgements per phrase are needed to reliably reproduce the MSRPC classification results with an inter-rater agreement of 84% for the whole corpus."
