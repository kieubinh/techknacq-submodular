        "The key to this success is how useful information can be effectively introduced into ML algorithms as features.",
        "With shallow NLP tasks, surface information like words and their POS within a window of a certain size can be easily employed as useful features.",
        "In contrast, in semantic and discourse processing, such as coreference resolution and discourse structure analysis, it is not trivial to employ as features deeper linguistic knowledge and human linguistic intuition that are indispensable for these tasks.",

        "Unlike past attempts relying on heuristic feature engineering, we take a cognitive science approach to improving system performance.",

        "1.",
        "An annotator reads a given text and understands its contents.",

        "Having fixed a target predicate, she/he searches for its argument in the set of preceding candidate arguments considering a type of relations with the predicate.",

        "Once she/he finds a probable argument in a",
        "text, she/he looks around its context in order to confirm the relation.",
        "The confirmation is finalised by creating a link between the predicate and its argument.",
        "The strategy of searching for arguments after fixing a predicate would reflect the linguistic knowledge that a predicate subcategorises its arguments.",
        "In addition, since Japanese is a head-final language, a predicate basically follows its arguments.",
        "Therefore searching for each argument within a sentence can begin at the same position, i.e. the predicate, toward the beginning of the sentence, when the predicate-first search strategy is adopted.",
        "The idea of dividing a cognitive process into different functional stages is common in cognitive science.",
        "For instance, Just and Carpenter (1985) divided a problem solving process into three stages: searching, comparison and confirmation.",
        "In their task, given a picture of two cubes with a letter on each surface, a participant is instructed to judge whether they can be the same or not.",
        "Since one of the cubes is relatively rotated in a certain direction and amount, the participant needs to mentally rotate the cubes for matching.",
        "Russo and Leclerc (1994) divided a visual decision making process into three stages: orientation, evaluation and verification.",
        "In their experiment, participants were asked to choose one of several daily food products that were visually presented.",
        "The boundaries of the above three stages were identified based on the participants?",
        "eye gaze and their verbal protocols.",
        "Malcolm and Henderson (2009) applied the idea to a visual search process, dividing it into initiation, scanning and verification.",
        "Gidlo?f et al. (2013) discussed the difference between a decision making process and a visual search process in terms of the process division.",
        "Although the above studies deal with the different cognitive processes, it is common that the first stage is for capturing an overview of a problem, the second is for searching for a tentative solution, and the third is for verifying their solution.",
        "Our division of the annotation process conforms with this idea.",
        "Particularly, our task is similar to the decision making process as defined by Russo and Leclerc (1994).",
        "Unlike these past studies, however, the beginning of an orientation stage1 is not clear in our case, since we collected the data in a natural annotation setting, i.e. a single annotation session for a text includes creation of multiple links.",
        "In other words, the first stage might correspond to multiple second and third stages.",
        "In addition, in past research on decision making, a",
        "volves two objects to consider, i.e. a predicate and an argument.",
        "Considering these differences and the proposals of previous studies (Russo and Leclerc, 1994; Gidlo?f et al., 2013)?we define the three stages as follows.",
        "As explained above, we can not identify the beginning of an orientation stage based on any decisive clue.",
        "We define the end of an orientation stage as the onset of the first dwell2 on a predicate being considered.",
        "The succeeding evaluation stage starts at the onset of the first dwell on the predicate and ends at the onset of the first dwell on the argument that is eventually linked to the predicate.",
        "The third stage, a verification stage, starts at the onset of the first dwell on the linked argument and ends at the creation of the link between the predicate and argument.",
        "These definitions and the relations between the stages are illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "The time points indicating the stage boundaries can be identified from the recorded eye gaze and tool operation data.",
        "First, gaze fixations were extracted by using the Dispersion-Threshold Identification (I-DT) algorithm (Salvucci and Goldberg, 2000).",
        "Based on a rationale that the eye movement velocity slows near fixations, the I-DT algorithm identifies fixations as clusters of consecutive gaze points within a particular dispersion.",
        "It has two parameters, the dispersion threshold that defines the maximum distance between gaze points belonging to the same cluster, and the duration threshold that constrains the minimum fixation duration.",
        "Considering the experimental configurations, i.e. (i) the display size and its resolution, (ii) the distance between the display and the annotator's eyes, and (iii) the eye-tracker resolution, we set the dispersion threshold to 16 pixels.",
        "Following Richardson et al. (2007), we set the duration threshold to 100 msec.",
        "Based on fixations, a dwell on a segment was defined as a series of fixations that consecutively stayed on the same segment where",
        "two consecutive fixations were not separated by more than 100 msec.",
        "We allowed a horizontal error margin of 16 pixels (one-character width) for both sides of a segment when identifying a dwell.",
        "Time points of link creation were determined by the ?create link start?",
        "event in Table 1.",
        "Among these three stages, the evaluation stage would be most informative for extracting useful features for ML algorithms, because an annotator identifies a probable argument for a predicate under consideration during this stage.",
        "Analysing annotator eye gaze during this stage could reveal useful information for predicate-argument analysis.",
        "It is, however, insufficient to regard only fixated arguments as being under the annotator's consideration during the evaluation stage.",
        "The annotator captures an overview of the current problem during the previous orientation stage, in which she/he could remember several candidate arguments in her/his short-term memory, then moves on to the evaluation stage.",
        "Therefore, all attended arguments are not necessarily observed through gaze dwells.",
        "As we explained earlier, we have no means to identify a rigid duration of an orientation stage, thus it is difficult to identify a precise set of candidate arguments under the annotator's consideration in the evaluation stage.",
        "For this purpose, we need a different experimental design so that every predicate-argument relation is annotated at a time in the same manner as the above decision making studies conducted.",
        "Another possibility is using an annotator's verbal protocols together with her/his eye gaze as done in Russo and Leclerc (1994).",
        "On the other hand, in the verification stage a probable argument has been already determined and its validity confirmed by investigating its competitors.",
        "We would expect considered competitors are explicitly fixated during this stage.",
        "Since we have a rigid definition of the verification stage duration, it is possible to analyse the annotator's behaviour during this stage based on her/his eye gaze.",
        "For this reason, we concentrate on the analysis of the verification stage of annotation henceforth.",
        "4 Analysis of the verification stage Given the set of annotation instances, i.e. predicate, argument and case triplets, we categorise these instances based on the annotator's behaviour during the verification stage.",
        "We focus on two factors for categorising annotation instances: (i) the",
        "distance of a predicate and if its argument is either near or far, and (ii) whether annotator gaze dwelled on other arguments than the eventually linked argument before creating the link.",
        "We call the former factor Near/Far distinction, and the latter Concentrated/Distracted distinction.",
        "To decide the Near/Far distinction, we investigated the distribution of distances of predicates and their argument.",
        "The result is shown in the upper graph of Figure 4, where the x-axis is the character-based distance and the y-axis shows the number of instances in each distance bin.",
        "Figure 4 demonstrates that the instances concentrate at the bin of distance 1.",
        "This reflects the frequently occurring instances where a one-character case maker follows an argument, and immediately precedes its predicate.",
        "The lower graph in Figure 4 shows the ratio of Distracted instances to Concentrated at each bin.",
        "The distribution indicates that there is no remarkable relation between the distance and Concentrated/Distracted distinction.",
        "The correlation coefficient between the distance and the number of Concentrated instances is ?0.26.",
        "We can conclude that the distance of a predicate and its argument does not impact the Concentrated/Distracted distinction.",
        "Considering the above tendency, we set the distance threshold to 22, the average distance of all annotation instances; instances with a distance of less than 22 are considered Near.",
        "These two factors make four combinations in total, i.e. Near-Concentrated (NC), Near-Distracted (ND), Far-Concentrated (FC) and Far-Distracted (FD).",

        "In addition, our experimental setting is more natural, meaning that all possible relations in a text were annotated in a single session, while each session targeted a single named entity (NE) in a limited context in the setting of Tomanek et al. (2010).",
        "Finally, our fixation target is more precise, i.e. words, rather than a coarse area around the target NE.",
        "We have also discussed evaluating annotation difficulty for predicate-argument relations by using the same data introduced in this paper (Tokunaga et al., 2013).",
        "Through manual analysis of the collected data, we suggested that an annotation time necessary for annotating a single predicate-argument relation was correlated with the agreement ratio among multiple human annotators."

        "The collected data were analysed from three aspects: (i) the relationship of predicate-argument distances and argument's cases, (ii) the effect of already-existing links and (iii) specificity of arguments and dispersal of eye gaze.",
        "The analysis on these aspects suggested that obtained insight into human annotation behaviour could be useful for exploring effective linguistic features in ML-based approaches.",
        "As future work, we need to further investigate the data from other aspects.",
        "There are advantages to manual analysis, such as done in this paper.",
        "Mining techniques for finding unknown but useful information may also be advantageous.",
        "Therefore, we are planning to employ mining techniques for finding useful gaze patterns for various NLP tasks.",
        "In this paper, we suggested useful information that could be incorporated into ML algorithms as features.",
        "It is necessary to implement these features in a specific ML algorithm and evaluate their effectiveness empirically.",
        "Our analysis was limited to the verification stage of annotation, in which a probable argument of a predicate was confirmed by comparing it with other competitors.",
        "The preceding evaluation stage should be also analysed, since it is the stage where annotators search for a correct argument of a predicate in question, thus probably includes useful information for computational models in identifying predicate-argument relations.",
        "For the analysis of the evaluation stage, a different design of experiments would be necessary, as already mentioned, employing single annotation at a time scheme as Tomanek et al. (2010) did, or using an annotator's verbal protocol together as Russo and Leclerc (1994), and Rosengrant (2010) did.",
        "Last but not least, data collection and analysis in different annotation tasks are indispensable.",
