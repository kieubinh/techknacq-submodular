        "Different kinds of linguistic cues are involved.",
        "In addition to the need to identify and semantically classify these cues, one has to deal with the question of their scope.",
        "This question is even more complex as many cues can be present together in a sentence, thus complexifying the interpretation of the interaction of different scopes (see Example 1.).",

        "In this light, we will focus only on what we will describe below as predicative cues.",

        "modal commitment In the field of linguistics, the notion of modality can be considered from an enunciative perspective (see Bally, 1932 Benveniste, 1966; Culioli, 1973).",
        "From this perspective, which is the one we adopt here, the construction of an utterance (or a text) has to take into account certain language operations such as predication or operations of commitment, the expression of which leaves a certain number of surface linguistic traces (or cues).",
        "The enunciator's degree of commitment to a predicative content is marked in the utterance by different kinds of linguistic traces.",
        "In other words, it can be said that in discourse the enunciator expresses different degrees of commitment to the truth of the propositional content.",
        "Very close to this issue is thus the long tradition of tracking veridicality in discourse.",
        "Whether ?",
        "in the most recent work - under the term of ?factuality degrees of events?",
        "(Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2012), ?event veridicality?",
        "(De Marneffe et al., 2012), ?detection of uncertainty?",
        "?private states?",
        "(Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), this notion refers to the relationship between language and reader commitment.",
        "In our approach, we do not attempt to access the notion of veridicality directly but rather via the organization of the text into different textual segments that have different enunciative and modal validation contexts.",
        "However, the cues we have to take into account to achieve this goal are mostly the same as in veridicality studies (modal verbs, reported speech verbs, verb of propositional attitude, hedging adverbs, and so on).",
        "Moreover, beyond traditional lexical cues, we also include in our work other cues such as morphological inflection (e.g. inflection of the French conditional tense), syntactic constructions such as subordinate clauses of condition or prepositional constructions (e.g. according to X, at first sight?).",
        "Furthermore, we have to take into account the fact that a lot of cues are embedded (as seen in Example 1 with express and a desire).",
        "If we want to interpret the enunciative and modal context of the textual segment to help Syria overcome this phase, we have to consider the fact that it is embedded in the segment a desire to help Syria overcome this phase.",
        "From this point of view our work is related to Kilicoglu (2012) who studied ?embedding predications?.",
        "Thus, we do not only consider the type of cues we find in text but also the way they interact.",
        "This methodology also enables us to consider cues that play a role at a discursive level.",
        "This question of discursive markers is discussed in (Charolles et al., 2005).",
        "Although modality markers in French - in their close relationship with the markers of evi-dentiality - have been systematically described (see for example Gosselin, 2010; Le Querler, 2004) there is still no reference corpus proposing the annotation of enunciative and modal characteristics as a discursive delimitation task and this is the goal we seek to achieve.",
        "This problem of identifying modal cues related to a scope was initially researched in biomedical texts (Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "This applicative task made it possible to renew the linguistic approach to modality by adopting a more concrete approach, focusing first on the variety of cues that can be identified in a text.",
        "This perspective also enables the issue of the influence of textual genre on modality markers to be addressed.",

        "This can be explained partly by the fact that the syntactic parser analysis produces some analysis errors (tagging or parsing errors, wrong syntactic attachment especially with coordinating conjunctions).",
