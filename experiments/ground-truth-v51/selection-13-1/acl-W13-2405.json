        "Thus, providing efficient information access for clients can be essential for many businesses.",
        "Frequently asked questions (FAQ) databases are a popular way to present domain-specific information in the form of expert answers to users questions.",
        "Each FAQ consists of a question and an answer, possibly complemented with additional metadata (e.g., keywords).",
        "A FAQ retrieval engine provides an interface to a FAQ database.",
        "Given a user query in natural language as input, it retrieves a ranked list of FAQs relevant to the query.",
        "FAQ retrieval can be considered half way between traditional document retrieval and question answering (QA).",
        "Unlike in full-blown QA, in FAQ retrieval the questions and the answers are already extracted.",
        "On the other hand, unlike in document retrieval, FAQ queries are typically questions and the answers are typically much shorter than documents.",
        "While FAQ retrieval can be approached using simple keyword matching, the performance of such systems will be severely limited due to the lexical gap ?",
        "a lack of overlap between the words that appear in a query and words from a FAQ pair.",
        "As noted by Sneiders (1999), there are two causes for this.",
        "Firstly, the FAQ database creators in general do not know the user questions in advance.",
        "Instead, they must guess what the likely questions would be.",
        "Thus, it is very common that users?",
        "information needs are not fully covered by the provided questions.",
        "Secondly, both FAQs and user queries are generally very short texts, which diminishes the chances of a keyword match.",
        "In this paper we describe the design and the evaluation of a FAQ retrieval engine for Croatian.",
        "To address the lexical gap problem, we take a supervised learning approach and train a model that predicts the relevance of a FAQ given a query.",
        "Motivated by the recent work on semantic textual similarity (Agirre et al., 2012), we use as model features a series of similarity measures based on word overlap and semantic vector space similarity.",
        "We train and evaluate the model on a FAQ dataset from a telecommunication domain.",
        "On this dataset, our best performing model achieves 0.47 of mean reciprocal rank, i.e., on average ranks the relevant FAQ among the top two results.",
        "In summary, the contribution of this paper is twofold.",
        "Firstly, we propose and evaluate a FAQ retrieval model based on supervised machine learning.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no previ",

        "Most prior work on FAQ retrieval has focused on the problem of lexical gap, and various approaches have been proposed for bridging it.",
        "Early work, such as Sneiders (1999), propose to manually enrich the FAQ databases with additional meta data such as the required, optional, and forbidden keywords and keyphrases.",
        "This effectively reduces FAQ retrieval to simple keyword matching, however in this case it is the manually assigned metadata that bridges the lexical gap and provides the look and feel of semantic search.",
        "For anything but a small-sized FAQ database, manual creation of metadata is tedious and cost intensive, and in addition requires expert knowledge.",
        "An alternative is to rely on general linguistic resources.",
        "FAQ finder (Burke et al., 1997) uses syntax analysis to identify phrases, and then performs matching using shallow lexical semantic knowledge from WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "Yet another way to bridge the lexical gap is smoothing via clustering, proposed by Kim and Seo (2006).",
        "First, query logs are expanded with word definitions from a machine readable dictionary.",
        "Subsequently, query logs are clustered, and query similarity is computed against the clusters, instead of against the individual FAQs.",
        "As an alternative to clustering, query expansion is often used to perform lexical smoothing (Voorhees, 1994; Navigli and Velardi, 2003).",
        "In some domains a FAQ engine additionally must deal with typing errors and noisy user-generated content.",
        "An example is the FAQ retrieval for SMS messages, described by Kothari et al.",
        "(2009) and Contractor et al. (2010).",
        "Although low lexical overlap is identified as the primary problem in FAQ retrieval, sometimes it is the high lexical overlap that also presents a problem.",
        "This is particularly true for large FAQ databases in which a non-relevant document can ?accidentally?",
        "have a high lexical overlap with a query.",
        "Moreo et al. (2012) address the problem of false positives using case based reasoning.",
        "Rather than considering only the words, they use phrases (?differentiator expressions?)",
        "that discriminate well between FAQs.",
        "The approaches described so far are essentially unsupervised.",
        "A number of supervised FAQ retrieval methods have been described in the literature.",
        "To bridge the lexical gap, Xue et al. (2008) use machine translation models to ?translate?",
        "the user query into a FAQ.",
        "Their system is trained on very large FAQ knowledge bases, such as Yahoo answers.",
        "Soricut and Brill (2004) describe another large-scale FAQ retrieval system, which uses language and transformation models.",
        "A good general overview of supervised approaches to ranking tasks is the work by Liu (2009).",
        "Our system falls into the category of supervised methods.",
        "In contrast to the above-described approaches, we use a supervised model with word overlap and semantic similarity features.",
        "Taking into account that FAQs are short texts, we use features that have been recently proposed for determining the semantic similarity between pairs of sentences (?aric?",
        "et al, 2012).",
        "Because we train our model to output a relevance score for each document, our approach is essentially a pointwise learning-to-rank approach (Qin et al., 2008)."

        "Model RM5, which additionally uses question type classification, performs worse than RM4, suggesting that the accuracy of question type classification is not sufficiently high.",
        "Our analysis of the test collection revealed that this can be attributed to a domain mismatch: the questions (mobile phone operator FAQ) are considerably different than those on which the question classifier was trained (factoid general questions).",
        "Moreover, some of the queries and questions in our FAQ test collection are not questions at all (cf. Table 2); e.g., ?Popravak mobitela.?",

        "The best MRR result of 0.479 (with standard deviation over five folds of ?0.04) indicates that, on average, model RM4 ranks the relevant answer among top two results.",

        "Expectedly, classification performance and retrieval performance are positively correlated (cf.",
        "Tables 5 and 6).",
        "A noteworthy case is RM4, which improves the F1-score by only 5% over RM3, yet improves IR measures by more than 10%.",
        "This suggest that, in addition to improving the classifier decisions, the QED boosts the confidence scores of already correct decisions.",
        "A caveat to the above analysis is the fact that the query expansion dictionary was constructed base on the cross-validation result.",
        "While only a small amount of errors were corrected with the dictionary, this still makes models RM4 and RM5 slightly biased to the given dataset.",
        "An objective estimate of maximum performance on unseen data is probably somewhere between RM3 and RM4."
