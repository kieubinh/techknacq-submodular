        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identification of information units in text such as person names, organizations and locations.",
        "It is an important subtask in many natural language processing (NLP) applications such as text sum-marization, information filtering, relation extraction and question answering.",
        "NER has been extensively studied for widely spoken languages such as English with the state-of-the-art systems achieving near-human performance (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1998), but no research has yet been done in regards to Estonian.",
        "The main difference of Estonian, a Finno-Ugric language, compared to English is high morphological richness.",
        "Estonian is a synthetic language and has relatively high morpheme-per-word ratio.",
        "It has both agglutinative and fusional (inflective) elements: morphemes can express one or more syntactic categories of the word.",
        "Although Estonian is considered a subject-verb-object (SVO) language, all phrase permutations are legal and widely used.",
        "These factors make NLP for Estonian particularly complicated.",
        "In this work, we address the problem of NER in Estonian using supervised learning approach.",
        "We explore common issues related to building a NER system such as the usage of language-agnostic and language-specific features, the representation of named entity tags, the required corpus size and the need for linguistic tools.",
        "To train and evaluate our system, we have created a gold standard NER corpus of Estonian news stories, in which we manually annotated occurrences of locations, persons and organizations.",
        "Our system, based on Conditional Random Fields, achieves an overall cross-validation F1-score of 87%, which is compatible with results reported for similar languages.",
        "Related work.",
        "The concept of NER originated in the 1990s in the course of the Message Understanding Conferences (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), and since then there has been a steady increase in research boosted by evaluation programs such as CoNLL (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-der, 2003) and ACE (ACE, 2005).",
        "The earliest works mainly involved using hand-crafted linguistic rules (Grishman, 1995; Wakao et al., 1996).",
        "Rule-based systems typically achieve high precision, but suffer low coverage, are laborious to build and and not easily portable to new text domains (Lin et al., 2003).",
        "The current dominant approach for addressing NER problem is supervised machine learning (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-der, 2003).",
        "Such systems generally read a large annotated corpus and induce disambiguation rules based on discriminative features.",
        "Frequently used techniques include Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al., 1997), Maximum Entropy Models (Bender et al., 2003) and Linear Chain Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li, 2003).",
        "The downside of supervised learning is the need for a large,",
        "annotated training corpus.",
        "Recently, some research has been done on NER for highly inflective and morphologically rich languages similar to Estonian.",
        "Varga and Simon (2007) report F1-score of 95% for Hungarian in business news domain using a Maximum Entropy classifier.",

        "Ku?c?u?k and others (2009) describe a rule-based NER system for Turkish language which achieves F1-score of 79%.",
        "We observe that the reported results are notably inferior compared to well-studied languages such as English.",
