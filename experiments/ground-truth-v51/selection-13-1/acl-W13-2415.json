        "PULS1 is a framework for information extraction from text (IE), designed for decision support in various domains and scenarios.",
        "To date, work on PULS has mostly concentrated on English-language text, though some effort has gone into adapting PULS to other languages, (Du et al., 2011).",
        "This paper describes a component that is used to extend PULS to analyze Russian-language text, and demonstrates its performance on two IE scenarios: infectious epidemics and cross-border",
        "security.",
        "The epidemics scenario is built to provide an early warning system for professionals and organizations responsible for tracking epidemic threats around the world.",
        "Because information related to outbreaks of infectious disease often appears in news earlier than it does in official sources, text mining from the Web for medical surveillance is a popular research topic, as discussed in, e.g., (Collier et al., 2008; Huttunen et al., 2002; Rortais et al., 2010; Zamite et al., 2010).",
        "Similarly, in the security scenario, the system tracks cross-border crime, including illegal migration, smuggling, human trafficking, as well as general criminal activity and crisis events; text mining for this scenario has been previously reported by (Ameyugo et al., 2012; Atkinson et al., 2011).",
        "The new component monitors open-source media in Russian, searching for incidents related to the given scenarios.",
        "It extracts information from plain, natural-language text into structured database records, which are used by domain specialists for daily event monitoring.",
        "The structure of the database records (called templates) depends on the scenario.",
        "For the epidemics scenario the system extracts the fields: disease name, location of the incident, date, number of victims, etc.",
        "In the security domain, the template contains the type of event, date and location, the perpetrator, number of victims (if any), goods smuggled, etc.",
        "Monolinguality is a serious limitation for IE, since end-users are under growing pressure to cover news from multiple languages, (Piskorski et al., 2011).",
        "The Russian-language component that we describe here is an experiment in extending PULS to multilingual coverage.",
        "Our aim is to explore whether a such an extension can be built with limited effort and resources.",
        "1.2 Prior work on IE from Russian IE in Russian has been the topic of several recent studies.",
        "For example, (Piskorski et al., 2011) uses",
        "Russian among other languages to study information fusion across languages.",
        "Extraction techniques are used for ontology learning in (Bocharov et al., 2010) and (Schumann, 2012).",
        "The University of Sheffield's GATE system, (Bontcheva et al., 2003), which supports multilingual IE, has been adapted to Russian as part of the MUSE-3 project, (though little is published on functionality available in Russian).",
        "HP Labs have recently started adaptation of their information extraction solutions to Russian, (Solovyev et al., 2012).",
        "Much literature devoted to Russian-language information extraction is published only in Russian; a brief review can be found in (Khoroshevsky, 2010).",
        "The majority of existing applications for Russian IE, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in general, are commercially based, and are either published in Russian only, or not at all.",
        "One major player in Russian text mining is Yandex, the leading Russian search engine.",
        "Yandex uses IE to support its main search service, e.g., to underline addresses and persons in search results, and in a service called ?Press Portraits,?2 which builds profiles for various personalities found in the news.",
        "A profile may include the profession, biographical facts, news that s/he is involved in, and related people?using information automatically extracted from on-line Russian media.",
        "Yandex also recently unveiled an open-source toolkit Tomita, for developing IE systems based on context-free grammars.",

        "As a consequence, the scores for the main slots, such as Disease or Country, may be overstated: the majority of documents mention only one disease, and since an event was found by the system in most documents selected for the test suite, the Disease slot is usually filled correctly.",
        "The results for the auxiliary slots, e.g., Time, Total, are closer to our expectation."

        "In general, the epidemics scenario performs much better than security, both in Russian and English.",
        "This is due to fact that the task definition for epidemics is simpler, better formalized, and deals with one type of event only.",
        "As noted in (Hut",
        "parallel English-Russian news corpus.",
        "tunen et al., 2002), event representation in text may have different structure depending on the scenario: the ?classic?",
        "IE scenarios, such as the MUC Management Succession or Terror Attacks, describe events that occur at a specific point in time, whereas other scenarios, such as Natural Disasters or Disease Outbreaks describe a process that is spread out in time and space.",
        "Consequently, events in the latter (?nature?)",
        "scenarios are more complex, may have hierarchical structure, and may even overlap in text.",
        "From the theoretical point of view it would be interesting to compare how the events representation, (Pivovarova et al., 2013), differs in different languages.",
        "Moreover, such differences can be important in cross-language information summarization, (Ji et al., 2013).",
        "We use a freely-available comparable news corpus, (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), to investigate the difference of event representation in English and Russian.",
        "The corpus contains 2327 BBC messages from the time period from 1 January 2001 to 10 May 2005, and their approximate translations from the Lenta.ru website; the translations may be quite different from their English sources and are stylistically similar to standard Russian news.",
        "We processed the corpora with the security and epidemics IE systems, using the respective language; the results are presented in the Table 6.",
        "The table shows that for both scenarios the English system finds more events than the Russian, which probably means that coverage of the Russian IE is lower.",
        "We have yet to conduct a thorough evaluation of the events found.",
        "It is also clear from the table that specific events are much more rare than general events; for the security scenario, the majority of events have type CRISIS, which is a general type that indicates some incident related to crime; in the epidemics scenario, the majority of events have type HARM, i.e., which is a gen",
        "eral type indicating that there are victims (e.g., humans) suffering from some cause, not only harm caused by infections.",
        "The distributions of event types are similar in English and Russian corpora, which may hint that a lack of specific events may be a property of the scenarios, irrespective of the language.",
        "This agrees with the expectation that the majority of retrieved documents are not relevant."

        "The Russian-language processing pipeline presented above is compatible with the working, pre-existing PULS IE system.",
        "It is worth noting again, that the output of the Russian-language analysis has the same form as that of the English-language PULS event extraction, that is, all fills for the template slots are output in English (except in the case of person names).",
        "This is made possible by the shared, language-independent ontology.",
        "An important benefit of this sharing is that the end-user is not required to understand Russian in order to determine whether the extracted facts and documents are relevant to her/his need.",
        "Thus, the slot fills may be presented in English, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The document text, however, may be presented in Russian; users who can read Russian can see the original article text where event elements are indicated (by highlighting or underlining).",
        "Figure 2 shows a summary-style list of events found from the news stream.",
        "The user can see events extracted from documents in a mix of languages (identified by the language tag in the leftmost column).",
        "The database representation for events is shared and independent of the language; this permits the user get a grasp of current situation in the domain of interest, in more than one language.",
        "We checked the impact of the Russian component on the system's coverage over the geographic area of the former USSR, which includes regions (outside Russia) where Russian may be used as a lingua franca, and may be common in press.",
        "Figure 3 shows the total number of events found in Russia, using both the Russian-and English-language IE systems for the four most frequently reported diseases.",
        "The check was conducted on news streams over 2011?2012.",
        "The number of events increases dramatically after deploying the Russian component, at the end of 2011 (near the middle of the timeline)."

        "We currently handle two scenarios: Security and Epidemic Surveillance.",
        "The amount of effort needed to develop the Russian component was modest compared to the time and labour spent on the English-language IE system.",
        "The Russian system demonstrates a comparable level of performance to the baseline English IE: F-measure is about 4% lower for the Security scenario and 2% higher for the Epidemic Surveillance.",
        "We believe that this success is due to two main factors: first, the reuse of as many existing modules and knowledge bases as possible from the pre-existing English-language system; second, the use of shallow, permissive patterns in Russian in combination with logical inference rules.",
        "In future research, we plan to further expand the pattern sets and lexicons, to analyze more kinds of syntactic and lexical phenomena in Russian.",
        "We plan to compare structural differences between the Security and Epidemics scenarios and their representation in Russian and English, to find language-dependent and language-independent features of the event representations.",
        "We plan to use cross-lingual analysis to obtain advances in two directions: first, pre-IE automatic pattern and paraphrase acquisition for free-word-order languages; second, post-IE aggregation of extracted information to improve overall quality by use of cross-document context, (Chen and Ji, 2009; Yangarber and Jokipii, 2005; Yangarber, 2006)."
