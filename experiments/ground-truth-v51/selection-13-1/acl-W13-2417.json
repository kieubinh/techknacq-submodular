        "PropBank spurred a lot of research in SRL (Pradhan et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2008; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004), to mention but a few.",

        "Morphosemantic relations in WordNet denote relations between (synset members) that are similar in meaning and where one word is derived from the other by means of a morphological affix (Fell-baum et al., 2009).",
        "The authors also note that most of the morphosemantic relations connect words from different classes and go on to demonstrate that part of the noun-verb relations correspond to",
        "semantic roles.",
        "In fact, many of the noun-verb morphosemantic links in WordNet designate typical relations between a participant and a predicate, such as agent, instrument, material, location, un-dergoer, destination, etc.",
        "For instance the verb literal send (cause to be directed or transmitted to another place) is related to the noun sender (someone who transmits a message) through the morphosemantic relation agent and to the noun sendee (the intended recipient of a message) through destination; train (educate for a future role or function) is connected to trainer (one who trains other persons or animals) through agent and to trainee (someone who is being trained) through undergoer.",
        "The noun members of these morphosemantic relations can function as arguments of the particular verbs and bear the respective semantic roles, i.e. agent for sender and trainer, destination for sendee, and undergoer for trainee.",
        "Further, we assume that if a noun and a verb enter into the same morphosemantic relation individually, they are licensed for it and therefore, when they collocate, they enter into this relation if there is no other appropriate noun candidate for the same relation.",
        "As an example, consider the sentence: The author used the method of cost-effectiveness analysis.",
        "The verb use is linked to user through the morphosemantic relation agent.",
        "The noun author is connected with the verb author (be the author of) by means of the same relation.",
        "By virtue of the above assumption we assign the relation agent between use and author in this particular sentence.",
        "In such a way the morphosemantic relation identified between the derivationally related verb and noun may be inherited by synonyms, direct hypernyms, hyponyms, sister terms, etc.",
        "Thus, given a morphosemantic relation and words in the context that participate in such a relation independently of each other, we are able to discover certain types of semantic relations."

        "In this paper we have explored the applicability of the morphosemantic relations in WordNet for cross-language identification of semantic and in some cases syntactic dependencies between collocated verbs and nouns.",
        "As morphosemantic relations are valid cross-linguistically, the method is applicable for any language or a pair of languages.",
        "The limitations of the proposed method lie in the insufficient connectivity of the nodes (synsets and literals).",
        "We have described an approach to automatic wordnet enhancement, which has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of morphosemantic relations.",
        "Another inherent weakness is that some of the relations are very general or vaguely defined.",
        "We have addressed this problem by considering relations jointly with the general semantic classes associated with the synsets in WordNet.",
        "The method has the advantage of using limited linguistic annotation.",
        "It does not require text alignment, syntactic parsing or word-sense disambiguation.",
        "The cross-linguistic similarity partially disambiguates the target words, so that the senses for which the clauses are not similar are discarded; the semantic restrictions imposed by the general semantic classes and their compatibility also contribute to semantic disambiguation.",
        "The method is thus to a large extent language-independent and well suited to less-resourced languages.",
        "In order to improve the performance and overcome the limitations of the method, we plan to explore deeper into the possibilities of predicting the roles of the verb participants from their general semantic class and the semantic compatibility of verb and noun classes, as well as from the compatibility of the different types of morphosemantic relations with the general semantic classes.",
        "Another line of research to pursue in the future is the application of the proposed method and its subtasks to other NLP tasks, such as clause splitting, alignment based on wordnet relations, extraction of patterns from comparable corpora, and augmentation and enhancement of training data for MT."
