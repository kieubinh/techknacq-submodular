        "This paper presents a simple and effective method for automatic bilingual lexicon extraction from less-known language pairs.",

        "Moreover, we use a freely available word aligner: Anymalign (Lardilleux et al., 2011) for constructing context vectors.",
        "Unlike the previous works, we obtain context vectors via a pivot language.",
        "Therefore, we do not require to translate context vectors by using a seed dictionary and improve the accuracy of low frequency word alignments that is weakness of statistical model by using Anymalign.",
        "In this paper, experiments have been conducted on two different language pairs that are bidirectional Korean-Spanish and Korean-French, respectively.",
        "The experimental results have demonstrated that our method for high-frequency words shows at least 76.3 and up to 87.2% and for the low-frequency words at least 43.3% and up to 48.9% within the top 20 ranking candidates, respectively."

        "Bilingual lexicons are an important resource in many domains, for example, machine translation, cross-language information retrieval, and so on.",
        "The direct way of bilingual lexicon extraction is to align words from a parallel corpus (Wu and Xia, 1994), which contains source texts and their translations.",
        "For some language pairs, however, collecting the parallel corpus is not easy and are restricted to specific domains.",
        "For these reasons, many researchers in bilingual lexicon extraction have focused on comparable corpora (Fung, 1995; Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010).",
        "These corpora are also hard to build on less-known language pairs, for instances, Korean and Spanish, Korean and French, and so on.",
        "Therefore, some researchers have studied the use of pivot languages as an intermediary language to extract bilingual lexicons (Tanaka and Ummemura, 1994; Wu and Wang, 2007; Tsunakawa et al., 2008).",
        "On the other hand, some researchers adopt information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract bilingual lexicons (Fung, 1998; Gaussier et al., 2004; Hazem et al., 2012).",
        "The techniques are collecting all the lexical units from each of two languages, and , respectively, and then are generating context vectors and for the collected lexical units in and , respectively.",
        "The context vector, and are translated using seed dictionaries, which are manually constructed by hand and of which the size is huge for accurate translation.",
        "Finally, the context vectors, and are compared with each other in order to get their translation candidates.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple and effective method for bilingual lexicons between two less-known language pairs using a pivot language and IR techniques.",
        "The pivot language is used for representing both of context vectors of a source language and a target language and IR techniques for calculating the similarity between the source context vector and the target context vector represented by the pivot language.",
        "Unlike the previous studies, therefore, we use two parallel corpora, Korean (KR)-English (EN) and English (EN) and English (EN)-Spanish (ES).",
        "Here English is the pivot language.",
        "We also use a free available word aligner, called Anymalign to generate the context vectors easily.",
        "The proposed method has many advantages such as easy adaptation to less-known language pairs through a pivot language like English, easy extension to multi-word expression, and dramatic reduction in labor-intensive words to get a large scale seed dictionary.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we describe the proposed approach in Section 2.",

        "In this paper, a simple and effective method for bilingual lexicons between two less-known language pairs using a pivot language and IR techniques.",
        "We use parallel corpora with more accurate alignment information instead of comparable corpora.",
        "It, however, is difficult to obtain parallel corpora for less-known language pairs.",
        "For such reasons, we use a pivot language which is well-known like English.",
        "The pivot language is used for representing both of context vectors of a source language and a target language.",
        "Unlike the previous studies using comparable corpora, therefore, we use two parallel corpora through the pivot language like Korean (KR)-English (EN) and English (EN)-Spanish (ES) and IR techniques for calculating the similarity between the source context vector and the target context vector represented by the pivot language.",
        "In the previous works, translating context-vectors is required using a seed dictionary, but in this paper, translating them is not needed any-more.",
        "Therefore, any bilingual dictionaries are not expected.",
        "Besides, we use a free available word aligner, called Anymalign, to construct context-vectors.",
        "Anymalign shows high accuracy for low-frequency words to extract translation candidates (Lardilleux et al., 2011).",
        "Overall structure of the proposed method is depicted in",
        "rized in the following three steps: i.",
        "To build source context vectors and target source context vectors for each word in the source language (eg.",
        "KR) and the target language (eg.",
        "ES) using two sets of independent parallel corpora that are KR-EN and EN-ES, respectively.",
        "All words in context vectors are weighted by Anymalign.",
        "ii.",
        "To calculate the similarity between each word in source context vector and all words in the target context vectors on the basis of the cosine measure iii.",
        "To sort the top k word pairs based on their similarity scores Two parallel corpora share a pivot language, English, in our case, and are used to build context vectors because Korean-Spanish bilingual corpora are publicly unavailable.",
        "Anymalign is used to weight all words in the context vectors.",
        "As mentioned before, in the previous work, a seed dictionary is required to translate context vectors at this time, but we do not carry out them.",
        "After context vectors are built once, all source and target context vectors are compared each other to get its similarity between them by using the cosine measure.",
        "Finally, top k word pairs are extracted as a result."

        "Each lexicon is unidirectional, meaning that they list the meanings of words of one language in another, and contains 100 high frequent words (denoted by HIGH hereafter) and 100 low rare words (denoted by LOW hereafter), respectively.",
