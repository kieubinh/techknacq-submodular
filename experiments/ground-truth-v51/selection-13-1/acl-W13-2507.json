        "The paper explores the options for building bilingual dictionaries by automated methods.",
        "We define the notion ?basic vocabulary?",
        "and investigate how well the conceptual units that make up this language-independent vocabulary are covered by language-specific bindings in 40 languages.",
        "Introduction Globalization increasingly brings languages in contact.",
        "At the time of the pioneering IBM work on the Hansard corpus (Brown et al., 1990), only two decades ago, there was no need for a Basque-Chinese dictionary, but today there is (Saralegi et al., 2012).",
        "While the methods for building dictionaries from parallel corpora are now mature (Melamed, 2000), there is a dearth of bilingual or even monolingual material (Zse?der et al., 2012), hence the increased interest in comparable corpora.",
        "Once we find bilingual speakers capable of carrying out a manual evaluation of representative samples, it is relatively easy to measure the precision of a dictionary built by automatic methods.",
        "But measuring recall remains a challenge, for if there existed a high quality machine-readable dictionary (MRD) to measure against, building a new one would largely be pointless, except perhaps as a means of engineering around copyright restrictions.",
        "We could measure recall against Wik-tionary, but of course this is a moving target, and more importantly, the coverage across language pairs is extremely uneven.",
        "What we need is a standardized vocabulary resource that is equally applicable to all language pairs.",
        "In this paper we describe our work toward creating such a resource by extending the 4lang conceptual dictionary (Kornai and Makrai, 2013) to the top 40 languages (by Wikipedia size) using a variety of methods.",
        "Since some of the resources studied here are not available for the initial list of 40 languages, we extended the original list to 50 languages so as to guarantee at least 40 languages for every method.",
        "Throughout the paper, results are provided for all 50 languages, indicating missing data as needed.",
        "Section 1 outlines the approach taken toward defining the basic vocabulary and translational equivalence.",
        "Section 2 describes how Wiktionary itself measures up against the 4lang resource directly and after triangulation across language pairs.",
        "Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 deals with extraction from multiply parallel and near-parallel corpora, and Section 3 offers some conclusions."

      "text": [
        "The idea that there is a basic vocabulary composed of a few hundred or at most a few thousand elements has a long history going back to the Renaissance ?",
        "for a summary, see Eco (1995).",
        "The first modern efforts in this direction are Thorndike's (1921) Word Book, based entirely on frequency counts (combining TF and DF measures), and Ogden's (1944) Basic English, based primarily on considerations of definability.",
        "Both had lasting impact, with Thorndike's approach forming the basis of much subsequent work on readability (Klare 1974, Kanungo and Orr 2009) and Ogden's forming the basis of the Simple English Wikipedia1.",
        "An important landmark is the Swadesh (1950) list, which puts special emphasis on cross-linguistic definability, as its primary goal is to support glottochronological studies.",
        "Until the advent of large MRDs, the frequency-based method was much easier to follow, and Thorndike himself has extended his original list of ten thousand words to twenty thousand (Thorndike",
        "1931) and thirty thousand (Thorndike and Lorge 1944).",
        "For a recent example see Davies and Gardner (2010), for a historical survey see McArthur (1998).",
        "The main problem with this approach is the lack of clear boundaries both at the top of the list, where function words dominate, and at the bottom, where it seems quite arbitrary to cut the list off after the top three hundred words (Diedrich 1938), the top thousand, as is common in foreign language learning, or the top five thousand, especially as the frequency curves are generally in good agreement with Zipf's law and thus show no obvious inflection point.",
        "The problem at the top is perhaps more significant, since any frequency-based listing will start with the function words of the language, characterizing more its grammar than its vocabulary.",
        "For this reason, the list is highly varied across languages, and what is a word (free form) in one language, like English the, often ends up as an affix (bound form) in another, like the Romanian suffix -ul.",
        "By choosing a frequency-based approach, we inevitably put the emphasis on comparing grammars and morphologies, instead of comparing vocabularies.",
        "The definitional method is based on the assumption that dictionaries will attempt to define the more complex words by simpler ones.",
        "Therefore, starting with any word list L, the list D(L) obtained by collecting the words appearing on the right-hand side of the dictionary definitions will be simpler, the list D(D(L)) obtained by repeating the method will be yet simpler, and so on, until we arrive at an irreducible list of basic words that can no longer be further simplified.",
        "Modern MRDs, starting with the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), generally enforce a strict list of words and word senses that can appear in definitions, which guarantees that the basic list will be a subset of this defining vocabulary.",
        "This method, while still open to charges of arbitrariness at the high end, in regards to the separation of function words from basic words, creates a bright line at the low end: no word, no matter how frequent, needs to be included as long as it is not necessary for defining other words.",
        "In creating the 4lang conceptual dictionary (Kornai and Makrai, 2013), we took advantage of the fact that the definitional method is robust in terms of choosing the seed list L, and built a seed of approximately 3,500 entries composed of the Longman Defining Vocabulary (2,200 entries), the most frequent 2,000 words according to the Google unigram count (Brants and Franz 2006) and the BNC, as well as the most frequent 2,000 words from Polish (Hala?csy et al2004) and Hungarian (Kornai et al2006).",
        "Since Latin is one of the four languages supported by 4lang (the other three being English, Polish, and Hungarian), we added the classic Diederich (1938) list and Whitney's (1885) Roots.",
        "The basic list emerging from the iteration has 1104 elements (including two bound morphemes but excluding technical terms of the formal semantic model that have no obvious surface reflex).",
        "We will refer to this as the basic or uroboros set as it has the property that each of its members can be defined in terms of the others, and we reserve the name 4lang for the larger set of 3,345 elements from which it was obtained.",
        "Since 4lang words can be defined using only the uroboros vocabulary, and every word in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English can be defined using the 4lang vocabulary (since this is a superset of LDV), we have full confidence that every sense of every non-technical word can be defined by the uroboros vocabulary.",
        "In fact, the Simple English Wikipedia is an attempt to do this (Yasseri et al., 2012) based on Ogden's Basic English, which overlaps with the uroboros set very significantly (Dice 0.527).",
        "The lexicographic principles underlying 4lang have been discussed elsewhere (Kornai, 2012; Kornai and Makrai, 2013), here we just summarize the most salient points.",
        "First, the system is intended to capture everyday vocabulary.",
        "Once the boundaries of natural language are crossed, and goats are defined by their set of genes (rather than an old-fashioned taxonomic description involving cloven hooves and the like), or derivative is defined as lim?",
        "?0(f(x + ?)",
        "?",
        "f(x))/?, the uroboros vocabulary loses its grip.",
        "But for the non-technical vocabulary, and even the part of the technical vocabulary that rests on natural language (e.g. legal definitions or the definitions in philosophy and discursive prose in general), coverage of the uroboros set promises a strategy of gradually extending the vocabulary from the simple to the more complex.",
        "Thus, to define Jupiter as ?the largest planet of the Sun?, we need to define planet, but not large as this item is already listed in the uroboros set.",
        "Since planet is defined ?as a large body in space that moves around a star?, by substitution we will obtain for Jupiter the definition ?the",
        "largest body in space that moves around the Sun?",
        "where all the key items large, body, space, move, around are part of the uroboros set.",
        "Proper nouns like Sun are discussed further in (Kornai, 2010), but we note here that they constitute a very small proportion (less than 6%) of the basic vocabulary.",
        "Second, the ultimate definitions of the uroboros elements are given in the formal language of machines (Eilenberg, 1974), and at that level the English words serve only a mnemonic purpose, and could in principle be replaced by any arbitrary names or even numbers.",
        "Because this would make debugging next to impossible, as in purposely obfuscated code, we resort to using English print-names for each concept, but it is important to keep in mind that these are only weakly reflective of the English word.",
        "For example, the system relies heavily on an element has that indicates the possessive relation both in the direct sense, as in the Sun's planet, the planet of the Sun and in its more indirect uses, as in John's favorite actress where there is no question of John being in possession of the actress.",
        "In other languages, has will generally be translated by morphemes (often bound morphemes) indicating possession, but there is no attempt to cross-link all relevant uses.",
        "The element has will appear in the definition of Latin meus and noster alike, but of course there is no claim that English has underlies the Latin senses.",
        "If we know how to express the basic vocabulary elements in a given language, which is the task we concentrate on here, and how to combine the expressions in that language, we are capable of defining all remaining words of the language.",
        "In general, matching up function words cross-linguistically is an extremely hard task, especially as they are often expressed by inflectional morphology and our workflow, which includes stemming, just strips off the relevant elements.",
        "Even across languages where morphological analysis is a solved task, it will take a great deal of manual work to establish some form of translational equivalence, and we consider the issue out of scope here.",
        "But for content words, the use of language-independent concepts simplifies matters a great deal: instead of finding",
        "pairs for the 3,384 concepts that already have manual bindings in four languages (currently, Latin and Polish are only 90% complete), our goal is only to find reasonable printnames for the 1,104 basic concepts in all 40 languages.",
        "Translation pairs are only obtained indirectly, through the conceptual pivot, and thus do not amount to fully valid bilingual translation pairs.",
        "For example, he-goat in one language may just get mapped to the concept goat, and if billy-goat is present in another language, the strict translational equivalence between the gendered forms will be lost because of the poverty of the pivot.",
        "Nevertheless, rough equivalence at the conceptual level is already a useful notion, especially for filtering out candidate pairs produced by more standard bilingual dictionary building methods, to which we now turn."

        "A similar method, within one dictionary rather than",
