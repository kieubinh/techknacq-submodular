        "Comparable corpora serve as essential resources for numerous studies and applications in both linguistics (contrastive language, text analysis), translation studies and natural language processing (machine translation, computational lexicography, information extraction).",
        "Many comparable corpora are available and have been being created for different language pairs like (a) English, German and Italian (Baroni et al., 2009); (b) English, Norwegian, German and French (Johansson, 2002); (c) written or spoken English and German (Hansen et al., 2012) or (Lapshinova et al., 2012).",
        "However, comparable corpora may be of the same language, as the feature of ?comparability?",
        "may relate not only to corpora of different languages but also to those of the same language.",
        "The main feature that makes them comparable is that they cover the same text type(s) in the same proportions, cf. for instance, (Laviosa, 1997) or (McEnery, 2003), and thus, can be used for a certain comparison task.",
        "As our research goal is the analysis of translation variation, we need a corpus which allows us to compare translations, which differ in the source/target language, the type of the text translated (genre or register) and the method of translation (human with/without CAT1 tools, machine translation).",
        "There are a number of corpus-based studies dedicated to the analysis of variation phenomena, cf. (Teich, 2003; Steiner, 2004; Neumann, 2011) among others.",
        "However, all of them concentrate on the analysis of human translations only, comparing translated texts with non-translated ones.",
        "In some works on machine translation, the focus does lie on comparing different translation variants (human vs. machine), e.g. (White, 1994; Papineni et al., 2002; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Popovic?, 2011).",
        "However, they all serve the task of automatic machine translation (MT) systems evaluation and use the human-produced translations as references or training material only.",
        "None of them provide analysis of specifc (linguistic) features of different text types translated with different translation methods.",
        "The same tendencies are observed in the corpus resources available, as they are mostly built for certain research goals.",
        "Although there exists a number of translation corpora, none of them fits our research task: most of them include one translation method only: EUROPARL (Koehn, 2005) and JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al., 2006) ?",
        "translations produced by humans, or DARPA",
        "Moreover, they all contain one register only and, therefore, cannot be applied to a comprehensive analysis of variation phenomena.",
        "Therefore, we decided to compile our own comparable corpus which contains translations from different languages, of different text types, produced with different translation methods (human vs. machine).",
        "Furthermore, both human and machine translations contain further varieties: they are produced by different translators (both professional and student), with or without CAT tools or by different MT systems.",
        "This resource will be valuable not only for our research goals, or for research purposes of further translation researchers.",
        "It can also find further applications, e.g. in machine translation or CAT tool development, as well as translation quality asses-ment.",

        "Thus, differences between registers or text types can be identified through the analysis of occurrence of lexico-grammatical features in these registers, see Biber's studies on linguistic variation, e.g. (Biber, 1988; Biber, 1995) or (Biber et al., 1999).",

        "but on the other, it can be used for the development, optimisation and evaluation of MT systems, as well as CAT tools (e.g. translation memories).",
        "In the future, we aim at expanding it with more data: (1) more texts for the existing registers (each register should contain around 30,000 words), (2) further text registers (e.g. academic, web and news texts).",
        "We also plan to produce further human and machine-generated translations, i.e. (3) machine translations post-edited by humans, as well as translation outputs of (4) further MT systems.",
        "Moreover, we aim at adding translations from German into English to trace variation influenced by language typology.",
        "As the automatic tagging of part-of-speech and chunk information might be erroneous, we plan to evaluate the output of the TreeTagger and compare it with the output of further tools available, e.g. MATE dependency parser, cf. (Bohnet, 2010).",
        "Furthermore, the originals will be aligned with their translations on word and sentence level.",
        "This annotation type is particularly important for the analysis of variation in translation of certain lexico-grammatical structures.",
        "A part of the corpus (CAT, RBMT and SMT subcorpora) will be available to a wider academic public, e.g. via the CLARIN-D repository."
