        "Most advocates (Pereira, 2000; Bod et al., 2003) and critics (Chomsky, 1957; Fong et al., 2013) of a probabilistic view of grammatical knowledge have assumed that this view identifies the grammatical status of a sentence directly with the probability of its occurrence.",
        "By contrast, we seek to characterize grammatical knowledge statistically, but without reducing grammaticality directly to probability.",
        "Instead we specify a set of scoring procedures for mapping the logprob value of a sentence into a relative grammaticality score, on the basis of the properties of the sentence and of the logprobs that an n-gram word model generates for the corpus containing the sentence.",
        "A scoring procedure in this set generates scores in terms of which we construct a grammaticality classifier, using a parameterized standard deviation from the mean value.",
        "The classifier provides a procedure for testing the accuracy of different scoring criteria in separating grammatical from ungrammatical passive sentences.",
        "We evaluate this approach by applying it to the task of distinguishing well and ill-formed sentences with passive constructions headed by four different sorts of verbs: intransitives (appear, last), pseudo-transitives, which take a restricted set of notional objects (laugh a hearty laugh, weigh 10 kg), ambiguous transitives, which allow both agentive and thematic subjects (the jeans / the tailor fitted John), and robust transitives that passivize freely (write, move).",
        "Intransitives and pseudo-transitives generally yield ill-formed passives.",
        "Passives formed from ambiguous transitives tend to be well-formed only on the agentive reading.",
        "Robust transitives, for the most part, yield acceptable passives, even if they are semantically (or pragmatically) odd.",
        "Experimenting with several scoring procedures and alternative values for our standard deviation parameter, we found that our classifier can distinguish pairwise between elements of the first two classes of passives and those of the latter two with a high degree of accuracy.",
        "However, its performance is far less reliable in identifying the difference between ambiguous and robust transitive passives.",
        "The first classification task relies on local lexical patterns that can be picked up by n-gram models, while the second requires identification of anomalous relations between passivized verbs and by-phrases, which are not generally accessible to measurement within the range of an n-gram.",
        "We also observed that as we increased the size of the training corpus, the performance of our enriched models on the classification task also increased.",
        "This result suggests that better n-gram language models are more sensitive to the sorts of patterns that our scoring procedures rely on to generate accurate grammaticality classifications.",
        "We note the important difference between",
        "grammaticality and acceptability.",
        "Following standard assumptions, we take grammaticality to be a theoretical notion, and acceptability to be an empirically testable property.",
        "Acceptability is, in part, determined by grammaticality, but also by factors such as sentence length, processing limitations, semantic acceptability and many other elements.",
        "Teasing apart these two concepts, and explicating their precise relationship raises a host of subtle methodological issues that we will not address here.",
        "Oversimplifying somewhat, we are trying to reconstruct a gradient notion of grammaticality which is derived from probabilistic models, that can serve as a core component of a full model of acceptability.",
        "We distinguish our task from the standard task of error detection in NLP (e.g. Post (2011)), that can be used in various language processing systems, such as machine translation (Pauls and Klein, 2012), language modeling and so on.",
        "In error detection, the problem is a supervised learning task.",
        "Given a corpus of examples labeled as grammatical or ungrammatical, the problem is to learn a classifier to distinguish them.",
        "We use supervised learning as well, but only to measure the upper bound of an unsupervised learning method.",
        "We assume that native speakers do not, in general, have access to systematic sets of ungrammatical sentences that they can use to calibrate their judgement of acceptability.",
        "Rather ungrammatical sentences are unusual or unlikely.",

        "We assume that we have some high quality language model which defines a probability distribution over whole sentences.",
        "As has often been noted, it is not possible to reduce grammaticality directly to a probability of this type, for several reasons.",
        "First, if one merely specifies a fixed probability value as a threshold for grammaticality, where strings are deemed to be grammatical if and only if their probability is higher than the threshold, then one is committed to the existence of only a finite number of grammatical sentences.",
        "The probabilities of the possible strings of words in a language sum to 1, and so at most 1/ sentences can have a probability of at least .",
        "Second, probability can be affected by factors that do not influence grammaticality.",
        "For example, the word ?yak?",
        "is rarer (and therefore less probable) than the word ?horse?, but this does not affect the relative grammaticality of ?I saw a horse?",
        "versus ?I saw a yak?.",
        "Third, a short ungrammatical sentence may have a higher probability than a long grammatical sentence with many rare words.",

        "Probabilistic inference is pervasive throughout all domains of cognition (Chater et al., 2006), and therefore it is plausible to assume that knowledge of language is also probabilistic in nature.",

        "Without them we would not be able to understand speech in a noisy environment.",

        "Scores of the second type are based on the intuition that the (un)grammaticality of a sentence is largely determined by its problematic components.",

        "In future work we will be experimenting with more expressive language models that can represent non-local syntactic relations.",
        "We will proceed conservatively by first extending our enriched lexical n-gram models to chunking models, and then to dependency grammar models, using only as much syntactic structure as is required to identify the judgement patterns that we are studying.",
