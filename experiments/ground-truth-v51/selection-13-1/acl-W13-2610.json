        "A central question in psycholinguistic modeling is the development of models for human sentence processing difficulty.",
        "An approach that has received a lot of interest in recent years is the information-theoretic measure of surprisal (Hale, 2001).",
        "Recent studies have shown that surprisal can successfully account for a range of psycholinguistic effects (Levy, 2008), as well as account for effects in naturalistic broad-coverage texts (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Roark et al., 2009; Frank, 2009; Mitchell et al., 2010).",
        ": what work of Roark and Frank you mean here?",
        "Under the notion of the Uniform Information Density hypothesis (UID, Levy and Jaeger, 2007; Frank and Jaeger, 2008), surprisal has also been used to explain choices in language production: When their language gives people the option to choose between different linguistic encodings, people tend to choose the encoding that distributes the information more uniformly across the sentence (where the information conveyed by a word is its surprisal).",
        "When using surprisal as a cognitive model of processing difficulty, we hypothesize that the processing difficulty incurred by the human when processing the word is proportional to the update of the interpretation, i.e. the information conveyed by the word (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008).",
        "We can try to estimate particular aspects of the information conveyed by a word, e.g., the information conveyed about the syntactic structure of the sentence, the semantic interpretation, or about discourse relations within the text.",
        "This paper does not go all the way to proposing a model of discourse relation surprisal, but discusses first steps towards a model for the information conveyed by discourse connectors about discourse relations, based on available resources like the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "First, we quantify how unambiguously specific discourse relations are marked by their typical connectors (Section 4.1) and test whether easily inferable relations are on average marked more ambiguously than relations which are less expected according to the default assumption of a reader.",
        "This idea is shaped with respect to the UID hypothesis: expected relations can afford to be signaled by weaker markers and less expected ones should be marked by strong connectors in order to keep the discourse-level information density smooth throughout the text (Section 4.2).",
        "We then investigate in more detail the types of ambiguity that a reader might face when processing discourse relations.",
        "While some ambiguities lie in discourse connectors, it also happens that more than one relation exist at the same time between two text spans.",
        "We show that",
        "some discourse markers also signal the presence of several relations (Section 5).",
        "In computational modeling as well as laboratory set-ups, one should therefore have a strategy to deal with the different types of ambiguities.",
        "Finally, we ask what granularity of distinction from other discourse relations (with respect to the PDTB relation sense hierarchy) each English discourse connective conveys (Section 6)."

        "A cognitive approach to discourse processing emphasizes on the procedural role of the connectives to constrain the way readers relate the propositions in a text (Blakemore, 1992; Blass, 1993).",
        "Experimental findings suggest that these markers can facilitate the inference of specific discourse relations (De-gand and Sanders, 2002), and that discourse connectors are processed incrementally Ko?hne and Demberg (2013).",
        "People can however infer discourse relations also in the absence of discourse connecotrs, relying on the propositional content of the sentences and their world-knowledge (Hobbs, 1979; Asher and Lascarides, 1998).",

        "To illuminate the role of these factors let's have a look at (1).",
        "While the type of relation between the two events is clearly inferable in (1-a) and (1-b) due to the discourse connectives, in (1-c), the reader would have to access their knowledge, e.g., about Harry (from larger context) or the usual affairs between bosses and employees, in order to construct a discourse relation.",

        "Levinson (2000) notes in his discussion on presumptive meanings that ?when events are conjoined they tend to be read as temporally successive and if at all plausible, as causally linked?.",
        "If this is true then the result reading is most probable for (1-c).",
        "General preferences of this kind have been investigated via experimental approaches (Segal et al., 1991; Murray, 1997; Sanders, 2005; Kuperberg et al., 2011).",
        "Segal et al. (1991) and Murray (1997) argue that readers expect a sentence to be continuous with respect to its preceding context (the continuity hypothesis).",
        "Continuous discourse relations in terms of congruency and/or temporality are consequently easier to process than the discontinuous ones.",
        "Sanders (2005) proposes that causal relatedness entails the maximum degree of coherence in a text, therefore readers always start by attempting to find cause-consequence relations between neighboring sentences (the causality-by-default hypothesis).",
        "In a similar vein, Kuperberg et al. (2011) shows that readers face comprehension difficulty when sentences in short text spans cannot be put into causal relation and no marker of other relations (e.g., Concession) is available.",
        "Taken together, these findings suggest that world knowledge, general cognitive biases, and linguistic features of the sentences such as the presence of a weak or strong marker contribute to the relational inference.",
        "With a look back to the information theoretic approach to the linguistic patterns, one could hypothesize that when one factor is strongly triggering expectation for a specific type of relation the other factors could remain silent in order to keep the information distribution uniform.",
        "With this perspective, Asr and Demberg (2012a) tested whether the predictability of discourse relations due to general cognitive biases (towards causality and continuity) can explain the presence vs. absence of the discourse connectors.",

        "This is in line with the UID and the continuity and causality-by-default hypotheses put forth by Murray (1997) and Sanders (2005).",
        "The second study then went on to show that one can distinguish several types of ambiguity among discourse relations, in particular, more than one relation can hold between two propositions, and there are some connectives which express this inherent ambiguity.",
        "In the third study, we also showed that the effect of particular discourse markers varies with respect to their contribution in different levels of relation classification.",
        "Some connectives such as the majority of the adversative ones, simply help to distinguish contrastive relations from other classes, while those with a temporal directionality contribute most in the deeper level of the PDTB hierarchical classification.",
        "The enhancement measure introduced in this paper can be employed for measuring the effect of any discriminative feature through the hierarchical classification of the relations.",
        "This work is a first step towards the computational modeling of the discourse processing with respect to the linguistic markers of the abstract discourse relations.",
        "In future work, we would like to look at the contribution of different types of relational markers including sentence connectives, sentiment words, implicit causality verbs, negation markers, event modals etc., which in the laboratory setup have proven to affect the expectation of the readers about an upcoming discourse relation (Kehler et al., 2008; Webber, 2013)."
