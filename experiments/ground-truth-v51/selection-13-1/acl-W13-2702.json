        "In this paper we aim to develop a system to paraphrase between diachronically distinct language variants.",
        "For research into history, historical linguistics and diachronic language change, historical texts are of great value.",
        "Specifically from earlier periods, texts are often the only forms of information that have been preserved.",
        "One problem that arises when studying these texts is the difference between the language the text is written in and the modern variant that the researchers who want to study the texts know and speak themselves.",
        "It takes a great deal of deciphering and interpretation to be able to grasp these texts.",
        "Our aim is to facilitate scholars such as historians who do not possess extensive knowledge of Middle Dutch who are studying medieval texts.",
        "We do this by attempting to generate literal translations of the sentences in the text into modern language.",
        "In particular we focus on the task of translating Middle Dutch to modern Dutch.",
        "The transformation between language variants, either synchronically or diachronically, can be seen as a paraphrase and a translation task, as it is often impossible to categorize two languages as either variants or different languages.",
        "We define Middle Dutch as a collection of closely related West Germanic dialects that were spoken and written between 1150 and 1500 in the area that is now defined as the Netherlands and parts of Belgium.",
        "One of the factors that make Middle Dutch difficult to read is the fact that at the time no overarching standard language existed.",
        "Modern Dutch is defined as Dutch as spoken from 1500.",
        "The variant we investigate is contemporary Dutch.",
        "An important difference with regular paraphrasing is the amount of parallel data available.",
        "The amount of parallel data for the variant pair Middle Dutch - Modern Dutch is several orders of magnitude smaller than bilingual parallel corpora typically used in machine translation (Koehn, 2005) or monolingual parallel corpora used for paraphrase generation by machine translation (Wubben et al., 2010).",
        "We do expect many etymologically related words to show a certain amount of character overlap between the Middle and Modern variants.",
        "An example of the data is given below, from the work ?Van den vos Reynaerde?",
        "(?About Reynard the Fox?",
        "), part of the Comburg manuscript that was written between 1380-1425.",
        "Here, the first text is the original text, the second text is a modern translation in Dutch by Walter Verniers and a translation in English is added below that for clarity.",
        "?Doe al dat hof versamet was, Was daer niemen, sonder die das, Hine hadde te claghene over Reynaerde, Den fellen metten grijsen baerde.?",
        "?Toen iedereen verzameld was, was er niemand -behalve de das-die niet kwam klagen over Reynaert, die deugniet met zijn grijze baard.?",
        "?When everyone was gathered, there was noone except the badger-who did not complain about Reynaert, that rascal with his grey beard.",
        "?",
        "We can observe that although the two Dutch texts are quite different, there is a large amount of character overlap in the words that are used.",
        "Our aim is to use this character overlap to compensate for the lower amount of data that is available.",
        "We compare three different approaches to translate Middle Dutch into Modern Dutch: a standard Phrase-Based machine translation (PBMT) approach, a PBMT approach with additional preprocessing based on Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment, and a character bigram based PBMT approach.",
        "The PBMT approach with preprocessing identifies likely translations based on character overlap and adds them as a dictionary to improve the statistical alignment process.",
        "The PBMT approach based on character bigrams rather than translating words, transliterates character bigrams and in this way improves the transformation process.",
        "We demonstrate that these two approaches outperform standard PBMT in this task, and that the PBMT transliteration approach based on character bigrams performs best."

        "In this paper we have described two modifications of the standard PBMT framework to improve the transformation of Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch",
        "error between brackets and the lower and upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval by using character overlap in the two variants.",
        "We described one approach that helps the alignment process by adding words that exhibit a certain amount of character overlap to the parallel data.",
        "We also described another approach that translates sequences of character bigrams instead of words.",
        "Reviewing the results we conclude that the use of character overlap between diachronic variants of a language is beneficial in the translation process.",
        "More specifically, the model that uses character bigrams in translation instead of words is ranked best.",
        "Also ranked significantly better than a standard Phrase Based machine translation approach is the approach using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align sentences and identify words or phrases that exhibit a significant amount of character overlap to help the GIZA++ statistical alignment process towards aligning the correct words and phrases.",
        "We have seen that one issue that is encountered when considering the task of language transformation from Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch is data sparseness.",
        "The number of lines used to train on amounts to a few thousand, and not millions as is more common in SMT.",
        "It is therefore crucial to use the inherent character overlap in this task to compensate for the lack of data and to make more informed decisions.",
        "The character bigram approach is able to generate a translation for out of vocabulary words, which is also a solution to the data sparseness problem.",
        "One area where the character bigram model often fails, is translating Middle Dutch words into Modern Dutch words that are significantly different.",
        "One example can be seen in Table 7, where ?mocht?",
        "is translated by the PBMT and PBMT + Overlap systems to ?kon?",
        "and left the same by the character bigram transliteration model.",
        "This is probably due to the fact that ?mocht?",
        "still exists in Dutch, but is not as common as ?kon?",
        "(meaning ?could?).",
        "another issue to consider is the fact that the character bigram model learns character mappings that are occurring trough out the language.",
        "One example is the disappearing silent ?h?",
        "after a ?g?.",
        "This often leads to transliterated words of which the spelling is only partially correct.",
        "Apparently the human judges rate these ?half words?",
        "higher than completely wrong words, but automatic measures such as NIST are insensitive to this.",
        "We have also reported the NIST scores for the output of the standard PBMT approach and the two proposed variants.",
        "We see that the NIST scores show a similar patterns as the human judgements: the PBMT + Overlap and character bigram PBMT systems both achieve significantly higher NIST scores than the normal PBMT system.",
        "However, the PBMT + Overlap and character bigram PBMT models do not differ significantly in scores.",
        "It is interesting that we find no significant correlation between human and automatic judgements, leading us to believe that automatic judgements are not viable in this particular scenario.",
        "This is perhaps due to the fact that the reference translations the automatic measures rely on are in this case not literal translations but rather more loosely translated literary interpretations of the source text in modern Dutch.",
        "The fact that both versions are written on rhyme only worsens this problem, as the author of the Modern Dutch version is often very creative.",
        "We think techniques such as the ones described here can be of great benefit to laymen wishing to investigate works that are not written in contemporary language, resulting in improved access to these older works.",
        "Our character bigram transliteration model may also play some role as a computational model in the study of the evolution of orthography in language variants, as it often will generate words that are strictly speaking not correct, but do resemble Modern Dutch in some way.",
        "Automatic evaluation is another topic for future work.",
        "It would be interesting to see if an automatic measure operating on the character level correlates better with human judgements."
