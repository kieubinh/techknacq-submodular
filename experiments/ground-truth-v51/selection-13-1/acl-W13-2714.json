        "The knowledge captured in such systems can prove useful in transferring modern language resources and tools to historical domains (Meyer, 2011).",
        "Automatic translation systems between and across language stages, as in the corpus introduced by (Magaz, 2006), can benefit from the identification of feature variation over time.",

        "The influence of the temporal effects in automatic document classification is analyzed in (Moura?o et al., 2008) and (Salles et al., 2010).",
        "The authors state that a major challenge in building text classification models may be the change which occurs in the characteristics of the documents and their classes over time (Moura?o et al., 2008).",
        "Therefore, in order to overcome the difficulties which arise in automatic classification when dealing with documents dating from different epochs, identifying and accounting for document characteristics changing over time (such as class frequency, relationships between terms and classes and the similarity among classes over time (Moura?o et al., 2008)) is essential and can lead to a more accurate discrimination between classes.",
        "In (Dalli and Wilks, 2006) a method for classification of texts and documents based on their predicted time of creation is successfully applied, proving that accounting for word frequencies and their variation over time is accurate.",
        "In (Kumar et al., 2012) the authors argue as well for the capability of this method, of using words alone, to determine the epoch in which a text was written or the time period a document refers to.",
        "The effectiveness of using models for individuals partitions in a timeline with the purpose of predicting probabilities over the timeline for new documents is investigated in (Kumar et al., 2011) and (Kanhabua and N?rva?g, 2009).",
        "This approach, based on the divergence between the language model of the test document and those of the time-line partitions, was successfully employed in predicting publication dates and in searching for web pages and web documents.",
        "In (de Jong et al., 2005) the authors raise the problem of access to historical collections of documents, which may be difficult due to the different historical and modern variants of the text, the less standardized spelling, words ambiguities and",
        "other language changes.",
        "Thus, the linking of current word forms with their historical equivalents and accurate dating of texts can help reduce the temporal effects in this regard.",
        "Recently, in (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012), the authors introduced the task of identifying changes in word usage over time, disambiguating the epoch at word-level."

        "The 16th century represents the beginning of the Romanian writing.",
        "In (Dim-itrescu, 1994, p. 13) the author states that the modern Romanian vocabulary cannot be completely understood without a thorough study of the texts written in this period, which should be considered the source of the literary language used today.",
        "In the 17th century, some of the most important cultural events which led to the development of the Romanian language are the improvement of the education system and the establishing of several printing houses (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 75).",
        "According to (Lupu, 1999, p. 29), in the 18th century a diversification of the philological interests in Romania takes place, through writing the first Romanian-Latin bilingual lexicons, the draft of the first monolingual dictionary, the first Romanian grammar and the earliest translations from French.",
        "The transition to the Latin alphabet, which was a significant cultural achievement, is completed in the 19th century.",
        "The Cyrillic alphabet is maintained in Romanian writing until around 1850, afterwards being gradually replaced with the Latin alphabet (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 270).",

        "In (Maiorescu, 1866) the author argues for applying the phonetic principle and several reforms are enforced for this purpose.",
