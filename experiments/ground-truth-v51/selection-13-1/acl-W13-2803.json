        "Language models (LMs) are a fundamental piece in statistical applications that produce natural language text, such as machine translation and speech recognition.",
        "In order to perform optimally, a LM should be trained on data from the same domain as the data that it will be applied to.",
        "This poses a problem, because in the majority of applications, the amount of domain-specific data is limited.",
        "A popular strand of research in recent years to tackle this problem is that of training data selection.",
        "Given a limited domain-specific corpus and a larger non-domain-specific corpus, the task consists on finding suitable data for the specific domain in the non-domain-specific corpus.",
        "The underlying assumption is that a non-domain-specific corpus, if broad enough, contains sentences similar to a domain-specific corpus, which therefore, would be useful for training models for that domain.",
        "This paper focuses on the approach that uses perplexity for the selection of training data.",
        "The first works in this regard (Gao et al., 2002; Lin et al., 1997) use the perplexity according to a domain-specific LM to rank the text segments (e.g. sentences) of non-domain-specific corpora.",
        "The text segments with perplexity less than a given threshold are selected.",
        "A more recent method, which can be considered the state-of-the-art, is Moore-Lewis (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "It considers not only the cross-entropy1 according to the domain-specific LM but also the cross-entropy according to a LM built on a random subset (equal in size to the domain-specific corpus) of the non-domain-specific corpus.",
        "The additional use of a LM from the non-domain-specific corpus allows to select a subset of the non-domain-specific corpus which is better (the perplexity of a test set of the specific domain has lower perplexity on a LM trained on this subset) and smaller compared to the previous approaches.",
        "The experiment was carried out for English, using Europarl (Koehn, 2005) as the domain-specific corpus and LDC Gigaword2 as the non-domain-specific one.",
        "In this paper we study whether the use of two types of linguistic knowledge (lemmas and named entities) can contribute to obtain better results within the perplexity-based approach."

        "We explore the use of linguistic information for the selection of data to train domain-specific LMs from non-domain-specific corpora.",
        "Our hypothesis is that ranking by perplexity on n-grams that represent linguistic patterns (rather than n-grams that represent surface forms) captures additional information, and thus may select valuable data that is not selected according solely to surface forms.",
        "We use two types of linguistic information at",
        "word level: lemmas and named entity categories.",
        "We experiment with the following models: ?",
        "Forms (hereafter f), uses surface forms.",

        "Regarding 1-grams, compared to f, the substitution of named entities by their categories (fn) results in smaller vocabulary size (-24.79%).",
        "Similarly, the vocabulary is reduced for the models l (-8.39%) and ln (- 44.18%).",

        "We build LMs for the domain-specific and non-domain-specific corpora using the four models previously introduced.",
        "Then we rank the sentences of the non-domain-specific corpus for each of these models and keep the highest ranked sentences according to a threshold.",
        "Finally, we build a LM on the set of sentences selected3 and compute the perplexity of the test set on this LM.",
        "We also investigate the combination of the four models.",
        "The procedure is fairly straightforward: given the sentences selected by all the models for a given threshold, we iterate through these sentences following the ranking order and keeping all the distinct sentences selected until we obtain a set of sentences whose size is the one indicated by the threshold.",
        "I.e. we add to our distinct set of sentences first the top ranked sentence by each of the methods, then the sentence ranked second by each method, and so on."

        "One interesting experiment would be to apply these models to a morphologically-rich language, to check if, as hypothesised, these models deal better with sparse data.",
        "Another strand regards the application of these models to filter parallel corpora, e.g. following the extension of the Moore-Lewis method (Axelrod et al., 2011) or in combination with other methods which are deemed to be more suitable for parallel data, e.g. (Mansour et al., 2011).",
        "We have used one type of linguistic information in each LM, but another possibility is to combine different pieces of linguistic information in a single LM, e.g. following a hybrid LM that uses words and tags, depending of the frequency of each type (Ruiz et al., 2012).",
        "Given the fact that the best result is obtained with different models depending on the corpus, it would be worth to investigate whether given a new corpus, one could predict the best method to be applied and the threshold for which one could expect to obtain the minimum perplexity."
