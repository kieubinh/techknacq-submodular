        "Given the limited availability of resources for many languages, only a very small bilingual corpus is required, while language modelling is performed by sampling a large target language (TL) monolingual corpus.",

        "Currently a large proportion of language-independent MT approaches are based on the statistical machine translation (SMT) paradigm (Koehn, 2010).",
        "A main benefit of SMT is that it is directly amenable to new language pairs, provided appropriate training data are available for extracting translation and language models.",
        "The main obstacle to the creation of an SMT system is the requirement for SL-TL parallel corpora of a sufficient size to allow the extraction of meaningful translation models.",
        "Such corpora (of the order of million sentences) are hard to obtain, particularly for less resourced languages.",
        "On the other hand, the translation accuracy of such systems largely depends on the quality and size of the bilingual corpora, as well as their relevance to the domain of text being translated.",
        "Even if such parallel corpora exist for a language pair, they are frequently restricted to a specific domain (or a narrow range of domains).",
        "As a consequence, these corpora are not suitable for creating MT systems that focus on other domains.",
        "For this reason, in SMT, researchers are investigating the extraction of information from monolingual corpora, including lexical translation probabilities (Klementiev et al., 2012) and topic-specific information (Su et al., 2011).",
        "Alternative techniques for creating MT systems using less informative but readily available resources have been proposed.",
        "Even if these methods do not provide a translation quality as high as SMT, their ability to develop hybrid MT systems with very limited specialised resources represents an important advantage.",
        "Such methods include automatic inference of templates for structural transfer from SL to TL (Caseli et al., 2008 and Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2009).",
        "Similarly, Carbonell et al. (2006) propose an MT method that needs no parallel text, but relies on a lightweight translation model utilising a full-form bilingual dictionary and a decoder for long-range context.",
        "Other systems using low-cost resources include METIS (Dologlou et al., 2003) and METIS-II (Markantonatou et al., 2009; Carl et al., 2008), which utilise a bilingual lexicon",
        "and monolingual corpora to translate SL texts.",
        "METIS/METIS II, which have studied translation only towards English, employ pattern recognition algorithms to retrieve the most appropriate translation from a monolingual corpus."

      "text": [
        "The MT methodology has been developed within the PRESEMT (Pattern REcognition-based Statistically Enhanced MT) project, funded by the European Commission (cf. www.presemt.eu).",
        "It comprises three stages: (i) pre-processing, where the input sentence is tagged and lemmatised (ii) main translation, where the actual translation output is generated and (iii) post-processing, where the corresponding tokens are generated from lemmas.",
        "The main translation process is split in two phases, namely (a) the establishment of the translation structure in terms of phrase order and (b) the definition of word order and resolution of lexical ambiguities at an intra-phrase level.",
        "In terms of resources, PRESEMT utilises a bilingual lemma dictionary providing SL ?",
        "TL lexical correspondences.",
        "It also employs an extensive TL monolingual corpus, compiled automatically via web crawling (Pomikalek et al., 2008) to generate a comprehensive phrase-based language model.",
        "The provision of the monolingual corpus allows PRESEMT to use only a very small bilingual corpus for mapping the transfer from SL to TL sentence structures.",
        "This bilingual corpus only numbers a few hundred sentences, reducing reliance on costly linguistic resources.",
        "The corpus is assembled from available parallel corpora, only replacing free translations with more literal ones, to allow the accurate extraction of structural modifications.",
        "The parallel corpus coverage is not studied prior to integration in PRESEMT, which would have allowed an optimisation of translation performance."

        "Initially, both the bilingual and the monolingual corpora are annotated 1 so as to incorporate lemma and Part-of-Speech (PoS) information and other salient language-specific morphological features (e.g. case, number, tense etc.).",
        "Furthermore, for the TL side, a shallow parser or chunker (hereafter referred to as parser) is used to split the sentences into syntactic phrases.",
        "As the proposed methodology has been developed to maximise the use of publicly-available software, the user is free to select any desired parser for the TL language.",
        "To avoid either an additional SL side parser or potential incompatibilities between the two parsers, the Phrase Aligner module (PAM, Tambouratzis et al., 2011) is implemented.",
        "PAM transfers the TL side parsing scheme, which encompasses lemma, tag and parsing information, to the SL side, based on lexical information coupled with statistical data on PoS tag correspondences extracted from the lexicon.",
        "The parsing scheme includes phrase boundaries and phrase labels.",
        "PAM follows a 3-step process, involving (a) lexicon-based alignment, (b) alignment based on similarity of grammatical features and PoS tag correspondence and (c) alignment on the evidence of already aligned neighbouring words.",
        "The SL side of the aligned corpus is subsequently processed by the Phrasing model generator (PMG), to create an SL phrasing model which will then parse sentences input for translation.",
        "The original PMG implementation (Tambouratzis et al., 2011) has utilised Conditional Random Fields (CRF), due to the considerable representation capabilities of this model (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "CRF is a statistical modelling method that takes context into account to predict labels for sequences of input samples.",
        "The implementation of an alternative PMG methodology (termed PMG-simple) based on template-matching principles has also been pursued.",
        "PMG-simple locates phrases that match",
        "For the annotation task readily available tools are employed.",
        "For the experiments reported here, TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) has been used for the TL text processing and the FBT PoS tagger (Prokopidis et al., 2011) has been employed for the processing of the SL text..",
        "exactly what it has seen before, based on a simple template-matching algorithm (Duda et al., 2001).",
        "The templates used are the phrases to which the SL side sentences of the bilingual corpus have been segmented.",
        "In contrast to CRF, PMG-simple implements a greedy search (Black, 2005) without backtracking.",
        "Initially all phrases are positioned in an ordered list according to their likelihood of being accurately detected.",
        "Starting from the phrase with the highest likelihood, PMG-simple examines if each phrase occurs in the input sentence.",
        "If it does and the constituent words are not part of an already established phrase, the constituent words are marked as parts of this phrase and are no longer considered in the phrase-matching process.",
        "If the phrase pattern does not occur, the next in-line phrase is considered, until the table is exhausted.",

        "The TL phrases are then organised in a hash map that allows the storage of multiple values for each key, using as a key the three aforementioned criteria.",
        "For each phrase the number of occurrences within the corpus is retained.",
        "Each hash map is stored in a separate file to minimise access time during translation.",
        "4 Translation phase 1: Structure selection The Structure selection phase determines the type and relative position of TL phrases to which the SL ones are translated.",
        "To achieve this, PRESEMT consults the SL-to-TL structural modifications as contained in the PAM-processed parallel corpus.",
        "In that respect, it resembles EBMT (Hutchins, 2005).",
        "Translation phase 1 receives as input an SL sentence, annotated with tag & lemma information and segmented into phrases by the PMG.",
