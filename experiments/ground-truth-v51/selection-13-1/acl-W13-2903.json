        "Recently, several TS-related workshops took place: PITR 2012 (Williams et al., 2012), SLPAT 2012 (Alexandersson et al., 2012), and NLP4ITA 20123 and 2013.",

        "The variety of problems tackled by the TS approaches differ, according to their final aim: (1) being a preprocessing step of an input to text processing applications, or (2) addressing the reading difficulties of specific groups of readers.",
        "The first type of final application ranges between parser input (Chandrasekar et al., 1996), small screens displays (Daelemans et al., 2004; Grefenstette, 1998), text summarization (Vanderwende et al., 2007), text extraction (Klebanov et al., 2004), semantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008) and Machine Translation (MT) (Ruffino, 1982; Streiff, 1985).The TS approaches addressing specific human reading needs, instead, address read",

        "As the aim of this article is to propose a text simplification evaluation metrics which would take into account text comprehensibility and reading comprehension, in this discussion we will focus mostly on the approaches, whose aim is to simplify texts for target readers and their evaluation strategies.",
        "The existing TS evaluation approaches focus either on the quality of the generated text/sentences, or on the effectiveness of text simplification on reading comprehension.",
        "The first group of approaches include human judges ratings of simplification, content preservation, and grammaticality, standard MT evaluation scores (BLEU and NIST), a variety of other automatic metrics (perplexity, precision/recall/F-measure, and edit distance).",

        "As can be seen from the discussion below, different TS systems employ a combination of the listed evaluation approaches.",
        "As one of the first text simplification systems for target reader populations, PSET, seems to have applied different evaluation strategies for different of its components, without running an evaluation of the system as a whole.",
        "The lexical simplification component (Devlin, 1999), which replaced technical terms with more frequent synonyms, was evaluated via user feedback, comprehension questions and the use of the Lorge readability formula (Lorge, 1948).",
        "The syntactic simplification system evaluated its single components and the system as a whole from different points of view, to a different extent, and used different evaluation strategies.",

        "Drndarevic et al. (2013) used 7 readability measures for Spanish to evaluate the degree of simplification, and twenty-five human annotators to evaluate on a Likert scale the grammaticality of the output and the preservation of the original meaning.",
        "The recent approaches considering TS as an MT task, such as Specia (2010), Zhu et al. (2010), Coster and Kauchak (2011) and Woodsend and Lapata (2011), apply standard MT evaluation techniques, such as BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), and TERp (Snover et al., 2009).",
        "In addition, Woodsend and Lapata (2011) apply two readability measures (Flesch-Kincaid, Coleman-Liau) to evaluate the actual reduction in complexity and human judges ratings for simplification, meaning preservation, and grammaticality.",

        "As we consider that the aim of text simplification for human readers is to improve text comprehensibility, we argue that reading comprehension must be evaluated, and that evaluating just the quality of produced sentences is not enough.",
        "Differently from the approaches that employ human judges, we consider that it is better to test real human comprehension with target readers populations, rather than to make conclusions about the extent of population's understanding on the basis of the opinion of a small number of human judges.",
        "In addition, we consider that measuring reading speed, rate, as well as reading and speed errors, requires much more complicated and expensive tools, than having an online system to measure time to reply and recognize correct answers.",
        "Finally, we consider that cloze tests are an evaluation method that cannot really reflect the complexity of reading comprehension (for example for measuring manipulations of the syntactic structure of sentences), and for this reason, we select multiple-choice questions as the testing method, which we consider the most reflecting the specificities of the complexity of a text, more accessible than eye-tracking technologies, and more objective than users?",
        "feedback.",
        "The approach does not explicitly evaluate the fluency, grammaticality and content preservation of the simplified text, but can be coupled with such additional evaluation.",
        "The closest to ours approach is that of Rello et al. (2013) who evaluated reading comprehension with over ninety readers with and without dyslexia.",
        "Besides using eye-tracking (reading time and fixations duration), different reading devices, and users rating the text according to how easy it is it read, to understand and to remember, they obtain also a comprehension score based on multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with 3 answers (1 correct, 1 partially correct and 1 wrong).",
        "The difference with our approach is that we consider that having only one correct answer (as suggested by Gronlund (1982)), is a more objective evaluation, rather than having one partially correct answer, which would introduce subjectivity in evaluation.",
        "To support our motivation, some state-of-the-art approaches state the scarcity of evaluation with target readers (Williams and Reiter, 2008), note that there are no commonly accepted evaluation measures (Coster and Kauchak, 2011), attempt to address the need of developing reading comprehension evaluation methods (Siddharthan and Katsos, 2012), and propose common evaluation frameworks (Specia et al., 2012; De Belder and Moens, 2012).",

        "The results of C-Score Complete have been multiplied per 100 for better readability.",
        "As a reminder, we consider that higher the score is, better is text comprehension.",
        "From this point of view, if the text simplification approach was successful, Text 2 (Simplified) should have a higher C-Score than its original, complex Text 1, Text 4 (Simplified) should have a higher C-Score than its original Text 3, Text 6 (Simplified) ?",
        "a higher score than the complex Text 5, and Text 8 (Simplified) ?",
        "a higher score than its original Text 7.",

        "The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 5.",

        "The results show that the comprehension score of participants under 45 years old is higher for all texts (despite the uneven participants?",
        "distribution), except in the case of complex Text 5.",
        "A similar phenomenon can be observed in Tables 2, 3 and 4, where in all text pairs, except for pair 3, i.e. Texts 5 and 6 (where can be observed the opposite), the simplified text has a higher comprehension score than its complex original.",
        "The hypothesis about the different behavior of Text 5 and 6 is that it is text-specific.",
        "This is confirmed by Table 5, which shows that besides the big dif",
        "ferences in reading comprehension between participants under 45 years old and participants over 45 years old, Text 5 has more or less the same comprehension score for both groups of readers.",
        "From this fact we can assume that this text is probably fairly easy, so this type of combination of text simplification rules does not simplify it, and instead, when applied makes it less comprehensible or more awkward for the human readers."

        "In order to address the lack of common or standard evaluation approaches, this article proposed three evaluation formulae, which measure the reading comprehension of produced texts.",
        "The formulae have been developed on the basis of an extensive reading comprehension experiment, aiming to evaluate the impact of a text simplification approach (a controlled language) on emergency instructions.",
        "Two evaluation scenarios have been presented, the first of which calculated with all three formulae, while the second used only the simplest one.",
        "In this way, the article aims to address both the lack of common TS evaluation metrics as suggested in Section 2 (Coster and Kauchak, 2011) and the scarcity of reading comprehension (Siddharthan and Katsos, 2012) evaluation with real users (Williams and Reiter, 2008), by proposing a tailored approach for this type of text simplification evaluation.",
        "With this article we aim at inciting the Text Simplification Community to open a discussion forum about common methods for evaluating text simplification, in order to provide objective evaluation metrics allowing the comparison of different approaches, and to ensure that simplification really achieves its aims.",
        "We also argue that taking in consideration the end-users and text units used for evaluation is important.",
        "In our approach, we address only the evaluation of text simplification approaches aiming to improve reading comprehension and experiments in which time to reply to questions and percentage of correct answers can be measured.",
        "A plausible scenario for applying our evaluation approach would be to use the Amazon Mechanical Turk for crowd-sourcing and then to evaluate the performance of a text simplification system on complex and simplified texts, to compare the performance of two or more approaches, or of two versions of the same system on the same pairs of texts.",
        "These formulae can be also employed in psycholinguistically-oriented experiments, which aim to reach cognitive findings regarding specific target reader groups, such as dyslexics or autis",
        "tic readers.",
        "Future work will involve the comparison of the above proposed evaluation metrics with any of the metrics already employed in the related work, such as the recent and classic readability formulae, eye-tracking, reading rate, human judges ratings, and others.",
        "We consider that content preservation and grammaticality are not necessary to be evaluated for this approach, as the simplified texts have been produced manually, by linguists, who were native speakers of English."
