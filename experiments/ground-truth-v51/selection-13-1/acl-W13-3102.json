        "There are two main tasks (and a single-document multilingual summarization pilot described in a separate paper) in MultiLing 2013: Summarization Task This MultiLing task aims to evaluate the application of (partially or fully) language-independent summarization algorithms on a variety of languages.",
        "Each system participating in the task was called to provide summaries for a range of different languages, based on corresponding corpora.",
        "In the MultiLing Pilot of 2011 the languages used were 7, while this year systems were called to summarize texts in 10 different languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Romanian, Spanish.",
        "Participating systems were required to apply their methods to a minimum of two languages.",
        "The task was aiming at the real problem of summarizing news topics, parts of which may be described or may happen in different moments in time.",
        "We consider, similarly to MultiLing 2011(Giannakopoulos et al., 2011) that news topics can be seen as event sequences: Definition 1 An event sequence is a set of atomic (self-sufficient) event descriptions, sequenced in time, that share main actors, location of occurence or some other important factor.",
        "Event sequences may refer to topics such as a natural disaster, a crime investigation, a set of negotiations focused on a single political issue, a sports event.",
        "The summarization task requires to generate a single, fluent, representative summary from a set of documents describing an event sequence.",
        "The language of the document set will be within the given range of 10 languages and all documents in a set share the same language.",
        "The output summary should be of the same language as its source documents.",
        "The output summary should be between 240 and 250 words.",
        "Evaluation Task This task aims to examine how well automated systems can evaluate summaries from different languages.",
        "This task takes as input the summaries generated from automatic systems and humans in the Summarization Task.",
        "The output should be a grading of the summaries.",
        "Ideally, we would want the automatic evaluation to maximally correlate to human judgement.",
        "The first task was aiming at the real problem of summarizing news topics, parts of which may be described or happen in different moments in time.",
        "The implications of including multiple aspects of the same event, as well as time relations at a varying level (from consequtive days to years), are still difficult to tackle in a summarization context.",
        "Furthermore, the requirement for multilingual applicability of the methods, further accentuates the difficulty of the task.",
        "The second task, summarization evaluation has come to be a prominent research problem, based on the difficulty of the summary evaluation process.",
        "While commonly used methods build upon a few human summaries to be able to judge automatic summaries (e.g., (Lin, 2004; Hovy et al., 2005)), there also exist works on fully automatic evaluation of summaries, without human?model?",
