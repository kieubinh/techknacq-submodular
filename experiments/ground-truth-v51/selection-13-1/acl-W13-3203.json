        "With the advent of statistical methods for NLP, Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) have emerged as powerful method for representing word semantics.",
        "In particular, the distributional vector formalism, which represents meaning by a distribution over neighboring words, has gained the most popularity.",
        "DSMs are widely used in information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), question answering (Tellex et al., 2003), semantic similarity computation (Wong and Raghavan, 1984; McCarthy and Carroll, 2003), automated dictionary building (Curran, 2003), automated essay grading (Lan-dauer and Dutnais, 1997), word-sense discrimination and disambiguation (McCarthy et al., 2004; ?",
        "*Equally contributing authors Sch√ºtze, 1998), selectional preference model-ing (Erk, 2007) and identification of translation equivalents (Hjelm, 2007).",
        "Systems that use DSMs implicitly make a bag of words assumption: that the meaning of a phrase can be reasonably estimated from the meaning of its constituents.",
        "However, semantics in natural language is a compositional phenomenon, encompassing interactions between syntactic structures, and the meaning of lexical constituents.",
        "It follows that the DSM formalism lends itself poorly to composition since it implicitly disregards syntactic structure.",
        "For instance, the distributions for ?Lincoln?, ?Booth?, and ?killed?",
        "when merged produce the same result regardless of whether the input is ?Booth killed Lincoln?",
        "or ?Lincoln killed Booth?.",
        "As suggested by Pantel and Lin (2000) and others, modeling the distribution over preferential attachments for each syntactic relation separately can yield greater expressive power.",
        "Attempts have been made to model linguistic composition of individual word vectors (Mitchell and Lapata, 2009), as well as remedy the inherent failings of the standard distributional approach (Erk and Pad?, 2008).",
        "The results show varying degrees of efficacy, but have largely failed to model deeper lexical semantics or compositional expectations of words and word combinations.",
        "In this paper we propose an extension to the traditional DSM model that explicitly preserves structural information and permits the approximation of distributional expectation over dependency relations.",
        "We extend the generic DSM model by representing a word as distributions over relation-specific syntactic neighborhoods.",
        "One can think of the Structured DSM (SDSM) representation of a word/phrase as several vectors defined over the same vocabulary, each vector representing the",
        "word's selectional preferences for a different syntactic argument.",
        "We argue that this representation captures individual word semantics effectively, and is better able to express the semantics of composed units.",
        "The overarching theme of our framework of evaluation is to explore the semantic space of the SDSM.",
        "We do this by measuring its ability to discriminate between varying surface forms of the same underlying concept.",
        "We perform the following set of experiments to evaluate its expressive power, and conclude the following: 1.",
