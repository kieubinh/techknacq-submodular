        "For many tasks such as information retrieval (IR) or clustering, a text document is represented by a vector, where each dimension corresponds to a given word and where each value encodes the word importance in the document (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "This Vector Space Model (VSM) or bag-of-words (BoW) representation is at the root of topic models such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester, 1988), Probablistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "All these topic models consist in ?projecting?",
        "documents on a set of topics generally learned in an unsupervised manner.",
        "During the learning stage, as a by-product of the projection of the training documents, one also obtains an embedding of the words in a typically small-dimensional continuous space.",
        "The distance between two words in this space translates the measure of similarity between words which is captured by the topic models.",
        "For LSI, PLSA or LDA, the implicit measure is the number of co-occurrences in the training corpus.",
        "In this paper, we raise the following question: if we were provided with an embedding of words in a continuous space, how could we best use it in IR/clustering tasks?",
        "Especially, could we develop probabilistic models which would be able to benefit from this a priori information on the similarity between words?",
        "When the words are embedded in a continuous space, one can view a document as a Bag-of-Embedded-Words (BoEW).",
        "We therefore draw inspiration from the computer vision community where it is common practice to represent an image as a bag-of-features (BoF) where each real-valued feature describes local properties of the image (such as its color, texture or shape).",
        "We model the generative process of embedded words using a mixture model where each mixture component can be loosely thought of as a ?topic?.",
        "To transform the variable-cardinality BoEW into a fixed-length representation which is more amenable to comparison, we make use of the Fisher kernel framework of Jaakkola and Haussler (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999).",
        "We will show that this induces a non-linear mapping of the embedded words in a higher-dimensional space where their contributions are aggregated.",
        "We underline that our contribution is not the application of the FK to text analysis (see (Hof-mann, 2000) for such an attempt).",
        "Knowing that words can be embedded in a continuous space, our main contribution is to show that we can consequently represent a document as a bag-of-embedded-words.",
        "The FK is just one possible way to subsequently transform this bag representation into a fixed-length vector which is more amenable to large-scale processing.",

        "We provide a short review of the literature on those topics which are most related to our work: topic models, word embeddings and bag-of-patches representations in computer vision.",
        "Topic models.",
        "Statistical topic models build on the idea of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in a probabilistic way.",
        "The PLSA model proposed by Hoffman (Hofmann, 1999) can be thought of as a constrained matrix factorization problem equivalent to NMF (Lee and Seung, 1999; Gaussier and Goutte, 2005).",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) , the generative counterpart of PLSA, has played a major role in the development of probabilistic models for textual data.",
        "As a result, it has been extended or refined in a countless studies (Griffiths et al., 2004; Eisenstein et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010).",
        "Statistical topic models are often evaluated with the perplexity measure on a held-out dataset but it has been shown that perplexity only correlates weakly with human preference (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "Moreover, several studies reported that LDA does not generally outperform LSI in IR or sentiment analysis tasks (Wang et al., 2011; Maas et al., 2011).",
        "Nevertheless, LSI has known a resurging interest.",
        "Supervised Semantic Indexing (SSI) (Bai et al., 2009) learns low-rank projection matrices on query-document pairs so as to minimize a ranking loss.",
        "Similarly, (Wang et al., 2011) studies the influence of `1 and `2 regularization on the projection matrices and shows how to distribute the algorithm using Map-Reduce.",
        "Word embeddings.",
        "Parrallel to the large development of statistical topic models, there has been an increasing amount of literature on word embeddings where it has been proposed to include higher-level dependencies between words, either syntactic or semantic.",
        "We note that topic models such as LSI, PLSA or LDA implicitly perform such an embedding (jointly with the embedding of documents) and that the measure of similarity is the co-occurrence of words in the training corpus.",
        "A seminal work in this field is the one by Col-lobert and Weston (Collobert and Weston, 2008) where a neural network is trained by stochastic gradient descent in order to minimize a loss function on the observed n-grams.",
        "This work has later then been refined in (Bengio et al., 2009).",
        "Probabilistic methods have also been proposed to learn language models such as the HLBL embedding (Mnih and Hinton, 2007).",
        "Similarly, (Maas et al., 2011) parametrizes a probabilistic model in order to capture word representations, instead of modeling individually latent topics, which lead to significant improvements over LDA in sentiment analysis.",
        "Furthermore, (Dhillon et al., 2011) uses the Canonical Correlation Analysis technique between the left and right context vectors of a word to learn word embeddings.",
        "Lastly, (Turian et al., 2010) proposes an empirical comparison of several word embedding techniques in a named entity recognition task and provides an excellent state-of-the-art of word representation.",
        "Except (Maas et al., 2011) , there has been very little work to your knowledge bridging the statistical topic models with the word embedding techniques.",
        "Computer vision.",
        "In modern computer vision, an image is usually described by a set of local descriptors extracted from small image patches such as SIFT.",
        "This local representation provides some invariance to changes in viewpoint, lighting or occlusion.",
        "The local descriptors characterize the low-level properties of the image such as its color, texture or shape.",
        "Since it is computationally intensive to handle (e.g. to match) sets of descriptors of variable cardinality, it has been proposed to aggregate the local descriptors into a global vector which is more amenable to retrieval and classification.",
        "The most popular aggregation mechanism was directly inspired by the work in text analysis.",
        "It makes use of an intermediate representation ?",
        "the visual vocabulary ?",
        "which is a set of prototypical descriptors ?",
        "the visual words ?",
        "obtained through a clustering algorithm such as k-means (Leung and Malik, 1999; Sivic and Zisserman, 2003; Csurka et al., 2004).",
        "Given an image, each of its descriptors is assigned to its closest visual word and the image is described by the histogram of visual words frequencies.",
        "This representation is referred to as the Bag-of-Visual-words (BoV).",
        "Some works pushed the analogy with text analysis even further.",
        "For instance, in large-scale re",
        "trieval, Sivic and Zisserman proposed to use a tf-idf weighting of the BoV vector and an inverted file for efficient matching (Sivic and Zisserman, 2003).",
        "As another example, pLSA, LDA and their many variations have been extensively applied to problems such as image classification (Quelhas et al., 2005) or object discovery (Russell et al., 2006).",
        "However, it has been noted that the quantization process mentioned above incurs a loss of information since a continuous descriptor is transformed into a discrete value (the index of the closest visual word).",
        "To overcome this limitation, several improvements have been proposed which depart from the pure discrete model.",
        "These improvements include the soft assignment of descriptors to visual words (Farquhar et al., 2005; Philbin et al., 2008; Gemert et al., 2008) or the use of more advanced coding techniques than vector quantization such as sparse coding (Yang et al., 2009) or locality-constrained linear coding (Wang et al., 2010).",
        "All the previous techniques can be understood (with some simplifications) as simple counting mechanisms (computation of 0-order statistics).",
        "It has been proposed to take into account higher-order statistics (first and second order for instance) which encode more descriptor-level information and therefore incur a lower loss of information.",
        "This includes the Fisher vector (Perronnin and Dance, 2007; Perronnin et al., 2010), which was directly inspired by the Fisher kernel of Jaakkola and Haussler (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999).",
        "In a nutshell, the Fisher vector consists in modeling the distribution of patches in any image with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and then in describing an image by its deviation from this average probability distribution.",
        "In a recent evaluation (Chat-field et al., 2011), it has been shown experimentally that the Fisher vector was the state-of-the-art representation for image classification.",
        "However, in this work we question the treatment of words as discrete entities.",
        "Indeed, intuitvely some words are closer to each other from a semantic standpoint and words can be embedded in a continuous space as is done for instance in LSA."

        "If the FV based on LSI word embeddings significantly outperforms LSI, it is outperformed by strong IR baselines such as Divergence From Randomness (DFR) models (Amati and Rijsbergen, 2002) or Language Models (Ponte and Croft, 1998).",

        "and TFIDF model on the three IR Collections compared to Fisher Vector and LSI These results are not surprising as it has been shown experimentally in many studies that latent-based approaches such as LSI are generally outperformed by state-of-the-art IR models in AdHoc tasks.",
        "There are a significant gap in performances between LSI and TFIDF and between TFIDF and the PL2 model.",
        "The first gap is due to the change in representation, from a vector space model to latent based representation, while the second one is only due to a ?better?",
        "similarity as both methods operate in a similar space.",
        "In a way, the FV approach offers a better similarity for latent representations even if several improvements could be further proposed (pivoted document length normalization, combination with exact representation).",
        "Unseen Words.",
        "One of the main benefits of our method is its ability to cope with unseen words: our framework allows to assign probabilities for words unseen while training the topic model assuming that they can be embedded in the Euclidean space.",
        "Thus, one can train the probabilistic model on a subpart of the collection without having to discard unseen words at test time.",
        "Therefore, we can easily address large-scale collections as we can restrict the GMM learning step on a subset of a collection of documents.",

        "of Gaussians against averaging word embeddings on TDT with the Yule measure time.",
        "We show in figure 5 that our model is robust to the number of word occurences used for training the GMM.",
        "We illustrate this point using the TREC 1-&2 collection with an embedding of size e = 100.",
        "We varied the number of documents to train the GMM.",
        "Figure 5 shows that increasing the number of documents does not lead to improvements and the performance remains stable.",
        "Therefore, these empirical results indeed confirm that we can adress large-scale collections as we can restrict the learning step on a small subset of a collection of documents.",
        "While we focused in the experimental section on word embeddings obtained with LSI, we now show that the proposed framework can be applied to other word embeddings.",
        "To do so, we use a word embedding based on the Yule association measure (Jagarlamudi et al., 2011) which is closely related to the Mutual Information but relies on the raw frequencies rather than on probabilities.",
        "We use this measure to compute a similarity matrix between words.",
        "Then, we applied a spherical kmeans on this matrix to find e = 50 word clusters and used the cluster centroids as the word embedding matrix.",
        "A simple baseline is to use as document representation the average word embedding as is the case of LSI.",
        "The baseline gets 82% NMI wherease the FV with 32 Gaussians reaches 88%.",
        "The non-linear mapping induced by the FV always outperforms the simple averaging.",
        "Therefore, it is worthwhile to learn non-linear mappings."

        "M refers to a million word occurences probabilistic mixture models once words were embedded in a Euclidean space.",
        "This is a significant departure from the vast majority of the works in the machine learning and information retrieval communities which deal with words as discrete entities.",
        "We assessed our framework on several clustering and ad-hoc IR collections and the experiments showed that our model is able to yield effective descriptors of textual documents.",
        "In particular, the FV based on LSI embedding was shown to significantly outperform LSI for retrieval tasks.",
        "There are many possible applications and generalizations of our framework.",
        "In this study, we focused on the LSI embedding and showed preliminary results with the Yule embedding.",
        "Since we believe that the word embedding technique is of crucial importance, we would like to experiment with recent embedding techniques such as the Col-lobert and Weston embedding (Collobert and Weston, 2008) which has been shown to scale well in several NLP tasks.",
        "Moreover, another significant advantage of the proposed framework is that we could deal seamlessly with collections of multilingual documents.",
        "This requires the ability to embedd the words of different languages and techniques exist to perform such an embedding including Canonical Correlation Analysis.",
        "Finally, the GMM still has several theoretical limitations to model textual documents appropriately so that one could design a better statistical model for bags-of-embedded-words."
