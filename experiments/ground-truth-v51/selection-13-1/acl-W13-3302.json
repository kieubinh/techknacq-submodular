        "Any source language document will",
        "therefore contain repeated instances of the same words or lemmas (morphological variants of the same words).",
        "This repeated use of words and lemmas is known as lexical consistency and the instances can be grouped together to form lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).",
        "Lexical chains were proposed by Lotfipour-Saedi (1997) as one feature of a text via which translational equivalence between source and target could be measured.",
        "While Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has gone from ignoring these properties of discourse by translating sentences independently, to trying to impose lexical consistency at a universal level, both approaches have given little consideration to what might be standard practice among human translators.",
        "In order to discover what the standard practice might be, and thus what an SMT system might better aim to achieve, I have carried out a detailed analysis of lexical consistency in human translation.",
        "For comparison, I also present an analysis of translations produced by an SMT system.",
        "I have considered a variety of genres, as genre correlates with the function of a text, which in turn predicts its important elements.",
        "A preliminary conclusion of this analysis is that human translators use lexical consistency to support what is important in a text."

        "The analysis of human translation presented in this paper is a first attempt to understand where and when it might be appropriate to encourage consistency in an SMT system.",
        "I consider genre as the where and parts-of-speech as the when, but other interpretations are also possible.",
        "On the whole, it seems reasonable to encourage the con",
        "sistent translation of nouns, across all genres.",
        "In addition, encouraging consistency in the translation of rare verbs and adjectives for technical documents and of adjectives for public information documents may also prove beneficial.",
        "With respect to verbs, variation in verb consistency has been shown to correlate with frequency (as a proxy to identify light and rare verbs).",
        "Given the low consistency with which humans translate light verbs, encouraging their consistency in automated translation would be undesirable.",
        "Automated translation may look very consistent on the surface, but it is necessary to look beyond this to see the errors.",
        "While humans may make inconsistent translations, we trust that these inconsistencies will not confuse or mislead the reader.",
        "SMT systems on the other hand generate their translations based on statistics that say what the ?best choice?",
        "might be, both at the word/phrase level (through the phrase table) and overall (through the language model).",
        "Furthermore, they do nothing to guarantee consistency - this occurs by chance, whether desirable or not.",
        "As a result, inconsistencies may arise that make the translations difficult to read.",
        "These inconsistencies are not predictable and could occur in any SMT system."

      "heading": "6 Future Work",
      "text": [
        "The findings presented in this paper are suggestive but only a small number of texts have been included for each genre.",
        "The analysis could be extended to include a larger set of documents and different language pairs (the only requirement is for a POS tagger for the source language).",
        "Multiple translations of the same document could also be considered to identify whether similar patterns can be observed for different translators.",
        "There are a number of possible ways in which to use this information to inform the design of a SMT system.",
        "I have shown that SMT systems are capable of highly consistent translations but this consistency cannot be guaranteed and there is the possibility that the translations will be consistent and incorrect.",
        "Also, Carpuat and Simard (2012) have shown that inconsistent translations in SMT often indicate translation errors.",
        "A system which encourages translations which are both consistent and correct (or at least acceptable) for words that belong to a predefined set (e.g. by POS tag) is desirable.",
        "This ?encouragement?",
        "could be achieved using rewards delivered via feature functions or within n-best list re-ranking ?",
        "hypotheses which make reuse of the same translation(s) for repetitions of the same source word would be ranked higher than those that introduced inconsistencies.",
        "Revisiting the cache-based models of (2010a; 2010b) and Gong et al. (2011) could provide a possible starting point.",
        "The initial focus could be on nouns, which are translated by human translators with high consistency for all genres.",
        "Many nouns are used either to specify entities that are only mentioned once in a text (essentially setting the scene for more prominent entities), or as ?predicate nominals?",
        "on those more prominent entities (e.g. in ?...is a horrific story?).",
        "However, other nouns occur within the Noun Phrases (NPs) that make up part of a corefer-ence chain, of subsequent reference to prominent entities.",
        "As an extension to this work I will aim to investigate the consistency of translation of those nouns that belong to coreference chains and ultimately, to build a system that makes use of the resulting information.",
        "Work has already started to construct a parallel corpus in which coreference chains are annotated so that the translation of coreference (both NPs and pronouns) may be studied in more depth.",
        "Another question worth considering is whether it would be desirable to replicate aspects of low consistency in human translation by encouraging inconsistent (but still acceptable) translations of certain words or word categories.",
        "My instinct is that this could lead to translations that better approximate those produced by humans."
