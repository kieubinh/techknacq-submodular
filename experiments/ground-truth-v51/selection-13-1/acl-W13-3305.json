        "The correct rendering of verbal tenses is an important aspect of translation.",
        "Translating to a wrong verbal tense in the target language does not convey the same meaning as the source text, for instance by distorting the temporal order of the events described in a text.",
        "Current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems may have difficulties in choosing the correct verb tense translations, in some language pairs, because these depend on a wider-range context than SMT systems consider.",
        "Indeed, decoding for SMT is still at the phrase or sentence level only, thus missing information from previously translated sentences (which is also detrimental to lexical cohesion and co-reference).",
        "In this paper, we explore the merits of a discourse feature called narrativity in helping SMT systems to improve their translation choices for English verbs in the Simple Past tense (henceforth, SP) into one of the three possible French past tenses.",
        "The narrativity feature characterizes each occurrence of an SP verb, either as narrative (for ordered events that happened in the past) or non-narrative (for past states of affairs).",
        "Narrativity is potentially relevant to EN/FR translation because three French past tenses can potentially translate an English Simple Past (SP), namely the Passe?",
        "Compose?",
        "(PC), Passe?",
        "Simple (PS) or Impar-fait (IMP).",
        "All of them can be correct translations of an EN SP verb, depending on its narrative or non-narrative role.",
        "The narrativity feature can be of use to SMT only if it can be assigned with sufficient precision over a source text by entirely automatic methods.",
        "Moreover, a narrativity-aware SMT model is likely to make a difference with respect to baseline SMT only if it is based on additional features that are not captured by, e.g., a phrase-based SMT model.",
        "In this study, we use a small amount of manually labeled instances to train a narrativity classifier for English texts.",
        "The (imperfect) output of this classifier over the English side of a large parallel corpus will then be used to train a narrativity-aware SMT system.",
        "In testing mode, the narrativity classifier provides input to the SMT system, resulting (as we will show below) in improved tense and lexical choices for verbs, and a modest but statistically significant increase in BLEU and TER scores.",
        "Overall, the method is similar in substance to our previous work on the",
        "combination of a classifier for discourse connectives with an SMT system (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012; Meyer et al., 2012).",

        "Such events are thus single points in time without internal structure.",

        "The IMP is imperfective (as its name suggests), i.e. it indicates that the event is in its preparatory phrase and is thus incomplete.",
        "In terms of aspect, the IMP is unaccomplished and provides background information, for instance ongoing state of affairs, or situations that are repeated in time, with an internal structure.",
        "Conversely, in English, the SP is described as having as its main meaning the reference to past tense, and as specific meanings the reference to present or future tenses identified under certain contextual conditions (Quirk et al., 1986).",
        "Cor-blin and de Swart (2004) argue that the SP is as-pectually ?transparent?, meaning that it applies to",

        ", which in FR is pluperfect tense instead of the correct Passe?",

        "est ne?",
        "as in the reference translation.",
        "A method to concatenate such verb phrases to avoid such errors is under work.",
        "A further reason for the small improvements in translation quality might be that factored translation models still operate on rather local context, even when the narrativity information is present.",
        "To widen the context captured by the translation model, labeling entire verbal phrase nodes in hierarchical or tree-based syntactical models will be considered in the future.",
        "Moreover, it has been shown that it is difficult to choose the optimal parameters for a factored translation model (Tam-chyna and Bojar, 2013).",
        "In an alternative approach currently under work, a more direct way to label verb tense is implemented, where a classifier can make use of the same features as those extracted here (in Section 3.2), but its classes are those that directly indicate which target verb tense should be output by the SMT.",
        "Thus, not only SP verbs can be considered and no intermediate category such as narrativity (that is more difficult to learn) is needed.",
        "The classifier will predict which FR tense should be used depending on the context of the EN verbs, for which the FR tense label can be annotated as above, within a factored translation model.",
        "Through word alignment and POS tagging, this method has the additional advantage of providing much more training data, extracted from word alignment of the verb phrases, and can be applied to all tenses, not only SP.",
        "Moreover, the approach is likely to learn which verbs are preferably translated with which tense: for instance, the verb started is much more likely to become a commence?",
        "(PC) in FR than to commenc?ait (IMP), due to its meaning of a punctual event in time, rather than a continuous or repetitive one."
