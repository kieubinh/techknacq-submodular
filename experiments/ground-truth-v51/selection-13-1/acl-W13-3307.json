        "As regards English, the personal pronoun it is the most complicated case.",
        "Not only can it corefer with almost any noun phrase (making it hard to pick the correct gender and number if the target language is morphologically rich), but it can also corefer with a larger discourse segment or play the role of a filler in certain grammatical constructions.",
        "In this work, we turn our attention to the translation of the English personal pronoun it into Czech.",
        "Even if we ignore morphology and merge all related surface forms into one, we cannot find a single Czech expression that would comprise all functions of the English it.",
        "Moreover, there is no simple one-to-one mapping from categories of it to Czech expressions.",
        "For instance, one would expect that the translation of it which is coreferential with a noun phrase has to agree in number and gender with the translation of its antecedent.",
        "However, there are cases when it is more suitable to translate it as the demonstrative pronoun to, whose gender is always neuter.",

        "Selecting the correct grammatical categories and thus producing a concrete surface form of a deep syntactic representation is provided by the translation synthesis stage, which we do not focus on in this work.",

        "Since this test set is provided with no annotation of coreferential links, the model of it that is involved in experiments on the end-to-end translation was trained on a complete feature set exclud10http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/test.tgz ing the coreferential features using the Machine Learning method that performed best in the intrinsic test, i.e. AI::MaxEntropy (see Section 6).",
        "The new method was compared to the rule-based approach originally used in TectoMT, which works as follows.",
        "In the transfer stage, all occurrences of it are translated to a demonstrative ten.",
        "In the synthesis stage, another rule is fired, which determines whether ten is omitted on the surface.",
        "Then, omitting it corresponds either to a structural change (Null class) or an unexpressed personal pronoun (a subset of PersPron class).",
        "It makes this original approach difficult to compare with the scores in Table 2, as the translation model of it is applied in the transfer stage, where we do not know yet if a personal pronoun is to be expressed or not.",
        "Thus, we consider it the most appropriate to use final translated sentences produced by two versions of TectoMT in order to compare the different way they handle it.",

        "We managed to accomplish it just on 1/6 of the data, which did not provide sufficient evidence for some specific features.",
        "Our main objective of the future work is thus to reduce a need for manual annotation by discovering ways of automatic extraction of reliable classes from a semi-manually annotated corpus such as PCEDT."
