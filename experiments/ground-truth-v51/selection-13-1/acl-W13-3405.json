        "The Australian Computational and Linguistics Olympiad (OzCLO) started in 2008 in only two locations and has since grown to a nationwide competition with almost 1500 high school students participating in 2013.",
        "An Australian team has participated in the International Linguistics Olympiad (ILO) every year since 2009.",
        "This paper describes how the competition is run (with a regional First Round and a final National Round) and the organisation of the competition (a National Steering Committee and Local Organising Committees for each region) and discusses the particular challenges faced by Australia (timing of the competition and distance between the major population centres).",
        "One major factor in the growth and success of OzCLO has been the introduction of the online competition, allowing participation of students from rural and remote country areas.",
        "The organisation relies on the goodwill and volunteer work of university and school staff but the strong interest among students and teachers shows that OzCLO is responding to a demand for linguistic challenges."

        "The Australian Computational and Linguistic Olympiad (OzCLO, www.ozclo.org.au) began as an idea in late 2007, largely prompted by a parent in Ballarat, a small town in Victoria, who came across the North American competition (NACLO, Radev et al. 2008) on the internet and thought it was something that her daughter would be interested in doing.",
        "Her emails to the organisers of NACLO, asking about the likelihood of such an event being run in Australia, led to initiating contact with the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) with the suggestion that a computational linguistic olym-piad be established in Australia.",
        "Dominique Estival (then at Appen Pty Ltd, and a member of the ALTA Steering Committee) took on the project and, jointly with Jane Simpson (then from the University of Sydney), Rachel Nordlinger and Jean Mulder (from the University of Melbourne), ran the first ever Australian Computational and Linguistic Olympiad in 2008, with financial support from HCSNet (the Human Communication Science Network), and help from ALTA (the Australasian Language Technology Association), ALS (the Australian Linguistic Society) and CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation).",
        "The first competition was held in two locations ?",
        "the University of Melbourne (Victoria) and the University of Sydney (New South Wales) ?",
        "with a total of 119 students participating from 22 schools.",
        "Given the success of this first competition, 2009 saw the addition of four new locations around Australia (Adelaide, South Australia; Brisbane, Queensland; Canberra, ACT; Perth, Western Australia) and the sending of the national winning team to the International Linguistic Olympiad in Wroclaw, Poland.",
        "Since then OzCLO has run every year, with the recent addition of two regions (NSW-North in 2010 and Northern Territory in 2013) and the participation of an Australian team in every ILO."

      "heading": "2 Philosophy, Aims and Principles",
      "text": [
        "The immediate aim of OzCLO (Simpson and Henderson, 2010) is to introduce high school students to language puzzles from which they can learn about the richness, diversity and systematic nature of language, and develop their reasoning skills.",
        "The general value of this type of knowledge and skills in high school education has not been specifically articulated to potential participants or their teachers, schools or parents, as it has in the UK (UKLO, 2011; Hudson and Sheldon, 2013).",
        "However, informal feedback and the participation rate both indicate a widespread perception in the school sector that this type of activity has educational value, albeit with different focuses in different schools.",
        "For many of the schools that participate, OzCLO provides a means to meet their institutional responsibility to provide extracurricular activities that are intellectually stimulating and broadening for academically high-achieving students (under rubrics such as ?gifted and talented?).",
        "Some schools offer OzCLO to a wider range of students.",
        "The broader aim of OzCLO is to promote awareness of, and interest in linguistics and computational linguistics in high schools and in the wider community, and more specifically to increase enrolments in these disciplines at university level.",
        "A further goal is that this will ultimately attract people to careers in these areas.",
        "Linguistics has traditionally had little recognition at high school level in Australia, even within language education, although more recently there is linguistics content at upper high school level in the English Language course in Victoria and in the new national English curriculum.",
        "OzCLO has been running in most regions long enough to see participants reaching university, and although there has been no proper research on the impact of OzCLO on enrolments, there is anecdotal evidence that some former participants have chosen to study at least some linguistics.",
        "Consistent with the key aim of promoting interest, OzCLO operates on the principles that participation should be fun and should offer achievable if challenging tasks to a wide range of students across science and humanities interests, especially in the First Round.",
        "Schools are provided with a training package of problems which starts with a simple morphological analysis that is suitable to do as a whole-class exercise even if they do not proceed to the competition itself.",
        "In both rounds participation takes place in school-based teams, rather than individual competition.",
        "This is partly to encourage students to learn to communicate their analytical ideas, to collaborate effectively, and to provide mutual support and social interaction.",
        "It also offers some organisational advantages in terms of registration and marking.",
        "Because team members may have different levels of ability, the competition process does not necessarily identify the highest achieving individuals, but this risk is outweighed by the benefits of teams.",
        "The organisation of the First Round as separate competitions in each region provides each team with a smaller pool to compete in initially and a distinct level of local achievement.",
        "However, since there are considerable differences in the number of teams in each region, and the top teams from each region are invited into the National Round, the national competition does not necessarily consist of the highest achieving teams nationally and there is currently discussion of methods to minimise this effect.",
        "Finally, the results are structured to recognise participation as well as high achievement: in addition to recognising the top teams, all teams receive certificates in the categories Gold (top ?25%), Silver (next ?25%) and Bronze (remainder)."

        "The aim is to show students that analysing language phenomena can be fun as well as challenging, and also that linguistic skills can be applied to some very practical tasks.",

        "Students, teachers and principals have been extremely positive about the experience, giving encouraging feedback and expressing strong support for the competition.",

        "Some schools have started a linguistics club as after school activity, and others are promoting their experiences on social media.",
        "While there is no data currently available regarding any effect on enrolments in tertiary linguistics programs, increased interest in and awareness of linguistics is certainly a positive outcome for a discipline which faces challenges of funding and viability.",
        "The cooperation of academics from universities across the country in all the LOCs and the NSC, plus the support of the Australian Linguistics Society (ALS) and of the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA), make the competition a truly national event.",
