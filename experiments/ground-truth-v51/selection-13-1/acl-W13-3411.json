        "This open-source tool, available at http://cs.jhu.",
        "edu/?jason/tutorials/loglin/, is intended to develop intuitions, so that basic log-linear models can be then taken for granted in future lectures.",
        "It can be used near the start of a course, perhaps after introducing probability notation and n-gram models.",
        "We used the tool in our Natural Language Processing (NLP) class and received very positive feedback.",
        "Students were excited by it, with some saying the tool helped develop their ?physical intuition?",
        "for log-linear models.",
        "Other test users with no technical background also enjoyed working through the introductory lessons and found that they began to understand the model.",
        "The app includes 18 ready-to-use lessons for individual or small-group study or classroom use.",
        "Each lesson, e.g.",
        "Figure 1, guides the student to fit a probability model p~?",
        "(y |x) over some collection Y of shapes, words, or other images such as parse trees.",
        "Each lesson is peppered with questions; students can be asked to answer some of these questions in writing.2 Ambitious instructors can add new lessons or edit existing ones by writing configuration files (see section 5.3).",
        "This is useful for emphasizing specific concepts or applications.",
        "Section 8 provides some history and applications of log-linear modeling, as well as assignment ideas.",
        "2There are approximately 6 questions per lesson.",
        "We found that answering all the questions took our students about 2300 words, or just under 23 words per question, which was probably both unreasonable and unnecessary."

        "Then p(y |x) is a Markov random field or a conditional random field, depending on whether x is empty or not.",
        "Log-linear models over discrete variables are also sufficiently expressive for an NLP course.",
        "Students may experiment freely with adding their own creative model features that refer to salient attributes or properties of the data, since the probability (1) may consider any number of informative features of the (x, y) pair.",
        "How about training?",

        "The scaled regular-izer C ?",
        "R(~?)",
        "prevents overfitting on sparse features.",
        "This is arguably more straightforward than the traditional NLP smoothing methods for estimating probabilities from sparse data (Chen and Goodman, 1996), which require applying various ad hoc formulas to counts, and which do not generalize well to settings where there is not a natural sequence of backoff models.",
        "There exist fast and usable tools that students can use to train their log",
        "linear models, including, among others, MegaM (Daume?",
        "III, 2004), and NLTK (Bird et al., 2009).3 Formally, log-linear models are a good gateway to a more general understanding of undirected graphical models and the exponential family, including globally normalized joint or conditional distributions over trees and sequences.",
        "One reason that log-linear models are both versatile and pedagogically useful is that they do not just make predictions, but explicitly model probabilities.",

        "Immediate variants include CRF CFGs (Finkel 3A caveat is that generic log-linear training tools will iterate over the setY(x) in order to maximize (1) and to compute the constant of proportionality in (1) and the gradient of (2).",
        "This is impractical when Y(x) is large, as in language modeling or structured prediction.",
        "See Section 8.",
        "4Historically, this objective has been regarded as the optimization dual of a maximum entropy problem (Berger et al., 1996), motivating the log-linear form of (2).",
