        "A critical issue for implementing Question Answering (QA) systems is the need of designing answer search and extraction modules specific to the target application domain.",
        "These modules encode handcrafted rules based on syntactic patterns that detect the relations between a question and its candidate answers in text fragments.",
        "Such rules are triggered when patterns in the question and the passage are found.",
        "For example, given a question1: What is Mark Twain's real name?",
        "and a relevant passage, e.g., retrieved by a search engine: Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain.",
        "the QA engineers typically apply a syntactic parser to obtain the parse trees of the above two sentences, from which, they extract rules like: 1We use this question/answer pair from TREC QA as a running example in the rest of the paper.",
        "if the pattern ?What is NP2's ADJ name?",
        "is in the question and the pattern ?NP1 better known as NP2?",
        "is in the answer passage then associate the passage with a high score2.",
        "Machine learning has made easier the task of QA engineering by enabling the automatic learning of answer extraction modules.",
        "However, new features and training data have to be typically developed when porting a QA system from a domain to another.",
        "This is even more critical considering that effective features tend to be as much complex and similar as traditional handcrafted rules.",
        "To reduce the burden of manual feature engineering for QA, we proposed structural models based on kernel methods, (Moschitti et al., 2007; Moschitti and Quarteroni, 2008; Moschitti, 2008) with passages limited to one sentence.",
        "Their main idea is to: (i) generate question and passage pairs, where the text passages are retrieved by a search engine; (ii) assuming those containing the correct answer as positive instance pairs and all the others as negative ones; (iii) represent such pairs with two syntactic trees; and (ii) learn to rank answer passages by means of structural kernels applied to two trees.",
        "This enables the automatic engineering of structural/lexical semantic patterns.",
        "More recently, we showed that such models can be learned for passages constituted by multiple sentences on very large-scale (Severyn and Moschitti, 2012).",
        "For this purpose, we designed a shallow syntactic representation of entire paragraphs by also improving the pair representation using relational tags.",
        "In this paper, we firstly use our model in (Severyn and Moschitti, 2012) as the current baseline and compare it with more advanced structures derived from dependency trees.",
        "2If the point-wise answer is needed rather than the entire passage, the rule could end with: returns NP1",
        "Secondly, we enrich the semantic representation of QA pairs with the categorical information provided by automatic classifiers, i.e., question category (QC) and focus classifiers (FC) and Named Entity Recognizers (NER).",
        "FC determines the constituent of the question to be linked to the named entities (NEs) of the answer passage.",
        "The target NEs are selected based on their compatibility with the category of the question, e.g., an NE of type PERSON is compatible with a category of a question asking for a human (HUM).",
        "Thirdly, we tested our models in a cross-domain setting since we believe that: (i) the enriched representation is supposed to increase the capability of learning effective structural relational patterns through kernel machines; and (ii) such structural features are more invariant with respect to different domains, fostering their adaptability.",
        "Finally, the results show that our methods greatly improve on IR baseline, e.g., BM25, by 40%, and on previous reranking models, up to 10%.",
        "In particular, differently from our previous work such models can effectively use NERs and the output of different automatic modules.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows, Sec. 2 describes our kernel-based reranker, Sec. 3 illustrates our question/answer relational structures; Sec. 5 briefly describes the feature vectors, and finally Sec. 6 reports the experimental results on TREC and Answerbag data.",

        "It should be noted that unlike TREC data, where the answers are simply passages containing the correct answer phrase, answers in Answerbag specifically address a given question and are generated by humans.",
        "Additionally, TREC QA contains only factoid questions, while Answerbag is a community QA corpus with a large portion of non-factoid questions.",
        "Interestingly, the results demonstrate the robustness of our syntactic relational model which captures patterns shared across different domains, e.g. TREC and Answerbag data.",
        "Table 5 shows that: (i) models based on dependency structures result in a better generalization ability extracting more robust syntactic patterns; and (ii) the strategy to link the question focus with the related named entities in the answer provides an interesting improvement over the basic structural representations."

        "Instead, the search engine ranks the correct answer at position 34.",

        "A: The toy is called after Barbie Millicent Roberts from Willows.",
        "Despite differences in the surface forms of the words, PTK extracts matching patterns, e.g. [S NP [VP VBN] [PP IN] REL-NP], which yields a high similarity score boosting the rank of the correct candidate.",
        "However, we note that at the same time an incorrect candidate answer, e.g. Mark Twain was accused of racist language., exhibits similar patterns and also gets a high rank.",
        "The basic structural representation is not able to encode essential differences from the correct answer candidate.",
        "This poses a certain limitation on the discriminative power of CH and DEP representations.",
        "Introducing a focus tag changes the structural representation of both q/a pairs, s.t.",
        "the correct q/a pair preserves the pattern (after identifying word name as focus and question category as HUM, it is transformed to [S REL-FOCUS-NP [VP VBN] [PP IN] REL-FOCUS-NP]), while it is absent in the incorrect candidate.",
        "Thus, linking the focus word with the related NEs in the answer helps to discriminate between structurally similar yet semantically different candidates.",
        "Another step towards a more fine-grained structural representation is to specialize the relational focus tag (QC+TFC model).",
        "We propose to augment the focus tag with the question category to avoid matches with other structurally similar but semantically different candidates.",
        "For example, a q/a pair found in the list of support vectors: Q: What is Mark Twain's place of birth?",
        "A: Mark Twain was raised in Hannibal Missouri.",
        "would exhibit high structural similarity even when relational focus is used (since the relational tag does not incorporate the question class LOC), but refining the focus tag with the question class eliminates such cases."

        "Previous studies similar to ours carry out passage reranking by exploiting structural information, e.g. using subject-verb-object relations (At-tardi et al., 2001; Katz and Lin, 2003).",
        "Unfortunately, the large variability of natural language makes such triples rather sparse thus different methods explore soft matching (i.e., lexical similarity) based on answer types and named entity types (Aktolga et al., 2011).",
        "Passage reranking using classifiers of question and answer pairs were proposed in (Radlinski and Joachims, 2006; Jeon et al., 2005).",
        "Regarding kernel methods, our work in (Moschitti et al., 2007; Severyn and Moschitti, 2012) was the first to exploit tree kernels for modeling answer reranking.",
        "However, such method lacks the use of important relational information between a question and a candidate answer, which is essential to learn accurate relational patterns.",
        "In contrast, this paper relies on shallow and dependency trees encoding the output of question and focus classifiers to connect focus word and NEs of the answer passage.",
        "This provides more effective relational information, which allows our model to significantly improve on previous rerankers."

      "text": [
        "This paper shows a viable research direction in the automatic QA engineering.",
        "One of its main characteristics is the use of structural kernel technology to induce features from structural semantic representations of question and answer passage pairs.",
        "The same technology is also used to construct question and focus classifiers, which are used to derive relational structures.",
        "An interesting result of this paper is that to design an answer passage reranker for a new domain, we can use off-the-shelf syntactic parsers and NERs along with little training data for the QC and FC classifiers.",
        "This is due to the fact that: (i) the kernel technology is able to automatically extract effective structural patterns; and (ii) the extracted patterns are rather robust, e.g., models learned on Answerbag improve accuracy on TREC test data."
