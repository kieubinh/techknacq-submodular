        "These two feature types represent different aspects of word meaning (Murphy et al., 2012c), and can be compared with the paradigmatic/syntagmatic distinction (Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "Global patterns give a more topic-based meaning (e.g. judge might appear in documents also containing court and verdict).",
        "Certain local patterns give a more type-based meaning (e.g. the noun judge might be modified by the adjective harsh, or be the subject of decide, as would related and substitutable words such as referee or conductor).",

        "Our Dependency VSM represents word w with a vector where each feature is a dependency parse link (e.g., the word w is the subject of the verb ?eat?",
        "), and the feature value is the number of instances of this dependency feature for word w across a large text corpus.",
        "We also consider a third Combined VSM in which the word vector is the concatenation of its Document and Dependency features.",
        "All three models subsequently normalize frequencies using positive pointwise mutual-information (PPMI), and",
