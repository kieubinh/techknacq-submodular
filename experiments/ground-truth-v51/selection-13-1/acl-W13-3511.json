        "Most competitive learning methods for computational linguistics are supervised, and thus require labeled examples, which are expensive to obtain.",
        "Moreover, those techniques suffer from data scarcity: many words only appear a small number of time, or even not at all, in the training data.",
        "It thus helps a lot to first learn word clusters on a large amount of unlabeled data, which are cheap to obtain, and then to use this clusters as features for the supervised task.",
        "This scheme has proven to be effective for various tasks such as named entity recognition (Freitag, 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Faruqui et al., 2010), syntactic chunking (Turian et al., 2010) or syntactic dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Haffari et al., 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2011).",
        "It was also successfully applied for transfer learning of multilingual structure by Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012).",
        "The most commonly used clustering method for semi-supervised learning is the one proposed by Brown et al. (1992), and known as Brown clustering.",
        "While still being one of the most efficient word representation method (Turian et al., 2010), Brown clustering has two limitations we want to address in this work.",
        "First, since it is a hard clustering method, homonymy is ignored.",
        "Second, it does not take into account syntactic relations between words, which seems crucial to induce semantic classes.",
        "Our goal is thus to propose a method for semantic class induction which takes into account both syntax and homonymy, and then to study their effects on semantic class learning.",
        "In this paper, we start by introducing a new unsupervised method for semantic classes induction.",
        "This is achieved by defining a generative model of sentences with latent variables, which aims at capturing semantic roles of words.",
        "We require our method to be scalable, in order to learn models on large datasets containing tens of millions of sentences.",
        "More precisely, we make the following contributions: ?",
        "We introduce a generative model of sentences, based on dependency trees, which can be seen as a generalization of Brown clustering, ?",
        "We describe a fast approximate inference algorithm, based on message passing and on-line EM for scaling to large datasets.",
        "It allowed us to learn models with 512 latent states on a dataset with hundreds of millions of tokens in less than two days on a single core, ?",

        "Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992) is the most commonly used method for word cluster induction for semi-supervised learning.",
        "The goal of this algorithm is to discover a clustering function C from words to clusters which maximizes the likelihood of the data, assuming the following sequential model of sentences:",
        "It can be shown that the best clustering is actually maximizing the mutual information between adjacent clusters.",
        "A greedy agglomerative algorithm was proposed by Brown et al. (1992) in order to find the clustering C, while Clark (2003) proposed to use the exchange clustering algorithm (Kneser and Ney, 1993) to maximize the previous likelihood.",
        "One of the limitations of this model is the fact that it neither takes into account homonymy or syntax.",
        "Another limitation of this method is the complexity of the algorithms proposed to find the best clustering.",
        "This led Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) to consider a slightly different model, where the class-to-class transitions are replaced by word-to-class transitions:",
        "Thanks to that modification, Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) designed an efficient variant of the exchange algorithm, allowing them to train models on very large datasets.",

        "Semantic space models are another family of methods, besides clustering, that can be used as features for semi-supervised learning.",
        "In those techniques, words are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space.",
        "These vectors are obtained by representing the unlabeled corpus as a word-document co-occurrence matrix in the case of latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990), or word-word co-occurrence matrix in the case of the hyperspace analog to language model (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996).",
        "Dimension reduction is then performed, by taking the singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix, in order to obtained the so-called semantic space.",

        "More recently, Dhillon et al. (2011) proposed a method based on canonical correlation analysis to obtained a such word embeddings.",
        "A last approach to word representation is latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA), proposed by Blei et al. (2003).",
        "LDA is a generative model where each document is viewed as a mixture of topics.",
        "The major difference between LDA and our model is the fact that LDA treats documents as bags of words, while we introduce a model of sentences, taking into account the syntax.",
        "Griffiths et al. (2005) defined a composite model, using LDA for topic modeling and an HMM for syntax modeling.",
        "This model, HMM-LDA, was used by Li and McCallum (2005) for semi-supervised learning and applied to part-of-speech tagging and Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Se?aghdha (2010) proposed to use topic models, such as LDA, to perform selectional preference induction.",
        "Finally, Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009) proposed a variant of LDA, using parse trees to include the syntax.",
        "Given that we aim for our classes to capture as much of the word semantics reflected by the syntax, such as the semantic roles of words, we believe that it is not necessarily useful or even desirable that the latent variables should be determined, even in part, by topic parameters that are sharing information at the document level.",
        "Moreover, our model being significantly simpler, we were able to design fast and efficient algorithms, making it possible to use our model on much larger datasets, and with many more latent classes."

        "We also note that Brown clustering on dependency trees always outperforms Brown clustering on chains for the two tasks we consider, confirming that syntactic dependencies are a better structure to induce semantic classes than a linear chain.",

        "These two effects make the disambiguation of verbs more noisy for trees than for chains.",

        "We developed an efficient algorithm to perform inference and learning, which makes it possible to learn in this model on large datasets, such as the New York Times corpus.",
        "We showed that this model induces relevant semantic classes and that it improves performance over Brown clustering on semi-supervised named entity recognition and supersense tagging.",
        "We plan to explore in future work better ways to model verbs, and in particular how to take into account the type of dependencies between words."
