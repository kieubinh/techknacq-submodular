        "Compositional and distributional semantic models seem to provide complementary solutions for solving the same problem, that of assigning a proper ?meaning?",
        "to a text segment.",
        "Specifically, while compositional models deal with the recursive nature of the language, providing a way to address its inherent ability to create infinite sentences from finite resources (words), they leave words as unexplained primitives whose meanings have somehow already been set before the compositional process.",
        "On the other hand, distributional models have been especially successful in providing concrete representations for the meaning of words as vectors in a vector space, created by taking into account the context in which each word appears.",
        "Despite its success for smaller language units, the distributional hypothesis does not naturally lend itself to compounds of words.",
        "Hence these models do not canonically scale in tasks requiring the creation of vector representations for text constituents larger than words, i.e. for phrases and sentences.",
        "Given the complementary nature of those two semantic models, it is not surprising that considerable research activity has been dedicated on combining them into a single framework that would benefit from the best of both worlds in a unified manner: Mitchell and Lapata (2008) experiment with intransitive sentences, applying simple compositional models based on vector addition and point-wise multiplication in a disambiguation task; Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Guevara (2010) use regression models in order to build vectors for adjective-noun compounds; Erk and Pad?",
        "(2008) work on transitive sentences using structured vector spaces; Socher et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) use neural networks to combine vectors following the grammatical structure; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a,b) apply the categorical framework of Coecke et al. (2010) on the disambiguation task of Mitchell and Lapata (2008); and Kartsaklis et al. (2012) and Grefenstette et al. (2013) build upon previous implementations by adding specific algebraic operations and machine learning techniques to further improve the concrete abilities of the abstract categorical models.",
        "A common strand in all of the above models is that they are based on ?ambiguous?",
        "vector representations, where a polysemous word is represented by a single vector regardless of the number of its actual senses.",
        "For example, the word ?bank?",
        "has at least two meanings (financial institution and land alongside a river), both of which will be fused into a single vector representation.",
        "And, although it is generally true that compositional models following the formal semantics view of Montague do not care about disambiguation (meanings of words in such models are represented by logical constants explicitly set before the compositional process), the story changes when one moves to a vector space model with ambiguous vector representations.",
        "The main problem is that, when acting on ambiguous vector spaces, compositional models",
        "seem to perform two tasks at the same time, composition and disambiguation, leaving the resulting vector hard to interpret: it is not clear if this vector is a proper meaning representation for the composed compound or just a disambiguated version of one of the words therein.",
        "This problem escapes the evaluation schemes, especially when disambiguation tasks are used as a criterion for evaluating compositional models?a common practice in current research for compositional-distributional semantics.",
        "Indeed, Pulman (2013) argues that although disambiguation can emerge as a welcome side-effect of the compositional process, it is not clear if compositionality is either a necessary or sufficient condition for disambiguation to happen.",
        "On the contrary, it seems that the form of most current vector space models and the compositional operations used on them (quite often some form of vector point-wise multiplication) mainly achieve disambiguation, but not composition.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to further investigate the potential of a compositional-distributional model based on disambiguated vector representations, where each word can have one or more distinct senses.",
        "More specifically, we aim to show that (a) compositionality is not a necessary condition for disambiguation, so the quite common practice of using a disambiguation task as a criterion for evaluating the performance of compositional-distributional models is questionable; and (b) the introduction of a separate disambiguation step in the compositional process of distributional models can be indeed beneficial for the quality of the resulting composed vectors.",
        "We train our models from BNC, a 100-million words corpus created from samples of written and spoken English.",
        "We perform word sense induction by following the generic algorithm of Schütze (1998), in which the senses of a word are represented by distinct clusters created by taking into account the various contexts in which this specific word occur in the corpus.",
        "For the actual clustering step we use a combination of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and the Calin?ski-Harabasz index (Calin?ski and Harabasz, 1974).",
        "The parameters of the models are fine-tuned on the noun set of SEMEVAL 2010 Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation task (Manandhar et al., 2010).",
        "Equipped with a disambiguated vector space, we use it on a verb disambiguation experiment, similar in style to that of Mitchell and Lapata (2008), but applied on a more linguistically motivated dataset, based on the work of Pickering and Frisson (2001).",
        "We find that the application of a simple disambiguation algorithm, without any compositional steps, is proven more effective than a number of compositional models.",
        "We consider this as an indication for the necessity of separating disambiguation from composition, since it implies that the latter is not necessary for achieving the former.",
        "Next, we demonstrate that a compositional model based on disambiguated vectors can indeed produce composite vector representations of better quality, by applying the model on a phrase similarity task (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "The goal here is to evaluate the similarity of short verb phrases, based on the distance of their composite vectors."

        "The transition from word meaning to sentence meaning, a task easily done by human subjects based on the rules of grammar, implies the existence of a composition operation applied to primitive text units in order to build compound ones.",
        "Various solutions have been proposed with different levels of sophistication for this problem in the context of vector space models of meaning.",
        "At one end of the spectrum the simple models of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) address composition as the point-wise multiplication or addition of the involved word vectors.",
        "This bag-of-words approach has been proven a hard-to-beat baseline for many of the more sophisticated models.",
        "At the other end, composition in the work of Socher et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) is served by the advanced machinery of recurring neural networks, where the output of the network is used again as input in a recurring fashion, for composing vectors of larger constituents.",
        "Following a different path, the categorical framework of Coecke et al. (2010) exploits a structural homomorphism between grammar and vector spaces in order to treat words with special meanings, such as verb and adjectives, as functions (tensors of rank-n) that apply to their arguments.",
        "This application has the form of inner product, generalising the familiar notion of matrix multiplication to tensors of higher rank.",
        "Regardless of their level of sophistication, most of the models which aim to apply compositionality on word vector representations fail to address the problem of handling the polysemous nature of words.",
        "Even more importantly, many of the models are evaluated on their ability to disambiguate the meaning of specific words, following an idea first introduced by Kintsch (2001) and later adopted by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and others.",
        "For example, in this latter work the au",
        "thors test their multiplicative and additive models as follows: given an ambiguous intransitive verb, say ?run?",
        "(with the two senses to be those of moving fast and of a liquid dissolving), they examine to what extent the composition of the verb with an appropriate subject (e.g. ?horse?",
        "or ?colour?)",
        "will disambiguate the intended sense of the verb within the specific context.",
        "Each row in the dataset consists of a subject (e.g.",
        "?horse?",
        "), a verb (?run?",
        "), a high-similarity landmark verb (?gallop?",
        "), and a low-similarity landmark verb (?dissolve?).",
        "The subject is combined with the main verb to form a simple intransitive sentence, and the vector of this sentence is then compared with the vectors of the landmark verbs.",
        "The goal is to evaluate the degree to which the composed sentence vector is closer to the high landmark than to the vector of the low landmark, and this is considered an indication of successful composition.",
        "However, although it is generally true that multiplying ??",
        "?run with ???",
        "?horse will filter out most of the components of??",
        "?run that are irrelevant to ?dissolve?",
        "(since the ?dissolve?-related elements of ???",
        "?horse should have values close to zero) and will produce a disambiguated version of this verb under the context of ?horse?, it is not at all clear if this vector will also constitute an appropriate representation for the meaning of the intransitive sentence ?horse runs?.",
        "In other words, here we have two tasks taking place at the same time: (a) disambiguation of the ambiguous word given its context; and (b) composition that produces a meaning vector for the whole sentence.",
        "The extent to which the latter is a necessary condition for the former remains unclear, and constitutes a factor that complicates the evaluation and assessment of such systems.",
        "In this paper we argue that as long as the above distinct tasks are interwoven into a single step, claims of compositionality in distributional systems cannot be reliably assessed.",
        "We therefore propose the addition of a disambiguation step in the generic methodology of compositional-distributional models."
