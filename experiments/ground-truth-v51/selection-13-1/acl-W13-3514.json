        "Given a post written for a two-sided topic in an online debate forum (e.g., ?Should abortion be allowed??",

        "For example, a stance classification system should determine that the author of the following post is anti-abortion.",
        "Post 1: Abortion has been legal for decades and no one seems to have a problem with it.",
        "That's ridiculous!",
        "There are millions of people in the world who would love to have children but can't.",
        "Previous approaches to debate stance classification have focused on three debate settings, namely congressional floor debates (Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Balahur et al., 2009; Yesse-nalina et al., 2010; Burfoot et al., 2011), company-internal discussions (Murakami and Raymond, 2010), and online social, political, and ideological debates in public forums (Agrawal et al., 2003; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Wang and Rose?, 2010; Biran and Rambow, 2011; Hasan and Ng, 2012).",
        "As Walker et al. (2012) point out, debates in public forums differ from congressional debates and company-internal discussions in terms of language use.",
        "Specifically, online debaters use colorful and emotional language to express their points, which may involve sarcasm, insults, and questioning another debater's assumptions and evidence.",
        "These properties can potentially make stance classification of online debates more challenging than that of the other two types of debates.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to improve the state of the art in stance classification of online debates, focusing in particular on ideological debates.",
        "Specifically, we present two extensions, one linguistic and the other extra-linguistic, to the state-of-the-art supervised learning approach to this task proposed by Anand et al. (2011).",
        "In our linguistic extension, we induce patterns from each sentence in the training set using syntactic dependencies and semantic frames that aim to capture the meaning of a sentence and provide a generalized representation of it.",
        "Note that while Anand et al.",
        "'s lexico-syntactic approach aims to generalize from a sentence using syntactic dependencies, we aim to generalize using semantic frames.",
        "As we will see in Section 4, not only is there no guarantee that syntactic dependencies can retain or sufficiently capture the meaning of a sentence during the generalization process, it is in fact harder to generalize from syntactic dependencies than from semantic frames.",
        "In our extralinguistic extension, we improve the classification of a test post via a novel way of exploiting the information in other test posts with the same stance.",
        "We evaluate our approach to stance classification of ideological debates on datasets collected for four domains from online debate forums.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it outperforms an improved version of Anand et al's approach by 2.6?7.0 accuracy points on the four domains.",

        "Their n-gram features include both the unigrams and bigrams in a post, as well as its first unigram, first bigram, and first trigram.",
        "The features based on document statistics include the post length, the number of words per sentence, the percentage of words with more than six letters, and the percentage of words as pronouns and sentiment words.",
        "The punctuation features are composed of the repeated punctuation symbols in a post.",
        "The dependency-based features have three variants.",
        "In the first variant, the pair of arguments involved in each dependency relation extracted by a dependency parser is used as a feature.",
        "The second variant is the same as the first except that the head (i.e., the first argument in a relation) is replaced by its part-of-speech (POS) tag.",
        "The features in the third variant, the topic-opinion features, are created by replacing each feature from the first two types that contains a sentiment word with the corresponding polarity label (i.e., + or ?).",

        "Related work on stance classification of congressional debates has found that enforcing author constraints (ACs) can improve classification performance (e.g., Thomas et al. (2006), Burfoot et al. (2011), Lu et al. (2012)).",
        "ACs are a type of inter-post constraints that specify that two posts written by the same author for the same debate domain should have the same stance.",
        "We hypothesize that ACs could similarly be used to improve stance classification of ideological debates, and therefore propose a second baseline where we enhance the first baseline with ACs.",
        "Enforcing ACs is simple.",
        "We first use the learned stance classifier to classify the test posts as in the first baseline, and then post-process the labels of the test posts.",
