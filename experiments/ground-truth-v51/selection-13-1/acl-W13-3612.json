        "Correcting ArtOrDet errors for this task is not an easy job especially the number of NP using correct article is really high (more than 95%).",
        "However our LIBLINEAR classifier performance is slightly better than the baseline and Naive Bayes.",
        "Besides comparing between Naive Bayes and LIBLINEAR classifiers for this task we also adapt two approaches from (Dahlmeier et al., 2012) and (Rozovskaya et al., 2012).",
        "Our result explains that neither re-sampling method nor error inflation method contribute to the increase of accuracy.",
        "There are several directions that can be pursued to improve the classifier accuracy.",
        "Adding language model feature which is mentioned by (Gamon et al., 2008; Dahlmeier et al., 2012) might be useful to filter the result.",
        "However using language model like Google N-gram corpus would need some extra treatment since the data is really big and need a lot of computation time to build the language model.",
        "The hardest part of the SVA-correction task is to extract the matching subject-verb pairs; with sufficient amount of data annotated for that purpose (there is one out there, for Swedish), the rule-based approach could be turned into a statistical learning one, which might improve the recall of the system.",
        "I have found no previous research pointing to this direction.",
        "Long and complex sentences, with more than one subject-verb pairs, are frequent in corpora specific to life sciences and technology literature, such as the corpus used in this shared task.",
        "The system definitely works better on shorter sentences."
