        "Grammatical correction covers many subproblems including spelling correction, lexical choice, and even paraphrasing.",
        "There is a sense in which syntax is separable from semantics and discourse.",
        "A sentence may be parsable in a language, even if it is nonsensical.",
        "On the other hand, many errors that we consider a matter of grammar, such as some instances of determiner choice, are only incorrect because of the semantic or discourse properties of the sentence in its context.",
        "Another complexity is that there are degrees of grammatical correctness.",
        "Some sentences are not parsable, but others are just awkward sounding, or unconventional.",
        "So a grammatical error may manifest in a message that doesn't code a meaning in the language at all, and the task becomes inferring a plausible meaning and coding it correctly.",
        "This is analogous to non-word spelling errors.",
        "Alternatively, it may result in a meaning that is not exactly what was intended.",
        "This is more like a real-word spelling error.",
        "In either case, the implication is that in order to detect and correct a grammatical error, we must be able to infer the intended meaning.",
        "This points to the depth of the problem."

      "heading": "1.1 Confusion Sets",
      "text": [
        "A common and useful way to construe error correction, including grammatical correction, is to first classify sets of alternatives that are mutually confusable.",
        "This is typically done at the lexical level, though the idea is generalizable to multiword expressions, constructions, or phrases.",
        "Then the text under examination is searched for instances of members of these confusion sets.",
        "Finally a heuristic is used to decide whether one of its alternatives would have been a more appropriate choice in its context.",
        "Within this framework, there are different approaches to these steps.",
        "In choosing our confusion sets, we wanted to be flexible and extensible.",
        "Therefore, we did not want to depend on corpora of errors with annotated corrections to infer alternatives.",
        "So we collected general statistics from corpora that were assumed to be correct, and used those to evaluate proposed corrections to observed sentences.",
        "This approach is not unique to this model.",
        "It is seen, for example, in (De Felice and Pulman, 2007), (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), and (Gamon et al., 2009), among others.",
        "However, the main difference between our system and previous ones is that we do not select our confusion sets in advance of statistical modelling.",
        "That is, although the confusion sets we used were based on POS tagsets, there was no classifying or learning to discriminate among members of a confusion set before the task.",
        "The aim of this choice was to make our system more general and flexible.",
        "We can now modify our confusion sets at runtime without retraining any models.",
        "The provisional confusion sets we used are somewhat arbitrary, but this can be changed independently of the rest of the system.",
        "Although our system was not competitive at this",
        "stage, it provides a preliminary basis for further experiments.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes the framework and the initial implementation of that framework that was used in the shared task, as well as future improvements to the model.",
        "We also discuss the difficulty in evaluating such systems.",
        "All of the code used to generate our submission is freely available for examination and use on GitHub (Wilcox-O?Hearn and Wilcox-O?Hearn, 2013)."

        "We approach grammatical error correction using a noisy channel model.",
        "Such a model is also used by (Park and Levy, 2011) and (West, Park, and Levy, 2011).",
        "One appealing aspect of this model is that it makes explicit the cost of error, such that a correction must not only be more likely than the observation to be proposed, but it must be more likely even given that errors are less likely than non-errors to a degree specified by the properties of the channel.",
        "In practice this can mitigate false positives that result from overconfidence in a language model.",
        "A grammatical error is treated as a transformation of some original, correct sentence, S, generated by a language model M .",
        "We attempt to recover the original sentence by hypothesizing possible transformations that could have resulted in the observed sentence S?.",
        "If we estimate that it is more likely that S was generated by M and transformed into S?",
        "than that S?",
        "was generated by M and left unchanged, we propose S as a correction.",
        "In this preliminary implementation of the framework, we use a combination of word and POS n-gram models as the language generation model, while POS tags form the basis of our channel model.",
        "To generate sentence hypotheses that can include multiple interacting errors interleaved with non-errors while putting a bound on the size of the search space, we use a left-to-right beam search.",
        "This differs from the beam search used by Dal-heimer and Ng (2012a).",
        "In their work, the search space is constructed by generating variations of the entire sentence.",
        "Just as here, at each iteration, they make every variation appropriate at a single position, but they evaluate the whole sentence containing that correction.",
        "Although sentences that require multiple interacting corrections will initially have a low score under this method, a large enough beam width will allow the corrections to be made one at a time without being lost from consideration.",
        "In our model, by evaluating partial sentences from left-to-right, we hope to lessen the need for a large beam width, by holding off integration of the continuation of the sentence, and letting it unfold in a way that more closely mimics human sentence comprehension."

        "The channel model provides a definition of transformations that could have been applied to a sentence before we observed it.",
        "Our system considers only transformations of single words, specifically, only single word insertions, deletions, and substitutions.",
        "This cannot represent every grammar error we might encounter, but makes a good first approximation, and it represents all errors in this iteration of the shared task.",
        "To simplify the description and implementation, we equivalently consider the empty string to be a valid word included in some substitution (confusion) sets, and define the channel as one that sometimes replaces a word with one of the alternatives in its confusion set.",
        "The probability of such replacement is a parameter ?",
        "to be inferred.",
        "As explained in the introduction, one goal of our system is to allow flexible confusion sets that do not need to be fully specified in advance of learning statistics about them.",
        "Therefore, we define our",
        "confusion sets in terms of the standard POS tagsets as given by the Stanford tagger, using a notion of closed vs. open word classes.",
        "For our purposes, a closed word class is a set of words that has a relatively small, finite number of members.",

        "Although the second such class is labelled ?AUX?, it does not correspond directly to the standard definition of auxiliary as given by grammars of English.",
        "First, ?to?",
        "does not meet al of the properties of auxiliaries.",
        "For example, because it does not occur with a subject, it cannot participate in subject-auxiliary inversion.",
        "On the other hand, although modals are traditionally a subclass of auxiliaries, we have left them separate as defined in the tagset.",
        "The intuition guiding those decisions was based on grammatical function and patterns of alternatives.",
        "Verb forms in English often consist of a closed class word w, followed by a main verb, the form of which combines with the particular w to indicate the tense and aspect.",
        "In other words, w functions as a verb form marker, and doesn't carry other information.",
        "Modals, in contrast, have uniform grammatical co-occurrence patterns, essentially all being followed by bare infinitives.",
        "They have the semantic function of expressing modality, and are alternatives to one another.",
        "Ultimately, which words are best classed as alternatives should be determined empirically.",
        "We used two open classes specific to this task, verbs and nouns.",
        "The verb errors of this year's task included verb form and subject-verb agreement.",
        "Ideally, to find candidates for the confusion set of a verb v, we would want to produce morphological variations of v whose POS tag is different from that of v. This was approximated with the following heuristic.",
        "We defined the prefix of v to be the initial characters of v, including least the first character, and not any of the final four, except when the first character was one of those.",
        "We collected all words in the vocabulary starting with that prefix, whose stem given by the NLTK Porter stemmer matched the corresponding stem of v and that had appeared at least once with a POS tag indicating a verb of a different form from that of v. Similarly, the only noun errors under consideration were noun number errors, meaning a change from singular to plural or vice versa.",

        "Sometimes the corrections were strictly grammatical, in that the original was not well-formed English.",
        "Some were more stylistic; what the student had written was awkward, or sounded disfluent, even if it could have been parsed acceptably.",
        "This is appropriate and consistent with the nature of the problem.",
        "However, it does make evaluation almost as challenging as the task itself.",
        "Often if a sentence has grammatical errors, there are many different ways to repair the error.",

        "output ought to be considered valid, even if it did not match the particular annotation given by the grader.",
        "Another problem with the evaluation, however, actually stemmed from the simplification of the task.",
        "Because grammatical correction is inherently difficult, and because some of the difficulty increases gradually by type as just described, the task for this year was made more moderate by selecting only 5 error types from the 27 types defined in the corpus.",
        "However, this resulted in two difficulties.",
        "The first was that some error types were closely related.",
        "Errors of verb form, verb tense, verb modal, and subject-verb agreement may have overlapping interpretation.",
        "Those error types are not necessarily distinguishable by our method.",
        "For example, there is a sentence in the test set: Firstly , security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace .",
        "which is corrected to: Firstly , security systems have improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace .",
        "with the annotation of verb tense error type, and thus not part of this task.",
        "On the other hand, there is also a sentence: ... the electric systems were short circuited... which is corrected to: ... the electric systems short circuited... with the annotation of verb form error type, and thus part of this task.",
        "Second, sometimes an annotation not evaluated in this task that resulted in a change of word form was necessarily accompanied by changes to words that were included in the task.",
        "This meant that in order for the system to match the gold annotations, it would have to propose a sentence that was grammatically incorrect.",
        "This is suboptimal.",
