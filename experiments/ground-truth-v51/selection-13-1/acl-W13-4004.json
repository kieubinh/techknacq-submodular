        "(CAUSE (erage, ecollapse)) In example 1, the two bold events are causally connected by an explicit and unambiguous discourse marker (because).",
        "However, in English, not all discourse markers unambiguously identify causality (Prasad et al., 2008) - for example, Bethard and Martin (2008) proposed a corpus of 1000 causal and non-causal event pairs conjoined by the marker and.",
        "Even more, causal relations can be encoded by implicit contexts - i.e., those where no discourse marker is present (example 2).",
        "Despite the recent achievements obtained in discourse processing, it is still unclear what types of knowledge can contribute most towards detecting causality in both explicit and implicit contexts (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).",
        "The complexity of the task of detecting causality between events stems from the fact that there are many factors involved, such as contextual features of an instance (e.g., lexical items, tenses of verbs, arguments of verbs, etc.",
        "), semantic and pragmatic features of events, background knowledge, world knowledge, common sense, etc.",
        "Prior approaches have employed contextual features of an instance to identify causality between events or discourse segments (Bethard and Martin, 2008; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Pitler et al., 2009).",
        "Although contextual features provide important knowledge about sentence(s) in which events appear, humans also make use of other information such as background knowledge to comprehend causality.",
        "For instance, in example 2 we use knowledge about the causal association between verbal entities rage and collapse to label it with causality.",
        "This research is motivated by the need to extract and analyze other type of knowledge necessary for the identification of causal relations between verbal events.",
        "We start from the fact that verbs are the",
        "main components of language to express events and semantic relations between events.",
        "Thus, in order to identify and extract causal relations between events (denoted by (evi , evj )), it is critical for a model to employ knowledge about the tendency of a verb pair (vi, vj) to encode causation.",
        "For example, the pair (kill, arrest) has a high tendency to encode a cause relation irrespective of the context in which it is used, thereby a good indicator of causality.",
        "The state-of-the-art resources on verb semantics, such as WordNet, VerbNet, Prop-Bank, FrameNet, etc.",
        "(Miller, 1990; Kipper et al., 2000; Kingsbury et al., 2002; Baker et al., 1998), provide information about the semantic classes, thematic roles and selectional restrictions of verbs.",
        "Among these, WordNet is the only resource which provides information about the cause relation between verbs, but it has very limited coverage.",
        "For VERBOCEAN, a semi-automatically generated resource, Chklovski and Pantel (2004) have used explicit lexical patterns (e.g., ?verb * by verb?)",
        "as means of mining enablement (cause-effect) relations between verbs.",
        "Such approaches help detecting causality with high precision but suffer from limited coverage due to the highly implicit nature of language.",
        "Moreover, such resources do not provide any information about the likelihood of a causal relation in verb pairs - e.g., (kill, arrest) has a high tendency to encode cause relation as compared with the pair (build, maintain).",
        "The pair (build, maintain) seems ambiguous because it can encode both cause and non-cause relations depending on the context, as shown by examples 1 and 3.",
        "Thus, causality detection models should employ knowledge about which verb pairs are strongly causal (non-causal) in nature and for which pairs the context plays an important role to signal causality.",

        "In this process, we create three categories of verb pairs: Strongly Causal (Sc), Ambiguous (Ac) and Strongly Non-causal (S?c).",
        "The result is a knowledge base (KBc) of causal associations of verbs.",
        "In KBc, the category Sc (S?c) contains the verb pairs which have the greatest (least) likelihood to encode a causal relation, respectively.",
        "However, the category Ac contains ambiguous verb pairs which have the likelihood to encode both causal and non-causal relations.",

        "They have relied on a small scale dataset of 1000 instances (697 training and 303 test) for this task.",
        "Unlike above models, recently some researchers have employed unsupervised causality detection metrics and minimal supervision for this task.",

        "They also proposed a minimally supervised method using explicit discourse markers.",
        "For example, they used ILP framework to assign a non-causal relation to all the event pairs appearing in two discourse segments connected by a non-causal marker.",
        "They evaluated their model on a set of 20 documents, a highly skewed evaluation set with around 2-3% causal instances and 58% human inter-annotator agreement on cause-effect relations.",
        "On verbal events, they reported 38.3% F-score with CEA and 1-2% improvement using minimally supervised method.",
        "As compared with above mentioned metrics, we introduce knowledge rich association measures which employ supervision from the automatically generated training corpus to learn causality.",
        "Several other NLP researchers have studied related topics e.g., identifying events, building of temporal chain of events sharing a common protagonist (participant), predicting future events and identifying hidden links in news articles to build a coherent chain (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013; Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010).",

        "For this purpose, we collected two test sets.",
        "For each test set, we randomly selected 50 verb pairs from the list of 10, 455 verb pairs in KBc.",
        "For each verb pair, we selected randomly 3 intra-and 3 inter-sentential instances from the English Gigaword corpus and the ?Hurricane Katrina?",
        "and ?Iraq war?",

        "In order to keep the development set different from the test sets, we automatically traversed the development set to determine if any test instance is available in it.",
        "In case of finding any such test instance, we removed it from the development set to perform evaluation on unseen test instances.",
        "Two annotators were asked to provide Cause or Non-Cause labels for each instance.",
        "They were provided with annotation guidelines from the manipulation theory of causality (Woodward, 2008).",
        "Given these guidelines have been successfully used by Riaz and Girju (2010), we use them here as well.",
        "For ease of annotation, we randomly selected inter-sentential instances such that the length of each sentence is at most 40 words.",
        "The human inter-annotator agreement achieved on Test-set1 (Test-set2) is 90% (88.3%) and the agreement on the cause class is 70% (62.7%), respectively.",
        "The kappa score on Test-set1 (Test-set2) is 0.75 (0.69), respectively.",
        "The Test-set1 (Test-set2) contains 25% (22%) causal instances, respectively.",
        "We employed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (equation 10) to compare the ranked list of verb pairs based on the scores of our metrics and the rank given by the human annotators.",
        "The score P ranges from +1 to ?1 where +1 and ?1 show strong and negative correlation, respectively.",
        "Here, n is the total number of verb pairs in the test set, xi is the human annotation rank and yi is the metric's rank of verb pair i of the test set.",
        "The values of xi and yi are determined as follows.",
        "For each verb pair, Ch is calculated which is the number of cause labels given by both human annota",

        "tors out of 6 instances of a verb pair.",
        "The pairs are ranked in descending order according to the score Ch s.t.",
        "the top scored pair(s) gets rank 50 and the next to the top pair(s) gets rank 49 and so on.",
        "Similarly, ranks are given to the verb pairs according to the metric's scores.",
        "This way of evaluation was also used by Beamer and Girju (2009) for temporally ordered adjacent verb pairs.",
        "But here, we are working with verb pairs appearing in any temporal order in both intra-and inter-sentential instances.",
        "We used ECA, ICA and BCA scores to generate the ranked list of all verb pairs.",
        "In this work, we also used the state-of-the-art causality identifier CEA (Do et al., 2011) as baseline metric.",
        "For each verb pair, we computed the likelihood of causality by taking the average of CEA scores on all instances of that pair in the development set.",
        "The results with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in Table 1 show that CEA is not very capable of matching the human ranked list of pairs as compared with our metrics (i.e., ECA, ICA and BCA).",
        "Specifically, the difference is significant for Test-set1 where the correlation coefficient with CEA goes below 0.",
        "This behavior of CEA makes sense because it is unsupervised and requires more knowledge to perform well.",
        "As compared with ECA, both ICA and BCA perform significantly better to match human ranking.",
        "The Spearman's score gain by BCA on Test-set1 is of about 30 (52) points over ECA (CEA) and the gain by ICA on Test-set2 is of about 13 (18) points over ECA (CEA), respectively.",
        "In order to explain the behavior of our metrics",
        "more clearly, we performed an evaluation of three categories of verb pairs as follows.",
        "We generated three categories of verb pairs using our metrics and CEA.",
        "We combined two test sets to show the percentage of total causal and non-causal instances of verb pairs that lie in Sc, Ac and S?c using following procedure.",
        "If a verb pair belongs to Sc and has 3 causal and 2 non-causal instances after human agreement, then these 5 instances are considered members of Sc.",
        "This step is performed for all verb pairs in the test set.",
        "After this the percentage of total causal and non-causal test instances are calculated for each category (see Figure 1).",
        "Figure 1 reveals that ICA, BCA and CEA are successful in pulling more causal instances in Sc as compared to ECA.",
        "But, CEA has a hard time distinguishing cause from non-cause instances because it also brings the highest percentage of non-causal instances in Sc.",
        "The reason is the dependence of CEA on PMI scores of pairs of verbs and arguments to make decision for causality where PMI is not good enough to distinguish a simple correlation from an asymmetric relation of causality.",
        "However, ICA and BCA work better by placing less non-causal instances in Sc as compared with CEA.",
        "ICA and BCA also work better because by pulling more causal instances in Sc and Ac, these metrics are keeping least percentage of causal instances in S?c.",
        "Also, ICA and BCA bring more causal instances in Sc as compared with ECA by handling training data sparseness.",
        "Another important line of research is the construction of a classifier on top of the component of knowledge base for the classes of cause and non-cause relations.",
        "This allows us to evaluate our model in terms of standard evaluation measures - i.e., precision, recall and F-score.",
        "These measures can also be used to compare our model with supervised classifier depending merely on shallow contextual features with no information from the knowledge base.",

        "There are 22 such verb pairs determined by our annotator and each of these pairs contain 43% causal instances on the average.",
        "There are many factors (e.g., temporal information, arguments of verbs) which can make an instance of strongly causal verb pair non-causal.",
