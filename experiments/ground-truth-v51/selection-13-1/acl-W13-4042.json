        "In our evaluation, the resulting output is preferred over that from a baseline system that uses a simpler commenting strategy.",

        "In spontaneous speech, speakers often commit temporally, e. g. by starting utterances that they do not yet know how to complete (Clark, 1996), putting time pressure on them for the generation of a completion.",
        "While this may be for planning and efficiency reasons, it also enables them to start commenting on events for which the outcome is not yet known.",
        "For example when a ball is flying towards the goal, but it is uncertain yet whether it will hit, in sports commentary.",
        "To accommodate this incremental behaviour, human speakers plan their utterances just somewhat ahead, typically in chunks of major phrases (Levelt, 1989), and remain flexible to change or abandon the original plan, or to hesitate, e. g. to adapt their timing.",
        "This flexibility is in contrast to speech output in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) which typically generate, synthesize and deliver speech in units of full utterances that cannot be changed while ongoing, apart from being aborted or interrupted (Edlund, 2008).",
        "Recently, incremental speech synthesis (iSS) has been presented (Dutoit et al., 2011; Baumann and Schlangen, 2012b) which allows to start partial utterances that are then smoothly extended during verbalization.",
        "Incremental spoken output for dialogue systems has been shown to improve naturalness (Buschmeier et al., 2012) and Skantze and Hjalmarsson (2010) have used filled pauses to hold a turn.",
        "Dethlefs et al. (2012) present an incremental NLG strategy to reduce the need for filled pauses in interactions.",
        "We investigate the impact of incremental spoken output in a highly dynamic environment, that is, where the rate of external events is high enough to allow only few utterances to finish as planned.",
        "As an example, we choose an otherwise simple commentary domain, where incremental output enables the system to combine multiple events into one complex commenting utterance that takes into account predictions about upcoming events.",
        "If the system overcommits to the timing of future events, it autonomously uses a filled pause until more material becomes available."

        "A paradigmatic example of a domain that uses open-ended utterances is sports commentary, which has received some attention in the NLG community.",
        "For example, Chen and Mooney (2008) present a system that learns from hand-annotated data what to comment on.",
        "However, attention seems to have been placed more on truthfulness of the content, as, judging from videos provided on their website,1 the formulations that are produced are rather monotonic (?pink7 dribbles towards the goal.",
        "pink7 shoots for the goal.",
        "pink7 passes to...?).",
        "More importantly, the delivery of a produced utterance does not seem to be temporally tied to the occurrence of the event.",
        "including the car on one of its itineraries (red; another in blue).",
        "At the depicted moment we can assume that the car will take a turn, but do not know whether left or right.",
        "Repeatedly, utterances are synthesized long after the fact that they describe which sometimes has become obsolete at that point (for example, a goal is scored while the system still talks about a pass).",
        "Lohmann et al. (2011) describe another domain that can be called highly dynamic: a system that adds spoken assistance to tactile maps for the visually impaired.",
        "In their settings, users can move around on a computer representation of a map with a hand-held haptic force-feedback device.",

        "Such exploratory moves by users can become rather quick, which in the system they describe can lead to output that comes late, referring to a position that has long been left."

        "These three event types are shown in Figure 2 at time t1 (ID), t2 (turn-prep), and t3 (turn).",
        "As can be seen in the example in Figure 2, the turn-prep event enables a system that is able to incrementally update its ongoing utterance to continue speaking about the anticipated future (?and then turns?)",

        "(Thus, in contrast to (Skantze and Hjalmarsson, 2010), hesitations do not consume additional time.)",
        "By using hesitations, the system gracefully accommodates temporal overcommitment (i. e. the obligation to produce a continuation that is not fulfilled in time) which may occur, e. g. when the car drives slower than anticipated and a turn's direction is not yet known when the system needs it.",
        "In the preliminary version of iSS used for the experiments, no prosodic integration of continuations takes place, resulting in prosodic discontinuities; see (Baumann and Schlangen, 2012a) for a detailed assessment of prosodic integration in iSS.",
        "As we focus on the merit of iSS in this work, we did not implement a scene analysis/event detection nor a NLG component for the task.2 Instead, the commentary is scripted from the same configuration file that controls the car's motion on the board.",

        "To evaluate the incremental system, we compared it to a non-incremental baseline system which is unable to alter speech incrementally and hence cannot smoothly extend ongoing partial utterances.",
        "Instead, the baseline system always produces full utterances, one per event.",
        "To ensure the temporal proximity of delivery with the causing event in the baseline system, utterances can be marked as optional (in which case they are skipped if the system is still outputting a previous utterance), or non-optional (in which case an ongoing utterance is aborted in favour of the new utterance).",

        "In total, this resulted in 81 paired samples for each question.",

        "The results indicate a clear user preference for open-ended, extensible utterances that grow as events unfold.",

        "Similarly to spoken commentary in dynamic domains, conversational speech requires revisions and reactions to events such as listener feedback, or the absence thereof (Clark, 1996).",
        "Thus, we believe that our results, as well as iSS in general, also apply to a broad range of conversational SDS tasks.",
        "Finally, synthesis quality appears to be less important than interaction adequacy: we found no difference in rating of perceptual quality (?pronunciation?)",
        "between the variants, even though in isolation iSS sounded noticeably worse in the prototype.",
        "This result calls for interactive adequacy as an optimization target over (isolated) perception ratings for speech synthesis, and also challenges the use of canned speech in conversational SDSs, which does not adapt to the interaction.",
