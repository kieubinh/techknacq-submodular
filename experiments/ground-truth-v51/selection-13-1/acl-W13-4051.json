        "Even though open-domain conversational dialogue systems are required in many fields, their development is complicated because of the flexibility and variety of user utterances.",

        "The need for open-domain conversational dialogue systems continues to grow.",
        "Such systems are beginning to be actively investigated from their social and entertainment aspects (Shibata et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2012); conversational dialogues also have potential for therapy purposes and for evoking a user's unconscious requests in task-oriented dialogues (Bickmore and Cassell, 2001).",
        "However, developing open-domain conversational dialogue systems is difficult, since the huge variety of user utterances makes it harder to build knowledge resources for generating appropriate system responses.",
        "To address this issue, previous research has selected system utterances from web articles or microblogs on the basis of surface cohesion and shallow semantic coherence (Shibata et al., 2009; Jafarpour and Burges, 2010; Wong et al., 2012); however, the selected utterances sometimes contain sentences irrelevant to the user utterance since they originally appeared in a different context.",
        "To satisfy both web-scale topic coverage and suppression of irrelevant sentences, we propose a template-based approach that fills templates with words related to the topic of the user utterance and with words related to the topic-words.",
        "This approach enables us to generate a wide range of system responses when we properly extract related words.",
        "To obtain words related to topic-words, we analyzed the dependency structures of a huge number of sentences posted to such microblogs as Twitter, where a large number and variety of sentences are posted daily.",
        "This way, we can generate a variety of appropriate system responses despite wide variation in user utterances.",
        "We develop a conversational dialogue system that generates system utterances with our proposed utterance generation approach and examine its effectiveness by chat experiments with real users."

        "To generate system utterances for conversational dialogue systems, Ritter et al. (2011) proposed a statistical machine translation-based approach that considers source-reply tweet pairs as a bilingual corpus.",
        "They compared the following three approaches: IR-status, which retrieves reply tweets whose associated source tweets most resemble the user utterance (Jafarpour and Burges, 2010); IR-response, which retrieves reply tweets that are the most similar to the user utterance; and their proposed SMT-based approach, named MT-chat.",
        "They reported that MT-chat outperformed the other approaches and that IR-response was superior to IR-status.",
        "However, these approaches used only the words, and not the structures, of user utterances to generate system utterances.",
        "Yoshino et al. (2011) proposed a QA system that answers questions about current events by retrieving, from news articles, descriptions containing similar dependency structures as those of the user's questions.",
        "Although this retrieval-based approach is effective for answering the user's factual questions, it is insufficient to generate subjective utterances for conversational dialogue systems since such systems are required to introduce",
        "new topics or to respond with opinions related to user utterances."

      "text": [
        "Our topic-word-driven template-based approach consists of the following three steps: topic estimation, related word extraction, and template-filling utterance generation.",
        "We identify three types of potential topic in an input user utterance: proper nouns, common nouns, and predicates (verbs, adjectives, adjectival verbs, and verbal nouns).",
        "Proper Nouns We take the last proper noun that appears in the user's utterance as a potential topic.",
        "Since general Japanese morphological analyzers cannot capture recent proper nouns, we complement the proper noun dictionary entries with Wikipedia entries1.",
        "Common Nouns To identify potential topics from common nouns, we calculate the inverse document frequency (IDF) of each common noun (all nouns except for proper, time-related, and verbal ones) in the user's utterance.",
        "We use a corpus of microblog posts and treat each post as a document.",
        "We adopt the word with the highest IDF as a potential topic.",
        "a dependency in the highest layer of the dependency structure as a potential topic.",
        "For example, we adopt ?ask?, but not ?walk?",
        "from the utterance ?I asked the man walking on the street?.",
        "To obtain topic-related words, a thesaurus or topic model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation are the most popular approaches (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "However, these approaches return semantically similar words to input query words, which do not effectively introduce new information into the system utterances.",
        "Therefore, we count the dependencies between words in a huge number of sentences gathered from microblogs, and utilize the most frequently dependent words.",
        "This approach enables us to extract adjectives related to proper noun topics; for example, the adjectives beautiful, good, clear, white, and huge are extracted for Mt.",
        "Fuji.",
        "Since microblogs contain a huge number of subjective posts, we expect the extracted words to be subjective and suitable for conversational dialogue systems.",
        "In this work, we extract adjectives for proper and common nouns, and nouns and their case frames for predicates.",
        "Examples of extracted words are shown in Table 2.",
        "We generate two types of system utterances using manually defined templates: subjective sentences with proper nouns and common nouns; and questions with predicates and their case frames.",
        "We generate system utterances using the proper and common nouns and their related adjectives.",
        "Here, we adopt different templates for each word type; proper nouns have explicit meanings, so adjectives related to them are easily suited for any dialogue context.",
        "By contrast, since common nouns are used in various contexts in microblogs, adjectives related to common nouns may not fit the dialogue context.",
        "Thus, we use ?suki?",
        "(?like?",
        "in English), or ?nigate?",
        "(?don't like?",
        "in English) in the templates based on the proportion of positive/negative adjectives in the set of related words for a common noun topic.",
        "Table 3 shows representative examples for each type.",
        "If the system gener",
        "ates subjective utterances as the system's own impression of the dialogue topic, the user will expect the system to justify or explain its opinion; however, our system cannot answer that kind of question.",
        "Thus, we define the templates using hedges such as ?I hear that...?",
        "to avoid such questions.",
        "The number of templates for proper nouns is eight, and for common nouns is four for each polarity.",
        "Predicate-driven Question Sentence Generation We generate question sentences using predicates and their related nouns and case frames.",
        "To elicit user utterances on a particular topic, we generate How/What/Where/When types of questions as shown in Table 3.",
        "To select a question word, we use the predicate types and the classes of the related nouns.",
        "If the predicate type is adjective or adjectival noun, we select ?how?",
        "for the question word.",
        "If the predicate type is verbal noun or verb and location class words appear in the related noun phrase, we select ?where?",
