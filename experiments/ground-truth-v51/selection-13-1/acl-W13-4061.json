        "We present an online system that provides a complete web-based sandbox for creating, testing and publishing embodied conversational agents.",
        "The tool, called Roundtable, empowers many different types of authors and varying team sizes to create flexible interactions by automating many editing workflows while limiting complexity and hiding architectural concerns.",
        "Finished characters can be published directly to web servers, enabling highly interactive applications.",
        "1 Introduction To support the creation of a virtual guide system called SimCoach (Rizzo et al. 2011) designed to help military service personnel and their families understand behavioral healthcare issues and learn about support resources, a core virtual human architecture that included a new dialogue management approach was developed (Morbini et al., 2012b).",
        "SimCoach is an embodied, conversational virtual human guide delivered via the web and is supported by a flexible information state dialogue manager called FLoReS designed to support mixed initiative dialogue with conversational systems.",
        "Morbini et al. (2012a) provide a detailed description of the dialogue manager.",
        "Although FLoReS supports a wide variety of virtual human character behaviors, these must be specified in dialogue policies that must be authored manually.",
        "Initially, authoring for this dialogue manager required coding of policies using a custom programming language.",
        "Therefore significant training for content authors was neces-sary, as well as substantial support from dialogue system developers in managing resources such as training data for the language understanding sys-tem.",
        "To improve the accessibility of the system to non-technical subject matter experts and other creative staff, it became clear that additional tools were necessary.",
        "In this demonstration, we present Roundtable: a web-based authoring environment for virtual human characters that is designed for use by subject matter experts who are qualified for content authoring in targeted do-mains, but who may not possess technical skills in programming or experience in dialogue system design.",
        "2 Supporting rapid authoring of dialogue agents for the web Roundtable is a complete web-based authoring system enabling the end-to-end creation, valida-tion, testing and web publishing of virtual human characters using the SimCoach virtual human architecture.",
        "The system provides features that empower many types of authors, team sizes and makeups.",
        "The system allows an author to select from a set of preconfigured 3D character models, model the dialogue policy through behavior templates and more direct subdialogue editing, train and test the natural language understanding com-ponent, render animation performances associated with character behaviors and utterances, and test both text-based and fully animated interac-tions.",
        "Finally, the complete character dataset can be exported and deployed to a live, highly available server environment, where interaction data can be monitored and periodically collected for analysis and refinement, all from within the same browser environment (Figure 1).",
        "The entire sys-tem, from authoring to end-user interaction with",
        "At the core of the authoring application is an object-oriented information model and set of management systems that span the following roles: ?",
        "Dialogue content management, responsible for persistence, search, validation and retrieval operations of all dialogue elements including subdialogue networks; information state variables and effects; goals and effects; and dialogue action annotations that provide the mapping to the action database.",
        "?",
        "Training data management, concerned with managing training items for a data-driven natural language understanding module, as well as providing support for running regressions when updating the training set.",
        "?",
        "Action management, provides data operations for managing potentially large sets of virtual human performance-related assets, including utterance text, speech audio when not system-generated, annotated nonverbal behavior schedules, as well as non-performance actions which include web-hosted videos, digested web articles, or any arbitrary HTML effect.",
        "?",
        "Deployment management, enabling rapid deployment of locally tested characters to highly available web servers as well as review and data warehousing functions for both analytic and refinement purposes.",
        "The information model is implemented in a relational database that fully specifies, relates and allows inquiry and validation of authored infor-mation.",
        "Additionally, a complete web application programming interface (API) powers the Roundtable application, providing a transactional framework for data operations as well as user privilege enforcement, but which also allows application expansion.",
        "The information model also serves to decouple the authoring representation from the data structures necessary to drive dialogue behavior at runtime.",
        "Prior to realizing an authored character in the FLoReS engine, project dialogue data elements are exported into the format expected by the runtime target, a process that we expect to expand in the future to support different dialogue managers and language understanding configura-tions.",
        "we can synthesize audio and render animations (Figure 1d).",
        "5.",
        "Finally, we navigate to the test module, compile our character project, and are then able to chat with the new character to ensure expected behavior.",
        "At this point, the character is ready to be deployed, with its unique URL, and is immediately accessible on the web (Figure 2).",
        "4 Conclusion We described the Roundtable online authoring framework that has been designed to support non-expert users in rapidly creating embodied, conversational virtual characters of varying complexities.",
        "The tool, being web-based, requires zero configuration to get started and authored virtual characters can be deployed to In-ternet-facing web servers immediately, expanding the reach of many dialogue-driven applica-tions.",
