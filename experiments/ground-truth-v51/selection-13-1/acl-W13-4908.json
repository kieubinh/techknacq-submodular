        "Morphologically rich languages present new challenges, as the use of state of the art parsers for more configurational and non-inflected languages like English does not reach similar performance levels in languages like Basque, Greek or Turkish (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "Using morphological information as features in parsing has been a commonly used method for parsing MRLs (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).",
        "In some cases the effect of this information is positive but in others it does not help or causes a negative effect.",
        "In most of the work on dependency parsing, the specific relevance of each morphological feature in the final result is unknown.",
        "The authors include all the morphological features1 in their systems with the aim of taking advantage of the diversity of the used information.",
        "This approach commonly produces very good results but they are not always the best ones (see table 2).",
        "On the other hand, some authors have made experiments to specify which is the real impact of",

        "the morphological features.",
        "Ambati et al. (2010) explore ways of integrating local morphosyntactic features into Hindi dependency parsing.",
        "They experiment with different sets of features on a graph-based and a transition-based dependency parser.",
        "They show that using some morphological features (root, case, and suffix) outperforms a baseline using POS as the only feature, with both gold and predicted settings .",
        "Bengoetxea and Gojenola (2010) make use of MaltParser's feature configuration file to take advantage of morphological features in parsing with gold data.",
        "Their experiments show that case and subordination type considerably increase parsing accuracy.",
        "Marton et al. (2013) also explore which morphological features could be useful in dependency parsing of Arabic.",
        "They observe the effect of features by adding them one at a time separately and comparing the outcomes.",
        "Experiments showed that when gold morphology is provided, case markers help the most, whereas when the morphology is automatically predicted the outcome is the opposite: using case harms the results the most.",
        "When features are combined in a greedy heuristic, using definiteness, person, number, and gender information improves accuracy.",
        "Similarly, Seeker and Kuhn (2013) also determine that the use of case is specially relevant for parsing, demonstrating that morpho-syntactic constraints can delimit the search space of a statistical dependency parser to outperform state-of-the-art baselines for Czech, German and Hungarian.",
        "Following this line of research, our first step will be to determine which is the concrete value of each feature on dependency parsing, adding one of the morphological features at a time starting with an empty FEATS column.",

        "In their work, it is observed that moving CASE to the POS field helps with a 0.3% LAS absolute increase in the gold pipeline settings and using CASE instead of nominal POS improves the labelled accuracy by 0.3% absolute for the training set.",
        "These experiments suggest that in some way the parser is not making an optimal use of all the available morpho-syntactic information, and that the parser algorithm (or the feature specification for the learning phase) is geared towards POS and CPOS, giving a lower status to other types of information.",
        "Although this strategy is good in general, it seems that, at least for some languages, specific features (e.g. CASE) are crucial in obtaining a high parsing performance.",
        "Taking these ideas into consideration, we will work on three different approaches: ?",
        "We will experiment the effect of using only the best three morphological features in the FEATS column (see table 1), compared to working with the full set of morpho-syntactic features.",
        "This can have the effect of speeding the learning and parsing processes, as the number of features can be smaller.",
        "On the other hand, the elimination of non-relevant features can also help to improve the parser's results, because some features can even be detrimental for parsing.",
        "?",
        "Following C?etinog?lu and Kuhn (2013), once our system resolves which feature is the most significant, it will be used to replace the POS and CPOS fields one by one and we will test the effect of these variants on the parsers.",
        "Finally, we will also try right-to-left versions of those 3 variants (baseline, and replacing POS and CPOS) completing a set of 6 different parsers.",
