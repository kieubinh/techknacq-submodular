        "This paper presents our preliminary conclusions as part of an ongoing effort to construct a new dependency representation framework for Turkish.",
        "We aim for this new framework to accommodate the highly agglutinative morphology of Turkish as well as to allow the annotation of unedited web data, and shape our decisions around these considerations.",
        "In this paper, we firstly describe a novel syntactic representation for morphosyntactic sub-word units (namely inflectional groups (IGs) in Turkish) which allows inter-IG relations to be discerned with perfect accuracy without having to hide lexical information.",
        "Secondly, we investigate alternative annotation schemes for coordination structures and present a better scheme (nearly 11% increase in recall scores) than the one in Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al., 2003) for both parsing accuracies and compatibility for colloquial language."

        "In recent years, dependency parsing has globally seen great deal of attention, and has constituted the underlying framework for the syntactic parsing of many multilingual studies.",
        "Even though constituency parsing and grammars are still the preferred formalism for some well-researched languages, others may have certain traits that put constituency parsing in an unfavorable position against dependency parsing, such as flexible constituent ordering, which is typical of several prominent languages including Turkish.",
        "Although Turkish is decidedly more workable over the dependency formalism, it has invariably fallen short of usual parsing accuracies compared to other languages, as seen clearly in some recent works such as (McDonald and Nivre, 2011).",
        "There are more parameters to parsing than the formalism alone, among which the correctness of the corpora used in learning procedures and the annotation schemes of syntactic relations are held in consideration as part of this work.",
        "Between the two, the emphasis is on the annotation scheme, which is proven to significantly affect the parsing performance (Bosco et al., 2010; Boyd and Meurers, 2008).",
        "Our motivation for this research is that these factors must also contribute to some extent to the performance deficiency in parsing Turkish, besides the inherent difficulty of parsing the language.",
        "Our aim is to investigate these points and suggest improvements where applicable."

        "As our parsing framework, we use MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) which is a data-driven dependency parser with an underlying SVM learner based on LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001).",
        "MaltParser is widely used and has shown high performances across various languages (Nivre et al., 2006a).",
        "We run MaltParser with Nivre's Arc-Standard parsing algorithm (Nivre, 2003) and use the same optimized parameters as in (Eryig?it et al., 2008).",

      "text": [
        "Within the context of data-driven parsing, the most apparent problem of languages with productive derivational morphology is that words can potentially yield a very large morphological tag set, which causes severe sparsity in the morphological features of words.",
        "To alleviate this problem, words are split into morphosyntactic parts called inflectional groups (IGs), taking intermediate derivational affixes as boundaries.",
        "It is a known fact that analyzing sentences as being composed of IGs rather than surface word forms yields better results in major NLP problems such as morphological disambiguation (Hakkani-Tu?r et al., 2002) and syntactic parsing (Eryig?it et al., 2008).",
        "Within the domain of dependency parsing, IGs as syntactic tokens are not as free as independent words, since the IGs of each word must be connected to each other with an exclusive dependency relation named DERIV.",
        "However, other tokens are free to be connected to an arbitrary IG of a word, with the added benefit of more compact morphological feature sets to help make the distinction.",
        "Other languages with productive derivation, such as Uralic or Ugric languages, or those orthographically differing from the well-studied European languages, such as Semitic languages, can also benefit from using non-word-based morphosyntactic parsing tokens, as evidenced for instance by the recent considerations of splitting up tokens based on morphemes for Hebrew (Tsarfaty and Goldberg, 2008).",
        "Since MaltParser accepts input in the standard data format of the CoNLL-X Shared Task (Buch-holz and Marsi, 2006), the ways in which IGs can be represented for the parser are limited.",
        "The standard method for annotating IGs using the CoNLL-X data fields, as described in (Eryig?it et al., 2008), involves marking up the FORM and LEMMA fields with underscores rather than with lexical data as shown in",
        "rent feature vectors readily take lexical information into account, and as such, a linear transition-based parser would easily learn to connect adjacent words as IGs of the same word as long as the head word has an underscore for a stem.",
        "However, an obvious drawback is that the actual lexical information gets lost in favor of marking IGs, preventing the potential usage of that information in deciding on inter-word dependencies.",
        "As an improvement over the original IG representation described in Section 3.1.1, we propose a slightly different annotation scheme which does not lock out the lexical data columns, by making use of",
        "a new column named IG.",
        "This new column takes a boolean value that is true for non-final IGs of multi-IG words much like the original FORM column, effectively marking the dependents that must be connected to the next token in line with the dependency relation DERIV.",
        "Once this representation gets integrated, lexical information may be assigned to the FORM and LEMMA columns, of which the former gets surface lexical forms of the current stage of derivation, and the latter gets the FORM data of the previous IG."

        "relation.",
        "The elements in coordination are the conjuncts of the CS, all of which are semantically linked to a single external head.",
        "A large variety of annotation methods are employed by different corpora, as thoroughly explained in (Popel et al., 2013).",
        "We chose three schemes to compare for our parser, which are illustrated in Figure 2.",

        "III) Stanford Style, another alternative scheme in the manner of the Stanford dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008), all with a head-right configuration as per (Popel et al., 2013), as would be appropriate for the predominantly head-final Turkish.",
        "In the original Turkish Treebank, CSs are annotated as shown in scheme I in Figure 2, which appears to be problematic in several ways.",
        "This structure requires a prior conjunct to be connected to an intermediate conjunction, which in turn would be connected to a posterior conjunct, completing the coordination.",
        "The CS is then represented by the posterior conjunct, and the dependency relation between the prior conjunct and the conjunction must be identical to the dependency relation between the posterior conjunct and the external head, even if it would not semantically make sense.",
        "Considering the tokens are processed incrementally from left to right during parsing, one difficulty with this method lies in correctly guessing the dependency relation between the prior argument and the conjunction before the posterior argument and the external head are even encountered, and unsurprisingly, directional parsers fail at this task more often than usual, resulting in added recall error for many dependency relations not necessarily related to coordinations.",
        "Another problem is that the scheme requires an intermediate conjunction or punctuation to work, which cannot be relied on even for edited texts, and would fare much worse if applied on web data.",
        "One final drawback of this method is that it is arguably more confusing for human annotators compared to a straightforward method in which the arguments in coordination are directly connected."

        "Evaluating the Swedish Style representation, we observe that the CS does not depend on correctly placed conjunctions between the arguments, which increases compatibility in the absence of well-formatted sentences.",

        "In order to practically evaluate our proposed IG and coordination representations, we first took our initial data set as our baseline, and then applied certain manual and automatic transformations to the data in order to create the experimental data sets.",
        "Since all of our data were based on a training corpus without an exclusive validation set, we decided to apply 10- fold cross-validation on all of our models to better evaluate the results.",
        "For our tests on IG representations, we attempted to automatically transform our baseline corpus by populating the new IG column with boolean data derived from the IG relations in the gold-standard, and then automatically fill out the null lexical fields by an automatic morphological synthesis procedure using our morphological tool (Oflazer, 1994).",
        "The synthesis procedure, albeit a non-trivial implementation, successfully covered the majority (over 95%) of the lexical data, and we were able to manually annotate the remaining unrecognized tokens.",
        "To allow MaltParser to recognize the new fields, the CoNLL-X sentence format has been slightly adjusted and submitted as a custom input data format, and the baseline feature vector has been augmented with two extra features for the IG column information from the tokens on top of the Stack and Input pipes.",
        "The final model is named the LexedIG model.",
        "On the other hand, we needed to perform a complete selective manual review of the corpus and correct numerous annotation errors in CSs before a healthy conversion could be made.",
        "Afterwards, we ran automatic conversion routines to map all CSs to the aforementioned Swedish Style and the commonly used Stanford Style in order to compare their specific performances.",

        "Regardless, a model with lexical information for all tokens is essentially superior to a similarly performing model without such information.",
        "We foresee that being able to see lexical forms in the data would increase both the speed and the accuracy of human annotation.",

        "the web, sparse data will no longer be a significant problem, and lexical data will gain further value.",
        "A comparison of the alternative CS models with the baseline suggests that, while the manual correction itself did not cause a noticeable change, the automatic conversion procedures that it made possible resulted in significant improvements.",
        "The Swedish Style and Stanford Style models fared slightly better in the accuracy of some dependency types commonly joined in CSs such as SUBJECT, OBJECT, and DATIVE, INSTRUMENTAL and ABLATIVE.ADJUNCTs, but not always enough to warrant statistical significance.",
        "Apart from those, the largest improvement is in the COORDINATION relation itself, which had a slight drop in precision for both final models (likely due to the increased average dependency distances) but at the great benefit of the recall increasing from 53.70% to 58.68% for the Stanford Style and 64.64% for the Swedish Style."
