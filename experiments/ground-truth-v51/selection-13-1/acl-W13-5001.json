        "The purpose of an information retrieval (IR) system is to retrieve the documents relevant to user's information need expressed in the form of a query.",
        "Many information needs are event-oriented, while at the same time there exists an abundance of event-centered texts (e.g., breaking news, police reports) that could satisfy these needs.",
        "Furthermore, event-oriented information needs often involve structure that cannot easily be expressed with keyword-based queries (e.g., ?What are the countries that President Bush has visited and in which has his visit triggered protests??).",
        "Traditional IR models (Salton et al., 1975; Robertson and Jones, 1976; Ponte and Croft, 1998) rely on shallow unstructured representations of documents and queries, making no use of syntactic, semantic, or discourse level information.",
        "On the other hand, models utilizing structured event-based representations have not yet proven useful in IR.",
        "However, significant advances in event extraction have been achieved in the last decade as the result of standardization efforts (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and shared evaluation tasks (Verhagen et al., 2010), renewing the interest in structured event-based text representations.",
        "In this paper we present a novel retrieval model that relies on structured event-based representation of text and addresses event-centered queries.",
        "We define an event-oriented query as a query referring to one or more real-world events, possibly including their participants, the circumstances under which the events occurred, and the temporal relations between the events.",
        "We account for such queries by structuring both documents and queries into event graphs (Glavas?",
        "and S?najder, 2013b).",
        "The event graphs are built from individual event mentions extracted from text, capturing their protagonists, times, locations, and temporal relations.",
        "To measure the query-document similarity, we compare the corresponding event graphs using graph kernels (Borg-wardt, 2007).",
        "Experimental results on two news story collections show significant improvements over state-of-the-art keyword-based models.",
        "We also show that our models are especially suitable for retrieval from collections containing topically similar documents."

        "Most IR systems are a variant of the vector space model (Salton et al., 1975), probabilistic model (Robertson and Jones, 1976), or language model (Ponte and Croft, 1998), which do not account for associations between query terms.",

        "Our approach fits into the latter group but we represent documents as graphs of events rather than graphs of concepts.",
