        "Given a training set T and a test set S, the goal of our algorithm is to identify subset pairs Tj, Sj of T and S such that when the unsupervised parser is trained on a training subset Tj its results on its paired test subset Sj are better than when it is trained on the entire training set T. A successful application of zoomed learning improves overall performance on the full test set S. We study our algorithm's effect on the leading algorithm for the task of fully unsupervised parsing (Seginer, 2007) in three different English domains, wsj, brown and genia, and show that it improves the parser F-score by up to 4.47%."

        "Grammar induction is the task of learning grammatical structure from plain text without human supervision.",
        "The task is of great importance both for the understanding of human language acquisition and since its output can be used by NLP applications, avoiding the costly and error prone creation of manually annotated corpora.",
        "Many recent works have addressed the task (e.g. (Klein and Manning, 2004; Seginer, 2007; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Headden et al., 2009)) and its importance has increased due to the recent availability of huge corpora.",
        "A basic challenge to this research direction is how to utilize training data in the best possible way.",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) report results for their dependency model with valence (DMV) for unsupervised dependency parsing when it is trained and tested on the same corpus (both when sentence length restriction is imposed, such as for WSJ 10, and when it is not, such as for the entire wsj).",
        "Today's best unsupervised dependency parsers, which are rooted in this model, train on short sentences only: both Headen et al., (2009) and Cohen and Smith (2009) train on WSJ10 even when the test set includes longer sentences.",
        "Recently, Spitkovsky et al., (2010) demonstrated that training the DMV model on sentences of up to 15 words length yields better results on the entire section 23 of WSJ (with no sentence length restriction) than training with the entire WSJ corpus.",
        "In contrast to these dependency models, the Seginer constituency parser achieves its best performance when trained on the entire wsj corpus either if sentence length restriction is imposed on the test corpus or not.",
        "The sentence length restriction training protocol of (Spitkovsky et al., 2010), harms this parser.",
        "When the parser is trained with the entire WSJ corpus its F-score performance on the wsj10, wsj20 and the entire wsj corpora are 76, 64.8 and 56.7 respectively.",
        "When training is done with wsj10 (wsj20) performance degrades to 60 (72.2), 37.4 (61.9) and 29.7 (48) respectively.",
        "In this paper we introduce the Zoomed Learning (ZL) technique for unsupervised parser training: given a training set T and a test set S, it identifies subset pairs Tj, Si of T and S such that when the unsupervised parser is trained on a training subset Ti its results on its paired test subset Si are better than when it is trained on the entire training set T. A successful application of zoomed learning improves performance on the full test set S.",
        "We describe ZL algorithms of increasing sophistication.",
        "In the simplest algorithm the subsets are randomly selected while in the more sophisticated versions subset selection is done using a fully unsupervised measure of constituency parse tree quality.",
        "We apply ZL to the Seginer parser, the best algorithm for fully unsupervised constituency parsing.",
        "The input is a plain text corpus without any annotation, not even PoS tagging, and the output is an unlabeled bracketing for each sentence.",
        "We experiment in three different English domains: wsj (economic newspaper), genia (biological articles) and brown (heterogeneous domains), and show that ZL improves the parser F-score by as",
        "Unsupervised parsing has attracted researchers for over a quarter of a century (see (Clark, 2001; Klein, 2005) for reviews).",
        "In recent years efforts have been made to evaluate the algorithms on manually annotated corpora such as the WSJ PennTreebank.",
        "Recent works on unlabeled bracketing or dependencies induction include (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein above use PoS tag sequences, created either manually or by a supervised algorithm, as input.",
        "The only exception is Seginer's parser, which induces bracketing from plain text.",
        "Our confidence-based ZL algorithms use the pupa unsupervised parsing quality score (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009b).",
        "As far as we know, pupa is the only unsupervised quality assessment algorithm for syntactic parsers that has been proposed.",
        "Combining pupa with Seginer's parser thus preserves the fully unsupervised nature of the task.",
        "Quality assessment of a learning algorithm's output has been addressed for supervised algorithms (see (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006) for a survey) and specifically for supervised syntactic parsing (Yates et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007; Ravi et al., 2008; Kawahara and Uchimoto, 2008).",
        "All these algorithms are based on manually annotated data and thus do not preserve the unsupervised nature of the task addressed in this paper.",
        "We experiment with the Seginer parser for two reasons.",
        "First, this is the best algorithm for the task of fully unsupervised parsing which motivates us to improve its performance.",
        "Second, this is the only publicly available unsupervised parser that induces constituency trees.",
        "The pupa score we use in our confidence-based algorithms is applicable for constituency trees only.",
        "When additional constituency parsers will be made available, we will test ZL with them as well.",
        "Interestingly, the results reported for other constituency models (the CCM model (Klein and Manning, 2002) and the U-DOP model (Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b)) are reported when the parser is trained on its test corpus even if the sentences is that corpus are of bounded length (e.g. wsj 10).",
        "This raises the question if using more training data (e.g. the entire wsj) wisely can enhance these models.",
        "Recently, Spitkovsky et al., (2010) proposed three approaches for improvement of unsupervised grammar induction by considering the complexity of the training data.",
        "The approaches have been applied to the DMV unsupervised dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2004) and improved its performance.",
        "One of these approaches is to train the model with sentences whose length is up to 15 words.",
        "As noted above, such a training protocol fails to improve the performance of the Seginer parser.",
        "The other approaches in that paper, bootstrapping via iterated learning of increasingly longer sentences and a combination of the bootstrapping and the short sentences approaches, are not directly applicable to the Seginer parser since its training method cannot be trivially bootstrapped with parses created in former steps (Seginer, 2007).",
        "Related machine learning methods.",
        "ZL is related to ensemble methods.",
        "Both ZL and such methods produce multiple learners, each of them trained on a different subset of the training data, and decide which learner to use for a particular test instance.",
        "Bagging (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Freund and Schapire, 1996), where the experts utilize the same learning algorithm and differ in the sample of the training data they use for its training, were applied to supervised parsing (Henderson and Brill, 2000; Becker and Osborne, 2005).",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the connection of ZL to boosting.",
        "Owing to the fact that ZL produces different learners, it is natural to use it in conjunction with an ensemble method, which is what we do in this paper with our EZL model (Section 3).",
        "ZL is also related to active learning (AL) (Cohn and Ladner, 1994).",
        "AL also uses training subset selection, with the goal of obtaining a faster learning curve for an algorithm.",
        "AL is done in supervised settings, usually in order to minimize human annotation costs.",
        "AL algorithms providing faster learning than random subset selection for parsing have been proposed (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009a; Hwa, 2004).",
        "However, we are not aware of AL applications in which the overall performance on the test set has been improved.",
        "In addition, our application here is to an unsupervised problem.",
        "Algorithms that utilize unsupervised clustering for class decomposition in order to improve classifiers' performance (e.g. (Vilalta and Rish, 2003)) are related to ZL.",
        "In such methods, examples that belong to the same class are clustered, and the induced clusters are considered as separate classes.",
        "These methods, however, have been applied only to supervised classification in contrast to our work that addresses unsupervised structured learning.",
        "Moreover, after class decomposition a classifier is trained with the entire training data while the subsets identified by a ZL algorithm are parsed by a parser trained only with the sentences they contain."

        "Zoomed Learning proposes that performance on a particular test instance might improve if training is done on a proper subset of the training set.",
        "The ZL view is clearly applicable when the training data is comprised of subsets originating from different sources having different natures.",
        "If the test data is also similarly composed, performance on any particular test instance might improve if training is done on a training subset coming from the same source.",
        "However, even when the training and test data are from the same source, a ZL algorithm may capture fine differences between subsets.",
        "The ZL idea is therefore related to the notions of in-domain and out-of-domain (domain adaptation).",
        "In the former, the training and test data are assumed to originate from the same domain.",
        "In the latter, the test data comes from a different domain, and therefore has different statistics from the training data.",
        "Indeed, the performance of NLP algorithms in domain adaptation scenarios is markedly lower than in in-domain ones (McClosky et al., 2006).",
        "ZL takes this observation to the extreme, assuming that a similar situation might exist even in indomain scenarios.",
        "After all, a 'domain' is only a coarse qualification of the nature of a data set.",
        "In NLP, a domain is usually specified as the genre of the text involved (e.g., 'newspapers').",
        "However, there are additional axes that might influence the statistics obtained from training data, e.g., the syntactic nature of sentences.",
        "This section presents our ZL algorithms.",
        "We start with the simplest possible ZL algorithm where the subsets are randomly selected.",
        "We then describe ZL algorithms based on quality-based parse selection.",
        "We first detail a basic version and then an extended version consisting of another level of parse selection.",
        "Finally, we briefly discuss the PUPA quality measure that we use to evaluate the quality ofa parse tree.",
        "In all versions of the algorithm the input consists of a set T of N training sentences, a set S ç T of test sentences, and an integer number NH < N.",
        "Zoomed Learning with Random Selection (rzl).",
        "The simplest ZL algorithm randomly assigns each of the training sentences to one of n sets (n = 2 in this paper).",
        "More explicitly, the set number is drawn from a uniform distribution on {1, 2,... n}.",
        "Each set is then parsed by a parser that is trained only with the sentences contained in that set.",
        "The intuition behind this algorithm is that different sets of sentences are likely to manifest different syntactic patterns.",
        "Consequently, the best way to learn the syntactic patterns of any given set of sentences might be to train the parser on the sentences contained in the set.",
        "While simple, in Section 5 it is shown to improve the performance of the Seginer parser.",
        "The Basic Quality-Based Algorithm (bzl).",
        "The idea of the basic ZL algorithm is that sentences for which the parser provides low quality parses manifest different syntactic patterns than the sentences for which the parser provides high quality parses.",
        "The main challenge is therefore to estimate the quality of the produced parses without supervision.",
        "The algorithm has three stages.",
        "In the first, we create the fully-trained model by training the parser using all of the N sentences of T. We then parse these N sentences using the fully-trained model.",
        "In the second, we compute a parse confidence score for each of the N sentences, based on the N parses produced in the first stage.",
        "We divide the training sentences to two subsets: a high quality subset H consisting of the top scored NH sentences, and a lower quality subset L consisting of the other NL = N – NH sentences.",
        "As is common practice for this problem (Klein and Manning, 2004; Seginer, 2007), the test set is contained in the training set.",
        "This methodology is a valid one because the training set is unannotated.",
        "Our test set is thus naturally divided into two subsets, a high quality subset HT consisting of the test set sentences contained in H and a lower quality subset LT consisting of the test set sentences contained in L.",
        "In the third stage, each of the test subsets is parsed by a model trained only on its corresponding training subset.",
        "This stage is motivated by our assumption that the high and low quality subsets manifest dissimilar syntactic patterns, and consequently the statistics of the parser's parameters suitable for one subset differ from those suitable for another.",
        "We compute the confidence score in the second stage using the unsupervised pupa algorithm (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009b).",
        "POS tags for it are induced using the fully unsupervised algorithm of Clark (2003).",
        "The parser we experiment with is the incremental parser of Seginer (2007), whose input consists of raw sentences and does not include any kind of supervised POS tags (created either manually or by a supervised algorithm).",
        "Consequently, our algorithm is fully unsupervised.",
        "The only parameter it has is NH but ZL improves parser performance for most NH values.",
        "bzl is related to boosting.",
        "In boosting after training one member of the ensemble, examples are re-weighted such that examples that are classified correctly are down-weighted.",
        "bzl does something sim-",
        "ilar: it uses pupa to estimate which sentences are given high quality parse trees, and down-weights examples with high (low) pupa score to 0 when training the L-trained (H-trained) model.",
        "However, in boosting the entire test set is annotated by the same learning model, while ZL parses each test subset with a model trained on its corresponding training subset.",
        "The Extended Quality-Based Algorithm (ezl).",
        "The basic algorithm produces an ensemble of two parsing experts: the one trained on H and the one trained on L. It uses the ensemble to parse the test set by applying the H-trained expert to HT and the L-trained expert to LT.",
        "Naturally, there are other ways to utilize the ensemble to parse the test set.",
        "In addition, even if parse trees generated by the experts are better with high probability than those of the fully trained parser, they are not guaranteed to be so.",
        "The fully trained parser is therefore also a valuable member in the ensemble.",
        "Consequently, we introduce an extended zoomed learning algorithm (ezl).",
        "The extended version is implemented as a final fourth stage of the previously described basic algorithm.",
        "In this stage, the two test subsets are parsed by the fully trained parsing model, in addition to being parsed by the zooming parsing models.",
        "We now have two parses for each test sentence s: PZ(s), the parse created by a parser trained with the sentences contained in its corresponding training subset, and PF(s), created by the fully trained parser.",
        "For each of the two parses of each test sentence, a confidence score is computed by pupa.",
        "As will be reviewed below, pupa uses a set of parsed sentences to compute the statistics on which its scores are based.",
        "Therefore, there are two sources for a difference between the scores ofthe two parse trees ofa given test sentence: the difference between the trees themselves, and the difference between the parses of the other sentences in the set.",
        "The pupa score for PZ(s) is computed using the parses created for the sentences contained in the test subset of s by a parser trained with the corresponding training subset.",
        "The pupa score for PF (s) is computed using the parses created for the entire test set by the fully trained parser.",

        "In the second and fourth stages of the confidence-based algorithms, an unsupervised confidence score is computed for each of the induced parse trees.",
        "The confidence score algorithm we use is the POS-based Unsupervised Parse Assessment (pupa) algorithm (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009b).",
        "We provide here abrief description of this algorithm.",
        "The input to pupa is a set I of parsed sentences, and its output consists of a confidence score in [0,1] assigned to each sentence in I.",
        "The pupa algorithm collects statistics of the syntactic structures (parse tree constituents) contained in the set I of parsed sentences.",
        "The constituent representation is based on the POS tags of the words in the yield of the constituent and of the words in the yields of neighboring constituents.",
        "We follow Reichart and Rappoport (2009b) and induce the POS tags using the fully unsupervised POS induction algorithm of Clark (2003).",
        "The algorithm then goes over each individual tree in the set I and scores it according to the collected statistics The pupa algorithm is guided by the idea that syntactic structures that are frequently created by the parser are more likely to be correct than structures the parser produces less frequently.",
        "Therefore, constituents that are more frequent in the set I receive higher scores after proper regularization is applied to prevent potential biases.",
        "The tree score is a combination of the scores of its constituents.",
        "Full details of the pupa algorithm are given in (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009b).",

        "Integration of the experimental results for zoomed learning with the three selection methods: random, confidence-based and oracle-based leads to an important conclusion that should guide future research.",
        "The more accurate the confidence score used by the zoomed learning algorithm, the more substantial is the performance improvement for the low quality test subset, at the cost of more substantial degradation in the performance on the high quality subset (but recall the different genia pattern which should be further explored).",
