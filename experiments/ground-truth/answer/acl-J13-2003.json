        "The view postulates that metaphor is not limited to similarity-based meaning extensions of individual words, but rather involves reconceptualization of a whole area of experience in terms of another.",

        "She found that verbs account for around 50% of the data, the rest being shared by nouns, adjectives, adverbs, copula constructions, and multi-word metaphors.",
        "This suggests that verb metaphors provide a reliable testbed for both linguistic and computational experiments.",
        "Restricting the scope to verbs is a methodological step aimed at testing the main principles of the proposed approach in a well-defined setting.",
        "We would, however, expect the presented methods to scale to other parts of speech and to a wide range of syntactic constructions, because they rely on techniques from computational lexical semantics that have been shown to be effective in modeling not only verb meanings, but also those of nouns and adjectives.",
        "As opposed to previous approaches that modeled metaphorical reasoning starting from a hand-crafted description and applying it to explain the data, we aim to design a statistical model that captures regular patterns of metaphoricity in a large corpus and thus generalizes to unseen examples.",

        "This conventionality is reflected in the data in that such verbs are frequently used in their ?metaphorical?",
        "contexts.",
        "As a result, they are clustered together with literally used terms.",
        "For instance, the verb tackle is found in a cluster with solve, resolve, handle, confront, face, and so forth.",
        "This results in the system tagging ?resolve a problem?",

        "Sun and Korhonen's (2009) method performs hard clustering, that is, it does not distinguish between different word senses.",

        "They tend to belong to the same semantic domain, however (e.g., verbs of dealing with LIQUIDS, verbs describing a FIGHT) It is the diversity of verb meanings within the domain cluster that allows the generalization from a limited number of seed expressions to a broader spectrum of previously unseen and novel metaphors, non-synonymous with those in the seed set.",

        "In addition, because the current system was only tested with very few seeds (again, due to the lack of metaphor-annotated data), we expect the current overall recall of the system to be relatively low.",
        "In order to obtain a full coverage of the corpus, a large and representative seed set is necessary.",
        "Although it is hard to capture the whole variety of metaphorical language in a limited set of examples, it is possible to compile a seed set representative of all common source?target domain mappings.",

        "As is the case in metaphor identification, the majority of existing approaches to metaphor interpretation also rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge (Martin 1990; Fass 1991; Narayanan 1997, 1999; Barnden and Lee 2002; Feldman and Narayanan 2004; Agerri et al. 2007) and produce interpretations in a non-textual format (Veale and Hao 2008).",
        "The ultimate objective of automatic metaphor processing, however, is a type of interpretation that can be directly embedded into other systems to enhance their performance.",
        "We thus define metaphor interpretation as a paraphrasing task and build a system that automatically derives literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text.",
        "Our method is also distinguished from previous work in that it does not rely on any hand-crafted knowledge aboutmetaphor, but in contrast is corpus-based and uses automatically induced selectional preferences.",
        "The metaphor paraphrasing task can be divided into two subtasks: (1) generating paraphrases, that is, other ways of expressing the same meaning in a given context, and (2) discriminating between literal and metaphorical paraphrases.",
        "Consequently, the proposed approach is theoretically grounded in two ideas underlying each of these subtasks:",
        "The meaning of a word in context emerges through interaction with the meaning of the words surrounding it.",
        "This assumption is widely accepted in lexical semantics theory (Pustejovsky 1995; Hanks and Pustejovsky 2005) and has been exploited for lexical acquisition (Schulte im Walde 2006; Sun and Korhonen 2009).",
        "It suggests that the context itself imposes",
        " certain semantic restrictions on the words which can occur within it.",
        "Given a large amount of linguistic data, it is possible to model these semantic restrictions in probabilistic terms (Lapata 2001).",
        "This can be done by deriving a ranking scheme for possible paraphrases that fit or do not fit in a specific context based on word co-occurrence evidence.",
        "This is how initial paraphrases are generated within the metaphor paraphrasing module.",
        "Literalness can be detected via strong selectional preference.",
        "This idea is a mirror-image of the selectional preference violation view of Wilks (1978), who suggested that a violation of selectional preferences indicates a metaphor.",
        "The key information that selectional preferences provide is whether there is an association between the predicate and its potential argument and how strong that association is.",
        "A literal paraphrase would normally come from the target domain (e.g., ?understand the explanation?)",
        "and be strongly associated with the target concept, whereas a metaphorical paraphrase would belong to the source domain (e.g., ?grasp the explanation?)",
        "and be associated with the concepts from this source domain more strongly than with the target concept.",
        "Hence we use a selectional preference model to measure the semantic fit of the generated paraphrases into the given context as opposed to all other contexts.",
        "The highest semantic fit then indicates the most literal paraphrase.",
        "Thus the context-based probabilistic model is used for paraphrase generation and the selectional preference model for literalness detection.",
        "The key difference between the two models is that the former favors the paraphrases that co-occur with the words in the context more frequently than other paraphrases do, and the latter favors the paraphrases that co-occur with the words from the context more frequently than with any other lexical items in the corpus.",
        "This is the main intuition behind our approach.",
        "The system thus incorporates the following components: a context-based probabilistic model that acquires paraphrases for metaphorical expressions from a large corpus; a WordNet similarity component that filters out the irrelevant paraphrases based on their similarity to the metaphorical term (similarity is defined as sharing a common hypernym within three levels in the WordNet hierarchy); a selectional preference model that discriminates literal paraphrases from the metaphorical ones.",
        "It re-ranks the paraphrases, de-emphasizing the metaphorical ones and emphasizing the literal ones.",
        "In addition, the system disambiguates the sense of the paraphrases using the WordNet inventory of senses.",
        "The context-based model together with the WordNet filter constitute a metaphor paraphrasing baseline.",
        "By comparing the final system to this baseline, we demonstrate that simple context-based substitution, even supplied by extensive knowledge contained in lexical resources, is not sufficient for metaphor interpretation and that a selectional preference model is needed to establish the literalness of the paraphrases.",
        "Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing This section first provides an overview of paraphrasing and lexical substitution and relates these tasks to the problem of metaphor interpretation.",

        "Paraphrasing by replacing individual words in a sentence is known as lexical substitution (McCarthy 2002).",
        "Because, in this article, we address the phenomenon of metaphor at a single-word level, our task is close in nature to lexical substitution.",
        "The task of lexical substitution originates from word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "The key difference between the two is that whereas WSD makes use of a predefined sense-inventory to characterize the meaning of a word in context, lexical substitution is aimed at automatic induction of meanings.",
        "Thus the goal of lexical substitution is to generate the set of semantically valid substitutes for the word.",

        "Both sentence-or phrase-level paraphrasing and lexical substitution find a wide range of applications in NLP.",
        "These include summarization (Knight and Marcu 2000; Zhou et al. 2006), information extraction (Shinyama and Sekine 2003), machine translation (Kurohashi 2001; Callison-Burch, Koehn, and Osborne 2006), text simplification (Carroll et al. 1999), question answering (McKeown 1979; Lin and Pantel 2001) and textual entailment (Sekine et al. 2007).",

        " MT.",
        "A number of approaches to lexical substitution rely on manually constructed thesauri to find sets of candidate synonyms (McCarthy and Navigli 2007), whereas others address the task in a fully unsupervised fashion.",
        "In order to derive and rank candidate substitutes, the latter systems make use of distributional similarity measures (Pucci et al. 2009; McCarthy, Keller, and Navigli 2010), vector space models of word meaning (De Cao and Basili 2009; Erk and Pado?",
        "2009) or statistical learning techniques, such as hidden Markov models and n-grams (Preiss, Coonce, and Baker 2009).",
        "The metaphor interpretation task is different from the WSD task, because it is impossible to predefine a set of senses of metaphorical words, in particular for novel metaphors.",
        "Instead, the correct substitute for the metaphorical term needs to be generated in a data-driven manner, as for lexical substitution.",
        "The metaphor paraphrasing task, however, also differs from lexical substitution in the following two ways.",
        "Firstly, a suitable substitute needs to be used literally in the target context, or at least more conventionally than the original word.",
        "Secondly, by definition, the substitution is not required to be a synonym of the metaphorical word.",
        "Moreover, for our task this is not even desired, because there is the danger that synonymous paraphrasing may result in another metaphorical expression, rather than the literal interpretation of the original one.",
        "Metaphor paraphrasing therefore presents an additional challenge in comparison to lexical substitution, namely, that of discriminating between literal and metaphorical substitutes.",

        "The 1980s and 1990s provided us with a wealth of ideas on the structure and mechanisms of metaphor.",
        "The computational approaches formulated back then are still highly influential, although their use of task-specific hand-coded knowledge is becoming increasingly less popular.",
        "The last decade witnessed a significant technological leap in natural language computation, whereby manually crafted rules gradually gave way to more robust corpus-based statistical methods.",
        "This is also the case for metaphor research.",
        "In this article, we presented the first integrated statistical system for metaphor processing in unrestricted text.",
        "Our method is distinguished from previous work in that it does not rely on anymetaphor-specific hand-coded knowledge (besides the seed set in the identification experiments), operates on open-domain text, and produces interpretations in textual format.",
        "The system, consisting of independent metaphor identification and paraphrasing modules, operates with a high precision (0.79 for identification, 0.81 for paraphrasing, and 0.67 as an integrated system).",
        "Although the system has been tested only on verb?subject and verb?object metaphors at this stage, the described identification and paraphrasing methods should be similarly applicable to a wider range of syntactic constructions.",
        "This expectation rests on the fact that both distributional",
        "Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen Statistical Metaphor Processing clustering and selectional preference induction techniques have been shown to model the meanings of a range of word classes (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Boleda Torrent and Alonso i Alemany 2003; Brockmann and Lapata 2003; Zapirain, Agirre, and Ma`rquez 2009).",
        "Extending the system to deal with metaphors represented by other word classes and constructions as well as multi-word metaphors is part of future work.",
        "Such an extension of the identification system would require the creation of a seed set exemplifying more syntactic constructions and the corpus search over further grammatical relations (e.g., verb?prepositional phrase [PP] complement relations: ?Hillary leapt in the conversation;?",
        "adjectival modifier?noun relations ?slippery mind, deep unease, heavy loss;?",
        "noun?PP complement relations: ?a fraction of self-control, a foot of a mountain;?",
        "verb?VP complement relations: ?aching to begin the day;?",
        "and copula constructions: ?Death is the sorry end of the human story, not a mysterious prelude to a new one?).",
        "Besides noun and verb clustering, it would also be necessary to perform clustering of adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Clusters of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and concrete nouns would then represent source domains within the model.",
        "The data study of Shutova and Teufel (2010) suggested that it is sometimes difficult to choose the optimal level of abstraction of domain categories that would generalize well over the data.",
        "Although the system does not explicitly assign any domain labels, its domain representation is still restricted by the fixed level of generality of source concepts, defined by the chosen cluster granularity.",
        "To relax this constraint, one could attempt to automatically optimize cluster granularity to fit the data more accurately and to ensure that the generated clusters explain themetaphorical expressions in the data more comprehensively.",
        "A hierarchical clustering algorithm, such as that of Yu, Yu, and Tresp (2006) or Sun andKorhonen (2011), could be used for this purpose.",
        "Besides this, it would be desirable to be able to generalize metaphorical associations learned from one type of syntactic construction across all syntactic constructions, without providing explicit seed examples for the latter.",
        "For instance, given the seed phrase ?stir excitement,?",
        "representing the conceptual mapping FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS, the system should be able to discover not only that phrases such as ?swallow anger?",
        "are metaphorical, but that phrases such as ?ocean of happiness?",
        "are as well.",
        "The extension of the paraphrasing system to other syntactic constructions would involve the extraction of further grammatical relations from the corpus, such as those listed herein, and their incorporation into the context-based paraphrase selectionmodel.",
        "Extending both the identification system and the paraphrasing system would require the application of the selectional preference model to other word classes.",
        "Although Resnik's selectional association measure has been used to model selectional preferences of verbs for their nominal arguments, it is in principle a generalizable measure of word association.",
        "Information-theoretic word association measures (e.g., mutual information [Church and Hanks 1990]) have been continuously successfully applied to a range of syntactic constructions in a number of NLP tasks (Hoang, Kim, and Kan 2009; Baldwin and Kim 2010).",
        "This suggests that applying a distributional association measure, such as the one proposed by Resnik, to other part-of-speech classes should still result in a realistic model of semantic fitness, which in our terms corresponds to a measure of ?literalness?",
        "of the paraphrases.",
        "In addition, the selectional preference model can be improved by using an SP acquisition algorithm that can handle word sense ambiguity (e.g., Rooth et al. 1999; O?",
        "Se?aghdha 2010; Reisinger and Mooney 2010).",
        "The current approach relies on SP classes produced by hard clustering and fails to accurately model word senses of generally polysemous words.",
        "This resulted in a number of errors in metaphor paraphrasing and it therefore needs to be addressed in the future.",
        " The current version of the metaphor paraphrasing system still relies on some hand-coded knowledge in the form of WordNet.",
        "WordNet has been criticized for a lack of consistency, high granularity of senses, and negligence with respect to some important semantic relations (Lenat, Miller, and Yokoi 1995).",
        "In addition, WordNet is a general-domain resource, which is less suitable if one wanted to apply the system to domain-specific data.",
        "For all of these reasons it would be preferable to develop a WordNet-free fully automated approach to metaphor resolution.",
        "Vector space models of word meaning (Erk 2009; Rudolph and Giesbrecht 2010; Van de Cruys, Poibeau, and Korhonen 2011) might provide a solution, as they have proved efficient in general paraphrasing and lexical substitution settings (Erk and Pado?",
        "2009).",
        "The feature similarity component of the paraphrasing system that is currently based on WordNet could be replaced by such a model.",
        "Another crucial problem that needs to be addressed is the coverage of the identification system.",
        "To enable high usability of the system it is necessary to perform high-recall processing.",
        "One way to improve the coverage is the creation of a larger, more diverse seed set.",
        "Although it is hardly possible to describe the whole variety of metaphorical language, it is possible to compile a set representative of (1) all most common source?target domain mappings and (2) all types of syntactic constructions that exhibit metaphoricity.",
        "The existing metaphor resources, primarily the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991), and examples from the linguistic literature about metaphor, could be a sensible starting point on a route to such a data set.",
        "Having a diverse seed set should enable the identification system to attain a broad coverage of the corpus.",
