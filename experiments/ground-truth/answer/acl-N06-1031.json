        "Recent work in statistical machine translation (MT) has sought to overcome the limitations of phrase-based models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by making use of syntactic information.",
        "Syntax-based MT offers the potential advantages of enforcing syntax-motivated constraints in translation and capturing long-distance/non-contiguous dependencies.",
        "Some approaches have used syntax at the core (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Hearne and Way, 2003; Melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (Xia and McCord, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Collins et al., 2005; Quirk et al., 2005).",
        "In this work, we employ a syntax-based model that applies a series of tree/string (xRS) rules (Galley et al., 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004) to a source language string to produce a target language phrase structure tree.",
        "Figure 1 exemplifies the translation process, which is called a derivation, from Chinese into English.",

        "is shown at the top left.",
        "Rule 01 replaces the Chinese word (shaded) with the English NP-C police.",
        "Rule (2) then builds a VP over the NP-C sequence.",
        "Next, is translated as the NP-C the gunman by rule T. Finally, rule combines the sequence of NP-C VP.",
        "into an S, denoting a complete tree.",
        "The yield of this tree gives the target translation: the gunman was killed by police.",
        "The Penn English Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) is our source of syntactic information, largely due to the availability of reliable parsers.",
        "It is not clear, however, whether this resource is suitable, as is, for the task of MT.",
        "In this paper, we argue that the overly-general tagset of the PTB is problematic for MT because it fails to capture important grammatical distinctions that are critical in translation.",
        "As a solution, we propose methods of relabeling the syntax trees that effectively improve translation quality.",
        "Consider the derivation in Figure 2.",
        "The output translation has two salient errors: determiner/noun number disagreement (*this Turkish positions) and auxiliary/verb tense disagreement (*has demonstrate).",
        "The first problem arises because the DT tag, which does not distinguish between singular and plural determiners, allows singular this to be used with plural NNS positions.",
        "In the second problem, the VP-C tag fails to communicate that it is headed by the base verb (VB) demonstrate, which should prevent it from being used with the auxiliary VBZ has.",
        "Information-poor tags like DT and VP-C can be relabeled to encourage more fluent translations, which is the thrust of this paper.",

        "This paper focuses on step 1, in which the original English parse trees are transformed by one or more relabeling strategies.",
        "Step 2 involves extracting minimal xRS rules (Galley et al., 2004) from the set of string/tree/alignments triplets.",
        "These rules are then used in a CKY-type parser-decoder to translate the 878-sentence 2002 NIST MT evaluation test set (step 3).",
