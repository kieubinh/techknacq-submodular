        "This extension has made event extraction more widely applicable in many NLP tasks including cross-lingual document retrieval (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007) and question answering (Schiffman et al., 2007).",
        "Various supervised learning approaches have been explored for ACE multilingual event extraction (e.g. Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006; Hardy et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2008; Chen and Ji, 2009).",
        "All of these previous literatures showed that one main bottleneck of event extraction lies in low recall.",
        "It's a challenging task to recognize the different forms in which an event may be expressed, given the limited amount of training data.",
        "The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of a bilingual (English and Chinese) state-of-the-art event extraction system without accessing its internal algorithms or annotating additional data.",
        "As for a separate research theme, extensive techniques have been used to produce word clusters or paraphrases from large unlabeled corpora (Brown et al., 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Lee and Pereira, 1999, Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Pang et al., 2003).",
        "For example, (Bannard and Callison-Burch, method to extract paraphrases from largely available bilingual corpora.",
        "The resulting clusters contain words with similar semantic information and therefore can be useful to augment a small amount of annotated data.",
        "We will automatically extract cross-lingual predicate clusters using two different approaches based on bilingual parallel corpora and cross-lingual IE respectively; and then use the derived clusters to improve event extraction.",
        "We propose a new learning method called inductive learning to exploit the derived predicate clusters.",
        "For each test document, a background document is constructed by gradually replacing the low-confidence events with the predicates in the same cluster.",
        "Then we conduct cross-document inference technique as described in (Ji and Grishman, 2008) to improve the performance of event extraction.",
        "This inductive learning approach matches the procedure of human knowledge acquisition and foreign language education: analyze information from specific examples and then discover a pattern or draw a conclusion; attempt synonyms to convey/learn the meaning of an intricate word.",

        "We start from two different approaches to extract cross-lingual predicate clusters, based on parallel corpora and cross-lingual IE techniques respectively.",
        "In the first approach, we take use of the 852 Chinese event trigger words in ACE05 training corpora as our 'anchor set'.",
        "For each Chinese trigger, we search its automatically aligned English words from a Chinese-English parallel corpus including 50,000 sentence pairs (part of Global Autonomous Language Exploitation Y3 Machine Translation training corpora) to construct an English predicate cluster.",
        "The word alignment was obtained by running Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "In each cluster we record the frequency of each unique English word.",
        "Then we conduct the same procedure in the other direction to construct Chinese predicate clusters anchored by English triggers.",
        "State-of-the-art Chinese-English word alignment error rate is about 40% (Deng and Byrne, 2005).",
        "Therefore the resulting cross-lingual clusters include a lot of word alignment errors.",
        "In order to address this problem, we filter the clusters by only keeping those predicates including the original predicate forms in ACE training data or English/Chinese Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2009).",
        "Based on the intuition that Machine Translation (MT) may translate a Chinese trigger word into different English words in different contexts, we employ the second approach using cross-lingual IE techniques (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007) on TDT5 Chinese corpus to generate more clusters.",
        "We apply the following two cross-lingual IE pipelines:",
        "Chinese IE_MT: Apply Chinese IE on the Chinese texts to get a set of Chinese triggers ch-trigger-set1, and then use word alignments to translate (project) ch-trigger-set1 into a set of English triggers en trigger-set1; MT English IE: Translate Chinese texts into English, and then apply English IE on the translated texts to get a set of English triggers en-trigger-set2.",
        "For any Chinese trigger ch-trigger in ch-trigger-set1, if its corresponding translation en-trigger in en-trigger-set1 is the same as that in en-trigger-set2, then we add en-trigger into the cluster anchored by ch-trigger.",
        "We apply the English and Chinese IE systems as described in (Grishman et al., 2005; Chen and Ji, 2009).",
        "Both cross-lingual IE pipelines need machine translation to translate Chinese documents (for English IE) or project the extraction results from Chinese IE into English.",
        "We use the RWTH Aachen Chinese-to-English statistical phrase-based machine translation system (Zens and Ney, 2004) for these purposes.",
        "Applying the above two approaches we obtained 438 English predicate clusters and 543 Chinese predicate clusters.",
        "For example, for a trigger \"^(injure)\", we can get the following two predicate clusters with their frequency in the parallel corpora:",
        "{injured:99 injuries:96 injury:76 wounded:38 wounding:28 injuring:14 wounds:7 killed:4 died:2 mutilated:] casualties:] chop:1 killing:] shot:]}.",
        "We can see that the predicates in the same cluster are not restrictedly synonyms, but they were generated as alternative translations for the same word and therefore represent similar meanings.",
        "More importantly, these triggers vary from very common ones such as 'injured' to rare words such as 'mutilate'.",
        "This indicates how these clusters can aid extracting low-confidence events: when deciding whether a word 'mutilate' indicates a \"Life-",
        "Injure\" event in a certain context, we can replace it with other predicates in the same cluster and may provide us more reliable overall evidence.",
        "We can see that most clusters include 2-9 predicates in both English and Chinese.",
        "However on average English clusters include more predicates.",
        "In addition, there are many more singletons in Chinese (232) than in English (101).",
        "This indicates that Chinese event triggers are more ambiguous.",
        "5 Motivation of Using Cross-lingual Clusters for Event Extraction",
        "After extracting cross-lingual predicate clusters, we can combine the evidence from all the predicates in each cluster to adjust the probabilities of event labeling.",
        "In the following we present some examples in both languages to demonstrate this motivation.",
        "Due to the limited training data, many trigger words only appear a few times as a particular type of event.",
        "This data sparse problem directly leads to the low recall of trigger labeling.",
        "But exploiting the evidence from other predicates in the same cluster may boost the confidence score of the candidate event.",
        "We present two examples as follows.",
        "For example, \"blown up\" doesn't appear in the training data as a \"Conflict-Attack\" event, and so it cannot be identified in the following test sentence.",
        "However, if we replace it with other predicates in the same cluster, the system can easily identify 'Conflict-Attack' events in the new sentences with high confidence values:",
        "(a) Test Sentence:",
        "Identified as \"Conflict-Attack\" Event with Confidence^:",
        "He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was destroyed.",

        "{ blown up:4 bombing:3 blew:2 destroying:1 destroyed:1 } (c) Replaced Sentences Identified as \"Conflict-Attack\" Event with Confi-dence=0.799:",
        "Chinese predicate clusters anchored by English words can also provide external evidence for event identification.",
        "For example, the trigger word (release/parole)\" appears rarely in the Chinese training data but in most cases it can be replaced by a more frequent trigger \"#Jjj((release)\" to represent the same meaning.",
        "Therefore by combining the evidence from \"#JjjC' we can enhance the confidence value of identifying as a \"Justice-ReleaseParole\" event.",
        "For example, Identified as \"Justice-ReleaseParole\" Event with Confidence=0:",

        "On the other hand, some common words are highly ambiguous in particular contexts.",
        "But the other less-ambiguous predicates in the clusters can help classify event types more accurately.",
        "For example, in the following sentence the \"Per-sonnel-End_Position\" event is missing because \"step\" doesn't indicate any ACE events in the training data.",

        "For example, the word \"JT\" appears in 27 different predicate clusters, representing the meaning of hit/call/strike/form/take/draw etc.",
        "Therefore we can take use of other less ambiguous predicates in these clusters to adjust the likelihood of event classification.",
        "For example, in the following test sentence, the word \"JT\" indicates two different event types.",
        "If we replace these words with other predicates, we can classify them into different event types more accurately based on the evidence from replaced predicates and contexts.",

        "In the future we will attempt incorporating POS tagging results and frequency information.",
        "In addition we will extend this framework to extract cross-lingual relation and name clusters to improve other IE tasks such as name tagging, relation extraction, event coreference and event translation.",
        "We are also interested in automatically discovering new event types (non-ACE event types) or more fine-grained subtypes/attributes for existing ACE event types from the derived predicate clusters."
