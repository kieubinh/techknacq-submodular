        "The overall quality of the cross-lingual word similarities and lexicons extracted by the method is dependent on the quality of estimated semantic response vectors.",
        "The quality of these vectors is of course further dependent on the quality of multilingual training data.",
        "For instance, for Dutch-English, we may observe a rather spectacular increase in overall scores (the tests are performed",
        "over the same set of 1000 words) when we augment Wikipedia data with Europarl data (compare the scores for NL-EN-W and NL-EN-W+EP).",
        "(ii) A transition from a semantic space spanned by",
        "cross-lingual topics (Topic-BC) to a semantic space spanned by vocabulary words (Response-BC) leads to better results over all corpora and language pairs.",
        "The difference is less visible when using training data of lesser quality (the scores for NL-EN-W).",
        "Moreover, since the shared space of cross-lingual topics is used to obtain and quantify semantic word responses, the quality of learned cross-lingual topics influences the quality of semantic word responses.",
        "If the semantic coherence of the cross-lingual topical space is unsatisfying, the method is unable to generate good semantic response vectors, and ultimately unable to correctly identify semantically similar words across languages.",
        "(iii) Due to its modeling properties that assign more importance to high-frequency words, Direct-SWR produces reasonable results in the BLE task only for high-frequency words (see results for IT-EN-W).",

        "(2) models the concept of semantic word responding in a sound way (Griffiths et al., 2007), using the semantic word responses directly is not suitable for the actual BLE task.",
        "(iv) The effect of word frequency is clearly visible when comparing the results obtained on IT-EN-W with the results obtained on the other Wikipedia corpora.",
        "High-frequency words produce more redundancies in training data that are captured by statistical models such as latent topic models.",
        "High-frequency words then obtain better estimates of their semantic response vectors which consequently leads to better overall scores.",
        "The effect of word frequency on statistical methods in the BLE task was investigated before (Pekar et al., 2006; Prochasson and Fung, 2011; Tamura et al., 2012), and we also confirm their findings.",
        "(v) Unlike (Koehn and Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008), our response-based method does not rely on any orthographic features such as cognates or words shared across languages.",
        "It is a pure statistical method that only relies on word distributions over a multilingual corpus.",
        "Based on these distributions, it performs the initial shallow semantic analysis of the corpus by means of a multilingual probabilistic model.",
        "The method then builds, via the concept of semantic word responding, a language",
        "independent semantic space spanned by all vocabulary words/responses in both languages.",
        "That makes the method portable to distant language pairs.",
