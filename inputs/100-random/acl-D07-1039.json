        "Characterising the semantic behaviour of phrases in terms of compositionality has particularly attracted attention in recent years (Lin, 1999; Schone and Ju-rafsky, 2001; Bannard, 2002; Bannard et al., 2003;",
        "Baldwin et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Bannard, 2005; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).",
        "Typically the phrases are putative multiwords and non-compositionality is viewed as an important feature of many such \"words with spaces\" (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "For applications such as paraphrasing, information extraction and translation, it is essential to take the words of non-compositional phrases together as a unit because the meaning of a phrase cannot be obtained straightforwardly from the constituent words.",
        "In this work we are investigate methods of determining semantic compositionality of verb-object combinations on a continuum following previous research in this direction (McCarthy et al., 2003; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).",
        "Much previous research has used a combination of statistics and distributional approaches whereby distributional similarity is used to compare the constituents of the multiword with the multiword itself.",
        "In this paper, we will investigate the use of selectional preferences of verbs.",
        "We will use the preferences to find atypical verb-object combinations as we anticipate that such combinations are more likely to be non-compositional.",
        "'We use object to refer to direct objects.",
        "Selectional preferences of predicates have been modelled using the man-made thesaurus WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), see for example (Resnik, 1993; Li and Abe, 1998; Abney and Light, 1999; Clark and Weir, 2002).",
        "There are also distributional approaches which use co-occurrence data to cluster distributionally similar words together.",
        "The cluster output can then be used as classes for selectional preferences (Pereira et al., 1993), or one can directly use frequency information from distri-butionally similar words for smoothing (Grishman and Sterling, 1994).",
        "We used three different types of probabilistic models, which vary in the classes selected for representation over which the probability distribution of the argument heads is estimated.",
        "Two use WordNet and the other uses the entries in a thesaurus of distri-butionally similar words acquired automatically following (Lin, 1998).",
        "The first method is due to Li and Abe (1998).",
        "The classes over which the probability distribution is calculated are selected according to the minimum description length principle (mdl) which uses the argument head tokens for finding the best classes for representation.",
        "This method has previously been tried for modelling compositionality of verb-particle constructions (Bannard, 2002).",
        "The other two methods (we refer to them as 'type-based') also calculate a probability distribution using argument head tokens but they select the classes over which the distribution is calculated using the number of argument head types (of a verb in a corpus) in a given class, rather than the number of argument head tokens in contrast to previous WordNet models (Resnik, 1993; Li and Abe, 1998; Clark and Weir, 2002).",
        "For example, if the object slot of the verb park contains the argument heads { car, car, car, car, van, jeep } then the type-based models use the word type \"car\" only once when determining the classes over which the probability distribution is to be estimated.",
        "Classes are selected which maximise the number of types that they cover, rather than the number of tokens.",
        "This is done to avoid the selectional preferences being heavily influenced by noise from highly frequent arguments which may be poly-semous and some or all of their meanings may not be semantically related to the 'prototypical' arguments of the verb.",
        "For example car has a gondola sense in WordNet.",
        "The third method uses entries in a distributional thesaurus rather than classes from WordNet.",
        "The entries used as classes for representation are selected by virtue of the number of argument types they encompass.",
        "As with the WordNet models, the tokens are used to estimate a probability distribution over these entries.",
        "In the next section, we discuss related work on identifying compositionality.",
        "In section 3, we describe the methods we are using for acquiring our models of selectional preference.",
        "In section 4, we test our models on a dataset used in previous research.",
        "We compare the three types of models individually and also investigate the best performing model when used in combination with other features used in previous research.",

        "Most previous work using distributional approaches to compositionality either contrasts distributional information of candidate phrases with constituent words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Bannard et al., or uses distributionally similar words to detect nonproductive phrases (Lin, 1999).",
        "Lin (1999) used his method (Lin, 1998) for automatic thesaurus construction.",
        "He identified candidate phrases involving several open-class words output from his parser and filtered these by the log-likelihood statistic.",

        "Note though that for WNPROTOs we have the added constraint that a hyponym class from C is selected in preference to a hypernym in C. Compo-sitionality of an object noun and verb is computed as:-",
        "We use the probability of the class, rather than an estimate of the probability of the object, because we want to determine how likely any word belonging to this class might occur with the given verb, rather than the probability of the speciic noun which may be infrequent, yet typical, of the objects that occur with this verb.",
        "For example, convertible may be an infrequent object of park, but it is quite likely given its membership of the class motor .vehicle.",
        "We do not want to assume anything about the frequency of non-compositional verb-object combinations, just that they are unlikely to be members of classes which represent prototypical objects.",
        "We will contrast these models with a baseline frequency feature used by Venkatapathy and Joshi.",
        "We use our selectional preference models to provide the probability that a candidate is representative of the typical objects of the verb.",
        "That is, if the object might typically occur in such a relationship then this should lessen the chance that this verb-object combination is non-compositional.",
        "We used the probability of the classes from our 3 selectional preference models to rank the pairs and then used Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient (rs) to compare these ranks with the ranks from the goldstandard.",
        "Our results for the three types of preference models are shown in the first section of table 1.",
        "All the correlation values are signiicant, but we note that using the type based selectional preference models achieves a far greater correlation than using the TCMs.",
        "The DSproto models achieve the best results which is very encouraging given that they only require raw data and an automatic parser to obtain the grammatical relations.",
        "We applied 4 of the features used by Venkatapa-thy and Joshi (2005) and described in section 2 to our subset of 638 items.",
        "These features were obtained using the same bnc dataset used by Venkat-apathy and Joshi which was obtained using Bikel's parser (Bikel, 2004).",
        "We obtained correlation values for these features as shown in table 1 under V&J.",
        "These features are feature 1 frequency, feature 2 pointwise mutual information, feature 3 based on (Lin, 1999) and feature 7 lsa feature which considers the similarity of the verb-object pair with the verbal form of the object.",
        "Pointwise mutual information did surprisingly well on this 84% subset of the data, however the DSproto preferences still outperformed this feature.",
        "We combined the DSproto and V&J features with an SVM ranking function and used 10 fold cross validation as Venkatapathy and Joshi did.",
        "We contrast the result with the V&J features without the preference models.",
        "The results in the bottom section of table 1 demonstrate that the preference models can be combined with other features to produce optimal results.",

        "We have demonstrated that the selectional preferences of a verbal predicate can be used to indicate if a speciic combination with an object is non-compositional.",
        "We have shown that selectional preference models which represent prototypical arguments and focus on argument types (rather than tokens) do well at the task.",
        "Models produced from distributional thesauruses are the most promising which is encouraging as the technique could be applied to a language without a man-made thesaurus.",
        "We ind that the probability estimates from our models show a highly signiicant correlation, and are very promising for detecting non-compositional verb-object pairs, in comparison to individual features used previously.",
        "Further comparison of wnprotos and DSprotos to other WordNet models are warranted to contrast the effect of our proposal for disambiguation using word types with iterative approaches, particularly those of Clark and Weir (2002).",
        "A benefit of the DSprotos is that they do not require a hand-crafted inventory.",
        "It would also be worthwhile comparing the use of raw data directly, both from the bnc and from google's Web 1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) since web counts have been shown to outperform the Clark and Weir models on a pseudo-disambiguation task (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "We believe that preferences should NOT be used in isolation.",
        "Whilst a low preference for a noun may be indicative of peculiar semantics, this may not always be the case, for example chew the fat.",
        "Certainly it would be worth combining the preferences with other measures, such as syntactic ixed-ness (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "We also believe it is worth targeting features to speciic types of constructions, for example light verb constructions undoubtedly warrant special treatment (Stevenson et",
        "The selectional preference models we have proposed here might also be applied to other tasks.",
        "We hope to use these models in tasks such as diathesis alternation detection (McCarthy, 2000; Tsang and Stevenson, 2004) and contrast with WordNet models previously used for this purpose."
