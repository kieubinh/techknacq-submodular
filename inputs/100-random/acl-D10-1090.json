        "summary evaluation (Zhou et al., 2006b), and question answering (Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006).",
        "Despite the research activities, we see two major problems in the field.",
        "First, there is currently no consensus on what attributes characterize a good paraphrase.",
        "As a result, works on the application of paraphrases tend to build their own PG system in view of the immediate needs instead of using an existing system.",
        "Second, and as a consequence, no automatic evaluation metric exists for paraphrases.",
        "Most works in this area resort to ad hoc manual evaluations, such as the percentage of \"yes\" judgments to the question of \"is the meaning preserved\".",
        "This type of evaluation is incomprehensive, expensive, and non-comparable between different studies, making progress hard to judge.",
        "In this work we address both problems.",
        "We propose a set of three criteria for good paraphrases: adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity.",
        "Considering that paraphrase evaluation is a very subjective task with no rigid definition, we conduct experiments with human judges to show that humans generally have a consistent intuition for good paraphrases, and that the three criteria are good indicators.",
        "Based on these criteria, we construct PEM (Paraphrase Evaluation Metric), a fully automatic evaluation metric for PG systems.",
        "PEM takes as input the original sentence R and its paraphrase candidate P, and outputs a single numeric score b estimating the quality of P as a paraphrase of R. PG systems can be compared based on the average scores of their output paraphrases.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic metric that gives an objective and unambiguous ranking of different PG systems, which serves as a benchmark of progress in the field ofPG.",
        "The main difficulty of deriving PEM is to measure semantic closeness without relying on lexical level similarity.",
        "To this end, we propose bag of pivot language N-grams (BPNG) as a robust, broad-coverage, and knowledge-lean semantic representation for natural language sentences.",
        "Most importantly, BPNG does not depend on lexical or syntactic similarity, allowing us to address the conflicting requirements of paraphrase evaluation.",
        "The only linguistic resource required to evaluate BPNG is a parallel text of the target language and an arbitrary other language, known as the pivot language.",
        "We highlight that paraphrase evaluation and paraphrase recognition (Heilman and Smith, 2010; Das and Smith, 2009; Wan et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006) are related yet distinct tasks.",
        "Consider two sentences S1 and S2 that are the same except for the substitution of a single synonym.",
        "A paraphrase recognition system should assign them a very high score, but a paraphrase evaluation system would assign a relatively low one.",
        "Indeed, the latter is often a better indicator of how useful a PG system potentially is for the applications of PG described earlier.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We survey other automatic evaluation metrics in natural language processing (NLP) in Section 2.",
        "We define the task of paraphrase evaluation in Section 3 and develop our metric in Section 4.",
        "We conduct a human evaluation and analyze the results in Section 5.",

        "The weakness of BLEU is that it operates purely at the lexical surface level.",

        "Interestingly, few MT evaluation metrics exploit parallel texts as a source of information, when statistical MT is centered almost entirely around mining parallel texts.",

        "(2006) propose automatic metrics for summary evaluation.",

        "The recall and precision of several current paraphrase generation systems are evaluated.",

        "We identify two key points in this definition: (1) that the meaning is preserved, and (2) that the lexical form is different.",
        "To which we add a third, that the paraphrase must be fluent.",
        "The first and last point are similar to MT evaluation, where adequacy and fluency have been established as the standard criteria.",
        "In paraphrase evaluation, we have one more: lexical dissimilarity.",
        "Although lexical dissimilarity is seemingly the easiest to judge automatically among the three, it poses an interesting challenge to automatic evaluation metrics, as overlap with the reference has been the basis of almost all evaluation metrics.",
        "That is, while MT evaluation and paraphrase evaluation are conceptually closely related, the latter actually highlights the deficiencies of the former, namely that in most automatic evaluations, semantic equivalence is under-represented and substituted by lexical and syntactic equivalence.",
        "The task of paraphrase evaluation is then defined as follows: Given an original sentence R and a paraphrase candidate P, output a numeric score b estimating the quality of P as a paraphrase of R by considering adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity.",
        "In this study, we use a scale of 1 to 5 (inclusive) for b, although that can be transformed linearly into any range desired.",
        "We observe here that the overall assessment b is not a linear combination of the three measures.",
        "In particular, a high dissimilarity score is meaningless by itself.",
        "It could simply be that the paraphrase is unrelated to the source sentence, or is incoherent.",
        "However, when accompanied by high adequacy and fluency scores, it differentiates the mediocre paraphrases from the good ones."

        "The remaining two criteria are addressed in Section 4.4, and we describe the final combined metric PEM in Section 4.5.",
