        "Early research in language understanding focused on high-level semantic representations to drive their models.",
        "Many proposals, such as frames and scripts, used rich event schemas to model the situations described in text.",
        "While the field has since focused on more shallow approaches, recent work on schema induction shows that event schemas might be learn-able from raw text.",
        "This paper continues the trend, addressing the question, can event schemas be induced from raw text without prior knowledge?",
        "We present a new generative model for event schemas, and it produces state-of-the-art induction results, including a 7 F1 point gain over a different generative proposal developed in parallel with this work.",
        "Event schemas are unique from most work in information extraction (IE).",
        "Current relation discovery (Banko et al., 2007a; Carlson et al., 2010b) focuses on atomic facts and relations.",
        "Event schemas build relations into coherent event structures, often called templates in IE.",
        "For instance, an election template jointly connects that obama won a presidential election with romney was the defeated, the election occurred in 2012, and the popular vote was 50-48.",
        "The entities in these relations fill specific semantic roles, as in this template schema: Template Schema for Elections (events: nominate, vote, elect, win, declare, concede)",
        "Traditionally, template extractors assume foreknowledge of the event schemas.",
        "They know a Winner exists, and research focuses on supervised learning to extract winners from text.",
        "This paper focuses on the other side of the supervision spectrum.",
        "The learner receives no human input, and it first induces a schema before extracting instances of it.",
        "Our proposed model contributes to a growing line of research in schema induction.",
        "The majority of previous work relies on ad-hoc clustering algorithms (Filatova et al., 2006; Sekine, 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011).",
        "Chambers and Jurafsky is a pipelined approach, learning events first, and later learning syntactic patterns as fillers.",
        "It requires",
        "several ad-hoc metrics and parameters, and it lacks the benefits of a formal model.",
        "However, central to their algorithm is the use of coreferring entity mentions to knit events and entities together into an event schema.",
        "We adapt this entity-driven approach to a single model that requires fewer parameters and far less training data.",
        "Further, experiments show state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Other research conducted at the time of this paper also proposes a generative model for schema induction (Cheung et al., 2013).",
        "Theirs is not entity-based, but instead uses a sequence model (HMM-based) of verb clauses.",
        "These two papers thus provide a unique opportunity to compare two very different views of document structure.",
        "One is entity-driven, modeling an entity's role by its coreference chain.",
        "The other is clause-driven, classifying individual clauses based on text sequence.",
        "Each model makes unique assumptions, providing an interesting contrast.",
        "Our entity model outperforms by 7 F1 points on a common extraction task.",
        "The rest of the paper describes in detail our main contributions: (1) the first entity-based generative model for schema induction, (2) a direct pipeline/formal model comparison, (3) results improving state-of-the-art performance by 20%, and (4) schema induction from the smallest amount of training data to date."

        "Chen et al. (2011) perform relation extraction with no supervision on earthquake and finance domains.",
        "Theirs is a generative model that represents relations as predicate/argument pairs.",

        "We present a formal model that uniquely models coreference chains.",
        "Advantages include a joint clustering of events and entities, and a formal probabilistic interpretation of the resulting schemas.",
