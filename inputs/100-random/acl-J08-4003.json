        "In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems.",
        "We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms.",

        "In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages.",
        "We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions.",
        "However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing.",
        "The linear time complexity ofthe stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice.",
        "Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm.",

        "Because parsers for natural language have to cope with a high degree of ambiguity and nondeterminism, they are typically based on different techniques than the ones used for parsing well-defined formal languages â€“ for example, in compilers for programming languages.",
        "Thus, the mainstream approach to natural language parsing uses algorithms that efficiently derive a potentially very large set of analyses in parallel, typically making use of dynamic programming and well-formed substring tables or charts.",
        "When disambiguation is required, this approach can be coupled with a statistical model for parse selection that ranks competing analyses with respect to plausibility.",
        "Although it is often necessary, for efficiency reasons, to prune the search space prior to the ranking of complete analyses, this type of parser always has to handle multiple analyses.",
        "By contrast, parsers for formal languages are usually based on deterministic parsing techniques, which are maximally efficient in that they only derive one analysis.",
        "This is possible because the formal language can be defined by a non-ambiguous formal grammar that assigns a single canonical derivation to each string in the language, a property that cannot be maintained for any realistically sized natural language grammar.",
        "Consequently, these deterministic parsing techniques have been much less popular for natural language parsing, except as a way of modeling human sentence processing, which appears to be at least partly deterministic in nature (Marcus 1980; Shieber 1983).",
        "More recently, however, it has been shown that accurate syntactic disambiguation for natural language can be achieved using a pseudo-deterministic approach, where treebank-induced classifiers are used to predict the optimal next derivation step when faced with a nondeterministic choice between several possible actions.",
        "Compared to the more traditional methods for natural language parsing, this can be seen as a severe form of pruning, where parse selection is performed incrementally so that only a single analysis is derived by the parser.",
        "This has the advantage of making the parsing process very simple and efficient but the potential disadvantage that overall accuracy suffers because of the early commitment enforced by the greedy search strategy.",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, though, research has shown that, with the right choice of parsing algorithm and classifier, this type of parser can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, especially when used with dependency-based syntactic representations.",
        "Classifier-based dependency parsing was pioneered by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) for unlabeled dependency parsing of Japanese with head-final dependencies only.",
        "The algorithm was generalized to allow both head-final and head-initial dependencies by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), who reported very good parsing accuracy for English, using dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank for training and testing.",
        "The approach was extended to labeled dependency parsing by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004) (for Swedish) and Nivre and Scholz (2004) (for English), using a different parsing algorithm first presented in Nivre (2003).",
        "At a recent evaluation of data-driven systems for dependency parsing with data from 13 different languages (Buchholz and Marsi 2006), the deterministic classifier-based parser of Nivre et al.",
        "(2006) reached top performance together with the system of McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira (2006), which is based on a global discriminative model with online learning.",
        "These results indicate that, at least for dependency parsing, deterministic parsing is possible without a drastic loss in accuracy.",
        "The deterministic classifier-based approach has also been applied to phrase structure parsing (Kalt 2004; Sagae and Lavie 2005), although the accuracy for this type of representation remains a bit below the state of the art.",
        "In this setting, more competitive results have been achieved using probabilistic classifiers and beam search, rather than strictly deterministic search, as in the work by Ratnaparkhi (1997,1999) and Sagae and Lavie (2006).",
        "A deterministic classifier-based parser consists of three essential components: a parsing algorithm, which defines the derivation of a syntactic analysis as a sequence of elementary parsing actions; a feature model, which defines a feature vector representation of the parser state at any given time; and a classifier, which maps parser states, as represented by the feature model, to parsing actions.",
        "Although different types of parsing algorithms, feature models, and classifiers have been used for deterministic dependency parsing, there are very few studies that compare the impact of different components.",
        "The notable exceptions are Cheng, Asahara, and Matsumoto (2005), who compare two different algorithms and two types of classifier for parsing Chinese, and Hall, Nivre, and Nilsson (2006), who compare two types of classifiers and several types of feature models for parsing Chinese, English, and Swedish.",
        "In this article, we focus on parsing algorithms.",
        "More precisely, we describe two families of algorithms that can be used for deterministic dependency parsing, supported by classifiers for predicting the next parsing action.",
        "The first family uses a stack to store partially processed tokens and is restricted to the derivation of projective dependency structures.",
        "The algorithms of Kudo and Matsumoto (2002), Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), and Nivre (2003, 2006b) all belong to this family.",
        "The second family, represented by the algorithms described by Covington (2001) and recently explored for classifier-based parsing in Nivre (2007), instead uses open lists for partially processed tokens, which allows arbitrary dependency structures to be processed (in particular, structures with non-projective dependencies).",
        "We provide a detailed analysis of four different algorithms, two from each family, and give proofs of correctness and complexity for each algorithm.",
        "In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of accuracy and efficiency for the four algorithms, combined with state-of-the-art classifiers, using data from 13 different languages.",
        "Although variants of these algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.",
        "The remainder of the article is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines the task of dependency parsing and Section 3 presents a formal framework for the characterization of deterministic incremental parsing algorithms.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 contain the formal analysis of four different algorithms, defined within the formal framework, with proofs of correctness and complexity.",
        "Section 6 presents the experimental evaluation; Section 7 reports on related work; and Section 8 contains our main conclusions."

        "Because the dependency graphs in the gold standard are always trees, each output graph was converted, if necessary, from a forest to a tree by attaching every root node i (i > 0) to the special root node 0 with a default label ROOT.",
        "Parsing accuracy was measured by the labeled attachment score (LAS), that is, the percentage of tokens that are assigned the correct head and dependency label, as well as the unlabeled attachment score (UAS), that is, the percentage of tokens with the correct head, and the label accuracy (LA), that is, the percentage of tokens with the correct dependency label.",
        "All scores were computed with the scoring software from the CoNLL-X shared task, eval.pl, with default settings.",
        "This means that punctuation tokens are excluded in all scores.",
        "In addition to parsing accuracy, we evaluated efficiency by measuring the learning time and parsing time in seconds for each data set.",
        "Before turning to the results of the evaluation, we need to fulfill the promise from Remarks 1 and 2 to discuss the way in which treebank-induced classifiers approximate oracles and to what extent they satisfy the condition of constant-time operation that was assumed in all the results on time complexity in Sections 4 and 5.",
        "When predicting the next transition at run-time, there are two different computations that take place: the first is the classifier returning a transition t as the output class for an input feature vector 3>(c), and the second is a check whether the preconditions of t are satisfied in c. If the preconditions are satisfied, the transition t is performed; otherwise a default transition (with no preconditions) is performed instead.",
        "(The default transition is SHIFT for the stack-based algorithms and NO-ARC for the list-based algorithms.)",
        "The time required to compute the classification t of 3>(c) depends on properties of the classifier, such as the number of support vectors and the number of classes for a multi-class SVM classifier, but is independent of the length of the input and can therefore be regarded as a constant as far as the time complexity of the parsing algorithm is concerned.The check of preconditions is a trivial constant-time operation in all cases except one, namely the need to check whether there is a path between two nodes for the LEFT-ARCnand RIGHT-ARC^ transitions of the non-projective list-based algorithm.",
        "Maintaining the information needed for this check and updating it with each addition of a new arc to the graph is equivalent to the union-find operations for disjoint set data structures.",
        "Using the techniques of path compression and union by rank, the amortized time per operation is 0(<x(n)) per operation, where n is the number of elements (nodes in this case) and a(n) is the inverse of the Ackermann function, which means that a(n)is less than 5 for all remotely practical values of n and is effectively a small constant (Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest 1990).",
        "With this proviso, all the complexity results from Sections 4 and 5 can be regarded as valid also for the classifier-based implementation of deterministic, incremental dependency parsing.",
        "Table 3 shows the parsing accuracy obtained for each of the 7 parsers on each of the 13 languages, as well as the average over all languages, with the top score in each row set in boldface.",
        "For comparison, we also include the results of the two top scoring systems in the CoNLL-X shared task, those of McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira (2006) and Nivre et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Starting with the LAS, we see that the multilingual average is very similar across the seven parsers, with a difference of only 0.58 percentage points between the best and the worst result, obtained with the non-projective and the strictly projective version of the list-based parser, respectively.",
        "However, given the large amount of data, some of the differences are nevertheless statistically significant (according to McNemar's test, a = .05).",
        "Broadly speaking, the group consisting of the non-projective, list-based parser and the three pseudo-projective parsers significantly outperforms the group consisting of the three projective parsers, whereas there are no significant differences within the two groups.",
        "This shows that the capacity to capture non-projective dependencies does make a significant difference, even though such dependencies are infrequent in most languages.",
        "The best result is about one percentage point below the top scores from the original CoNLL-X shared task, but it must be remembered that the results in this article have",
        "8 A more sophisticated strategy would be to back off to the second best choice of the oracle, assuming that the oracle provides a ranking of all the possible transitions.",
        "On the whole, however, classifiers very rarely predict transitions that are not legal in the current configuration.",
        "9 The role of this constant in determining the overall running time is similar to that of a grammar constant in grammar-based parsing.",
        "10 The only exception to this generalization is the pseudo-projective, list-based parser, which is significantly worse than the non-projective, list-based parser, but not significantly better than the projective, arc-standard, stack-based parser.",
        "Parsing accuracy for 7 parsers on 13 languages, measured by labeled attachment score (LAS), unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and label accuracy (LA).",
        "NP-L = non-projective list-based; P-L = projective list-based; PP-L = pseudo-projective list-based; PE = projective arc-eager stack-based; PP-E = pseudo-projective arc-eager stack-based; PS = projective arc-standard stack-based; PPS = pseudo-projective arc-standard stack-based; McD = McDonald, Lerman and Pereira (2006); Niv = Nivre et al.",

        "been obtained without optimization of feature representations or learning algorithm parameters.",
        "The net effect of this can be seen in the result for the pseudo-projective version of the arc-eager, stack-based parser, which is identical to the system used by Nivre et al.",
        "(2006), except for the lack of optimization, and which suffers a loss of 1.12 percentage points overall.",
        "The results for UAS show basically the same pattern as the LAS results, but with even less variation between the parsers.",
        "Nevertheless, there is still a statistically significant margin between the non-projective, list-based parser and the three pseudo-projective parsers, on the one hand, and the strictly projective parsers, on the other.For label accuracy (LA), finally, the most noteworthy result is that the strictly projective parsers consistently outperform their pseudo-projective counterparts, although the difference is statistically significant only for the projective, list-based parser.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that the pseudo-projective parsing technique increases the number of distinct dependency labels, using labels to distinguish not only between different syntactic functions but also between \"lifted\" and \"unlifted\" arcs.",
        "It is therefore understandable that the pseudo-projective parsers suffer a drop in pure labeling accuracy.",
        "Despite the very similar performance of all parsers on average over all languages, there are interesting differences for individual languages and groups of languages.",
        "These differences concern the impact of non-projective, pseudo-projective, and strictly projective parsing, on the one hand, and the effect of adopting an arc-eager or an arc-standard parsing strategy for the stack-based parsers, on the other.",
        "Before we turn to the evaluation of efficiency, we will try to analyze some of these differences in a little more detail, starting with the different techniques for capturing non-projective dependencies.",
        "First of all, we may observe that the non-projective, list-based parser outperforms its strictly projective counterpart for all languages except Chinese.",
        "The result for Chinese is expected, given that it is the only data set that does not contain any non-projective dependencies, but the difference in accuracy is very slight (0.19 percentage points).",
        "Thus, it seems that the non-projective parser can also be used without loss in accuracy for languages with very few non-projective structures.",
        "The relative improvement in accuracy for the non-projective parser appears to be roughly linear in the percentage of non-projective dependencies found in the data set, with a highly significant correlation (Pearson's r = 0.815, p = 0.0007).",
        "The only language that clearly diverges from this trend is German, where the relative improvement is much smaller than expected.",
        "If we compare the non-projective, list-based parser to the strictly projective stack-based parsers, we see essentially the same pattern but with a little more variation.",
        "For the arc-eager, stack-based parser, the only anomaly is the result for Arabic, which is significantly higher than the result for the non-projective parser, but this seems to be due to a particularly bad performance of the list-based parsers as a group for this language.",
        "For the arc-standard, stack-based parser, the data is considerably more noisy, which is related to the fact that the arc-standard parser in itself has a higher",
        "11 The exception this time is the pseudo-projective, arc-eager parser, which has a statistically significant difference up to the non-projective parser but a non-significant difference down to the projective, arc-standard parser.",
        "12 A possible explanation for this result is the extremely high average sentence length for Arabic, which leads to a greater increase in the number of potential arcs considered for the list-based parsers than for the stack-based parsers.",
        "variance than the other parsers, an observation that we will return to later on.",
        "Still, the correlation between relative improvement in accuracy and percentage of non-projective dependencies is significant for both the arc-eager parser (r = 0.766, p = 0.001) and the arc-standard parser (r = 0.571, p = 0.02), although clearly not as strong as for the list-based parser.",
        "It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the non-projective parser in general can be expected to outperform a strictly projective parser with a margin that is directly related to the proportion of non-projective dependencies in the data.",
        "Having compared the non-projective, list-based parser to the strictly projective parsers, we will now scrutinize the results obtained when coupling the projective parsers with the pseudo-projective parsing technique, as an alternative method for capturing non-projective dependencies.",
        "The overall pattern is that pseudo-projective parsing improves the accuracy of a projective parser for languages with more than 1% of non-projective dependencies, as seen from the results for Czech, Dutch, German, and Portuguese.",
        "For these languages, the pseudo-projective parser is never outperformed by its strictly projective counterpart, and usually does considerably better, although the improvements for German are again smaller than expected.",
        "For Slovene and Turkish, we find improvement only for two out of three parsers, despite a relatively high share of non-projective dependencies (1.9% for Slovene, 1.5% for Turkish).",
        "Given that Slovene and Turkish have the smallest training data sets of all languages, this is consistent with previous studies showing that pseudo-projective parsing is sensitive to data sparseness (Nilsson, Nivre, and Hall 2007).",
        "For languages with a lower percentage of non-projective dependencies, the pseudo-projective technique seems to hurt performance more often than not, possibly as a result of decreasing the labeling accuracy, as noted previously.",
        "It is worth noting that Chinese is a special case in this respect.",
        "Because there are no non-projective dependencies in this data set, the projectivized training data set will be identical to the original one, which means that the pseudo-projective parser will behave exactly as the projective one.",
        "Comparing non-projective parsing to pseudo-projective parsing, it seems clear that both can improve parsing accuracy in the presence of significant amounts of non-projective dependencies, but the former appears to be more stable in that it seldom or never hurts performance, whereas the latter can be expected to have a negative effect on accuracy when the amount of training data or non-projective dependencies (or both) is not high enough.",
        "Moreover, the non-projective parser tends to outperform the best pseudo-projective parsers, both on average and for individual languages.",
        "In fact, the pseudo-projective technique outperforms the non-projective parser only in combination with the arc-standard, stack-based parsing algorithm, and this seems to be due more to the arc-standard parsing strategy than to the pseudo-projective technique as such.",
        "The relevant question here is therefore why arc-standard parsing seems to work particularly well for some languages, with or without pseudo-projective parsing.",
        "Going through the results for individual languages, it is clear that the arc-standard algorithm has a higher variance than the other algorithms.",
        "For Bulgarian, Dutch, and Spanish, the accuracy is considerably lower than for the other algorithms, in most cases by more than one percentage point.",
        "But for Arabic, Czech, and Slovene, we find exactly the opposite pattern, with the arc-standard parsers sometimes outperforming the other parsers by more than two percentage points.",
        "For the remaining languages, the arc-standard algorithm performs on a par with the other algorithms.",
        "In order to",
        "13 The arc-standard algorithm achieves the highest score also for Chinese, German, and Turkish, but in these cases only by a small margin.",
        "explain this pattern we need to consider the way in which properties of the algorithms interact with properties of different languages and the way they have been annotated syntactically.",
        "First of all, it is important to note that the two list-based algorithms and the arc-eager variant of the stack-based algorithm are all arc-eager in the sense that an arc (i, l, j) is always added at the earliest possible moment, that is, in the first configuration where i and j are the target tokens.",
        "For the arc-standard stack-based parser, this is still true for left dependents (i.e., arcs (i, l, j)suchthat j < i) but not for right dependents, where an arc (i, l, < j) should be added only at the point where all arcs of the form (j, l', k) have already been added (i.e., when the dependent j has already found all its dependents).",
        "This explains why the results for the two list-based parsers and the arc-eager stack-based parser are so well correlated, but it does not explain why the arc-standard strategy works better for some languages but not for others.",
        "The arc-eager strategy has an advantage in that a right dependent j can be attached to its head i at any time without having to decide whether j itself should have a right dependent.",
        "By contrast, with the arc-standard strategy it is necessary to decide not only whether j is a right dependent of i but also whether it should be added now or later, which means that two types of errors are possible even when the decision to attach j to i is correct.",
        "Attaching too early means that right dependents can never be attached to j; postponing the attachment too long means that j will never be added to i.Noneof these errors can occur with the arc-eager strategy, which therefore can be expected to work better for data sets where this kind of \"ambiguity\" is commonly found.",
        "In order for this to be the case, there must first of all be a significant proportion of left-headed structures in the data.",
        "Thus, we find that in all the data sets for which the arc-standard parsers do badly, the percentage of left-headed dependencies is in the 50-75% range.",
        "However, it must also be pointed out that the highest percentage of all is found in Arabic (82.9%), which means that a high proportion of left-headed structures may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the arc-eager strategy to work better than the arc-standard strategy.",
        "We conjecture that an additional necessary condition is an annotation style that favors more deeply embedded structures, giving rise to chains of left-headed structures where each node is dependent on the preceding one, which increases the number of points at which an incorrect decision can be made by an arc-standard parser.",
        "However, we have not yet fully verified the extent to which this condition holds for all the data sets where the arc-eager parsers outperform their arc-standard counterparts.",
        "Although the arc-eager strategy has an advantage in that the decisions involved in attaching a right dependent are simpler, it has the disadvantage that it has to commit early.",
        "This may either lead the parser to add an arc (i, l, < j) when it is not correct to do so, or fail to add the same arc in a situation where it should have been added, in both cases because the information available at an early point makes the wrong decision look probable.",
        "In the first case, the arc-standard parser may still get the analysis right, if it also seems probable that j should have a right dependent (in which case it will postpone the attachment); in the second case, it may get a second chance to add the arc if it in fact adds a right dependent to j at a later point.",
        "It is not so easy to predict what type of structures and annotation will favor the arc-standard parser in this way, but it is likely that having many right dependents attached to (or near) the root could cause problems for the arc-eager algorithms, since these dependencies determine the global structure and often span long distances, which makes it harder to make correct decisions early in the parsing process.",
        "This is consistent with earlier studies showing that parsers using the arc-eager, stack-based algorithm tend to predict dependents of the root with lower precision than other algorithms.",
        "Interestingly, the three languages for which the arc-standard parser has the highest improvement (Arabic, Czech, Slovene) have a very similar annotation, based on the Prague school tradition of dependency grammar, which not only allows multiple dependents of the root but also uses several different labels for these dependents, which means that they will be analyzed correctly only if a RIGHT-ARC transition is performed with the right label at exactly the right point in time.",
        "This is in contrast to annotation schemes that use a default label ROOT, for dependents of the root, where such dependents can often be correctly recovered in post-processing by attaching all remaining roots to the special root node with the default label.",
        "We can see the effect of this by comparing the two stack-based parsers (in their pseudo-projective versions) with respect to precision and recall for the dependency type PRED (predicate), which is the most important label for dependents of the root in the data sets for Arabic, Czech, and Slovene.",
        "While the arc-standard parser has 78.02% precision and 70.22% recall, averaged over the three languages, the corresponding figures for the arc-eager parser are as low as 68.93% and 65.93%, respectively, which represents a drop of almost ten percentage points in precision and almost five percentage points in recall.",
        "Summarizing the results of the accuracy evaluation, we have seen that all four algorithms can be used for deterministic, classifier-based parsing with competitive accuracy.",
        "The results presented are close to the state of the art without any optimization of feature representations and learning algorithm parameters.",
        "Comparing different algorithms, we have seen that the capacity to capture non-projective dependencies makes a significant difference in general, but with language-specific effects that depend primarily on the frequency of non-projective constructions.",
        "We have also seen that the non-projective list-based algorithm is more stable and predictable in this respect, compared to the use of pseudo-projective parsing in combination with an essentially projective parsing algorithm.",
        "Finally, we have observed quite strong language-specific effects for the difference between arc-standard and arc-eager parsing for the stack-based algorithms, effects that can be tied to differences in linguistic structure and annotation style between different data sets, although a much more detailed error analysis is needed before we can draw precise conclusions about the relative merits of different parsing algorithms for different languages and syntactic representations.",
        "Before we consider the evaluation of efficiency in both learning and parsing, it is worth pointing out that the results will be heavily dependent on the choice of support vector machines for classification, and cannot be directly generalized to the use of deterministic incremental parsing algorithms together with other kinds of classifiers.",
        "However, because support vector machines constitute the state of the art in classifier-based parsing, it is still worth examining how learning and parsing times vary with the parsing algorithm while parameters of learning and classification are kept constant.",
        "Table 4 gives the results of the efficiency evaluation.",
        "Looking first at learning times, it is obvious that learning time depends primarily on the number of training instances, which is why we can observe a difference of several orders of magnitude in learning time between the biggest training set (Czech) and the smallest training set (Slovene)",
        "14 This is shown by Nivre and Scholz (2004) in comparison to the iterative, arc-standard algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and by McDonald and Nivre (2007) in comparison to the spanning tree algorithm of McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira (2006).",
        "Learning and parsing time for seven parsers on six languages, measured in seconds.",
        "NP-L = non-projective list-based; P-L = projective list-based; PP-L = pseudo-projective list-based; PE = projective arc-eager stack-based; PP-E = pseudo-projective arc-eager stack-based; PS = projective arc-standard stack-based; PPS = pseudo-projective arc-standard stack-based.",
        "Learning Time for a given parsing algorithm.",
        "Broadly speaking, for any given parsing algorithm, the ranking of languages with respect to learning time follows the ranking with respect to training set size, with a few noticeable exceptions.",
        "Thus, learning times are shorter than expected, relative to other languages, for Swedish and Japanese, but longer than expected for Arabic and (except in the case of the arc-standard parsers) for Danish.",
        "However, the number of training instances for the SVM learner depends not only on the number of tokens in the training set, but also on the number of transitions required to parse a sentence of length n. This explains why the non-projective list-based algorithm, with its quadratic complexity, consistently has longer learning times than the linear stack-based algorithms.",
        "However, it can also be noted that the projective, list-based algorithm, despite having the same worst-case complexity as the non-projective algorithm, in practice behaves much more like the arc-eager stack-based algorithm and in fact has a slightly lower learning time than the latter on average.",
        "The arc-standard stack-based algorithm, finally, again shows much more variation than the other algorithms.",
        "On average, it is slower to train than the arc-eager algorithm, and sometimes very substantially so, but for a few languages (Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovene) it is actually faster (and considerably so for Danish).",
        "This again shows that learning time depends on other properties of the training sets than sheer size, and that some data sets may be more easily separable for the SVM learner with one parsing algorithm than with another.",

        "It is noteworthy that there are no consistent differences in learning time between the strictly projective parsers and their pseudo-projective counterparts, despite the fact that the pseudo-projective technique increases the number of distinct classes (because of its augmented arc labels), which in turn increases the number of binary classifiers that need to be trained in order to perform multi-class classification with the one-versus-one method.",
        "The number of classifiers is m{(n â€“ V), where m is the number of classes, and the pseudo-projective technique with the encoding scheme used here can theoretically lead to a quadratic increase in the number of classes.",
        "The fact that this has no noticeable effect on efficiency indicates that learning time is dominated by other factors, in particular the number of training instances.",
        "Turning to parsing efficiency, we may first note that parsing time is also dependent on the size of the training set, through a dependence on the number of support vectors, which tend to grow with the size of the training set.",
        "Thus, for any given algorithm, there is a strong tendency that parsing times for different languages follow the same order as training set sizes.",
        "The notable exceptions are Arabic, Turkish, and Chinese, which have higher parsing times than expected (relative to other languages), and Japanese, where parsing is surprisingly fast.",
        "Because these deviations are the same for all algorithms, it seems likely that they are related to specific properties of these data sets.",
        "It is also worth noting that for Arabic and Japanese the deviations are consistent across learning and parsing (slower than expected for Arabic, faster than expected for Japanese), whereas for Chinese there is no consistent trend (faster than expected in learning, slower than expected in parsing).",
        "Comparing algorithms, we see that the non-projective list-based algorithm is slower than the strictly projective stack-based algorithms, which can be expected from the difference in time complexity.",
        "But we also see that the projective list-based algorithm, despite having the same worst-case complexity as the non-projective algorithm, in practice behaves like the linear-time algorithms and is in fact slightly faster on average than the arc-eager stack-based algorithm, which in turn outperforms the arc-standard stack-based algorithm.",
        "This is consistent with the results from oracle parsing reported in Nivre (2006a), which show that, with the constraint of projectivity, the relation between sentence length and number of transitions for the list-based parser can be regarded as linear in practice.",
        "Comparing the arc-eager and the arc-standard variants of the stack-based algorithm, we find the same kind of pattern as for learning time in that the arc-eager parser is faster for all except a small set of languages: Chinese, Japanese, Slovene, and Turkish.",
        "Only two of these, Japanese and Slovene, are languages for which learning is also faster with the stack-based algorithm, which again shows that there is no straightforward correspondence between learning time and parsing time.",
        "Perhaps the most interesting result of all, as far as efficiency is concerned, is to be found in the often dramatic differences in parsing time between the strictly projective parsers and their pseudo-projective counterparts.",
        "Although we did not see any clear effect of the increased number of classes, hence classifiers, on learning time earlier, it is quite clear that there is a noticeable effect on parsing time, with the pseudo-projective parsers always being substantially slower.",
        "In fact, in some cases the pseudo-projective parsers are also slower than the non-projective list-based parser, despite the difference in time complexity that exists at least for the stack-based parsers.",
        "This result holds on average over all languages and for five out of thirteen of the individual languages and shows that the advantage of linear-time parsing complexity (for the stack-based parsers) can be outweighed by the disadvantage of a more complex classification problem in pseudo-projective parsing.",
        "In other words, the larger constant associated with a larger cohort of SVM classifiers for the pseudo-projective parser can be more important than the better asymptotic complexity of the linear-time algorithm in the range of sentence lengths typically found in natural language.",
        "Looking more closely at the variation in sentence length across languages, we find that the pseudo-projective parsers are faster than the non-projective parser for all data sets with an average sentence length above 18.",
        "For data sets with shorter sentences, the non-projective parser is more efficient in all except three cases: Bulgarian, Chinese, and Japanese.",
        "For Chinese this is easily explained by the absence of non-projective dependencies, making the performance of the pseudo-projective parsers identical to their strictly projective counterparts.",
        "For the other two languages, the low number of distinct dependency labels for Japanese and the low percentage of non-projective dependencies for Bulgarian are factors that mitigate the effect of enlarging the set of dependency labels in pseudo-projective parsing.",
        "We conclude that the relative efficiency of non-projective and pseudo-projective parsing depends on several factors, of which sentence length appears to be the most important, but where the number of distinct dependency labels and the percentage of non-projective dependencies also play a role."

        "Data-driven dependency parsing using supervised machine learning was pioneered by Eisner (1996), who showed how traditional chart parsing techniques could be adapted for dependency parsing to give efficient parsing with exact inference over a probabilistic model where the score of a dependency tree is the sum of the scores of individual arcs.",
        "This approach has been further developed in particular by Ryan McDonald and his colleagues (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005; McDonald et al.",
        "2005; McDonald and Pereira 2006) and is now known as spanning tree parsing, because the problem of finding the most probable tree under this type of model is equivalent to finding an optimum spanning tree in a dense graph containing all possible dependency arcs.",
        "If we assume that the score of an individual arc is independent of all other arcs, this problem can be solved efficiently for arbitrary non-projective dependency trees using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, as shown by McDonald et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Spanning tree algorithms have so far primarily been combined with online learning methods such as MIRA (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005).",
        "The approach of deterministic classifier-based parsing was first proposed for Japanese by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) and for English by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003).",
        "In contrast to spanning tree parsing, this can be characterized as a greedy inference strategy, trying to construct a globally optimal dependency graph by making a sequence of locally optimal decisions.",
        "The first strictly incremental parser of this kind was described in Nivre (2003) and used for classifier-based parsing of Swedish by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004) and English by Nivre and Scholz (2004).",
        "Altogether it has now been applied to 19 different languages (Nivre et al.",
        "2006, 2007; Hall et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Most algorithms in this tradition are restricted to projective dependency graphs, but it is possible to recover non-projective dependencies using pseudo-projective parsing (Nivre and Nilsson 2005).",
        "More recently, algorithms for non-projective classifier-based parsing have been proposed by Attardi (2006) and Nivre (2006a).",
        "The strictly deterministic parsing strategy has been relaxed in favor of w-best parsing by Johansson and Nugues (2006), among others.",
        "The dominant learning method in this tradition is support vector machines (Kudo and Matsumoto 2002; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003; Nivre et al.",
        "2006) but memory-based learning has also been used (Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson 2004; Nivre and Scholz 2004; Attardi 2006).",
        "Of the algorithms described in this article, the arc-eager stack-based algorithm is essentially the algorithm proposed for unlabeled dependency parsing in Nivre (2003), extended to labeled dependency parsing in Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004), and most fully described in Nivre (2006b).",
        "The major difference is that the parser is now initialized with the special root node on the stack, whereas earlier formulations had an empty stack at initialization.",
        "The arc-standard stack-based algorithm is briefly described in Nivre (2004) but can also be seen as an incremental version of the algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), where incrementality is achieved by only allowing one left-to-right pass over the input, whereas Yamada and Matsumoto perform several iterations in order to construct the dependency graph bottom-up, breadth-first as it were.",
        "The list-based algorithms are both inspired by the work of Covington (2001), although the formulations are not equivalent.",
        "They have previously been explored for deterministic classifier-based parsing in Nivre (2006a, 2007).",
        "A more orthodox implementation of Covington's algorithms for data-driven dependency parsing is found in Marinov (2007)."

        "In this article, we have introduced a formal framework for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, where parsing algorithms can be defined in terms of transition systems that are deterministic only together with an oracle for predicting the next transition.",
        "We have used this framework to analyze four different algorithms, proving the correctness of each algorithm relative to a relevant class of dependency graphs, and giving complexity results for each algorithm.",
        "To complement the formal analysis, we have performed an experimental evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, using SVM classifiers to approximate oracles, and using data from 13 languages.",
        "The comparison shows that although strictly projective dependency parsing is most efficient both in learning and in parsing, the capacity to produce non-projective dependency graphs leads to better accuracy unless it can be assumed that all structures are strictly projective.",
        "The evaluation also shows that using the non-projective, list-based parsing algorithm gives a more stable improvement in this respect than applying the pseudo-projective parsing technique to a strictly projective parsing algorithm.",
        "Moreover, despite its quadratic time complexity, the non-projective parser is often as efficient as the pseudo-projective parsers in practice, because the extended set of dependency labels used in pseudo-projective parsing slows down classification.",
        "This demonstrates the importance of complementing the theoretical analysis of complexity with practical running time experiments.",
        "Although the non-projective, list-based algorithm can be said to give the best tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency when results are averaged over all languages in the sample, we have also observed important language-specific effects.",
        "In particular, the",
        "15 The current version was first used in the CoNLL-X shared task (Nivre et al.",
        "2006).",
        "arc-eager strategy inherent not only in the arc-eager, stack-based algorithm but also in both versions of the list-based algorithm appears to be suboptimal for some languages and syntactic representations.",
        "In such cases, using the arc-standard parsing strategy, with or without pseudo-projective parsing, may lead to significantly higher accuracy.",
        "More research is needed to determine exactly which properties of linguistic structures and their syntactic analysis give rise to these effects.",
        "On the whole, however, the four algorithms investigated in this article give very similar performance both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and several previous studies have shown that both the stack-based and the list-based algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy together with properly trained classifiers (Nivre et al.",
