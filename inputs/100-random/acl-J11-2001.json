        "When used in the analysis of public opinion, such as the automated interpretation of on-line product reviews, semantic orientation can be extremely helpful in marketing, measures of popularity and success, and compiling reviews.",
        "The analysis and automatic extraction of semantic orientation can be found under different umbrella terms: sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee 2008), subjectivity (Lyons 1981; Langacker 1985), opinion mining (Pang and Lee 2008), analysis of stance (Biber and Finegan 1988; Conrad and Biber 2000), appraisal (Martin and White 2005), point of view (Wiebe 1994; Scheibman 2002), evidentiality (Chafe and Nichols 1986), and a few others, without expanding into neighboring disciplines and the study of emotion (Ketal 1975; Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988) and affect (Batson, Shaw, and Oleson 1992).",
        "In this article, sentiment analysis refers to the general method to extract subjectivity and polarity from text (potentially also speech), and semantic orientation refers to the polarity and strength of words, phrases, or texts.",
        "Our concern is primarily with the semantic orientation of texts, but we extract the sentiment of words and phrases towards that goal.",
        "There exist two main approaches to the problem of extracting sentiment automatically.",
        "The lexicon-based approach involves calculating orientation for a document from the semantic orientation of words or phrases in the document (Turney 2002).",
        "The text classification approach involves building classifiers from labeled instances of texts or sentences (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002), essentially a supervised classification task.",
        "The latter approach could also be described as a statistical or machine-learning approach.",
        "We follow the first method, in which we use dictionaries of words annotated with the word's semantic orientation, or polarity.",
        "Dictionaries for lexicon-based approaches can be created manually, as we describe in this article (see also Stone et al.",
        "1966; Tong 2001), or automatically, using seed words to expand the list of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Turney 2002; Turney and Littman 2003).",
        "Much of the lexicon-based research has focused on using adjectives as indicators of the semantic orientation of text (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Wiebe 2000; Hu and Liu 2004; Taboada, Anthony, and Voll 2006).",
        "First, a list of adjectives and corresponding SO values is compiled into a dictionary.",
        "Then, for any given text, all adjectives are extracted and annotated with their SO value, using the dictionary scores.",
        "The SO scores are in turn aggregated into a single score for the text.",
        "The majority of the statistical text classification research builds Support Vector Machine classifiers, trained on a particular data set using features such as unigrams or bigrams, and with or without part-of-speech labels, although the most successful features seem to be basic unigrams (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Salvetti, Reichenbach, and Lewis 2006).",
        "Classifiers built using supervised methods reach quite a high accuracy in detecting the polarity of a text (Chaovalit and Zhou 2005; Kennedy such classifiers perform very well in the domain that they are trained on, their performance drops precipitously (almost to chance) when the same classifier is used in",
        "1 Pang and Lee (2008) provide an excellent recent survey of the opinion mining or sentiment analysis problem and the approaches used to tackle it.",
        "2 With some exceptions: Turney (2002) uses two-word phrases; Whitelaw, Garg, and Argamon (2005) adjective phrases; and Benamara et al.",
        "(2007) adjectives with adverbial modifiers.",
        "See also Section 2.1.",

        "a different domain (Aue and Gamon [2005]; see also the discussion about domain specificity in Pang and Lee [2008, section 4.4]).",
        "Consider, for example, an experiment using the Polarity Dataset, a corpus containing 2,000 movie reviews, in which Brooke (2009) extracted the 100 most positive and negative unigram features from an SVM classifier that reached 85.1% accuracy.",
        "Many of these features were quite predictable: worst, waste, unfortunately,andmess are among the most negative, whereas memorable, wonderful, laughs,andenjoyed are all highly positive.",
        "Other features are domain-specific and somewhat inexplicable: If the writer, director, plot, or script are mentioned, the review is likely to be disfavorable towards the movie, whereas the mention of performances, the ending, or even flaws, indicates a good movie.",
        "Closed-class function words appear frequently; for instance, as, yet, with,andboth are all extremely positive, whereas since, have, though,andthose have negative weight.",
        "Names also figure prominently, a problem noted by other researchers (Finn and Kushmerick 2003; Kennedy and Inkpen 2006).",
        "Perhaps most telling is the inclusion of unigrams like 2, video, tv,and series in the list of negative words.",
        "The polarity of these words actually makes some sense in context: Sequels and movies adapted from video games or TV series do tend to be less well-received than the average movie.",
        "However, these real-world facts are not the sort of knowledge a sentiment classifier ought to be learning; within the domain of movie reviews such facts are prejudicial, and in other domains (e.g., video games or TV shows) they are either irrelevant or a source of noise.",
        "Another area where the lexicon-based model might be preferable to a classifier model is in simulating the effect of linguistic context.",
        "On reading any document, it becomes apparent that aspects of the local context of a word need to be taken into account in SO assessment, such as negation (e.g., not good) and intensification (e.g., very good), aspects that Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) named contextual valence shifters.",
        "Research by Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) concentrated on implementing those insights.",
        "They dealt with negation and intensification by creating separate features, namely, the appearance of good might be either good (no modification) not-good (negated good), int-good (intensified good), or dim-good (diminished good).",
        "The classifier, however, cannot determine that these four types of good are in any way related, and so in order to train accurately there must be enough examples of all four in the training corpus.",
        "Moreover, we show in Section 2.4 that expanding the scope to two-word phrases does not deal with negation adequately, as it is often a long-distance phenomenon.",
        "Recent work has begun to address this issue.",
        "For instance, Choi and Cardie (2008) present a classifier that treats negation from a compositional point of view by first calculating polarity of terms independently, and then applying inference rules to arrive at a combined polarity score.",
        "As we shall see in Section 2, our lexicon-based model handles negation and intensification in a way that generalizes to all words that have a semantic orientation value.",
        "A middle ground exists, however, with semi-supervised approaches to the problem.",
        "Read and Carroll (2009), for instance, use semi-supervised methods to build domain-independent polarity classifiers.",
        "Read and Carroll built different classifiers and show that they are more robust across domains.",
        "Their classifiers are, in effect, dictionary-based, differing only in the methodology used to build the dictionary.",
        "Li et al.",
        "(2010) use co-training to incorporate labeled and unlabeled examples, also making use of",
        "3 Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira (2007) do show some success in transferring knowledge across domains, so that the classifier does not have to be rebuilt entirely from scratch.",
        "a distinction between sentences with a first person subject and with other subjects.",
        "Other hybrid methods include those of Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008), Dang, Zhang, and Chen (2010), Dasgupta and Ng (2009), Goldberg and Zhu (2006), or Prabowo and Thelwall (2009).",
        "Wan (2009) uses co-training in a method that uses English labeled data and an English classifier to learn a classifier for Chinese.",
        "In our approach, we seek methods that operate at a deep level of analysis, incorporating semantic orientation of individual words and contextual valence shifters, yet do not aim at a full linguistic analysis (one that involves analysis of word senses or argument structure), although further work in that direction is possible.",
        "In this article, starting in Section 2, we describe the Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL) that we have developed over the last few years.",
        "We first extract sentiment-bearing words (including adjectives, verbs, nouns, and adverbs), and use them to calculate semantic orientation, taking into account valence shifters (intensifiers, downtoners, negation, and irrealis markers).",
        "We show that this lexicon-based method performs well, and that it is robust across domains and texts.",
        "One of the criticisms raised against lexicon-based methods is that the dictionaries are unreliable, as they are either built automatically or hand-ranked by humans (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008).",
        "In Section 3, we present the results of several experiments that show that our dictionaries are robust and reliable, both against other existing dictionaries, and as compared to values assigned by humans (through the use of the Mechanical Turk interface).",

        "In principle, a positive adjective should occur more frequently alongside the positive seed words, and thus will obtain a positive score, whereas negative adjectives will occur most often in the vicinity of negative seed words, thus obtaining a negative score.",

        "As we describe subsequently, the current version of SO-CAL takes other parts of speech into account, and makes use of more sophisticated methods to determine the true contribution of each word.",
        "It is important to note that how a dictionary is created affects the overall accuracy of subsequent results.",

        "It is difficult to measure the coverage of our dictionaries, because there is no direct way to estimate the number of SO-carrying words and expressions in English (although it should probably be larger than 5,000, the rough total of our current dictionaries).",
        "Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann (2005) provide a list of subjectivity cues with over 8,000 entries; there are many more neutral, repeated, and inflectionally related entries than in our dictionaries, however, as well as many more nouns, and far fewer adjectives.",
        "Automatically generated dictionaries are generally much larger: SentiWordNet (Baccianella, Esuli, and Sebastiani 2010) includes 38,182 non-neutral words (when the polarity of senses is averaged – see discussion in Section 3.4), and the Maryland dictionary (Mohammad, Dorr, and Dunne 2009) has 76,775 words and phrases tagged for polarity.",
        "We will see, in Section 3.4, that larger dictionaries are not necessarily better, in some cases because the information contained is not as detailed (the Maryland dictionary is not classified by part of speech), or because, in general, including more words may also lead to including more noise.",
        "Independently of the difference between manually and automatically generated dictionaries, we have evidence that coverage is a double-edged sword: With an earlier version of SO-CAL we extracted 50 texts from the Polarity Dataset (texts from which we had not previously drawn words) and extracted all words judged to have sentiment that were not already in our dictionaries.",
        "We found 116 adjectives, 62 nouns, 43 verbs, and 7 adverbs, a small fraction (less than 3%) of the words in our present lexicon.",
        "When these words were added, we found that performance in that data set actually dropped (by 4%).",
        "We believe this effect is related to the large amounts of description in genres such as movie reviews (see Taboada, Brooke, and Stede [2009] for a way to address the problem of descriptive noise); basically, rarer vocabulary is likely to contain a strong descriptive (semantic) component, and thus be used in a way that is tangential to overall text sentiment.",
        "In any case, the best argument for good (and appropriate) coverage is acceptable performance for new texts in new domains, and indeed we will see in Sections 2.8 and 2.9 that there is little difference in performance between texts and domains which were used to build our dictionaries, and others which were not."

        "The number of polar responses should be relatively balanced.",

        "• The percentage of polar responses may hit a maximum, after which we would expect a consistent distribution (within a small margin of error; this maximum might not be 100%, due to noise in the data).",
        "For the first task, that is, the neutral/negative/positive single word decision task, we included neutral words from our Epinions corpus which had originally been excluded from our dictionaries.",
        "Purely random sampling would have resulted in very little data from the high SO end of the spectrum, so we randomly selected first by SO (neutral SO = 0) and then by word, re-sampling from the first step if we had randomly selected a word that had been used before.",
        "In the end, we tested 400 adjectives chosen using this method.",
        "For each word, we solicited six judgments through Mechanical Turk.",
        "Preparing data for the word comparison task was slightly more involved, because we did not want to remove words from consideration just because they had been used once.",
        "Note that we first segregated the words by polarity: We compared positive words with positive words and negative words with negative words.",
        "This first test yielded a nice wide range of comparisons by randomly selecting first by SO and then by word, as well as by lowering the probability of picking high (absolute) SO words, and discounting words which had been used recently (in early attempts we saw high absolute SO words like great and terrible appearing over and over again, sometimes in consecutive queries).",
        "Though the odds of this occurring were low, we explicitly disallowed duplicate pairs.",
        "Once we settled on a method, we created 500 pairs of positive adjectives and 500 pairs of negative adjectives.",
        "Again, for each pair we solicited six judgments.",
        "In addition to our \"standard\" pair comparison data sets, we also created, using the same method, four data sets which compared negated words to words of opposite polarity (i.e., not bad and good).",
        "The primary goal here was not to evaluate the ranking of the words, but rather to see how well our two models of negation (switch and shift) correspond to human intuition across a wide variety of cases.",
        "To do so, we assume that our dictionary is generally correct, and then use the SO values after negation as input.",
        "Finally, we wanted to evaluate the intensifier dictionary, again using pairwise comparisons of strength.",
        "To this end, we selected 500 pairs of adverbial modifiers (e.g., very).",
        "Similar to the main dictionary pairs, we randomly selected first by modifier value, and then by word, discounting a pair if one of the words had appeared in the 10 most recently selected pairs.",

        "For instance, we judged savory, lush,and jolly to be equally positive, but they are applied to very different kinds of things, and so are not easily compared.",
        "And, of course, even assuming our 10-point scale, there are words in our dictionary that do not belong together in the same category; our focus here is on the big picture, but we can use this data to identify words which are problematic and improve the dictionary in the next iteration.",
        "The results in Figures 2 and 3 for the adjective word pair task are otherwise very encouraging.",

        "For each of the dictionaries discussed below, we used it instead of our set of manually ranked dictionaries as a source of SO values, and tested accuracy across different corpora.",
        "Accuracy in this case is calculated for the polarity identification task, that is, deciding whether a text is negative or positive, using the author's own ranking (\"recommended\" or \"not recommended,\" or number of stars).",
        "In our comparisons, we tested two options: Full uses all the default SO-CAL features described in Section 2, including intensification and negation.",
        "Basic, on the other hand, is just a sum of the SO value of words in relevant texts, with none of the SO-CAL features enabled.",
        "The first dictionary that we incorporated into SO-CAL was the Google-generated PMI-based dictionary described in Taboada, Anthony, and Voll (2006), and mentioned earlier in this article.",
        "32 Except for tests with the Maryland dictionary, where we disabled negative weighting because with weighting the performance was close to chance (all negative correct, all positive wrong).",
        "We believe that this is because the dictionary contains a disproportionately large number of negative words (likely the result of expanding existing dictionaries, which also tend to include more negative than positive words).",
        "The \"Maryland\" dictionary (Mohammad, Dorr, and Dunne 2009) is a very large collection of words and phrases (around 70,000) extracted from the Macquarie Thesaurus.",
        "The dictionary is not classified according to part of speech, and only contains information on whether the word is positive or negative.",
        "To integrate it into our system, we assigned all positive words an SO value of 3, and all negative words a value of – 3.",
        "We used the same type of quantification for the General Inquirer (GI; Stone et al.",
        "1966), which also has only positive and negative tags; a word was included in the dictionary if any of the senses listed in the GI were polar.",

        "The Subjectivity dictionary only contains a distinction between weak and strong opinion words.",
        "For our tests, weak words were assigned 2 or – 2 values, depending on whether they were positive or negative, and strong words were assigned 4 or – 4.",
        "The SentiWordNet dictionary (Esuli and Sebastiani 2006; Baccianella, Esuli, and Sebastiani 2010), also used in the previous section, was built using WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), and retains its synset structure.",
        "There are two main versions of SentiWordNet available, 1.0 and 3.0, and two straightforward methods to calculate an SO value:Use the first sense SO, or average the SO across senses.",
        "For the first sense method, we calculate the SO value of a word w (of a given POS) based on its first sense f as follows:",
        "SO(w) = 5 x (Pos(f ) – Neg(f )) For the averaging across senses method, SO is calculated as that is, the difference between the positive and negative scores provided by SentiWord-Net (each in the 0-1 range), averaged across all word senses for the desired part of speech, and multiplied by to provide SO values in the – to range.",
        "Table 9 contains a comparison of performance (using simple word averaging, no SO-CAL features) in our various corpora for each version of SentiWordNet using each method.",
        "What is surprising is that the best dictionary using just basic word counts (1.0, first sense) is actually the worst dictionary when using SO-CAL, and the best dictionary using all SO-CAL features (3.0, average across senses) is the worst dictionary when features are disabled.",
        "We believe this effect is due almost entirely to the degree of positive bias in the various dictionaries.",
        "The 3.0 average dictionary is the most positively biased, which results in degraded basic performance (in the Camera corpus, only 20.",
        "% of negative reviews are correctly identified).",
        "When negative weighting is applied, however, it reaches an almost perfect balance between positive and negative accuracy (70.7% to 71.3% in the Camera corpus), which optimizes overall performance.",
        "We cannot therefore conclude definitively that any of the SentiWordNet dictionaries is superior for our task; in fact,",
        "33 We chose 3 as a value because it is the middle value between 2 and 4 that we assigned to strong and weak words in the Subjectivity Dictionary, as explained subsequently.",
        "34 A third alternative would be to calculate a weighted average using sense frequency information; SentiWordNet does not include such information, however.",
        "Integrating this information from other sources, though certainly possible, would take us well beyond \"off-the-shelf\" usage, and, we believe, would provide only marginal benefit."

        "The General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al.",
        "1966), the only other fully manually dictionary considered here, does comparably quite well despite being relatively small.",
        "Finally, the Subjectivity dictionary, with the added strong/weak distinctions, is the closest in performance to our dictionary, though significantly worse when all features are enabled.",
        "The comparison is not completely fair to the Subjectivity dictionary, as it was built to recognize subjectivity, not polarity.",
        "We must note that the comparison is different for the Maryland dictionary, where we turned off negative weighting.",
        "This resulted in anomalously high performance on the Movies corpus, despite poor performance elsewhere.",
        "In general, there is significantly less positive bias in the movie review domain, most likely due to the use of negative terms in plot and character description (Taboada, Brooke, and Stede 2009), thus the negative weighting that is appropriate for other domains is often excessive for movie reviews.",
        "Comparing the performance of various dictionaries with or without SO-CAL features, two facts are apparent: First, SO-CAL features are generally beneficial no matter what dictionary is used (in fact, all Overall improvements from Basic to Full in Table 10 are statistically significant); the only exceptions are due to negative weighting in the movie domain, which for most of the dictionaries causes a drop in performance.Second, the benefit provided by SO-CAL seems to be somewhat dependent on the reliability of the dictionary; in general, automatically derived SO dictionaries derive less benefit from the use of linguistic features, and the effects are, on the whole, much less consistent; this is in fact the same conclusion we reached in other work where we compared automatically translated dictionaries to manually built ones for Spanish (Brooke, Tofiloski, and Taboada 2009).",
        "Interestingly, the Subjectivity dictionary performs slightly above the SO-CAL dictionary in some data sets when no features are enabled (which we might attribute to a mixture of basic reliability with respect to polarity and an appropriate level of coverage), but its lack of granularity seems to blunt the benefit of SO-CAL features, which were designed to take advantage of a finer-grained SO scale, an effect which is even more pronounced in binary dictionaries like the GI.",
        "We can summarize this result as follows: When using lexical methods, the effectiveness of any linguistic enhancements will to some extent depend on the characteristics of the underlying lexicon and, as such, the two cannot be considered in isolation."

        "35 When negative weighting is excluded (for example, the results for the Maryland dictionary in Table 10), SO-CAL features have a positive effect on performance in the movie domain.",
        "approaches have emerged: the use of machine-learning classifiers trained on n-grams or similar features (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002), and the use of sentiment dictionaries (Esuli and Sebastiani 2006; Taboada, Anthony, and Voll 2006).",
        "Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers have been shown to outperform lexicon-based models within a single domain (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006); they have trouble with cross-domain tasks (Aue and Gamon 2005), however, and some researchers have argued for hybrid classifiers (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008).",

        "The results presented here suggest that a lexicon-based system could outperform pure or hybrid machine-learning methods in cross-domain situations, though further research would be necessary to establish this point conclusively.",

        "We have presented a word-based method for extracting sentiment from texts.",
        "Building on previous research that made use of adjectives, we extend the Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL) to other parts of speech.",
        "We also introduce intensifiers, and refine our approach to negation.",
        "The current results represent a statistically-significant improvement over previous instantiations of the SO-CAL system.",
        "Additionally, we show that a manually built dictionary provides a solid foundation for a lexicon-based approach, one that is necessary to get full benefit from a system like SO-CAL.",
        "We compare our dictionaries to other, manual or automatic, dictionaries, and show that they are generally superior in terms of performance.",
        "This we attribute to our criteria for selecting and ranking words, which include excluding ambiguous words and including fewer rather than more words.",
        "Furthermore, we show that the dictionary rankings are in agreement with human judgments collected through the use of the Mechanical Turk interface.",
        "More importantly, we show that SO-CAL has robust performance across different types of reviews, a form of domain-independence that is difficult to achieve with text classification methods.",
        "The existing SO-CAL can be enhanced with many other sources of information.",
        "In Taboada, Brooke, and Stede (2009) we built classifiers to distinguish among paragraphs that contained mostly description, mostly comment, a combination of the two, or meta-information (such as titles, authors, review ratings, or movie ratings).",
        "Weighting paragraphs according to this classification, with lower weights assigned to description, results in a statistically-significant improvement in the polarity classification task.",
        "The classification of paragraphs into comment and description is but one of the many ways in which contextual information can be incorporated into a robust approach to sentiment extraction.",
        "In previous work (Voll and Taboada 2007), we showed a prototype for extracting topic sentences, and performing sentiment analysis on those only.",
        "We also showed how a sentence-level discourse parser, developed by Soricut and Marcu (2003), could be used to differentiate between main and secondary parts of the text.",
        "At the sentence level, exploring the types of syntactic patterns that indicate subjectivity and sentiment is also a possibility (Greene and Resnik 2009).",
        "Syntactic patterns can also be used to distinguish different types of opinion and appraisal (Bednarek 2009).",
        "Our current work focuses on developing discourse parsing methods, both general and specific to the review genre.",
        "At the same time, we will investigate different aggregation strategies for the different types of relations in the text (see also Asher, Benamara, and Mathieu [2008, 2009] for preliminary work in this area), and build on existing discourse parsing systems and proposals (Schilder 2002; Soricut and Marcu 2003; Subba and Di Eugenio 2009).",
        "The main conclusion of our work is that lexicon-based methods for sentiment analysis are robust, result in good cross-domain performance, and can be easily enhanced with multiple sources of knowledge (Taboada, Brooke, and Stede 2009).",
        "SO-CAL has performed well on blog postings (Murray et al.",
        "2008) and video game reviews (Brooke and Hurst 2009), without any need for further development or training.",
        "In related work, we have also shown that creating a new version of SO-CAL for a new language, Spanish, is as fast as building text classifiers for the new language, and results in better performance (Brooke 2009; Brooke, Tofiloski, and Taboada 2009).",
