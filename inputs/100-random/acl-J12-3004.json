        "There has been a growing interest in language systems that generate textual summaries of non-linguistic input data (Reiter 2007).",
        "The overall goal of these systems, generally referred to as data-to-text systems, is to enable efficient processing of large volumes of numeric data by supporting traditional visualisation modalities and to reduce the effort spent by human experts on analyzing the data.",
        "Various examples of data-to-text systems in the literature include systems that summarize weather forecast data (Goldberg, Driedger, and Kittredge 1994; Coch 1998), stock market data (Kukich 1983), and georeferenced data (Turner, Sripada, and Reiter 2009).",
        "One of the most successful data-to-text generation research efforts is the SumTime project, which uses pattern recognition techniques to generate textual summaries of automatically generated time-series data in order to convey the significant and interesting events (such as spikes and oscillations) that a domain expert would recognize by analyzing the data.",
        "The SumTime-Mousam (Somayajulu, Reiter, and Davy 2003) and SumTime-Turbine (Yu et al. 2007) systems were designed to summarize weather forecast data and the data from gas turbine engines, respectively.",
        "More recently, the",
        " project was extended to the medical domain.",
        "The BabyTalk (Gatt et al. 2009) project produces textual summaries of clinical data collected for babies in a neonatal intensive care unit, where the summaries are intended to present key information to medical staff for decision support.",
        "The implemented prototype (BT-45) (Portet et al. 2009) generates multi-paragraph summaries from large quantities of heterogeneous data (e.g., time series sensor data and the records of actions taken by the medical staff).",
        "The overall goal of these systems (identifying and presenting significant events) is similar to our goal of generating a summary that conveys what a person would get by viewing an information graphic, and these systems contend with each of the generation issues we must face with our system.",
        "Our generation methodology, however, is different from the approaches deployed in these systems in various respects.",
        "For example, BT-45 produces multi-paragraph summaries where each paragraph presents first a key event (of highest importance), then events related to the key event (e.g., an event that causes the key event), and finally other co-temporal events.",
        "Our system, on the other hand, produces single-paragraph summaries where the selected propositions are grouped and ordered with respect to the kind of information they convey.",
        "In addition, BT-45 performs a limited amount of aggregation at the conceptual level, where the aggregation is used to express the relations between events with the use of temporal adverbials and cue phrases (such as as a result).",
        "Contrarily, our system syntactically aggregates the selected propositions with respect to the entities they share.",
        "There is also a growing literature on summarizing numeric data visualized via graphical representations.",
        "One of the recent studies, the iGRAPH-Lite (Ferres et al. 2007) system, provides visually impaired users access to the information in a graphic via keyboard commands.",
        "The system is specifically designed for the graphics that appear in ?The Daily?",
        "(Statistics Canada's main dissemination venue) and presents the user with a template-based textual summary of the graphic.",
        "Although this system is very useful for in depth analysis of statistical graphs and interpreting numeric data, it is not appropriate for graphics from popular media where the intended message of the graphic is important.",
        "In the iGRAPH-Lite system, the summary generated for a graphic conveys the same information (such as the title of the graphic, and the maximum and minimum values) no matter what the visual features of the graphic are.",
        "The content of the summaries that our system generates, however, is dependent on the intention and the visual features of the graphic.",
        "Moreover, that system does not consider many of the generation issues that we address in our work.",
        "Choosing an appropriate presentation for a large amount of quantitative data is a difficult and time-consuming task (Foster 1999).",
        "A variety of systems were built to automatically generate presentations of statistical data?such as the PostGraphe system (Corio and Lapalme 1999; Fasciano and Lapalme 2000), which generates graphics and complementary text based on the information explicitly given by the user such as the intention to be conveyed in the graphic and the data of special interest to the user.",
        "The content of the accompanying text is determined according to the intention of the graphic and the features of the data.",
        "Moreover, the generated texts are intended to reinforce some important facts that are visually present in the graphic.",
        "In this respect, the generation in PostGraphe is similar to our work, although the output texts have a limited range and are heavily dependent on the information explicitly given by the user."

        "Many electronic documents do not provide ALT texts and even in the cases where ALT text is present, it is often very general or inadequate for conveying the intended message of the graphic (Lazar, Kleinman, and Malarkey 2007).",

        "For the graphic in Figure 1, our system generates the following textual summary: The graphic shows that United States at 32,434 has the highest number of hacker attacks among the countries Brazil, Britain, Germany, Italy, and United States.",
        "United States has 5.93 times more attacks than the average of the other countries.",
        "For the graphic in Figure 3a, the following textual summary is generated: The graphic shows an increasing trend in the dollar value of Lands?",
        "End annual revenue over the period from the year 1992 to the year 2001.",
        "The dollar value of Lands?",
        "End annual revenue shows an increase of nearly 225 percent.",
        "Except for a small drop in the year 1999, slight increases are observed almost every year.",
        "For the graphic in Figure 3b, our system generates the following summary: The graphic compares the defense agencies army, navy, air force, and other defense agencies, which are sorted in descending order with respect to the number of civilian employees.",
        "The number of civilian employees is highest for army at 233,030 and is lowest for other defense agencies at",
        "For the graphic in Figure 4, the following textual summary is generated: The graphic shows a decreasing trend in the dollar value of net profit over the period from the year 1998 to the year 2006.",
        "The dollar value of net profit ranges from 2.77 to 0.96 billion dollars over the period from the year 1998 to the year 2006 and shows the largest drop of about 0.56 billion dollars between the year 2000 and the year 2001.",
        "Slight decreases are observed almost every year.",
        "For the graphic in Figure 8b, our system generates the following summary: The graphic shows an increasing trend in the dollar value of U.S. Biotech Revenues over the period from the year 1992 to the year 2001.",
        "Increasing slightly every year, the dollar value of U.S. Biotech Revenues shows an increase of nearly 265 percent and ranges from 7.87 to 28.52 billion dollars.",
        "For the graphic in Figure 7a, the following textual summary is generated: In the year 2003, the graphic shows a much higher rise in the dollar value of Chicago Federal Home Loan Bank's mortgage program assets in contrast with the moderate increases over the period from the year 1998 to the year 2002.",
        "The dollar value of Chicago Federal Home Loan Bank's mortgage program assets reaches to 94.23 billion dollars in the year 2003.",
        "The dollar value of these assets in the year 2003 is nearly 49.1 times higher than that in the year 1998.",
        "For the graphic in Figure 9, the following textual summary is generated: This graphic is about American Express.",
        "The graphic shows that American Express at 255 billion dollars is 29 The backward-looking center of a current utterance is the most highly ranked entity of the previous utterance that is realized in the current utterance.",
        "30 The reason for saying that the defense agencies are sorted in decreasing order is not to enable the reader to visualize the graphic but rather that it subsumes giving the ranking of each bar.",
        "Graphic conveying the rank of a bar.",
        "the third highest with respect to the dollar value of total credit-card purchases per year among the entities Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diner's Club, and American Express.",
        "8.",
        "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Textual Summaries The earlier user studies (Sections 4.4 and 5.5) demonstrated the effectiveness of our generation methodology in identifying and presenting the high-level content of bar charts.",
        "The success of a generation system depends not only on the quality of the produced text, however, but also on whether the text achieves the impact that it is intended to make on readers (such as enabling readers to perform a task or changing their opinions in some context).",
        "We conducted an evaluation study to measure how adequate and effective the summaries generated by our system are for our purpose of providing the message and high-level knowledge that one would gain from viewing a graphic.",
        "Specifically, we were interested in (1) what amount of information is retained by a reader from reading the summary generated by our system, (2) whether someone reading the summary garners the most important knowledge conveyed by the graphic, and (3) whether the knowledge gleaned from the summary is consistent with the actual graphic.",
        "In this study, we used four graphics from the test corpus (described in Section 3.3) with different intended messages.",
        "These graphics conveyed an increasing trend (i.e., Figure 3a), a decreasing trend, the rank of the maximum bar (i.e., Figure 1), and the rank of a bar (i.e., Figure 9) among all bars.",
        "In the first part of the study, each of the 18 participants (graduate students) was first presented with the summaries generated by our system for these graphics; the participants neither saw the original graphics (the graphical images of the bar charts) nor were aware of our system and how the summaries were generated.",
        "For each summary, the participants were asked to draw the bar chart being described in that summary.",
        "Although enabling a reader to redraw the graphic is not a goal of our work, comparing a reader's mental representation of the graphic with the actual graphic allows us to identify whether there are any inconsistencies between knowledge gleaned from the summary and the content of the actual graphic.",
        "In the second part of the study, we asked three evaluators not involved in this research to evaluate the drawings that we collected from the participants.",
        "The evaluators were Ph.D. students from the University of Delaware (none of them were the authors of this work) and had an overall knowledge about our summarization approach (i.e., what is intended to be conveyed in the summaries of graphics).",
        "The evaluators were",
        " first told that a set of participants were presented with brief summaries of bar charts and asked to draw the corresponding bar charts based on the information presented in those summaries.",
        "They were also told that each summary only conveyed what is identified by our system as the most important information that should be conveyed about the bar chart being described.",
        "The evaluators were presented with the graphical images of the four bar charts used in the study (none saw the summaries presented in the first part of the study) and the drawings collected from the participants, and then asked to rate each drawing using the following evaluation scores:",
        "5: The drawing is essentially the same as the original graphic 4: The drawing captures all important information from the original graphic but requires some minor modifications 3: The drawing captures most of the important information from the original graphic but is missing one significant piece of information 2: The drawing reflects some information from the original graphic but requires major modifications 1: The drawing fails to reflect the original graphic",
        "The average score that a drawing received from the evaluators ranged from 3 to 5.",
        "The evaluators viewed the drawings drawn for the graphics with a trend more favor-ably and assigned a score of 4 or more in most cases.",
        "For each graphic, we computed the average score given by the evaluators to all drawings constructed from the summary of that graphic (i.e., the average of the three scores given to each of the 18 drawings drawn from the same summary).",
        "The graphics conveying an increasing (Figure 3a) and a decreasing trend received a score of 4.22 and 4.63, respectively.",
        "The evaluators gave an average score of 3.53 and 4.07 to the graphics which conveyed the rank of the maximum bar (Figure 1) and the rank of a bar among all bars (Figure 9).",
        "Because we do not present all features of a bar chart in its summary (such as all bar values), obtaining an average score of less than 5 for all bar charts is not surprising.",
        "We also asked the evaluators to specify a reason (i.e., what is missing or should be changed) for the cases where they assigned a score of less than 4.",
        "Once we analyzed their feedback for the drawings with a trend, we observed that missing values on the dependent axis (i.e., tick mark labels) and missing measurement axis descriptors (although given in the summaries) were the main reasons.",
        "We argue that presenting tick mark labels is more appropriate for summaries that describe scientific graphics (such as the summaries generated by the iGRAPH-Lite system [Ferres et al. 2007]) in contrast to the summaries that we generate for conveying the high-level content of a graphic.",
        "The evaluators indicated incorrect rankings of some bars as the reason for giving lower scores to the drawings that present the rank of the maximum bar or the rank of a bar among all bars; this is due to the fact that our summaries did not convey the rankings and the values of all bars in those cases.",
        "Because the intention of the corresponding graphics is to convey the rank of a single bar (not all bars), we argue that our summaries facilitate the readers to get the main purpose of these graphics.",
        "Overall, this study demonstrated that our summarization approach is effective in conveying the high-level content of bar charts so as to enable readers to correctly understand the main point of the graphic.",
        "We are planning to conduct future studies to explore the effectiveness of our approach further, however.",
        "One possible evaluation could be asking",
        "Demir, Carberry, and McCoy Summarizing Information Graphics Textually a different set of participants to draw the bar charts that we used in this study by reading their summaries produced by an appropriate baseline approach, and comparing the scores that those new set of drawings received from the same three evaluators with our current results.",
        "This evaluation will also allow us to determine whether the evaluators judged our summarization approach favorably because they were aware of the overall approach (i.e., brief summaries are generated by our system and these summaries do not contain everything that can be conveyed by the corresponding bar charts).",
        "Favorable results were also achieved when people with visual impairments were presented with the brief summaries generated by our work in an interactive system which also enabled the user to ask follow-up questions to learn more about about the graphic.",
        "More on that system and study can be found in Demir et al. (2010)."

      "text": [
        "The majority of information graphics from popular media are intended to convey a message that is often not captured by the text of the document.",
        "Thus graphics, along with the textual segments, contribute to the overall purpose of a multimodal document and cannot be ignored.",
        "The work presented in this article is the first to apply natural language generation technology to provide themessage and high-level knowledge that one would gain by viewing graphics from popular media via brief textual summaries.",
        "Our summarization approach treats a graphic as a form of language and utilizes the inferred intention of the graphic designer, the communicative signals present in the graphic, and the significant visual features of the underlying data in determining what to convey about that graph.",
        "Our approach uses a set of content identification rules constructed for each intended message category of a bar chart in determining the content of the summaries.",
        "The propositions selected for inclusion by these rules are organized into a text structure by applying a novel bottom?up approach which leverages different discourse related considerations such as the number and syntactic complexity of sentences and clause embeddings that will be used for realization.",
        "Following the generation of referring expressions for certain graphical elements, the structure of a summary is realized in natural language via a publicly available realizer.",
        "Three different evaluation studies validated the effectiveness of our approach in selecting and coherently organizing the most important information that should be conveyed about a bar chart, and enabling readers to correctly understand the high-level knowledge of the graphic.",
        "In addition to the application area, this article makes contributions to two broad areas of research: data-to-text generation systems and text-to-text generation of referring expressions.",
        "Here we have viewed the generation of a summary of an information graphic as a data-to-text generation problem.",
        "Any data-to-text generation system must solve several important problems: (1) out of all of the information in the data, extract out that information that is important enough to be included in the text, (2) structure the information so it can be realized as a coherent text, (3) aggregate propositions to be conveyed in the text into more complex yet understandable sentence structures, (4) order the resulting sentence structures so as to maintain text fluency, and (5) realize the information as English sentences and generate appropriate referring expressions.",
        "Our work has addressed each of these issues in a systematic fashion maintaining modularity of system components and following a development methodology that includes human input for making system decisions, and a thorough evaluation of each module as well as final system evaluation.",
        "Although the specific implementations that we developed are geared toward generating summaries of bar charts, the groundwork described in this article is currently",
        " being used by our own group to investigate summarizing other types of graphics (such as line graphs and grouped bar charts) from popular media.",
        "A Bayesian system for recognizing the intended message of line graphs has already been developed (Wu et al. 2010) and the work on constructing the content identification rules for line graphs is under way (Greenbacker, Carberry, and McCoy 2011).",
        "The module that generates referring expressions represents a sophisticated study of text-to-text referring expression generation.",
        "Referring expression generation is a vibrant field.",
        "Although the particular rules used for extracting an appropriate referring expression are unique to referring expressions for graphical elements inside an information graphic (note: not just bar charts), the work has uncovered some rather interesting properties in terms of extracting expressions from text which may generalize to other domains as well.",
        "Our work is unique in that a full referring expression is pieced together from text not directly referring to the item in question.",
        "In order to do this, we identified text levels and rules for extracting the core expression along with potential important modifiers.",
        "One can imagine this message carrying over to other types of data-to-text activities as well as to more standard text-to-text generation problems.",
        "In future work, we intend to build on the work reported here in several ways.",
        "Corpus studies where human subjects tasked with writing brief summaries of graphics (the kind of summaries that our system intends to generate) would be of great potential in informing generation decisions that our system makes at different levels.",
        "Moreover, experts with extensive knowledge of the domain or the targeted end users were shown to be of greater supply to the development of manyNLG systems.",
        "Learning from summaries written by subjects (especially expert writers) would be an exciting area of future research.",
        "We also believe that our approach would benefit from these corpus studies towards exploring how the fluency of the summaries can be further improved particularly by reducing the occasional verbosity in order to achieve textual economy (Stone and Webber 1998).",
        "For example, these efforts might help us to determine how measurement axis descriptors can be more appropriately phrased in different situations.",
        "Improving the current evaluation metric for choosing a text plan is also in our research agenda.",
        "We utilize three criteria in our evaluation metric for determining the best structure that can be obtained by applying the operators to the selected propositions.",
        "In addition, each criteria (the number of sentences, the overall syntactic complexity of sentences, and the overall comprehension complexity of all embedded clauses) has the same impact on the selection process.",
        "We are considering conducting more user studies in order to identify what other criteria should be taken into account and how important each criteria should be in relation to all the others.",
        "Moreover, exploring the broader applicability of the novel aspects of our work in other settings is an interesting topic for future work.",
        "Finally, evaluating the utility of our theoretically informed aggregation mechanism in comparison to or in conjunction with the more surface-oriented mechanism of the SPoT system would be a promising area for further research.",
        "To our best knowledge, what kinds of summaries best serve the needs of visually impaired individuals has not been throughly studied before.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, we believe that our summaries, once associated with graphics as ALT texts, might be of help to these individuals while reading electronic documents via screen readers.",
        "One fruitful research direction would be to present such individuals with our summaries in real-time scenarios and to mine their informational and presentational needs.",
        "Such a study would probably provide insights with regard to this question and potentially lead to guidelines that human summarizers could follow in generating summaries for people with visual impairments."
