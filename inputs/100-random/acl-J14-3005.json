        "Our framework uses Bayesian latent-variable models inspired by, and extending, the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of topical structure in documents; when applied to predicate?argument data, topic models automatically induce semantic classes of arguments and assign each predicate a distribution over those classes.",
        "We consider LDA and a number of extensions to the model and evaluate them on a variety of semantic prediction tasks, demonstrating that our approach attains state-of-the-art performance.",

        "and knowledge of language.",
        "The relationship between the meanings of an individual word and the larger linguistic structure in which it appears is not unidirectional; while the word contributes to the meaning of the structure, the structure also clarifies the meaning of the word.",
        "Taken on its own a word may be vague or ambiguous, in the senses of Zwicky and Sadock (1975); even when the word's meaning is relatively clear it may still admit specification of additional details that affect its interpretation (e.g., what color/breed was the dog?).",
        "This specification comes through context, which consists of both linguistic and extralinguistic factors but shows a strong effect of the immediate lexical and syntactic environment?the other words surrounding the word of interest and their syntactic relations to it.",

        "In this article we develop a framework for modeling word meaning and how it is modulated by contextual effects.1 Our models are distributional in the sense that their parameters are learned from observed co-occurrences between words and contexts in corpus data.",
        "More specifically, they are probabilistic models that associate latent variables with automatically induced classes of distributional behavior and associate each word with a probability distribution over those classes.",
        "This has a natural interpretation as a model of selectional preference, the semantic phenomenon by which predicates such as verbs or adjectives more plausibly combine with some classes of arguments than with others.",
        "It also has an interpretation as a disambiguation model: The different latent variable values correspond to different aspects of meaning and a word's distribution over those values can be modified by information coming from the context it appears in.",
        "We present a number of specific models within this framework and demonstrate that they can give state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring models of preference and disambiguation.",
        "More generally, we illustrate that probabilistic modeling is an effective general-purpose framework for distributional semantics and a useful alternative to the popular vector-space framework.",

Frith: If we consider words or morphemes A and B to be more different in meaning than A and C, then we will often find that the distributions of A and B are more different than the distributions of A and C. (Harris 1954) 1 We build on previous work published in O?",

        "Se?aghdha and Korhonen (2011), adding new models and evaluation experiments as well as a comprehensive exposition.",
        "In Section 4 we indicate which experimental results have previously been reported.",
        "588 O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Korhonen Probabilistic Distributional Semantics You shall know a word by the company it keeps.",
        "(Frith 1957) In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the term distributional semantics encompasses a broad range of methods that identify the semantic properties of a word or other linguistic unit with its patterns of co-occurrence in a corpus of textual data.",
        "The potential for learning semantic knowledge from text was recognized very early in the development of NLP (Spa?rck Jones 1964; Cordier 1965; Harper 1965), but it is with the technological developments of the past twenty years that this data-driven approach to semantics has become dominant.",
        "Distributional approaches may use a representation based on vector spaces, on graphs, or (like this article) on probabilistic models, but they all share the common property of estimating their parameters from empirically observed co-occurrences.",
        "The basic unit of distributional semantics is the co-occurrence: an observation of a word appearing in a particular context.",
        "The definition is a general one: We may be interested in all kinds of words, or only a particular subset of the vocabulary; we may define the context of interest to be a document, a fixed-size window around a nearby word, or a syntactic dependency arc incident to a nearby word.",
        "Given a data set of co-occurrence observations we can extract an indexed set of co-occurrence counts fw for each word of interest w; each entry fwc counts the number of times that w was observed in context c. Alternatively, we can extract an indexed set fc for each context.",
        "The vector-space approach is the best-known methodology for distributional semantics; under this conception fw is treated as a vector in R|C|, where C is the vocabulary of contexts.",
        "As such, fw is amenable to computations known from linear algebra.",
        "We can compare co-occurrence vectors for different words with a similarity function such as the cosine measure or a dissimilarity function such as Euclidean distance; we can cluster neighboring vectors; we can project a matrix of co-occurrence counts onto a low-dimensional subspace; and so on.",
        "This is perhaps the most popular approach to distributional semantics and there are many good general overviews covering the possibilities and applications of the vector space model (Curran 2003; Weeds and Weir 2005; Pado?",
        "and Lapata 2007; Turney and Pantel 2010).",
        "Although it is natural to view the aggregate of co-occurrence counts for a word as constituting a vector, it is equally natural to view it as defining a probability distribution.",
        "When normalized to have unit sum, fw parameterizes a discrete distribution giving the conditional probability of observing a particular context given that we observe w. The contents of the vector-space modeler's toolkit generally have probabilistic analogs: similarity and dissimilarity can be computed using measures from information theory such as the Kullback?Leibler or Jensen?Shannon divergences (Lee 1999); the effects of clustering and dimensionality reduction can be achieved through the use of latent variable models (see Section 3.2.2).",
        "Additionally, Bayesian priors on parameter distributions provide a flexible toolbox for performing regularization and incorporating prior information in learning.",
        "A further advantage of the probabilistic framework is that it is often straightforward to extend existing models to account for additional structure in the data, or to tie together parameters for shared statistical strength, while maintaining guarantees of well-normalized behavior thanks to the laws of probability.",
        "In this article we focus on selectional preference learning and contextual disambiguation but we believe that the probabilistic approach exemplified here can fruitfully be applied in any scenario involving distributional semantic modeling.",
        "589  2.2 Selectional Preferences 2.2.1 Motivation.",
        "A fundamental concept in linguistic knowledge is the predicate, by which we mean a word or other symbol that combines with one or more arguments to produce a composite representation with a composite meaning (by the principle of compositionality).",
        "The archetypal predicate is a verb; for example, transitive drink takes two noun arguments as subject and object, with which it combines to form a basic sentence.",
        "However, the concept is a general one, encompassing other word classes as well as more abstract items such as semantic relations (Yao et al. 2011), semantic frames (Erk, Pado?, and Pado?",
        "2010), and inference rules (Pantel et al. 2007).",
        "The asymmetric distinction between predicate and argument is analogous to that between context and word in the more general distributional framework.",
        "It is intuitive that a particular predicate will be more compatible with some semantic argument classes than with others.",
        "For example, the subject of drink is typically an animate entity (human or animal) and the object of drink is typically a beverage.",
        "The subject of eat is also typically an animate entity but its object is typically a foodstuff.",
        "The noun modified by the adjective tasty is also typically a foodstuff, whereas the noun modified by informative is an information-bearing object.",
        "This intuition can be formalized in terms of a predicate's selectional preference: a function that assigns a numerical score to a combination of a predicate and one or more arguments according to the semantic plausibility of that combination.",
        "This score may be a probability, a rank, a real value, or a binary value; in the last case, the usual term is selectional restriction.",
        "Models of selectional preference aim to capture conceptual knowledge that all language users are assumed to have.",
        "Speakers of English can readily identify that examples such as the following are semantically infelicitous despite being syntactically well-formed: 1.",
        "The beer drank the man.",
        "2.",
        "Quadruplicity drinks procrastination.",
        "(Russell 1940) 3.",
        "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.",
        "(Chomsky 1957) 4.",
        "The paint is silent.",
        "(Katz and Fodor 1963) Psycholinguistic experiments have shown that the time course of human sentence processing is sensitive to predicate?argument plausibility (Altmann and Kamide 1999; Rayner et al. 2004; Bicknell et al. 2010): Reading times are faster when participants are presented with plausible combinations than when they are presented with implausible combinations.",
        "It has also been proposed that selectional preference violations are cues that trigger metaphorical interpretation.",
        "Wilks (1978) gives the example My car drinks gasoline, which must be understood non-literally since car strongly violates the subject preference of drink and gasoline is also an unlikely candidate for something to drink.",
        "In NLP, one motivation for modeling predicate?argument plausibility is to investigate whether this aspect of human conceptual knowledge can be learned automatically from text corpora.",
        "If the predictions of a computational model correlate with judgments collected from human behavioral data, the assumption is that the model itself shares some properties with human linguistic knowledge and is in some sense a ?good?",

        "2.2.2 The ?Counting?",
        "Approach.",
        "The simplest way to estimate the plausibility of a predicate?argument combination from a corpus is to count the number of times that combination appears, on the assumptions that frequency correlates with plausibility and that given enough data the resulting estimates will be relatively accurate.",

        "returned.",
        "To estimate the frequency with which the verb drink takes beer as a direct object, Keller and Lapata's method uses the query <drink|drinks|drank|drunk|drinking a|the|?",
        "beer|beers>; to estimate the frequency with which tasty modifies pizza the query is simply <tasty pizza|pizzas>.",
        "Where desired, these joint frequency counts can be normalized by unigram hit counts to estimate conditional probabilities such as P(pizza|tasty).",
        "The main advantages of this approach are its simplicity and its ability to exploit massive corpora of raw text.",
        "On the other hand, it is hindered by the facts that only shallow processing is possible and that even in a Web-scale corpus the probability estimates for rare combinations will not be accurate.",
        "At the time of writing, Google returns zero hits for the query <draughtsman|draughtsmen whistle|whistles|whistled|whistling> and 1,570 hits for <onion|onions whistle|whistles|whistled|whistling>, suggesting the implausible conclusion that an onion is far more likely to whistle than a draughtsman.2 Zhou et al. (2011) modify the Web query approach to better capture statistical association by using pointwise mutual information (PMI) rather than raw co-occurrence frequency to quantify selectional preference: PMI(p, a) = log P(p, a) P(p)P(a) (1) The role of the PMI transformation is to correct for the effect of unigram frequency: A common word may co-occur often with another word just because it is a common word rather than because there is a semantic association between them.",
        "However, it does not provide a way to overcome the problem of inaccurate counts for low-probability co-occurrences.",
        "Zhou et al.'s goal is to incorporate selectional preference features into a parsing model and they do not perform any evaluation of the semantic quality of the resulting predictions.",
        "2.2.3 Similarity-Based Smoothing Methods.",
        "During the 1990s, research on language modeling led to the development of various ?smoothing?",
        "methods for overcoming the data sparsity problem that inevitably arises when estimating co-occurrence counts from finite corpora (Chen and Goodman 1999).",
        "The general goal of smoothing algorithms is to alter the distributional profile of observed counts to better match the known statistical properties of linguistic data (e.g., that language exhibits power-law behavior).",
        "Some also incorporate semantic information on the assumption that meaning guides the distribution of words in a text.",
        "2 The analogous example given by O?",
        "Se?aghdha (2010) relates to the plausibility of a manservant or a carrot laughing; Google no longer returns zero hits for <a|the manservant|manservants|menservants laugh|laughs|laughed> but a frequency-based estimate still puts the probability of a carrot laughing at 200 times that of a manservant laughing (1,680 hits against 81 hits).",
        "591  One such class of methods is based on similarity-based smoothing, by which one can extrapolate from observed co-occurrences by implementing the distributional hypothesis: ?similar?",
        "words will have similar distributional properties.",

        "S(w1, w2) is a set of comparison words that may depend on w1 or w2, or neither: Essen and Steinbiss (1992) use the entire vocabulary, whereas Dagan, Lee, and Pereira use a fixed number of the most similar words to w2, provided their similarity value is above a threshold t. While originally proposed for language modeling?the task of estimating the probability of a sequence of words?these methods require only trivial alteration to estimate co-occurrence probabilities for predicates and arguments, as was noted early on by Grishman and Sterling (1993) and Dagan, Lee, and Pereira (1999).",

        "One advantage of this and other similarity-based models is that the corpus used to estimate similarity need not be the same as that used to estimate predicate?argument co-occurrence, which is useful when the corpus labeled with these co-occurrences is small (e.g., a corpus labeled with FrameNet frames).",
