        "Semantic parsing maps a natural language sentence into a formal representation of its meaning.",
        "Due to the difficulty in deep semantic parsing, most previous work focuses on shallow semantic parsing, which assigns a simple structure (such as WHO did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW) to each predicate in a sentence.",
        "In particular, the well-defined semantic role labeling (SRL) task has been drawing increasing attention in recent years due to its importance in natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), and co-reference resolution (Kong et al., 2009).",
        "Given a sentence",
        "Hwee Tou Ng",
        "and a predicate (either a verb or a noun) in the sentence, SRL recognizes and maps all the constituents in the sentence into their corresponding semantic arguments (roles) of the predicate.",
        "In both English and Chinese PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2003), and English and Chinese NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004; Xue, 2006), these semantic arguments include core arguments (e.g., Arg0 for agent and Arg1 for recipient) and adjunct arguments (e.g., ArgM-LOC for locative argument and ArgM-TMP for temporal argument).",
        "According to predicate type, SRL can be divided into SRL for verbal predicates (verbal SRL, in short) and SRL for nominal predicates (nominal SRL, in short).",
        "With the availability of large annotated corpora such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank, and NomBank in English, data-driven techniques, including both feature-based and kernel-based methods, have been extensively studied for SRL (Carreras and Màrquez, 2004; Carreras and Màrquez, 2005; Pradhan et al., verbal and nominal SRL, state-of-the-art systems depend heavily on the top-best parse tree and there exists a large performance gap between SRL based on the gold parse tree and the top-best parse tree.",
        "For example, Pradhan et al.",
        "(2005) suffered a performance drop of 7.3 in F1-measure on English PropBank when using the top-best parse tree returned from Charniak's parser (Charniak, 2001).",
        "Liu and Ng (2007) reported a performance drop of 4.21 in F1-measure on English NomBank.",
        "Compared with English SRL, Chinese SRL suffers more seriously from syntactic parsing.",
        "Xue (2008) evaluated on Chinese PropBank and showed that the performance of Chinese verbal SRL drops by about 25 in F1-measure when replacing gold parse trees with automatic ones.",
        "Likewise, Xue (2008) and Li et al.",
        "(2009) reported a performance drop of about 12 in F1-measure in Chinese NomBank SRL.",
        "While it may be difficult to further improve syntactic parsing, a promising alternative is to perform both syntactic and semantic parsing in an integrated way.",
        "Given the close interaction between the two tasks, joint learning not only allows uncertainty about syntactic parsing to be carried forward to semantic parsing but also allows useful information from semantic parsing to be carried backward to syntactic parsing.",
        "This paper explores joint learning of syntactic and semantic parsing for Chinese texts from two levels.",
        "Firstly, an integrated parsing approach is proposed to benefit from the close interaction between syntactic and semantic parsing.",

        "Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank shows that our method significantly improves the performance of both syntactic and semantic parsing.",

        "However, they reported negative results, which they blamed on the inaccurate probability estimates from their locally trained SRL model.",
        "As an alternative to the above pseudo-joint learning methods (strictly speaking, they are still pipeline methods), one can augment the syntactic label of a constituent with semantic information, like what function parsing does (Merlo and Muthe distributions of semantic labels could potentially interact with the distributions of syntactic labels and redefined the boundaries of constituents.",
        "Based on this observation, they incorporated semantic role information into syntactic parse trees by extending syntactic constituent labels with their coarse-grained semantic roles (core argument or adjunct argument) in the sentence, and thus unified semantic parsing and syntactic parsing.",
        "The actual fine-grained semantic roles are assigned, as in other methods, by an ensemble classifier.",
        "However, the results obtained with this method were negative, and they concluded that semantic parsing on PropBank was too difficult due to the differences between chunk annotation and tree structure.",
        "Motivated by Yi and Palmer (2005), Merlo and Musillo (2008) first extended a statistical parser to produce a richly annotated tree that identifies and labels nodes with semantic role labels as well as syntactic labels.",
        "Then, they explored both rule-based and machine learning techniques to extract predicate-argument structures from this enriched output.",
        "Their experiments showed that their method was biased against these roles in general, thus lowering recall for them (e.g., precision of 87.6 and recall of 65.8).",
        "There have been other efforts in NLP on joint learning with various degrees of success.",
        "In particular, the recent shared tasks of CoNLL 2008 and 2009 (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajic et al., 2009) tackled joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies.",

        "Our Chinese SRL models for both verbal and nominal predicates adopt the widely-used SRL framework, which divides the task into three sequential sub-tasks: argument pruning, argument identification, and argument classification.",

        "The CoNLL-2009 shared task (Hajic et al., 2009) included both verbal and nominal SRL on dependency parsing, instead of constituent-based syntactic parsing.",

        "Also, /is/VC\" would turn into \"ê/is/S_VC\".",
        "Through POSCHUNK, all characters in a sentence are first assigned with POS chunk labels which must be compatible with previous ones, and then merged into words with their POS tags.",
        "For example, \"it/north/B_NR\", \"M/capital/M_NR\", and \"7fj/city/E_NR\" will be merged as \"jkKrlï /Beijing/NR\", /is/S_VC\" will become /is/VC\".",
        "Finally the merged results of the POSCHUNK are fed into the CHUNK procedure of the second pass.",
