        "Statistical translation models that use synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) or related formalisms to try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years.",
        "The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).",
        "The next obvious step is toward models that make full use of syntactic information on both sides.",
        "But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrase-based models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and La vie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we explore the reasons why tree-to-tree translation has been challenging, and how source syntax and target syntax might be used together.",
        "Drawing on previous successful attempts to relax syntactic constraints during grammar extraction in various ways (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), we compare several methods for extracting a synchronous grammar from tree-to-tree data.",
        "One confounding factor in such a comparison is that some methods generate many new syntactic categories, making it more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at decoding time.",
        "We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrase-based model Hiero (Chiang, 2005).",
        "This augmented model is able to learn from data whether to rely on syntax or not, or to revert back to monotone phrase-based translation.",
        "In experiments on Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation, we find that when both source and target syntax are made available to the model in an unobtrusive way, the model chooses to build structures that are more syntactically well-formed and yield significantly better translations than a nonsyntactic hierarchical phrase-based model."

        "Still, only derivations that satisfy the matching constraint are included in the summation.",
        "But in some cases we may want to soften the matching constraint itself.",

        "Applying the heuristic for nesting phrases reduced the grammar sizes dramatically (by a factor of 2.4 for Chinese and 4.2 for Arabic) but, interestingly, had almost no effect on translation quality: a slight decrease in BLEU on the Arabic-English development set and no significant difference on the other sets.",
        "This suggests that the strength of fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction lies in its ability to break up flat structures and to reconcile the source and target trees with each other, rather than multiple restructurings of the training trees.",
        "We then took a closer look at the behavior of the string-to-string and fuzzy tree-to-tree grammars (without the nesting heuristic).",
        "Because the rules of these grammars are in one-to-one correspondence, we can analyze the string-to-string system's derivations as though they had syntactic categories.",

      "text": [
        "Though exact tree-to-tree translation tends to hamper translation quality by imposing too many constraints during both grammar extraction and decoding, we have shown that using both source and target syntax improves translation accuracy when the model is given the opportunity to learn from data how strongly to apply syntactic constraints.",
        "Indeed, we have found that the model learns on its own to choose syntactically richer and more well-formed structures, demonstrating that source-and target-side syntax can be used together profitably as long as they are not allowed to overconstrain the translation model."
