        "The same procedure can straightforwardly be applied to a corpus with tagged source side sentences.",
        "We use the simple term 'tag' to stand for any kind of word-level analysis – a syntactic, statistical, or other means of grouping word types or tokens into classes, possibly based on their position and context in the sentence, POS tagging being the most obvious example.",
        "As in Chiang's hierarchical system, we rely on an external phrase-extraction procedure such as the one of Koehn et al.",

        "The creation of complex rules based on all initial rules obtained from the current sentence now proceeds just as in Chiang's model.",
        "Consider the target-tagged example sentence pair:",

        "Intuitively, the labeling of initial rules with tags marking the boundary of their target sides results in complex rules whose nonterminal occurrences impose weak syntactic constraints on the rules eligible for substitution in a PSCFG derivation: The left and right boundary word tags of the inserted rule's target side have to match the respective boundary word tags of the phrase pair that was replaced by a nonterminal when the complex rule was created from a training sentence pair.",
        "Since consecutive words within a rule stem from consecutive words in the training corpus and thus are already consistent, the boundary word tags are more informative than tags of words between the boundaries for the task of combining different rules in a derivation, and are therefore a more appropriate choice for the creation of grammar labels than tags of inside words.",
        "Accounting for phrase size A drawback of the current approach is that a single-word rule such as",
        "PRP-PRP – Ich I I can have the same left-hand-side nonterminal as a long rule with identical left and right boundary tags, such as (when using target-side tags):",

        "We therefore introduce a means of distinguishing between one-word, two-word, and multiple-word phrases as follows: Each one-word phrase with tag T simply receives the label T, instead of T-T. Two-word phrases with tag sequence T1T2 are labeled T1-T2 as before.",

        "Quite plausibly, phrase labeling should be informed by more than just the classes of the first and last words of the phrase.",
        "Taking phrase context into account, for example, can aid the learning of syntactic properties: a phrase beginning with a determiner and ending with a noun, with a verb as right context, is more likely to be a noun phrase than the same phrase with another noun as right context.",
        "In the current scheme, there is no way of distinguishing between these two cases.",
        "Similarly, it is conceivable that using non-boundary words inside the phrase might aid the labeling process.",
        "When relying on unsupervised learning of the word classes, we are forced to chose a fixed number of classes.",
        "A smaller number of word clusters will result in smaller number of grammar nonterminals, and thus more reliable feature estimation, while a larger number has the potential to discover more subtle syntactic properties.",
        "Using multiple word clusterings simultaneously, each based on a different number of classes, could turn this global, hard trade-off into a local, soft one, informed by the number of phrase pair instances available for a given granularity.",
        "Lastly, our method of accounting for phrase size is somewhat displeasing: While there is a hard partitioning of one-word and two-word phrases, no distinction is made between phrases of length greater than two.",
        "Marking phrase sizes greater than two explicitly by length, however, would create many sparse, low-frequency rules, and one of the strengths of PSCFG-based translation is the ability to substitute flexible-length spans into nonterminals of a derivation.",
        "A partitioning where phrase size is instead merely a feature informing the labeling process seems more desirable.",
        "We thus propose to represent each phrase pair instance (including its bilingual one-word contexts) as feature vectors, i.e., points of a vector space.",
        "We then use these data points to partition the space into clusters, and subsequently assign each phrase pair instance the cluster of its corresponding feature vector as label.",

        "Further, let c0 be a shorthand for the result of looking up the class of a word that is out of bounds (e.g., the left context of the first word of a sentence, or the second word of a one-word phrase).",

        "The elements in the first line represent the phrase boundary word classes, the next two lines the classes of the second and penultimate word, followed by a line representing the accumulated contents of the whole phrase, followed by two lines pertaining to the context word classes.",
        "The final element of the vector is proportional to the logarithm of the phrase length.",
        "We chose the logarithm assuming that length deviation of syntactic phrasal units is not constant, but proportional to the average length.",
        "Thus, all other features being equal, the distance between a two-word and a four-word phrase is the same as the distance between a four-word and an eight-word phrase.",
        "We will mainly use the Euclidean (L2) distance to compare points for clustering purposes.",
        "Our feature space is thus the Euclidean vector space R7N+.",
        "To additionally make use of source-side word classes, we append elements analogous to the ones above to the vector, all further multiplied by a parameter asrc that allows trading off the relevance of source-side and target-side information.",
        "In the same fashion, we can incorporate multiple tagging schemes (e.g., word clusterings of different granularities) into the same feature vector.",
        "As finer-grained schemes have more elements in the feature vector than coarser-grained ones, and thus exert more influence, we set the a parameter for each scheme to 1/N (where N is the number of word classes of the scheme).",
        "The K-means algorithm To create the clusters, we chose the K-means algorithm (Steinhaus, 1956; MacQueen, 1967) for both its computational efficiency and ease of implementation and paralleliza-tion.",
        "Given an initial mapping from the data points to K clusters, the procedure alternates between (i) computing the centroid of each cluster and (ii) reallocating each data point to the closest cluster centroid, until convergence.",
        "We implemented two commonly used initialization methods: Forgy and Random Partition.",
        "The Forgy method randomly chooses K observations from the data set and uses these as the initial means.",
        "The Random Partition method first randomly assigns a cluster to each observation and then proceeds straight to step (ii).",
        "Forgy tends to spread the initial means out, while Random Partition places all of them close to the center of the data set.",
        "As the resulting clusters looked similar, and Random Partition sometimes led to a high rate of empty clusters, we settled for Forgy."

        "Even though a key advantage of our method is its applicability to resource-poor languages, we used a language pair for which linguistic resources are available in order to determine how close translation performance can get to a fully syntax-based system.",
        "Accordingly, we use Chiang's hierarchical phrase based translation model (Chiang, 2007) as a base line, and the syntax-augmented MT model (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) as a 'target line', a model that would not be applicable for language pairs without linguistic resources.",

        "Apart from the language model, the lexical, phrasal, and (for the syntax grammar) label-conditioned features, and the rule, target word, and glue operation counters, Venugopal and Zollmann (2009) also provide both the hierarchical and syntax-augmented grammars with a rareness penalty 1/cnt(r), where cnt(r) is the occurrence count of rule r in the training corpus, allowing the system to learn penalization of low-frequency rules, as well as three indicator features firing if the rule has one, two unswapped, and two swapped nonterminal pairs, respectively.",
        "Further, to mitigate badly estimated PSCFG derivations based on low-frequency rules of the much sparser syntax model, the syntax grammar also contains the hierarchical grammar as a backbone (cf. Zollmann and Vogel (2010) for details and empirical analysis).",
        "We implemented our rule labeling approach within the SAMT rule extraction pipeline, resulting in comparable features across all systems.",

        "Results for the Syntax system are consistent with previous results (Zollmann et al., 2008), indicating improvements over the hierarchical system.",
        "Our approach, using target POS tags ('POS-tgt (no phr.",
        "s.)'), outperforms the hierarchical system on all three tests sets, and gains further improvements when accounting for phrase size ('POS-tgt').",
        "The latter approach is roughly on par with the corresponding Syntax system, slightly outperforming it on average, but not consistently across all test sets.",
        "The same is true for the 'slow' version ('POS-tgt-slow').",
        "The model based on bilingually tagged training instances ('POS-src&tgt') does not gain further improvements over the merely target-based one, but actually performs worse.",
        "We assume this is due to the huge number of nonterminals of 'POS-src&tgt' ((2 * 33 + 33)(2 * 36 + 36) = 5.8M in principle) compared to 'POS-tgt' (2 * 36 + 36 = 2628), increasing the sparseness of the grammar and thus leading to less reliable statistical estimates.",
        "We also experimented with a source-tag based model ('POS-src').",
        "In line with previous findings for syntax-augmented grammars (Zollmann and Vogel, 2010), the source-side-based grammar does not reach the translation quality of its target-based counterpart; however, the model still outperforms the hierarchical system on all test sets.",
        "Further, decoding is much faster than for 'POS-ext-tgt' and even slightly faster than 'Hierarchical'.",
        "This is due to the fact that for the source-tag based approach, a given chart cell in the CYK decoder, represented by a start and end position in the source sentence, almost uniquely determines the nonterminal any hypothesis in this cell can have: Disregarding part-of-speech tag ambiguity and phrase size accounting, that nonterminal will be the composition of the tags of the start and end source words spanned by that cell.",

        "Performance of the word-clustering based models To empirically validate the unsupervised clustering approaches, we first need to decide how to determine the number of word classes, N. A straightforward approach is to run experiments and report test set results for many different N. While this would allow us to reliably conclude the optimal number N, a comparison of that best-performing clustering method to the hierarchical, syntax, and POS systems would be tainted by the fact that N was effectively tuned on the test sets.",

        "In this work we proposed methods of labeling phrase pairs to create automatically learned PSCFG rules for machine translation.",
        "Crucially, our methods only rely on \"shallow\" lexical tags, either generated by POS taggers or by automatic clustering of words into classes.",
        "Evaluated on a Chinese-to-English translation task, our approach improves translation quality over a popular PSCFG baseline – the hierarchical model of Chiang (2005) – and performs on par with the model of Zollmann and Venugopal (2006), using heuristically generated labels from parse trees.",
        "Using automatically obtained word clusters instead of POS tags yields essentially the same results, thus making our methods applicable to all languages pairs with parallel corpora, whether syntactic resources are available for them or not.",
        "We also propose a more flexible way of obtaining the phrase labels from word classes using K-means clustering.",
        "While currently the simple hard-labeling methods perform just as well, we hope that the ease of incorporating new features into the K-means labeling method will spur interesting future research.",
        "When considering the constraints and independence relationships implied by each labeling approach, we can distinguish between approaches that label rules differently within the context of the sentence that they were extracted from, and those that do not.",
        "The Syntax system from Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) is at one end of this extreme.",
        "A given target span might be labeled differently depending on the syntactic analysis of the sentence that it is a part of.",
        "On the other extreme, the clustering based approach labels phrases based on the contained words alone.",
        "The POS grammar represents an intermediate point on this spectrum, since POS tags can change based on surrounding words in the sentence; and the position of the K-means model depends on the influence of the phrase contexts on the clustering process.",
        "Context insensitive labeling has the advantage that there are less alternative left-hand-side labels for initial rules, producing grammars with less rules, whose weights can be more accurately estimated.",
        "This could explain the strong performance of the word-clustering based labeling approach.",
