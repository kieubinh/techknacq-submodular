        ".",

        "However, the definition of a ?word?",
        "is often problematic.",
        "The most obvious example of this lies in languages that do not separate words with white space such as Chinese, Japanese, or Thai, in which the choice of a segmentation standard has a large effect on translation accuracy (Chang et al., 2008).",
        "Even for languages with explicit word The first author is now affiliated with the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.",
        "boundaries, all machine translation systems perform at least some precursory form of tokenization, splitting punctuation and words to prevent the sparsity that would occur if punctuated and non-punctuated words were treated as different entities.",
        "Sparsity also manifests itself in other forms, including the large vocabularies produced by morphological productivity, word compounding, numbers, and proper names.",
        "A myriad of methods have been proposed to handle each of these phenomena individually, including morphological analysis, stemming, compound breaking, number regularization, optimizing word segmentation, and transliteration, which we outline in more detail in Section 2.",
        "These difficulties occur because we are translating sequences of words as our basic unit.",
        "On the other hand, Vilar et al. (2007) examine the possibility of instead treating each sentence as sequences of characters to be translated.",
        "This method is attractive, as it is theoretically able to handle all sparsity phenomena in a single unified framework, but has only been shown feasible between similar language pairs such as Spanish-Catalan (Vilar et al., 2007), Swedish-Norwegian (Tiedemann, 2009), and Thai-Lao (Sornlertlamvanich et al., 2008), which have a strong co-occurrence between single characters.",
        "As Vilar et al. (2007) state and we confirm, accurate translations cannot be achieved when applying traditional translation techniques to character-based translation for less similar language pairs.",
        "In this paper, we propose improvements to the alignment process tailored to character-based machine translation, and demonstrate that it is, in fact, possible to achieve translation accuracies that ap",
        "proach those of traditional word-based systems using only character strings.",
        "We draw upon recent advances in many-to-many alignment, which allows for the automatic choice of the length of units to be aligned.",
        "As these units may be at the character, subword, word, or multi-word phrase level, we conjecture that this will allow for better character alignments than one-to-many alignment techniques, and will allow for better translation of uncommon words than traditional word-based models by breaking down words into their component parts.",
        "We also propose two improvements to the many-to-many alignment method of Neubig et al. (2011).",
        "One barrier to applying many-to-many alignment models to character strings is training cost.",
        "In the inversion transduction grammar (ITG) framework (Wu, 1997), which is widely used in many-to-many alignment, search is cumbersome for longer sentences, a problem that is further exacerbated when using characters instead of words as the basic unit.",
        "As a step towards overcoming this difficulty, we increase the efficiency of the beam-search technique of Saers et al. (2009) by augmenting it with lookahead probabilities in the spirit of A* search.",
        "Secondly, we describe a method to seed the search process using counts of all substring pairs in the corpus to bias the phrase alignment model.",
        "We do this by defining prior probabilities based on these substring counts within the Bayesian phrasal ITG framework.",
        "An evaluation on four language pairs with differing morphological properties shows that for distant language pairs, character-based SMT can achieve translation accuracy comparable to word-based systems.",
        "In addition, we perform ablation studies, showing that these results were not possible without the proposed enhancements to the model.",
        "Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis, which finds that character-based translation can handle unsegmented text, conjugation, and proper names in a unified framework with no additional processing."

        "As traditional SMT systems treat all words as single tokens without considering their internal structure, major problems of data sparsity occur for less frequent tokens.",
        "In fact, it has been shown that there is a direct negative correlation between vocabulary size (and thus sparsity) of a language and translation accuracy (Koehn, 2005).",
        "Sparsity causes trouble for alignment models, both in the form of incorrectly aligned uncommon words, and in the form of garbage collection, where uncommon words in one language are incorrectly aligned to large segments of the sentence in the other language (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Unknown words are also a problem during the translation process, and the default approach is to map them as-is into the target sentence.",
        "This is a major problem in agglutinative languages such as Finnish or compounding languages such as German.",
        "Previous works have attempted to handle morphology, decompounding and regularization through lemmatization, morphological analysis, or unsupervised techniques (Nie?en and Ney, 2000; Brown, 2002; Lee, 2004; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Talbot and Osborne, 2006; Mermer and Ak?n, 2010; Macherey et al., 2011).",
        "It has also been noted that it is more difficult to translate into morphologically rich languages, and methods for modeling target-side morphology have attracted interest in recent years (Bojar, 2007; Subotin, 2011).",
        "Another source of data sparsity that occurs in all languages is proper names, which have been handled by using cognates or transliteration to improve translation (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Kondrak et al., 2003; Finch and Sumita, 2007), and more sophisticated methods for named entity translation that combine translation and transliteration have also been proposed (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).",
        "Choosing word units is also essential for creating good translation results for languages that do not explicitly mark word boundaries, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Thai.",
        "A number of works have dealt with this word segmentation problem in translation, mainly focusing on Chinese-to-English translation (Bai et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008b; Chung and Gildea, 2009; Nguyen et al., 2010), although these works generally assume that a word segmentation exists in one language (English) and attempt to optimize the word segmentation in the other language (Chinese).",
        "We have enumerated these related works to demonstrate the myriad of data sparsity problems and proposed solutions.",
        "Character-based translation has the potential to handle all of the phenomena in the previously mentioned research in a single",
        "unified framework, requiring no language specific tools such as morphological analyzers or word seg-menters.",
        "However, while the approach is attractive conceptually, previous research has only been shown effective for closely related language pairs (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009; Sornlertlamvanich et al., 2008).",
