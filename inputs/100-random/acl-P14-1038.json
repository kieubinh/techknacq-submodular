        "The goal of end-to-end entity mention and relation extraction is to discover relational structures of entity mentions from unstructured texts.",
        "This problem has been artificially broken down into several components such as entity mention boundary identification, entity type classification and relation extraction.",
        "Although adopting such a pipelined approach would make a system comparatively easy to assemble, it has some limita-tions: First, it prohibits the interactions between components.",
        "Errors in the upstream components are propagated to the downstream components without any feedback.",
        "Second, it over-simplifies the problem as multiple local classification steps without modeling long-distance and cross-task dependencies.",
        "By contrast, we re-formulate this task as a structured prediction problem to reveal the linguistic and logical properties of the hidden 1 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace structures.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the output structure of each sentence can be interpreted as a graph in which entity mentions are nodes and relations are directed arcs with relation types.",
        "By jointly predicting the structures, we aim to address the aforementioned limitations by capturing: (i) The interactions between two tasks.",
        "For exam-ple, in Figure 1a, although it may be difficult for a mention extractor to predict ?1,400?",

        "(ii) The global features of the hidden structure.",
        "Various entity mentions and relations share linguistic and logical constraints.",
        "For example, we can use the triangle feature in Figure 1b to ensure that the relations between ?forces?, and each of the entity mentions ?Somalia /GPE ?, ?Haiti /GPE ?",
        "and ?Kosovo /GPE ?, are of the same type (Physical (PHYS), in this case).",
        "Following the above intuitions, we introduce a joint framework based on structured perceptron (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004) with beam-search to extract entity mentions and relations simultaneously.",

        "Most previous attempts on joint inference of entity mentions and relations (such as (Roth and Yih, 2004; Roth and Yih, 2007)) assumed that entity mention boundaries were given, and the classifiers of mentions and relations are separately learned.",
        "As a key difference, we incrementally extract entity mentions together with relations using a single model.",

        "We design a set of novel global features based on soft constraints over the entire output graph structure with low cost (Section 4).",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better performance than pipelined approaches, and global features provide further significant gains.",
        "2 Background 2.1 Task Definition The entity mention extraction and relation extraction tasks we are addressing are those of the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program 2 .",
        "ACE defined 7 main entity types including Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Geographical Entities (GPE), Location (LOC), 2 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace Facility (FAC), Weapon (WEA) and Vehicle (VEH).",
        "The goal of relation extraction 3 is to extract semantic relations of the targeted types between a pair of entity mentions which appear in the same sentence.",
        "ACE?04 defined 7 main relation types: Physical (PHYS), Person-Social (PER-SOC), Employment-Organization (EMP-ORG), Agent-Artifact (ART), PER/ORG Affiliation (Other-AFF), GPE-Affiliation (GPE-AFF) and Discourse (DISC).",
        "ACE?05 kept PER-SOC, ART and GPE-AFF, split PHYS into PHYS and a new relation type Part-Whole, removed DISC, and merged EMP-ORG and Other-AFF into EMP-ORG.",
        "Throughout this paper, we use?",
        "to denote nonentity or non-relation classes.",
        "We consider relation asymmetric.",
        "The same relation type with opposite directions is considered to be two classes, which we refer to as directed relation types.",
        "Most previous research on relation extraction assumed that entity mentions were given In this work we aim to address the problem of end-to-end entity mention and relation extraction from raw texts.",
        "2.2 Baseline System In order to develop a baseline system representing state-of-the-art pipelined approaches, we trained a linear-chain Conditional Random Fields model (Lafferty et al., 2001) for entity mention extraction and a Maximum Entropy model for relation extraction.",
        "Entity Mention Extraction Model We re-cast the problem of entity mention extraction as a sequential token tagging task as in the state-of-the-art system (Florian et al., 2006).",
        "We applied the BILOU scheme, where each tag means a token is the Beginning, Inside, Last, Outside, and Unit of an entity mention, respectively.",
        "Most of our features are similar to the work of (Florian et al., 3 Throughout this paper we refer to relation mention as relation since we do not consider relation mention coreference.",
        "403 2004; Florian et al., 2006) except that we do not have their gazetteers and outputs from other mention detection systems as features.",
        "Our additional features are as follows: ?",

        "?",

        "(non-relation).",
        "Most of our relation extraction features are based on the previous work of (Zhou et al., 2005) and (Kambhatla, 2004).",
        "We designed the following additional features: ?",
        "The label sequence of phrases covering the two mentions.",
        "For example, for the sentence in Figure 1a, the sequence is ?NP VP NP?.",

        "Four syntactico semantic patterns described in (Chan and Roth, 2010).",
        "?",
        "We replicated each lexical feature by replacing each word with its Brown cluster.",

        "3.1.1 Joint Decoding Algorithm One main challenge to search for entity mentions and relations incrementally is the alignment of different assignments.",
        "Assignments for the same sentence can have different numbers of entity mentions and relation arcs.",
        "The entity mention extraction task is often re-cast as a token-level sequential labeling problem with BIO or BILOU scheme (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Florian et al., 2006).",
        "A naive solution to our task is to adopt this strategy by treating each token as a state.",
        "How-ever, different assignments for the same sentence can have various mention boundaries.",
        "It is unfair to compare the model scores of a partial mention and a complete mention.",
        "It is also difficult to synchronize the search process of relations.",

        "NewB-GPE YorkL-GPE Stock Exchange PHYS PHYS The model would bias towards the incorrect assignment ?New /B-GPE York /L-GPE ?",

        "Fur-thermore, the predictions of the two PHYS relations cannot be synchronized since ?New /B-FAC York /I-FAC ?",
        "is not yet a complete mention.",
        "To tackle these problems, we employ the idea of semi-Markov chain (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), in which each state corresponds to a segment of the input sequence.",
