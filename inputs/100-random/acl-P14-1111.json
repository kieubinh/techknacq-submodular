        "We explore the extent to which high-resource manual annotations such as treebanks are necessary for the task of semantic role labeling (SRL).",
        "We examine how performance changes without syntactic supervision, comparing both joint and pipelined methods to induce latent syntax.",
        "This work highlights a new application of unsupervised grammar induction and demonstrates several approaches to SRL in the absence of supervised syntax.",
        "Our best models obtain competitive results in the high-resource setting and state-of-the-art results in the low resource setting, reaching 72.48% F1 averaged across languages.",
        "We release our code for this work along with a larger toolkit for specifying arbitrary graphical structure.",
        "1 1 Introduction The goal of semantic role labeling (SRL) is to identify predicates and arguments and label their semantic contribution in a sentence.",
        "Such labeling defines who did what to whom, when, where and how.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?The kids ran the marathon?, ran assigns a role to kids to denote that they are the runners; and a role to marathon to denote that it is the race course.",
        "Models for SRL have increasingly come to rely on an array of NLP tools (e.g., parsers, lem-matizers) in order to obtain state-of-the-art results (Bj?orkelund et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "Each tool is typically trained on hand-annotated data, thus placing SRL at the end of a very high-resource NLP pipeline.",
        "However, richly annotated data such as that provided in parsing treebanks is expensive to produce, and may be tied to specific domains (e.g., newswire).",
        "Many languages do 1 http://www.cs.jhu.edu/ ?",
        "mrg/software/ not have such supervised resources (low-resource languages), which makes exploring SRL cross-linguistically difficult.",
        "The problem of SRL for low-resource languages is an important one to solve, as solutions pave the way for a wide range of applications: Accurate identification of the semantic roles of entities is a critical step for any application sensitive to semantics, from information retrieval to machine translation to question answering.",
        "In this work, we explore models that minimize the need for high-resource supervision.",
        "We examine approaches in a joint setting where we marginalize over latent syntax to find the optimal semantic role assignment; and a pipeline setting where we first induce an unsupervised grammar.",
        "We find that the joint approach is a viable alternative for making reasonable semantic role predic-tions, outperforming the pipeline models.",
        "These models can be effectively trained with access to only SRL annotations, and mark a state-of-the-art contribution for low-resource SRL.",
        "To better understand the effect of the low-resource grammars and features used in these models, we further include comparisons with (1) models that use higher-resource versions of the same features; (2) state-of-the-art high resource models; and (3) previous work on low-resource grammar induction.",

        "Toutanova et al. (2005) introduced one of the first joint approaches for SRL and demonstrated that a model that scores the full predicate-argument structure of a parse tree could lead to significant error reduction over independent classifiers for each predicate-argument relation.",

        "We define the DMV such that it generates sequences of word classes: either POS tags or Brown clusters as in Spitkovsky et al. (2011).",

        "At test time, the parser is unconstrained.",
        "Dependency-based semantic role labeling can be described as a simple structured prediction problem: the predicted structure is a labeled directed graph, where nodes correspond to words in the sentence.",

        "Because each word in a sentence may be in a semantic relationship with any other word (including itself), a sentence of length n has n 2 possible edges.",
        "We define a single L+1-ary variable for each edge, whose value can be any of L semantic labels or a special label indicating there is no predicate-argument relationship between the two words.",
        "In this way, we jointly perform identification (determining whether a semantic relationship exists) and classification (de- termining the semantic label).",
        "This use of an L+1-ary variable is in contrast to the model of Naradowsky et al. (2012), which used a more complex DEPTREE Dep 1,1 Role 1,1 Role 1,2 Role 1,3 Role n,n Dep 1,2 Dep 1,3 Dep n,n ... ...",

        "Unlike the semantic dependencies, these syntactic variables must be coupled so that they produce a projective dependency parse; this requires an additional global constraint factor to ensure that this is the case (Smith and Eisner, 2008).",

        "First, for SRL, it has been observed that feature bigrams (the concatenation of simple features such as a predicate's POS tag and an ar-gument's word) are important for state-of-the-art (Zhao et al., 2009; Bj?orkelund et al., 2009).",
        "Sec-ond, for syntactic dependency parsing, combining Brown cluster features with word forms or POS tags yields high accuracy even with little training data (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "We create binary indicator features for each model using feature templates.",
        "Our feature template definitions build from those used by the top performing systems in the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task, Zhao et al. (2009) and Bj?orkelund et al. (2009) and from features in syntactic dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005; Koo et al., 2008).",

        "Also following Zhao et al. (2009), properties from a set of positions can be put together in three possible orders: as the given sequence, as a sorted list of unique strings, and removing all duplicated neighbored strings.",
        "We consider both template unigrams and bigrams, combining two templates in sequence.",
        "Additional templates we include are the relative position (Bj?orkelund et al., 2009), geneological re-lationship, distance (Zhao et al., 2009), and binned distance (Koo et al., 2008) between two words in the path.",
        "From Llu?",
        "'s et al. (2013), we use 1, 2, 3- gram path features of words/POS tags (path-grams), and the number of non-consecutive token pairs in a predicate-argument path (continuity).",

        "Unlike the gradient based ap-1181 proaches, this filtering approach easily scales to many features since we can decompose the memory usage over feature templates.",
        "As an additional speedup, we reduce the dimensionality of our feature space to 1 million for each clique using a common trick referred to as feature hashing (Weinberger et al., 2009): we map each feature instantiation to an integer using a hash function 3 modulo the desired dimentionality.",
        "4 Experiments We are interested in the effects of varied supervision using pipeline and joint training for SRL.",
        "To compare to prior work (i.e., submissions to the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task), we also consider the joint task of semantic role labeling and predicate sense disambiguation.",
