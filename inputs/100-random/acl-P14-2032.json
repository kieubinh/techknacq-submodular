        "Chinese text is written without delimiters between words; as a result, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is an essential foundational step for many tasks in Chinese natural language processing.",
        "As demonstrated by (Shi and Wang, 2007; Bai et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008; Kummerfeld et al., 2013), the quality and consistency of segmentation has important downstream impacts on system performance in machine translation, POS tagging and parsing.",
        "State-of-the-art performance in CWS is high, with F-scores in the upper 90s.",
        "Still, challenges remain.",
        "Unknown words, also known as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, lead to difficulties for word-or dictionary-based approaches.",
        "Ambiguity can cause errors when the appropriate segmentation is determined contextually, such as??",

        "and?",
        "/?",
        "(?just able?)",
        "(Gao et al., 2003).",
        "There are two primary classes of models: character-based, where the foundational units for processing are individual Chinese characters (Xue, 2003; Tseng et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2010), and word-based, where the units are full words based on some dictionary or training lexicon (Andrew, 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2007).",
        "Sun (2010) details their respective theoretical strengths: character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new OOV words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans.",
        "Prior work has shown performance gains from combining these two types of models to exploit their respective strengths, but such approaches are often complex to implement and computationally expensive.",
        "In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition.",
        "This method has strong optimality guarantees and works very well empirically.",
        "It is easy to implement and does not require retraining of existing character- and word-based segmenters.",
        "Perhaps most importantly, this work presents a much more practical and usable form of classifier combination in the CWS context than existing methods offer.",
        "Experimental results on standard SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 bake-off evaluations show that our model outperforms the character and word baselines by a significant margin.",
        "In particular, out approach improves OOV recall rates and segmentation consistency, and gives the best reported results to date on 6 out of 7 datasets.",
        "2 Models for CWS Here we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition.",
        "193 2.1 Character-based Models In the most commonly used contemporary approach to character-based segmentation, first proposed by (Xue, 2003), CWS is seen as a character sequence tagging task, where each character is tagged on whether it is at the beginning, mid-dle, or end of a word.",
        "Conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have been widely adopted for this task, and give state-of-the-art results (Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "In a first-order linear-chain CRF model, the conditional probability of a label sequence y given a word sequence x is defined as: P (y|x) = 1 Z |y| ?",

        "?",
        "f(x, y t , y t+1 )) f(x, y t , y t?1 ) are feature functions that typically include surrounding character n-gram and morphological suffix/prefix features.",
        "These types of features capture the compositional properties of characters and are likely to generalize well to unknown words.",
        "However, the Markov assumption in CRF limits the context of such features; it is difficult to capture long-range word features in this model.",
        "2.2 Word-based Models Word-based models search through lists of word candidates using scoring functions that directly assign scores to each.",
        "Early word-based segmentation work employed simple heuristics like dictionary-lookup maximum matching (Chen and Liu, 1992).",
        "More recently, Zhang and Clark (2007) reported success using a linear model trained with the average perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002).",

        "(y)) F (y|x) is the score of segmentation result y. Searching through the entire GEN(x) space is intractable even with a local model, so a beam-search algorithm is used.",
        "The search algorithm consumes one character input token at a time, and iterates through the existing beams to score two new alternative hypotheses by either appending the new character to the last word in the beam, or starting a new word at the current position.",

        "These mixing models perform well on standard datasets, but are not in wide use because of their high computational costs and difficulty of implementation.",
        "Dual decomposition (DD) (Rush et al., 2010) offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to (Sun et al., 2009)) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in (Wang et al., 2006; Sun, 2010)).",
        "DD has been successfully applied to similar situations for combining local with global models; for example, in dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2010), bilingual sequence tagging (Wang et al., 2013) and word alignment (DeNero and Macherey, 2011).",
