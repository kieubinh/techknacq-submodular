        "In most work on this topic, however, utterances in a conversation are treated independently and discourse structure information is largely ignored.",
        "In the context of language acquisition, this independence assumption discards cues that are important to the learner, e.g., the fact that consecutive utterances are likely to share the same referent (Frank et al., 2013).",
        "The current paper describes an approach to the problem of simultaneously modeling grounded language at the sentence and discourse levels.",
        "We combine ideas from parsing and grammar induction to produce a parser that can handle long input strings with thousands of tokens, creating parse trees that represent full discourses.",

        "Learning mappings between natural language (NL) and meaning representations (MR) is an important goal for both computational linguistics and cognitive science.",
        "Accurately learning novel mappings is crucial in grounded language understanding tasks and such systems can suggest insights into the nature of children language learning.",
        "Two influential examples of grounded language learning tasks are the sportscasting task, RoboCup, where the NL is the set of running commentary and the MR is the set of logical forms representing actions like kicking or passing (Chen and Mooney, 2008), and the cross-situational word-learning task, where the NL is the caregiver's utterances and the MR is the set of objects present in the context (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Ballard, 2007).",
        "Work in these domains suggests that, based on the co-occurrence between words and their referents in context, it is possible to learn mappings between NL and MR even under substantial ambiguity.",
        "Nevertheless, contexts like RoboCup?where every single utterance is grounded?are extremely rare.",
        "Much more common are cases where a single topic is introduced and then discussed at length throughout a discourse.",
        "In a television news show, for example, a topic might be introduced by presenting a relevant picture or video clip.",
        "Once the topic is introduced, the anchors can discuss it by name or even using a pronoun without showing a picture.",
        "The discourse is grounded without having to ground every utterance.",
        "Moreover, although previous work has largely treated utterance order as independent, the order of utterances is critical in grounded discourse contexts: if the order is scrambled, it can become impossible to recover the topic.",
        "Supporting this idea, Frank et al.",
        "(2013) found that topic continuity?the tendency to talk about the same topic in multiple utterances that are contiguous in time?is both prevalent and informative for word learning.",
        "This paper examines the importance of topic continuity through a grammatical inference problem.",

        "learn word-object mappings and to investigate the role of social information (cues like eye-gaze and pointing) in a child language acquisition task.",
        "Our main contribution lies in the novel integration of existing techniques and algorithms in parsing and grammar induction to offer a complete solution for simultaneously modeling grounded language at the sentence and discourse levels.",
        "Specifically, we: (1) use the Earley algorithm to exploit the special structure of our grammars, which are deterministic or have at most bounded ambiguity, to achieve approximately linear parsing time; (2) suggest a rescaling approach that enables us to build a PCFG parser capable of handling very long strings with thousands of tokens; and (3) employ Variational Bayes for grammatical inference to obtain better grammars than those given by the EM algorithm.",
        "By parsing entire discourses at once, we shed light on a scientifically interesting question about why the child's own gaze is a positive cue for word learning (Johnson et al., 2012).",
        "Our data provide support for the hypothesis (from previous work) that caregivers ?follow in?",
        ": they name objects that the child is already looking at (Tomasello and Farrar, 1986).",
