        "Human language users?",
        "knowledge about selectional preferences has been implicated in analyses of metaphor processing (Wilks, 1978) and in psycholinguistic studies of comprehension (Rayner et al., 2004).",
        "In Natural Language Processing, automatically acquired preference models have been shown to aid a number of tasks, including semantic role labelling (Zapirain et al., 2009), parsing (Zhou et al., 2011) and lexical disambiguation (Thater et al., 2010; O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Korhonen, 2011).",
        "It is tempting to assume that with a large enough corpus, preference learning reduces to a simple language modelling task that can be solved by counting predicate-argument co-occurrences.",
        "Indeed, Keller and Lapata (2003) show that relatively good performance at plausibility estimation can be attained by submitting queries to a Web search engine.",
        "However, there are many scenarios where this approach is insufficient: for languages and language domains where Web-scale data is unavailable, for predicate types (e.g., inference rules or semantic roles) that cannot be retrieved by keyword search and for applications where accurate models of rarer words are required.",
        "O?",
        "Se?aghdha (2010) shows that the Web-based approach is reliably outperformed by more complex models trained on smaller corpora for less frequent predicate-argument combinations.",
        "Models that induce a level of semantic representation, such as probabilistic latent variable models, have a further advantage in that they can provide rich structured information for downstream tasks such as lexical disambiguation (O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Korhonen, 2011) and semantic relation mining (Yao et al., 2011).",
        "Recent research has investigated the potential of Bayesian probabilistic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for modelling selectional preferences (O?",

        "Focussing here on (a), we demonstrate that our models attain better performance than previously-proposed WordNet-based methods on a plausibility estimation task and are particularly well-suited to estimating plausibility for arguments that were not seen in training and for which LDA cannot make useful predictions."

        "The WordNet lexical hierarchy (Fellbaum, 1998) is one of the most-used resources in NLP, finding many applications in both the definition of tasks (e.g. the SENSEVAL/SemEval word sense disambiguation tasks) and in the construction of systems.",
        "The idea of using WordNet to define selectional preferences was first implemented by Resnik (1993), who proposed a measure of associational strength between a semantic class s and a predicate p corresponding to a relation type r:",
        "where ?",
        "is a normalisation term.",
        "This measure captures the degree to which the probability of seeing s given the predicate p differs from the prior probability of s. Given that we are often interested in the preference of p for a word w rather than a class and words generally map onto multiple classes, Resnik suggests calculating A(s, p, r) for all classes that could potentially be expressed by w and predicting the maximal value.",
        "Cut-based models assume that modelling the selectional preference of a predicate involves finding the right ?level of generalisation?",
        "in the WordNet hierarchy.",
        "For example, the direct object slot of the verb eat can be associated with the subhierarchy rooted at the synset food#n#1, as all hyponyms of that synset are assumed to be edible and the immediate hypernym of the synset, substance#n#1, is too general given that many substances are rarely eaten.1 This leads to the notion of ?cutting?",
        "the hierarchy at one or more positions (Li and Abe, 1998).",
        "The modelling task then becomes that of finding the cuts that are maximally general without overgeneralising.",
        "Li and Abe (1998) propose a model in which the appropriate cut c is selected according to the Minimum Description Length principle; this principle explicitly accounts for the trade-off between generalisation and accuracy by minimising a sum of model description length and data description length.",
        "The probability of a predicate p taking as its argument an synset s is modelled as:",
        "where cs,p,r is the portion of the cut learned for p that dominates s. The distribution P (s|cs,p,r) is held to be uniform over all synsets dominated by cs,p,r, while P (c|p) is given by a maximum likelihood estimate.",
        "Clark and Weir (2002) present a model that, while not explicitly described as cut-based, likewise seeks to find the right level of generalisation for an observation.",
        "In this case, the hypernym at which to ?cut?",
        "is chosen by a chi-squared test: if the aggregate preference of p for classes in the subhierarchy rooted at c differs significantly from the individual preferences of p for the immediate children of c, the hierarchy is cut below c. The probability of p taking a synset s as its argument is given by:",
        "where cs,p,r is the root node of the subhierarchy containing s that was selected for p. An alternative approach to modelling with WordNet uses its hierarchical structure to define a Markov model with transitions from senses to senses and from senses to words.",
        "The intuition here is that each observation is generated by a ?walk?",
        "from the root of the hierarchy to a leaf node and emitting the word",
        "corresponding to the leaf.",
        "Abney and Light (1999) proposed such a model for selectional preferences, trained via EM, but failed to achieve competitive performance on a pseudodisambiguation task.",
        "The models described above have subsequently been used in many different studies.",
        "For example: McCarthy and Carroll (2003) use Li and Abe's method in a word sense disambiguation setting; Schulte im Walde et al. (2008) use their MDL approach as part of a system for syntactic and semantic subcategorisation frame learning; Shutova (2010) deploys Resnik's method for metaphor interpretation.",
        "Brockmann and Lapata (2003) report a comparative evaluation in which the methods of Resnik and Clark and Weir outpeform Li and Abe's method on a plausibility estimation task.",
        "Much recent work on preference learning has focused on purely distributional methods that do not use a predefined hierarchy but learn to make generalisations about predicates and arguments from corpus observations alone.",
        "These methods can be vector-based (Erk et al., 2010; Thater et al., 2010), discriminative (Bergsma et al., 2008) or probabilistic (O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2010; Ritter et al., 2010; Reisinger and Mooney, 2011).",
        "In the probabilistic category, Bayesian models based on the ?topic modelling?",
        "framework (Blei et al., 2003b) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a number of evaluation settings; the models considered in this paper are also related to this framework.",
        "In machine learning, researchers have proposed a variety of topic modelling methods where the latent variables are arranged in a hierarchical structure (Blei et al., 2003a; Mimno et al., 2007).",
        "In contrast to the present work, these models use a relatively shallow hierarchy (e.g., 3 levels) and any hierarchy node can in principle emit any vocabulary item; they thus provide a poor match for our goal of modelling over WordNet.",

        "Each predicate p is associated with a distribution over ?cuts?, i.e., complete subgraphs of G rooted at a single node and containing all nodes dominated by the root.",
        "It follows that the number of possible cuts is the same as the number of synsets.",
        "Each cut c is associated with a non-uniform distribution over the set of words Wc that can be generated by the synsets contained in c. As well as the use of a non-uniform emission distribution and the placing of Dirichlet priors on the multinomial over cuts, a significant difference from Li and Abe's model is that overlapping cuts are permitted (indeed, every cut has non-zero probability given a predicate).",
        "For example, the",
        "model may learn that the direct object slot of eat gives high probability to the cut rooted at food#n#1 but also that the cut rooted at substance#n#1 has non-negligible probability, higher than that assigned to phenomenon#n#1.",
        "It follows that the estimated probability of p taking argument w takes into account all possible cuts, weighted by their probability given p. The generative story for WN-CUT is given in Algorithm 1; this describes the assumptions made by the model about how a corpus of observations is generated.",
        "The probability of predicate p taking argument w is defined as (4); an empirical posterior estimate of this quantity can be computed from a Gibbs sampling state via (5):",
        "where fcw is the number of observations containing argument w that have been assigned cut c, fcp is the number of observations containing predicate p that have been assigned cut c and fc?, f?p are the marginal counts for cut c and predicate p, respectively.",
        "The two terms that are multiplied in (4) play complementary roles analogous to those of the two description lengths in Li and Abe's MDL formulation; P (c|p) will prefer to reuse more general cuts, while P (w|c) will prefer more specific cuts with a smaller associated argument vocabulary.",
        "As the number of words |Wc |that can be emitted by a cut |c |varies according to the size of the subhierarchy under the cut, the proportion of probability mass accorded to the likelihood and the prior in (5) is not constant.",
        "An alternative formulation is to keep the distribution of mass between likelihood and prior constant but vary the value of the individual ?c parameters according to cut size.",
        "Experiments suggest that this alternative does not differ in performance.",
        "The second cut-based model, WN-CUT-TOPICS, extends WN-CUT by adding two extra layers of latent variables.",
        "Firstly, the choice of cut is conditional on a ?topic?",
        "variable z rather than directly conditioned on the predicate; when the topic vocabulary Z is much smaller than the cut vocabulary C, this has the effect of clustering the cuts.",
        "Secondly, Model 2 Generative story for WN-CUT-TOPICS",
        "instead of immediately drawing a word once a cut has been chosen, the model first draws a synset s and then draws a word from the vocabularyWs associated with that synset.",
        "This has two advantages; it directly disambiguates each observation to a specific synset rather than to a region of the hierarchy and it should also improve plausibility predictions for rare synonyms of common arguments.",
        "The generative story for WN-CUT-TOPICS is given in Algorithm 2; the distribution over arguments for p is given in (6) and the corresponding posterior estimate in (7):",
        "As before, fzp, fcz , fsc and fws are the respective co-occurrence counts of topics/predicates, cuts/topics, synsets/cuts and words/synsets in the sampling state and f?p, f?z , f?c and f's are the corresponding marginal counts.",
        "Since WN-CUT and WN-CUT-TOPICS are constructed from multinomials with Dirichlet priors, it is relatively straightforward to train them by collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), an iterative method whereby each latent variable in the model is stochastically updated according to the distribution given by conditioning on the current latent variable assignments of all other tokens.",
        "In the case of WN-CUT, this amounts to updating the cut assignment ci for each token in turn.",
        "For WN-CUT-TOPICS there are three variables to update; ci and si must be updated simultaneously, but zi can be updated independently for the benefit of efficiency.",
        "Although WordNet contains 82,115 noun synsets, updates for ci and si can be computed very efficiently, as there are typically few possible synsets for a given word type and few possible cuts for a given synset (the maximum synset depth is 19).",

        "One obvious explanation is that the training data for this relation has fewer tokens per predicate, making it more difficult to learn their preferences.",
        "A second, more hypothetical, explanation is that the ontological structure of WordNet is a relatively poor fit for the preferences of nominal modifiers; it is well-known that almost any pair of nouns can combine to produce a minimally plausible noun-noun compound (Downing, 1977) and it may be that this behaviour is ill-suited by the assumption that preferences are sparse distributions over regions of WordNet."

        "In this paper we have presented a range of Bayesian selectional preference models that incorporate knowledge about the structure of a lexical hierarchy.",
        "One motivation for this work was to test the hypothesis that such knowledge can be helpful in constructing robust models that can handle rare and unseen arguments.",
        "To this end we have reported a plausibility-based evaluation in which our models outperform previously proposed WordNet-based preference models and make sensible predictions for out-of-vocabulary items.",
        "A second motivation, which we intend to explore in future work, is to apply our models in the context of a word sense disambiguation task.",
        "Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of distributional Bayesian selectional preference models for predicting lexical substitutes (O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Korhonen, 2011) but these models lack a principled way to map a word onto its most likely WordNet sense.",
        "The methods presented in this paper offer a promising solution to this issue.",
        "Another potential research direction is integration of semantic relation extraction algorithms with WordNet or other lexical resources, along the lines of Pennacchiotti and Pantel (2006) and Van Durme et al. (2009)."
