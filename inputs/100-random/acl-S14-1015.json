        "to much of the visual content needed to generate complete, human-like sentences.",
        "In this paper, we instead study generation with more complete visual support, as provided by human annotations, allowing us to develop more comprehensive models than previously considered.",
        "Such models have the dual benefit of (1) providing new insights into how to construct more human-like sentences and (2) allowing us to perform experiments that systematically study the contribution of different visual cues in generation, suggesting which automatic detectors would be most beneficial for generation.",
        "In an effort to approximate relatively complete visual recognition, we collected manually labeled representations of objects, parts, attributes and activities for a benchmark caption generation dataset that includes images paired with human authored 110 descriptions (Rashtchian et al., 2010).",
        "2 As seen in Figure 1, the labels include object boundaries and descriptive text, here including the facts that the children are ?riding?",
        "and ?walking?",
        "and that they are ?young.?",
        "Our goal is to be as exhaustive as possible, giving equal treatment to all objects.",
        "For example, the annotations in Figure 1 contain enough information to generate the first three sentences and most of the content in the remaining two.",
        "Labels gathered in this way are a type of feature norms (McRae et al., 2005), which have been used in the cognitive science literature to approximate human perception and were recently used as a visual proxy in distributional semantics (Silberer and Lapata, 2012).",
        "We present the first effort, that we are aware of, for using feature norms to study image description generation.",
        "Such rich data allows us to develop significantly more comprehensive generation models.",
        "We divide generation into choices about which visual content to select and how to realize a sentence that describes that content.",
        "Our approach is grammar-based, feature-rich, and jointly models both decisions.",
        "The content selection model includes latent variables that align phrases to visual objects and features that, for example, measure how visual salience and spatial relationships influence which objects are mentioned.",
        "The realization approach considers a number of cues, including language model scores, word specificity, and relative spatial information (e.g. to produce the best spatial prepositions), when producing the final sentence.",
        "When used with a reranking model, including global cues such as sentence length, this approach provides a full generation system.",
        "Our experiments demonstrate high quality visual content selection, within 90% of human performance on unigram BLEU, and improved complete sentence generation, nearly halving the difference from human performance to two baselines on 4-gram BLEU.",
        "In ablations, we measure the importance of different annotations and visual cues, showing that annotation of activities and relative bounding box information between objects are crucial to generating human-like description.",
        "2 Related Work A number of approaches have been proposed for constructing sentences from images, including copying captions from other images (Farhadi 2 Available at : http://homes.cs.washington.edu/?my89/ et al., 2010; Ordonez et al., 2011), using text surrounding an image in a news article (Feng and Lapata, 2010), filling visual sentence templates (Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Elliott and Keller, 2013), and stitching together existing sentence descriptions (Gupta and Mannem, 2012; Kuznetsova et al., 2012).",
        "However, due to the lack of reliable detectors, especially for activi-ties, many previous systems have a small vocabulary and must generate many words, including verbs, with no direct visual support.",
        "These problems also extend to video caption systems (Yu and Siskind, 2013; Krishnamoorthy et al., 2013).",
        "The Midge algorithm (Mitchell et al., 2012) is most closely related to our approach, and will provide a baseline in our experiments.",
        "Midge is syntax-driven but again uses a small vocabulary without direct visual support for every word.",
        "It outputs a large set of sentences to describe all triplets of recognized objects in the scene, but does not include a content selection model to select the best sentence.",
        "We extend Midge with content and sentence selection rules to use it as a baseline.",
        "The visual facts we annotate are motivated by research in machine vision.",
        "Attributes are a good intermediate representation for categorization (Farhadi et al., 2009).",
        "Activity recognition is an emerging area in images (Li and Fei-Fei, 2007; Yao et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2013) and video (Weinland et al., 2011), although less studied than object recognition.",
        "Also, parts have been widely used in object recognition (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010).",
        "Yet, no work tests the contribution of these labels for sentence generation.",
        "There is also a significant amount of work on other grounded language problems, where related models have been developed.",
        "Visual referring expression generation systems (Krahmer and Van Deemter, 2012; Mitchell et al., 2013; FitzGerald et al., 2013) aim to identify specific objects, a sub-problem we deal with when describing images more generally.",
        "Other research generates descriptions in simulated worlds and, like this work, uses feature rich models (Angeli et al., 2010), or syntactic structures like PCFGs (Chen et al., 2010; Konstas and Lapata, 2012) but does not combine the two.",
        "Finally, Zitnick and Parikh (2013) study sentences describing clipart scenes.",
        "They present a number of factors influencing overall descriptive quality, several of which we use in sentence generation for the first time.",
        "111 3 Dataset We collected a dataset of richly annotated images to approximate gold standard visual recognition.",
        "In collecting the data, we sought a visual annotation with sufficient coverage to support the generation of as many of the words in the original image descriptions as possible.",
        "We also aimed to make it as visually exhaustive as possible?giving equal treatment to all visible objects.",
        "This ensures less bias from annotators?",

        "This dataset will be available for future experiments.",

        "Restricting ourselves to Creative Commons images, we sampled 500 images for annotation.",
        "We collected annotations of images in three stages using MTurk, and assigned each annotation task to 3-5 workers to improve quality through redundancy (Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "Below we describe the process for annotating a single image.",
        "Stage 1: We prompted five turkers to list all objects in an image, ignoring objects that are parts of larger objects (e.g., the arms of a person), which we collected later in Stage 3.",
        "This list also included groups, such as crowds of people.",
        "Stage 2: For each unique object label from Stage 1, we asked two turkers to draw a polygon around the object identified.",
        "3 In cases where the object is a group, we also asked for the number of objects present (1-6 or many).",
        "Finally, we created a list of all references to the object from the first stage, which we call the Object facet.",
        "Stage 3: For each object or group, we prompted three turkers to provide descriptive phrases of: ?",
