        "One of the challenging properties of natural language is that the same semantic content can typically be expressed by many different surface forms.",
        "As the ability to deal with paraphrases holds great potential for improving the coverage of NLP systems, a substantial body of research addressing recognition, extraction and generation of paraphrases has emerged (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010; Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Paraphrase Generation can be regarded as a translation task in which source and target language are the same.",
        "Both Paraphrase Generation and Machine Translation (MT) are instances of Text-To-Text Generation, which involves transforming one text into another, obeying certain restrictions.",
        "Here these restrictions are that the generated text must be grammatically well-formed and semantically/translationally equivalent to the source text.",
        "Addionally Paraphrase Generation requires that the output should differ from the input to a certain degree.",
        "The similarity between Paraphrase Generation and MT suggests that methods and tools originally developed for MT could be exploited for Paraphrase Generation.",
        "One popular approach - arguably the most successful so far - is Statistical Phrase-based Machine Translation (PBMT), which learns phrase translation rules from aligned bilingual text corpora (Och et al., 1999; Vogel et al., 2000; Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Prior work has explored the use of PBMT for paraphrase generation (Quirk et al., 2004; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Madnani et al., 2007; Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Wubben et al., 2010)",
        "However, since many researchers believe that PBMT has reached a performance ceiling, ongoing research looks into more structural approaches to statistical MT (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Och and",
        "Ney, 2004; Khalilov and Fonollosa, 2009).",
        "Syntax-based MT attempts to extract translation rules in terms of syntactic constituents or subtrees rather than arbitrary phrases, presupposing syntactic structures for source, target or both languages.",
        "Syntactic information might lead to better results in the area of grammatical well-formedness, and unlike phrase-based MT that uses contiguous n-grams, syntax enables the modeling of long-distance translation patterns.",
        "While the verdict on whether or not this approach leads to any significant performance gain is still out, a similar line of reasoning would suggest that syntax-based paraphrasing may offer similar advantages over phrase-based paraphrasing.",
        "Considering the fact that the success of PBMT can partly be attributed to the abundance of large parallel corpora, and that sufficiently large parallel corpora are still lacking for paraphrase generation, using more linguistically motivated methods might prove beneficial for paraphrase generation.",
        "At the same time, automatic syntactic analysis introduces errors in the parse trees, as no syntactic parser is perfect.",
        "Likewise, automatic alignment of syntactic phrases may be prone to errors.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is a systematic comparison between phrase-based and syntax-based paraphrase generation using an off-the-shelf statistical machine translation (SMT) decoder, namely Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and the word-alignment tool GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Training data derives from a new, large scale (2.1M tokens) paraphrase corpus for Dutch, which has been recently released.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the paraphrase corpus from which provides training and test data.",
        "Next, Section 3 describes the paraphrase generation methods and the experimental setup.",
        "Results are presented in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss our findings and formulate our conclusions."

        "The main bottleneck in building SMT systems is the need for a substantial amount of parallel aligned text.",
        "Likewise, exploiting SMT for paraphrasing requires large amounts of monolingual parallel text.",
        "However, paraphrase corpora are scarce; the situation is more dire than in MT, and this has caused some studies to focus on the automatic harvesting of paraphrase corpora.",
        "The use of monolingual parallel text corpora was first suggested by Barzilay and McKeown (2001), who built their corpus using various alternative human-produced translations of literary texts and then applied machine learning or multi-sequence alignment for extracting paraphrases.",
        "In a similar vein, Pang et al.",
        "(2003) used a corpus of alternative English translations of Chinese news stories in combination with a syntax-based algorithm that automatically builds word lattices, in which paraphrases can be identified.",
        "So-called comparable monolingual corpora, for instance independently written news reports describing the same event, in which some pairs of sentences",
        "The first manually collected paraphrase corpus is the Microsoft Research Paraphrase (MSRP) Corpus (Dolan et al., 2004), consisting of 5,801 sentence pairs, sampled from a larger corpus of news articles.",
        "However, it is rather small and contains no sub-sentential allignments.",
        "Cohn et al.",
        "(2008) developed a parallel monolingual corpus of 900 sentence pairs annotated at the word and phrase level.",
        "However, all of these corpora are small from an SMT perspective.",
        "Recently a new large-scale paraphrase corpus for Dutch, the DAESO corpus, was released.",
        "The corpus contains both samples of parallel and comparable text in which similar sentences, phrases and words are aligned.",
        "One part of the corpus is manually aligned, whereas another part is automatically aligned using a data-driven aligner trained on the first part.",
        "The DAESO corpus is extensively described in (Marsi and Krahmer, 2011); the summary here is limited to aspects relevant to the work at hand.",
        "The corpus contains the following types of text: (1) alternative translations in Dutch of three literary works of fiction; (2) autocue text from televion broadcast news as read by the news reader, and the corresponding subtitles; (3) headlines from similar news articles obtained from Google News Dutch; (4) press releases about the same news topic from two different press agencies; (5) similar answers retrieved from a document collection in the medical domain, originally created for evaluating question-answering systems.",
        "In a first step, similar sentences were automatically aligned, after which alignments were manually corrected.",
        "In the case of the parallel book texts, aligned sentences are (approximate) paraphrases.",
        "To a lesser degree, this is also true for the news headlines.",
        "The autocue-subtitle pairs are mostly examples of sentence compression, as the subtitle tends to be a compressed version of the read autocue text.",
        "In contrast, the press releases and the QA answers, are characterized by a great deal of one-to-many sentence alignments, as well as sentences left unaligned, as is to be expected in comparable text.",
        "Most sentences in these types of text tend to have only partial overlap in meaning.",
        "Next, aligned sentences were tokenized and parsed with the Alpino parser for Dutch (Bouma et al., 2001).",
        "The parser provides a relatively theory-neutral syntactic analysis which is a blend of phrase structure analysis and dependency analysis, with a backbone of phrasal constituents and arcs labeled with syntactic function/dependency labels.",
        "The alignments not only concern paraphrases in the strict sense, i.e., expressions that are semantically equivalent, but extend to expressions that are semantically similar in less strict ways, for instance, where one phrase is either more specific or more general than the related phrase.",
        "For this reason, alignments are also labeled according to a limited set of semantic similarity relations.",
        "Since these relations were not used in the current study, we will not discuss them further here.",
        "The corpus comprises over 2.1 million tokens, 678 thousand of which are manually annotated and 1,511 thousand are automatically processed.",
        "To give a more complete overview of the sizes of different corpus segments, some properties of the manually aligned corpus are listed in Table 1.",
        "Properties of the automatically aligned part are similar, except for the fact that it only contains text of the news and QA type."
