        "This year, we directed our research toward addressing the word order problem for statistical machine translation (SMT) and discover its impact on output translation quality.",
        "We reorder the words of a sentence of the source language with respect to the word order of the target language and a given source-side parse tree.",
        "The difference from the baseline Moses-based translation system lies in the pre-translation step, in which we introduce a discriminative source string permutation model based on probabilistic parse tree transduction.",
        "The idea here is to permute the order ofthe source words in such a way that the resulting permutation allows as monotone a translation process as possible is not new.",
        "This approach to enhance SMT by using a reordering step prior to translation has proved to be successful in improving translation quality for many translation tasks, see (Genzel, 2010; Costa-jussa and Fonollosa, 2006; Collins et al., 2005), for example.",
        "The general problem of source-side reordering is that the number of permutations is factorial in n, and learning a sequence of transductions for explaining a source permutation can be computationally rather challenging.",
        "We propose to address this problem by defining the source-side permutation process as the learning problem of how to transfer a given source parse tree into a parse tree that minimizes the divergence from target word order.",
        "Our reordering system is inspired by the direction taken in (Tromble and Eisner, 2009), but differs in defining the space of permutations, using local probabilistic tree transductions, as well as in the learning objective aiming at scoring permutations based on a log-linear interpolation of a local syntax-based model with a global string-based (language) model.",
        "The reordering (novel) and translation (standard) components are described in the following sections.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "After a brief description of the phrase-based translation system in Section 2, we present the architecture and details of our reordering system (Section 3), Section 4 reviews related work, Section 5 reports the experimental setup, details the submissions and discusses the results, while Section 6 concludes the article."

        "Unfolding the crossing instances in a should lead to as monotone an alignment a as possible between a permutation s of s and the target string t. Conducting such a \"mono-tonization\" on the parallel corpus gives two parallel corpora: (1) a source-to-permutation parallel corpus (s – s ) and (2) a source permutation-totarget parallel corpus (s – t).",

        "The rationale behind this interpolation is that our source permutation approach aims at finding the optimal permutation s of s that can serve as input for a subsequent translation model.",
        "Hence, we aim at tree transductions that are syntactically motivated that also lead to improved string permutations.",
        "In this sense, the tree transduction definitions can be seen as an efficient and syntactically informed way to define the space of possible permutations.",
