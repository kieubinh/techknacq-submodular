        "Research in automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics has been a key driving force behind the recent advances of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems.",
        "The early seminal work on automatic MT metrics (e.g., BLEU and NIST) is largely based on n-gram matches (Papineni et al., 2002; Doddington, 2002).",
        "Despite their simplicity, these measures have shown good correlation with human judgments, and enabled large-scale evaluations across many different MT systems, without incurring the huge labor cost of human evaluation (Callison-Burch et al. (2009; 2010; 2011), inter alia).",
        "Later metrics that move beyond n-grams achieve higher accuracy and improved robustness from resources like WordNet synonyms (Miller et al., 1990), paraphrasing (Zhou et al., 2006; Snover et al., 2009; Denkowski and Lavie, 2010), and syntactic parse structures (Liu et al., 2005; Owczarzak et al., 2008; He et al., 2010).",
        "But a common problem in these metrics is they typically resort to ad-hoc tuning methods instead of principled approaches to incorporate linguistic features.",
        "Recent models use linear or SVM regression and train them against human judg-ments to automatic learn feature weights, and have shown state-of-the-art correlation with human judg-ments (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b; Sun et al., 2008; Padó et al., 2009).",
        "The drawback, however, is they rely on time-consuming",
        "(Doc:AFP CMN 20070703.0005, system09, sent 1).",
        "The three rows below are the best state transition (edit) sequences that transforms REF to SYS, according to the three proposed models.",
        "The corresponding alignments generated by the models (pFSM, pPDA, pPDA+f ) are shown with different styled lines, with later models in the order generating strictly more alignments than earlier ones.",
        "The gold human evaluation score is 6.5, and model predictions are: pPDA+f 5.5, pPDA 4.3, pFSM 3.1, METEORR 3.2, TERR 2.8. preprocessing modules to extract linguistic features (e.g., a full end-to-end textual entailment system was needed in Padó et al. (2009)), which severely limits their practical use.",
        "Furthermore, these models employ a large number of features (on the order of hundreds), and consequently make the model predictions opaque and hard to analyze."

        "We start off by framing the problem of machine translation evaluation in terms of weighted edit distance calculated using probabilistic finite state machines (pFSMs).",
        "A FSM defines a language by accepting a string of input tokens in the language, and rejecting those that are not.",
        "A probabilistic FSM defines the probability that a string is in a language, extending on the concept of a FSM.",
        "Commonly used models such as HMMs, n-gram models, Markov Chains, probabilistic finite state transducers and PCFGs all fall in the broad family of pFSMs (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Eisner, 2002; Kumar and Byrne, 2003; Vidal et al., 2005).",
        "Unlike all the other applications of FSMs where tokens in the language are words, in our language tokens are edit operations.",
        "A string of tokens that our FSM accepts is an edit sequence that transforms a reference translation (denoted as ref ) into a system translation (sys).",
        "Our pFSM has a unique start and stop state, and one state per edit operation (i.e., Insert, Delete, Substitution).",
        "The probability of an edit sequence e is generated by the model is the product of the state transition probabilities in the pFSM, formally described as:",
        "We featurize each of the state changes with a log-linear parameterization; f is a set of binary feature functions defined over pairs of neighboring states (by the Markov assumption) and the input sentences, and ?",
        "are the associated feature weights; r and s are shorthand for ref and sys; Z is a partition function.",
        "In this basic pFSM model, the feature functions are simply identity functions that emit the current state, and the state transition sequence of the previous state and the current state.",
        "The feature weights are then automatically learned by training a global regression model where some translational equivalence judgment score (e.g., human assessment score, or HTER (Snover et al., 2006)) for each sys and ref translation pair is the regression target (y?).",

        "At test time, y/(|s|+ |r|)+?",
        "is computed as the predicted score.",

        "In other words, all but the three matching-based substitutions are disallowed.",
        "The start state can transition into any of the edit states with a constant unit cost, and each edit state can transition into any other edit state if and only if the edit operation involved is valid at the current edit position (e.g., the model cannot transition into Delete state if it is already at the end of ref ; similarly it cannot transition into Slemma unless the lemma of the two words under edit in sys and ref match).",
        "When the end of both sentences are reached, the model transitions into the stop state and ends the edit sequence.",
        "The first row in Figure 1 starting with pFSM shows a state transition sequence for an example sys/ref translation pair.",
        "There exists a one-to-one correspondence between substitution edits and word alignments.",
        "Therefore this example state transition sequence correctly generates an alignment for the word 43 and people.",
        "It is helpful to compare with the TER metric (Snover et al., 2006), which is based on the idea of word error rate measured in edit distance, to better understand the intuition behind our model.",
        "There are two major improvements in our model: 1) the edit operations in our model are weighted, as defined by the feature functions and weights; 2) the weights are automatically learned, instead of being uniform or manually set; and 3) we model state transitions, which can be understood as a bigram extension of the unigram edit distance model used in TER.",
        "For example, if in our learned model the feature for two consecutive Sword states has a positive weight, then our model would favor consecutive same word substitutions, whereas in the TER model the order of the substitution does not matter.",
