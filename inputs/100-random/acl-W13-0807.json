        "Institute for Logic, Language and Computation.",
        "belief, however, a synchronous grammar (see e.g., (Chiang, 2005; Satta and Peserico, 2005)) does not accept (or parse) word alignments.",
        "This is because a synchronous derivation generates a tree pair with a bijective binary relation (links) between their non-terminal nodes.",
        "For deciding whether a given word alignment is generated/accepted by a given synchronous grammar, it is necessary to interpret the synchronous derivations down to the lexical level.",
        "However, it is formally defined yet how to unambiguously interpret the synchronous derivations of a synchronous grammar as word alignments.",
        "One major difficulty is that synchronous productions, in their most general form, may contain unaligned terminal sequences.",
        "Consider, for instance, the relatively non-complex synchronous production ?X ?",

        "X(3)?",
        "where superscript (i) stands for aligned instances of nonterminal X and all Greek symbols stand for arbitrary non-empty terminals sequences.",
        "Given a word aligned sentence pair it is necessary to bind the terminal sequence by alignments consistent with the given word alignment, and then parse the word alignment with the thus enriched grammar rules.",
        "This is not complex if we assume that each of the source terminal sequences is contiguously aligned with a target contiguous sequence, but difficult if we assume arbitrary alignments, including many-to-one and non-contiguously aligned chunks.",
        "One important goal of this paper is to propose a formal characterization of what it means to synchronously parse a word alignment.",
        "Our formal characterization is borrowed from the ?parsing as in-tersection\" paradigm, e.g., (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964; Lang, 1988; van Noord, 1995; Nederhof and Satta,",
        "2004).",
        "Conceptually, our characterization makes use of three algorithms.",
        "Firstly, parse the unaligned sentence pair with the synchronous grammar to obtain a set of synchronous derivations, i.e., trees.",
        "Secondly, interpret a word alignment as generating a set of synchronous trees representing the recursive translation equivalence relations of interest1 perceived in the word alignment.",
        "And finally, intersect the sets of nodes in the two sets of synchronous trees to check whether the grammar can generate (parts of) the word alignment.",
        "The formal detail of each of these three steps is provided in sections 3 to 5.",
        "We think that alignment parsing is relevant for current research because it highlights the difference between alignments in training data and alignments accepted by a synchronous grammar (learned from data).",
        "This is useful for literature on learning from word aligned parallel corpora (e.g., (Zens and Ney, 2003; DeNero et al., 2006; Blunsom et al., 2009; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009; Riesa and Marcu, 2010; Mylonakis and Sima?an, 2011; Haghighi et al., 2009; McCarley et al., 2011)).",
        "A theoretical, formalized characterization of the alignment parsing problem is likely to improve the choices made in empirical work as well.",
        "We exemplify our claims by providing yet another empirical study of the stability of the ITG hypothesis.",
        "Our study highlights some of the technical choices left implicit in preceding work as explained in the next section.",
        "2 First application to the ITG hypothesis A grammar formalism is a whole set/family of synchronous grammars.",
        "For example, ITG (Wu, 1997) defines a family of inversion-transduction grammars differing among them in the exact set of synchronous productions, terminals and non-terminals.",
        "Given a synchronous grammar formalism and an input word alignment, a relevant theoretical question is whether there exists an instance synchronous grammar that generates the word alignment exactly.",
        "We will refer to this question as the alignment coverage problem.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach to the alignment coverage problem using the three-step solution proposed above for parsing word align-1The translation equivalence relations of interest may vary in kind as we will exemplify later.",
        "The known phrase pairs are merely one possible kind.",
        "ments by arbitrary synchronous grammars.",
        "Most current use of synchronous grammars is limited to a subclass using a pair of nonterminals, e.g., (Chiang, 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Mylonakis and Sima?an, 2011), thereby remaining within the confines of the ITG formalism (Wu, 1997).",
        "On the one hand, this is because of computational complexity reasons.",
        "On the other, this choice relies on existing empirical evidence of what we will call the ?ITG hypothesis\", freely rephrased as follows: the ITG formalism is sufficient for representing a major percentage of reorderings in translation data in general.",
        "Although checking whether a word alignment can be generated by ITG is far simpler than for arbitrary synchronous grammars, there is a striking variation in the approaches taken in the existing literature, e.g., (Zens and Ney, 2003; Wellington et al., 2006; S?gaard and Wu, 2009; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; S?gaard and Kuhn, 2009; S?gaard, 2010).",
        "S?gaard and Wu (S?gaard and Wu, 2009) observe justifiably that the literature studying the ITG alignment coverage makes conflicting choices in method and data, and reports significantly diverging alignment coverage scores.",
        "We hypothesize here that the major conflicting choices in method (what to count and how to parse) are likely due to the absence of a well-understood, formalized method for parsing word alignments even under ITG.",
        "In this paper we apply our formal approach to the ITG case, contributing new empirical evidence concerning the ITG hypothesis.",
        "For our empirical study we exemplify our approach by detailing an algorithm dedicated to ITG in Normal-Form (NF-ITG).",
        "While our algorithm is in essence equivalent to existing algorithms for checking binarizability of permutations, e.g.,(Wu, 1997; Huang et al., 2009), the formal foundations preceding it concern nailing down the choices made in parsing arbitrary word alignments, as opposed to (bijective) permutations.",
        "The formalization is our way to resolve some of the major points of differences in existing literature.",
        "We report new coverage results for ITG parsing of manual as well as automatic alignments, showing the contrast between the two kinds.",
        "While the latter seems built for phrase extraction, trading-off precision for recall, the former is heavily marked with id",
        "iomatic expressions.",
        "Our coverage results make explicit a relevant dilemma.",
        "To hierarchically parse the current automatic word alignments exactly, we will need more general synchronous reordering mechanisms than ITG, with increased risk of exponential parsing algorithms (Wu, 1997; Satta and Peserico, 2005).",
        "But if we abandon these word alignments, we will face the exponential problem of learning reordering arbitrary permutations, cf. (Tromble and Eisner, 2009).",
        "Our results also exhibit the importance of explicitly defining the units of translation equivalence when studying (ITG) coverage of word alignments.",
        "The more complex the choice of translation equivalence relations, the more difficult it is to parse the word alignments."

        "Grammatical Coverage (GC) is defined as the percentage word alignments (sentence pairs) in a parallel corpus that can be covered by an instance of the grammar (NF-ITG) (cf.",

        "The first thing to notice is that there is just a small difference between the Grammatical Coverage scores for these two definitions.",
        "The difference is in the order of a few percentage points, the largest difference is seen for Portuguese?French (79% v.s 74% Grammatical Coverage), for some language pairs there is no difference.",
        "For the automatically aligned corpora the absolute difference is on average about 2%.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that there are only very few discontiguous TEUs that can be covered by NF-ITG in this data.",

        "Intuitively, one would expect that more alignment links make alignments more complicated.",
        "This turns out to not always be the case.",
        "Further inspection of the LREC alignments also shows that these alignments often consist of parts that are completely linked.",
        "Such completely linked parts are by definition treated as atomic TEUs, which could make the alignments look simpler.",
        "This contrasts with the situation in the manually aligned English?German corpus where on average less alignment links exist per word.",
        "Examples 1 and 2 show that dense alignments can be simpler than less dense ones.",
        "This is because sometimes the density implies idiomatic TEUs which leads to rather flat lexical productions.",
        "We think that idiomatic TEUs reasonably belong in the lexicon.",
        "When we look at the results for the automatically aligned corpora at the lowest rows in the table, we see that these are comparable to the results for the manually aligned English?German corpus (and much lower than the results for the LREC corpora).",
        "This could be explained by the fact that the manually aligned English?German is not only Europarl data, but possibly also because the manual alignments themselves were obtained by initialization with the GIZA++ alignments.",
        "In any case, the manually and automatically acquired alignments for this data are not too different from the perspective of NF-ITG.",
        "Further differences might exist if we would employ another class of grammars, e.g., full SCFGs.",
        "One the one hand, we find that manual alignments are well but not fully covered by NF-ITG.",
        "On the other, the automatic alignments are not covered well but NF-ITG.",
        "This suggests that these automatic alignments are difficult to cover by NF-ITG, and the reason could be that these alignments are built heuristically by trading precision for recall cf.",

        "Interestingly, these upperbounds are determined by filtering/excluding complex alignment phenomena known formally to be beyond (NF-)ITG.",
        "None of these earlier efforts discussed explicitly the dilemmas of instantiating a grammar formalism or how to formally parse word alignments.",
        "The work in (Zens and Ney, 2003; S?gaard and Wu, 2009), defining and counting TEUs, provides a far tighter upperbound than (Wellington et al., 2006), who use the disjunctive interpretation of word alignments, interpreting multiple alignment links of the same word as alternatives.",
        "We adopt the conjunctive interpretation of word alignments like a majority of work in MT, e.g., (Ayan and Dorr, 2006; Fox, 2002; S?gaard and Wu, 2009; S?gaard, 2010).",
        "In deviation from earlier work, the work in (S?-gaard and Kuhn, 2009; S?gaard and Wu, 2009; S?gaard, 2010) discusses TEUs defined over word alignments explicitly, and defines evaluation metrics based on TEUs.",
        "In particular, Sogaard (S?gaard, 2010) writes that he employs \"a more aggressive search\" for TEUs than earlier work, thereby leading to far tighter upperbounds on hand aligned data.",
        "Our results seem to back this claim but, unfortunately, we could not pin down the formal details of his procedure.",
        "More remotely related, the work described in (Huang et al., 2009) presents a binarization algorithm for productions of an SCFG instance (as opposed to formalism).",
        "Although somewhat related, this is different from checking whether there exists an NF-ITG instance (which has to be determined) that covers a word alignment.",
        "In contrast with earlier work, we present the alignment coverage problem as an intersection of two partially ordered sets (graphs).",
        "The partial order over TEUs as well as the formal definition of parsing as intersection in this work are novel elements, making explicit the view of word alignments as automata generating partially order sets."
