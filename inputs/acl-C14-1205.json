        "Lexicon acquisition represents one key way that the information in large corpora and other resources can be leveraged in various NLP tasks, particularly when the range of lexical items involved in a particular phenomenon is much more diverse than can typically be captured in manually-built resources.",
        "Another property of the lexicon which might limit a manual approach is the fact that certain attributes are not discrete, instead falling on a continuous spectrum; although there are manually-built dictionaries which contain fine-grained judgments of spectra?an example is the MRC psychological database (Coltheart, 1980)?these tend to be very low in coverage, reflecting the difficulty in collecting this information.",
        "Within computational linguistics, the continuous lexical attribute that has received the most attention is undoubtedly the positive-negative spectrum, otherwise known as semantic orientation (SO) or polarity.",
        "Much of the work focused on acquisition of this attribute at the lexical level has involved simplification to a binary (positive-negative) or ternary (positive-neutral-negative) distinction (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Takamura et al., 2005; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Rao and Ravichandra, 2009; Mohammad et al., 2009; Volkova et al., 2013) but other work explicitly offers a continuous quantification (Turney, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003; Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "Another spectrum with a prominent role in the lexicon is formality (Brooke et al., 2010; Lahiri et al., 2011), which includes colloquial words at one end, socially-distancing words at the other, and common vocabulary in the middle.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on these two spectra; the method presented, however, is intended to be general, and as such could be easily applied to other spectra such as those in the MRC database, e.g. abstractness (Turney et al., 2011), and other kinds of variation captured in, for instance, Osgood's semantic differential (Osgood et al., 1957).",
        "The typical approach to this problem involves semi-supervised methods using vector space and/or graph representations and a set of seed terms.",
        "Our method is novel in that it uses fully supervised SVM ranking of co-occurrence profiles, i.e. normalized counts of instances of binary text co-occurrence between the target word and a large set of profiling words, selected on the basis of their frequency, in a publicly-available blog corpus.",
        "The seed terms from earlier methods are now viewed as training examples for building a supervised model that can connect the distributions of co-occurring words in this wider vocabulary to relative locations on a continuous spectrum.",
        "This approach depends somewhat upon improved manual lexical resources available for these tasks, such as the SO-CAL dictionary (Taboada This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "2172 et al., 2011) in the case of polarity, but we limit our (word) training set size in order to show it will work in resource-scarce situations, such as languages other than English.",
        "Our method is straightforward, practical, and offers essentially full coverage, including words and lexicogrammtical patterns that are simply not accessible by the many popular methods that are primarily based on WordNet.",
        "To evaluate, we compare our method with popular alternatives in both polarity and formality, with particular emphasis on other methods based on corpus co-occurrence that have also been shown to be generalizable across various spectra, i.e. LSA and PMI.",
        "For both spectra of interest here, we evaluate both intrinsically using pairwise comparisons from manually-built lexical resources, and also extrinsically in downstream tasks such as text-level polarity classification and sentence-level formality judgments.",
        "We show our method is consistently superior across our various evaluations.",
        "We also show that not only are co-occurrence profiles a good source of information for supervised ranking, but that a focus on ranking rather than regression in this space appears to be fundamental to the success of a supervised approach to lexical spectra.",
        "2 Related Work Viewed primarily as a categorical task, the creation or expansion of lexical resources for sentiment analysis is a commonly-addressed problem.",
        "In addition to SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), which we will compare to directly to here, there are numerous mostly semi-supervised approaches based on exploiting the glosses and/or the graph structure of WordNet to determine whether a word is positive or negative (Kamps et al., 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; An-dreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Rao and Ravichandra, 2009; Hassan and Radev, 2010), or taking advantage of some other lexicographic resources (Mohammad et al., 2009; Klebanov et al., 2013).",
        "The earliest corpus-based approach was that of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) who used local syntactic in-formation, i.e. conjunctions, to make connections between adjectives; other work that makes use of local patterns in a corpus includes that of Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007) and Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006).",
        "Turney (2002) built a continuous polarity lexicon using PMI based on Internet hit counts as a useful measure of relatedness between seeds, and Turney and Littman (2003) compared this approach with LSA, which uses general patterns of co-occurrence based on dimensionality reduction.",
        "Velikovich et al. (2010) combined web-scale corpora with a graph-based approach, assigning polarity scores to n-grams on the basis of the maximum weighed path from an n-gram to the seed terms, using a small (6-word) context around the word.",
        "Like us, Volkova et al. (2013) use social media, iteratively labeling tweets and words for subjectivity and polarity.",
        "Fully-supervised approaches to polarity lexicon acquisition are rare, but one example is the work of Chetviorkin and Loukachevitch (2012), who classify words as being sentiment-relevant in Russian using a small set of statistical features, including ratios across disparate corpora.",
        "Our interest in the continuous aspect of polarity overlaps with work on deriving the semantic intensity of lexical items from corpora (Sheinman and Tokunaga, 2009); in this task, small sets of synonyms are ranked according to their intensity, including (but not limited to) polarity.",
        "De Melo and Bansal (2013) use a Mixed Integer Linear Programing algorithm to combine information from multiple pairs into a single coherent ranking.",
        "As with some of the work in polarity, the focus is on adjectives and local patterns which explicitly distinguish degrees of intensity e.g. not only x but also y, which limits its range of application; it would not, for instance, be useful for formality or other more pragmatic variations.",
        "Beyond the our work in LSA-based formality lexicon creation (Brooke et al., 2010) and the sentence-level formality annotation of Lahiri et al. (2011), which we discuss later in more detail, there is a relatively small amount of computational research that directly addresses formality.",
        "At lexical level, Li and Yarowsky (2008) identify formal and informal synonyms in Chinese.",
        "Heylighen and Dewaele (2002) and Li et al. (2013) both offer text-level quantifications of formality; the former is based on POS frequency, while the latter is based on the Coh-Metrix textual metrics.",
        "Using these kinds of metrics, formality has been evaluated in social media (Mosquera and Moreda, 2012).",
        "A supervised text classification approach to formality is offered by Sheika and Inkpen (2012).",
        "Lexical formality is obviously related to lexicon-based readability (Kidwell et al., 2009) and lexical simplification (Carroll et al., 1999), and is 2173 also relevant to the recent interest in identifying social relationships (Peterson et al., 2011) and shows of politeness (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013).",
        "3 Method Our approach to lexicon acquisition falls into the general category of corpus-based techniques.",
        "For both attributes addressed in this paper, we use the same corpus, the 2009 ICWSM Spinn3r dataset (Burton et al., 2009), a publicly-available blog corpus which we also used in our earlier work on lexical formality (Brooke et al., 2010).",
        "Blogs are a good resource for broad lexical acquisition because they are very broad in style and content, and are available in essentially unlimited amounts.",
        "We use the English Tier 1 (high-quality) blogs that have at least 100 word types, excluding duplicate texts; after this filtering, our dataset contains a total of about 2.4 million blogs.",
        "To build a lexicon for any continuous attribute of interest, we begin by creating co-occurrence profiles as follows: First, we select a document frequency range min-df, max-df that determines a set of profile words P in a corpus S, where for each p ?",
        "P, the document frequency df S p of p in S is limited to be min-df < df S p < max-df ; that is, each profile word appears in more than min-df documents, but fewer than max-df documents in our corpus.",
        "Then, given a sample size n and a target word w that we wish to profile, we sample a set of n texts from S which contain the target word (or all the documents where the word appears, if it appears fewer than n times), and count the document frequency of each profile word p in this subcorpus, T w .",
        "We ignore the term frequencies within individual documents because a binary representation is known to be preferred for stylistic dimensions like formality (Brooke et al., 2010), and this seems to be also somewhat true in the domain of polarity, where better results can be obtained when multiple instances of a polar word are discounted (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "To avoid overfitting our statistical model, we do not count a word as appearing with itself.",
        "Once we have sub-corpus document frequences df T w p for each p, for each profile word p we define the element of our co-occurrence profile vector v p as v p = df T w p ?",
        "q?P df T w q That is, we normalize each count by the sum across all counts, such that the L1 norm of v is 1.",
        "For our applications here, the dimension of the co-occurrence profile vector is typically in the tens of thousands, but to illustrate the creation of this vector, suppose we choose an extremely narrow document frequency band min-df, max-df, such there were only three co-occurrence profile words: p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 .",
        "For some word w, we sample n instances of texts from our corpus which contain w, and find that p 1 appears in 10 of these texts, p 2 in 40 of them, and p 3 in 50 of them.",
        "The resulting co-occurrence profile vector is v = ?0.1,0.4,0.5?.",
        "This profile could be viewed as a distributional vector space representation of the word (Turney and Pantel, 2010), or as an estimate of the probability of each p occurring with w; without any further manipulation, however, we will use it directly as a feature vector for our supervised ranking.",
        "In order to proceed with a supervised approach, we need a ranking of a set of words relevant to the lexical attribute that we wish to acquire; this ranking is specific to the attribute in question, so we discuss this in later sections.",
        "Given such a ranking (which, we note, may be partial), we apply SVM rank (Joachims, 2002), which is part of the SVM light set of SVM-based machine learning tools.",
        "SVM rank was developed for ranking web page results, and, to our knowledge, has not been applied in this space.",
        "SVM rank uses an algorithm which optimizes the Kendall's ?",
        "(Kendall, 1955) between a correct ranking r a and the automatically-generated ranking r b .",
        "The simplest version of ?",
        "is based on the number of pairwise rankings which are in concord (C), i.e. both rankings rank the pair relative to each other and the pairwise rankings are the same, or in discord (D), i.e. both rankings rank the pair relative to each other but the rankings offered are contradictory.",
        "?",
        "is defined as: ?",
        "(r a ,r b ) = C?D C +D 2174 In practice, this is accomplished in SVM rank by modifying the original SVM algorithm to use as feature vectors the difference between ranked input vectors, rather than the input vectors directly.",
        "In the context of this feature space, this means that the model is trained on vectors which represent the differences in the co-occurrence profiles of ranked words; if the word with co-occurrence profile u is ranked higher than a word with co-occurrence profile v in our annotation, then SVM rank will try to find a weight vector w such that (u?v) ?w > 0, where w is constrained to be a sum of co-occurrence profile differences (i.e. the support vectors).",
        "Like standard SVM, ranking SVM uses a C parameter which represents the trade-off between margin size and classification errors, though the interpretation of the margin in ranking SVM is less clear.",
        "The output of the classification step of SVM rank is a number for each word which can be used directly to rank words, or which can be normalized across words into a scale.",
        "If the input rankings also have a continuous numerical representation (which is true in our case for polarity), then this ranking approach can be compared directly to a standard regression which is not directly sensitive to rankings; to maximize comparability, we use the regression function included in SVM light for this purpose.",
        "For both, we used a linear kernel.",
        "There is a small number of parameters that need to be set: the sample size n, the frequency range min-df, max-df, and the SVM C parameter.",
        "For each of the two lexical attributes of interest, we carried out independent tuning of these parameters using 5-fold crossvalidation in the training set, carrying out a grid search at powers of 10.",
        "We will discuss the values of parameters with respect to specific experiments later, but we mention here that a higher-than-default C, which corresponds to more emphasis on avoiding error rather than maximizing the margin, gave better results for both ranking and correlation, though with diminishing returns.",
        "The role of n is primarily to make the method (much) more tractable, but we suspect it might be beneficial to the training of the model for the profiles to be based on a uniform number of examples across word types.",
        "Before we move on to the experimental evaluation, we highlight some intrinsic advantages of this model, independent of performance.",
        "As a technique based on large corpus co-occurrence, it has the important property that it can go beyond the limited vocabulary offered by, for instance, WordNet.",
        "Since we rely only on co-occurrence, we are not at all limited to individual words (or specific types of words): we could just as easily derive attribute values for n-grams, collocations, or full lexico-grammatical constructions (for instance, distinguishing high as related to price from high as related to quality); though our interest here is in general lexical properties, there is no reason this approach could not be used for domain-specific applications, for any lexical units that appear often enough to obtain a reliable co-occurrence profile.",
        "Unlike many graph-based techniques, new vocabulary can be classified directly without perturbing the model, potentially in an online fashion if the corpus is properly indexed (which, we note, is by far the most time-consuming step of our method).",
        "Though some lemmatization may be required for highly inflectional languages, the method extends easily to any language for which blog data is likely to be available in sufficient quantities.",
        "Our approach is more straightforward than most other methods based on co-occurrence, which means fewer arbitrary choices and nuisance variables (such as the dimensionality k or feature weighting typically used in dimensionality-reduction approaches such as LSA); the parameters that we have are fairly well-behaved.",
        "Unlike methods which rely only on examples from the extremes of a spectrum to derive a quantification of it, our method naturally integrates examples from the middle of the spectrum (e.g. neutral examples in the case of polarity), but does not inherently require fine-grained quantification of the entire spectrum; in fact, pairwise examples alone could be used for training.",
        "4 Polarity experiments 4.1 Word-level Evaluation We first consider whether our model can be used to build a lexicon which reflects the polarity spectrum.",
        "Our training set of words is taken from the SO-CAL dictionary (Taboada et al., 2011), which has manually assigned SO (polarity) values for words at integer intervals in the range +5 to ?5.",
        "The entire dictionary contains about 5000 words, but we do not use the entire set: first, we restrict our investigation here to adjectives, which allows us to sidestep inflection issues (we do not consider comparative adjec-2175 tives), and we randomly select only 50 words from each of the 11 possible SO ratings in the dictionary (for a total of 550 words), so as to mimic a (relatively) low-resource situation as we might find working in other languages, and to make it possible to keep the counts equal across SO ratings.",
        "Note that the SO-CAL dictionary does not contain neutral words (words not in the dictionary are assumed to be neutral), but we used a set of about 200 hand-marked neutral adjectives that had been excluded from the lexicon during its creation from the words in a set of Epinions product reviews, and which were used for the original dictionary evaluation by Taboada et al. (2011).",
        "After training our model, we evaluate in two test sets.",
        "The first test set is the rest of the SO-CAL dictionary, excluding words in the training set as well as those not given a rating by SentiWordNet (see below).",
        "Note that this set is not balanced across SO values, since there are many more weakly positive (SO 1 to 3) or weakly negative (SO ?1 to ?3) words than more-extreme or neutral words; we would argue, though, that this reflects the actual situation in subjective corpora such as product reviews.",
        "To test whether we might be overfitting to the product reviews domain, we also test using annotations from the MPQA (Subjectivity) lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), which was built primarily from news texts.",
        "1 For this, we again include only words that are in SentiWordNet.",
        "The MPQA lexicon uses a very different tagging schema than the SO-CAL dictionary, with 3 polarity categories (positive, negative, and neutral) as well as two degrees of subjectivity, weak or strong.",
        "Strong or weak subjectivity is defined as how reliable an indicator of subjectivity the word is, which does not directly correspond to the rationale used for the SO-CAL dictionary (which is closer to the notion of force or intensity); the results in Taboada et al. (2011) and our own examination of the lexicon suggest, however, that there is some correlation.",
        "2 Despite this uncertainty, we combined the MPQA tags to form a polarity spectrum: strongly subjective negative, weakly subjective negative, neutral, weakly subjective positive, strongly subjective positive.",
        "Given a ranking by our SVM ranker, we evaluate overall pairwise accuracy by considering all possible pairings of words across different ratings within the SO-CAL or MPQA test sets, and count the percentage of those where the ordering of the pair with respect to the polarity spectrum is correctly predicted by the ranking.",
        "For a more detailed breakdown, we divide these pairwise comparisons into 3 categories: polarity (pairs which involve one positive and one negative word), neutrality (pairs which have one neutral word), and intensity (pairs which have two words with the same polarity).",
        "Note that much work in bootstrapping lexicons for sentiment analysis uses precision and recall, but this is not the most appropriate evaluation metric in this case because our method can assign a rank (and, eventually, an SO value) to any word in the 2 million word vocabulary of our corpus.",
        "3 Here, we are interested only in reliability of these rankings.",
        "During parameter tuning in the development phase, we found that min-df = 10 3 , max-df = 10 5 was a good choice: in other words, our profile words are words that appear less than once in 24 texts, but more than once in 2400 texts.",
        "In the ICWSM, there are 30,852 words that fall into this category, so that is the length of our feature vector.",
        "Based on results in the development set, we take n = 1000 as our default; larger samples provided no appreciable benefit and were even slightly worse in some cases.",
        "For the SVM C parameter, we used 100.",
        "We also test using SVM correlation, using the same parameters.",
        "In addition to these variations on our co-occurrence profile technique, we also compare with three independent alternatives.",
        "The first is SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et al., 2010), which uses a random walk method in WordNet to derive positive, negative, and neutral values (which sum to 1) for each synset in WordNet.",
        "We follow Taboada et al. (2011) in converting this to a single spectrum for each word by subtracting the negative score from the positive score, and averaging the result across senses for each 1 There are of course other popular manually-built lexicons, for instance the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), but they tend to have only binary annotations.",
        "2 One example of where these two dictionaries differ is the word nervous, which is tagged as a strongly subjective negative word in the MPQA, but has only a?1 score in the SO-CAL dictionary, since it does not describe a particularly intense negative emotion.",
        "An example of a ?5 word is horrendous, which is also a strongly subjective negative word in the MPQA.",
        "Instances of discord where the SO-CAL dictionary is clearly stronger are rarer, but an example is comprehensive, which has an SO of 3 in SO-CAL, but is weakly subjective in the MPQA, probably because of its common descriptive uses, such as in the context of insurance and (in the UK) education.",
        "3 We have not yet build such a lexicon, but, to facilitate comparison, but we are making available raw scores for all the adjectives already contained in at least one of the SO-CAL, MPQA, and SentiWordNet lists (excluding the 550 training words), as well as lists of specific words used for training and testing.",

        "Surprisingly, the correlation method, despite using the same feature input as the ranking method, is the worst performing method here, though SentiWordNet is only marginally better, while LSA falls roughly in the middle of the range, and PMI is the strongest competitor.",
        "One potential criticism is that a ranking method is likely to have an advantage when evaluating by rank.",
        "This is true, but we think that relative rank among words is fundamental to the notion of a spectrum, whereas the bucketing of words into evenly spaced integer ratings is just an annotation convenience.",
        "That said, our output ranking is perhaps too fine-grained in comparison to our input (offering a full ranking for all words), and it would be desirable if our ranking algorithm allowed us to encourage some words to be ranked the same.",
        "Although SVM ranking is also the best method on the MPQA test set, the results are marginal as compared to the SO-CAL test.",
        "Part of this could be a moderate amount of domain overfitting, or perhaps the ranking method is better at fine-grained scales relative to the other methods.",
        "However, the most obvious difference between the test sets appears relative to the intensity comparison, where the profile ranking performance is relatively poor.",
        "This is likely attributable to the differences between the two kinds of annotations: the SVM ranking method learns the SO-CAL intensity scale fairly well, but this actually becomes a handicap when degree of subjectivity and not force is the deciding factor; on the other hand, corpus-based models which did relatively poorly in all the other evaluations (profile regression, LSA) actually do somewhat better in MPQA intensity than their most comparable alternatives (profile ranking, PMI) to a degree that is in fact proportional to their relative inferiority elsewhere, suggesting that sensitivity to degree of subjectivity might be interfering with acquisition of the SO-CAL polarity spectrum.",
        "Interestingly, the value provided by SentiWordNet does not seem to correspond well to either of these interpretations of intensity, since it does rather poorly with respect to both.",
        "2177 4.2 Text-level Evaluation The most common use of polarity lexicons is the task of text polarity classification (Turney, 2002), identifying whether an opinionated text is positive or negative.",
        "In this section, we convert the initial output of the models to polarity lexicons with an appropriate scale so that we can use the SO-CAL software (Taboada et al., 2011) to carry out text sentiment analysis with our alternative adjective lexicons rather than its original, manually-built one.",
        "SO-CAL is an unsupervised lexical sentiment analysis system with a number of built-in features, e.g. handling of negation and intensification, that improve the accuracy of the model, particularly when using a fine-grained, high-precision lexicon.",
        "Taboada et al. evaluate across 4 corpora of balanced product reviews.",
        "For our evaluation, we use one of those corpora, a set of 400 product reviews from Epinions, with 50 balanced texts from each of 8 product categories (movies, books, cars, computers, cookware, hotels, phones, and music).",
        "Taboada et al. call this corpus Epinions 2, to distinguish it from the Epinions corpus that the SO-CAL dictionary was built from.",
        "They report an accuracy of 80% using SO-CAL with all word types and features enabled.",
        "Our interest here is to test the influence of lexicon quality on polarity detection.",
        "Coverage, though of course important, is actually a potential source of noise: Low coverage can naturally result in low performance, but Taboada et al. point out that high coverage can also cause problems, when many of the rarer words added to the lexicon, even when human-tagged, are not relevant to the primary sentiment of the text, but rather irrelevant aspects like (in the movie or book domain) character descriptions.",
        "Steps can be taken to mitigate this by identifying relevant sentiment (Scheible and Sch?utze, 2013), but here we sidestep this problem by forcing our lexicons to have exactly the same coverage by limiting them to words that appear in the static SentiWordNet lexicon.",
        "Again, we also consider only adjectives here.",
        "To build the lexicon for this evaluation we used a different training set: it is not possible to take 50 samples from each SO rating in the SO-CAL adjective lexicon and not have training words that also appear in the corpus, which we explicitly wanted to avoid.",
        "4 Instead, we train using all the adjectives in the SO-CAL dictionary that either don't appear in the Epinions corpus or don't appear in SentiWordNet (since we are limiting our output lexicon to SentiWordNet words).",
        "This results in a much larger training set than in the word-level evaluation (about 1500 words), but they are distributed unevenly across SO ratings.",
        "Relative to the word-level evaluation, this is closer to the situation if we were using the entire SO-CAL dictionary to expand the lexicon.",
        "We use the same set of training words as seeds for LSA.",
        "To convert SentiWordNet to a SO-CAL-compatible dictionary, we simply multiply the raw score, guaranteed to be between ?1 and +1, by 5, creating a range of ?5 to +5.",
        "For the raw scores for our other three options (LSA, profile regression, and profile ranking), we linearly scale the raw score so that the mean within the lexicon is 0, and a SO +5 word is at the third standard deviation away from the mean; we choose a rather severe scaling so that there are only a handful of words in the lexicon whose absolute value is over 5, which SO-CAL is not designed for.",
        "The results of this evaluation are shown on right side of Table 1.",
        "Profile ranking is once again dom-inant, almost 4 percentage points better than the second-best option.",
        "The ordering of the lexicons here is exactly the same as we saw for the word-level evaluation in SO-CAL, though SentiWordNet does somewhat better than would be expected from those scores.",
        "Again, regression does quite poorly despite having access to the same feature vectors as the ranking method.",
        "We note that our results here are also markedly better than all the other automatic lexicons compared by Taboada et al., namely a PMI-derived lexicon based on Google counts (Taboada et al., 2006), and a binary lexicon built by expanding entries in a thesaurus (Mohammad et al., 2009), and are even a bit better than using the human-tagged (binary) annotations from the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), though we are still quite a long way from what is possible with the full manual SO-CAL dictionary.",
        "Since the quality of the lexicon is directly reflected in our polarity classification scores here, it is not surprising that our gold-standard lexicon is superior; in this context, it should be viewed as an upper bound.",
        "Nevertheless, we have strong evidence here that our co-occurrence profile ranking method is a step in the right direction relative to other methods for automatically building lexicons.",
        "4 For all of our evaluations in this paper we were careful never to use the score of a word which appeared in our training set; the drawback of this is that our training set size is not constant.",
        "2178 5 Formality Experiments 5.1 Word-level Evaluation Though the lexicon is perhaps more fundamental to distinctions of polarity than is the case for formality, nevertheless formality is strongly expressed through word choice; for instance, in English using the word dude to address a socially-powerful stranger would generally be unacceptable, and it would be very strange to address a good friend as sir, except as a joke.",
        "These are not isolated examples: a huge portion of the vocabulary is marked to some degree in this fashion, and requires special attention when moving across text genres or social situations.",
        "Word length (in English, at least) and word frequency can be used as a simple proxy (longer, rarer words are, on average, more formal), but the example above belies this approach: sir is a shorter word than dude, and it is not immediately obvious that it would appear less in, for instance, a news corpus, than dude.",
        "In previous work (Brooke et al., 2010), we used the LSA co-occurrence method of Turney and Littman (2003) discussed in the previous section to derive a formality lexicon using the ICWSM (which was the best among various corpora tested, including the BNC).",
        "For testing, we used a set of 399 synonym pairs that were pulled from a writing manual focused on word choice, Choose the Right Word (CTRW) (Hayakawa, 1994), where the author explicitly compared words for their formality, showing that co-occurrence was a better approach to identifying lexical formality than proxies related to word length or word frequency.",
        "We note that many of the distinctions in the CTRW set are quite subtle, for example determine vs. ascertain, both of which seem at least somewhat formal, though ascertain was judged by the expert to be the more formal of the two.",
        "In this section we will build a formality ranking using our profile ranking method, and show that it is better than the LSA method in the CTRW dataset.",
        "Here, we follow our earlier work in using a much smaller k value (20) than is typical for topical uses of LSA, which we found was better for this dataset, since major stylistic differences seem to be mostly captured in the first few dimensions after dimensionality reduction, a result which is consistent with the work of Biber (1988) looking at differences across registers.",
        "Unlike for polarity, there is no resource available that offers a full scale of formality for a large number of words, and the set used in our initial work on formality has only extreme, handpicked words.",
        "In more recent work (Brooke and Hirst, 2013), we used a larger set of words (900) that included a variety of different styles that had been tagged by a group of 5 annotators.",
        "In that work, we did not use the term ?formality,?",
        "but one of our styles, colloquial, corresponds to the informal end of the spectrum, and two other styles, objective and literary, can both be viewed as social-distancing language.",
        "5 The words tagged by annotators as belonging to neither of these categories will serve as the middle of this spectrum.",
        "Compared to our polarity lexicon, our training set therefore is much more coarse-grained (with only 3 rankings, as compared to 11 for polarity), but the pairwise relationships can be used to build a fine-grained scale.",
        "As before, we remove all words that overlap with our test set.",
        "With respect to parameters, we use the same n as in the polarity experiments, but in development we saw better performance from a higher C (10,000) and a lower bottom bound on the document frequency range, df-min = 10 2 .",
        "The latter might reflect the fact that rare vocabulary has a strong tendency to be associated with extreme formality, though there is also a limit to this, since if a word is so rare that it hardly ever co-occurs with anything, it cannot possibly be useful for training no matter how good an example of extreme formality it is.",
        "The results using these settings are shown in the left side of Table 2.",
        "Again, our profiling method is clearly better than lexicon-based alternatives.",
        "LSA outperforms PMI in the word-level task, a result which is consistent with our other work in stylistic lexical induction (Brooke and Hirst, 2013), 6 and all the co-occurrence methods are well above the word-length baseline.",
        "Figure 1 contains a more detailed analysis of the influence of individual document frequency bands: we 5 The objective dimension corresponds roughly to the style of a technical document, while the literary dimension involves flowery, even archaic language that suggests a literary sophistication.",
        "Contrast so with synonyms therefore (objective) and thus (literary), which are both more formal, but in different ways.",
        "6 We suspect this is due to the fact that LSA vectors encode information about word frequency: even when the vector norm is controlled for, we have found that the LSA vectors of high- and low-frequency words have consistently different distributions, which may help in identifying extremely low frequency, highly formal words appearing in the CTRW dataset; by contrast, PMI and other probability-based approaches seem to behave more erratically when presented with low-frequency items.",
        "2179 Table 2: Results of the formality experiments.",
        "The second column shows pairwise accuracy of different models identifying the more formal of two synonyms in CTRW test set.",
        "The third column shows average correlation with two human 5-point Likert-scale formality annotations of the 500 sentence test set.",
        "Method CTRW words Sentence Evaluation Word length 63.7 0.36 LSA 78.7 0.49 PMI 72.2 0.52 Profile ranking 86.5 0.55 Figure 1: Pairwise accuracy in the CTRW test set for various frequency bands.",
        "Dotted line represents performance using best parameters from development phase, i.e. max-df = 10 2 , max-df = 10 5 .",
        "built models for each of our frequency bands (ranges between two consecutive powers of ten), and tested them in the CTRW corpus.",
        "The flat dotted line represents the larger band we used based on development performance, 10 2 ?10 5 .",
        "We see that accuracy peaks at 10 3 to 10 4 df band, at a value (87.3%) which is higher than we saw with the larger band chosen based on the development set.",
        "The words in this band are fairly uncommon, appearing less than once in 240 texts, but greater than once in 2400 texts; still, as a group they provide enough evidence to make a strong determination of formalty.",
        "5.2 Sentence-level Evaluation Lahiri and Lu (2011) report on the creation of 5-point Likert scale annotations of sentence-level formality, with two ratings for each of 500 sentences taken from separate texts in a diverse corpus which includes news, blogs, forums, and academic papers (Lahiri et al., 2011).",
        "In this section, we use this annotation to carry out an extrinsic evaluation of our lexical formality ratings.",
        "As far as we are aware, this is the first use of this annotation for evaluating metrics of formality.",
        "We extract all lexical words (verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and nouns, though we omit proper nouns) from the sentences and use the 3-way formality annotation with these words removed to create LSA, PMI, and profile ranking models, which are then used to create a formality lexicon for these words, using the same method we used to create the SO lexicon.",
        "Given a lexicon, we averaged the formality score across each sentence (ignoring duplicate items) to get a formality score for each sentence.",
        "We calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between our score and each of the two annotators, and then average the result.",
        "For comparison, the correlation between the two human annotators is 0.60.",
        "The results in Table 2 indicate that the preference for the profile ranking method seen in the CTRW set extends directly to sentence-level formality ranking, and the level of correlation reached by the profile ranking method approaches correlation between humans.",
        "This supports our claim that lexical choice is very important to formality: our results here indicate that humans with access to other indicators of formality (for instance, use or avoidance of particular syntactic constructions) agree only slightly more with each other than our lexicon-only model does with them.",
        "2180 6 Conclusion In this paper we have presented a novel approach to determining where a word lies on a spectrum, using just counts of words that it tends to appear with and an SVM ranking algorithm, both of which are key components to its success.",
        "We have shown that it can be applied to at least two continuous attributes of interest in computational linguistics, namely polarity and formality, and that the benefits of this method relative to established alternatives are visible not just in direct lexicon evaluation, but also in the NLP tasks where these lexicons can be used.",
        "Even with a relatively small set of words to train with, we see little sign of overfitting, and although we have focused on a small set of words here, our method is efficient enough that it could easily be applied to a much larger set of lexicogrammatical units, though we will also have to derive ways to filter out unreliable assignments to reduce overall noise.",
        "Other future work will involve looking at other spectra, other languages, other supervised ranking models, and improving our performance generally by being more selective of profile words or training examples or by refining our rankings by including other sources of information such as WordNet.",
