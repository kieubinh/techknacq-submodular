        "HPB model (Chiang, 2007) is widely used and has consistently delivered state-of-the-art performance.",
        "This model extends the phrase-based model (Koehn et al., 2003) by using the formal synchronous grammar to well capture the recursiveness of language during translation.",
        "In a formal synchronous grammar, the syntactic unit could be any sequence of contiguous terminals and non-terminals, which may not necessarily satisfy the linguistic constraints.",
        "HPB model is powerful to cover any format of translation pairs, but it might introduce ungrammatical rules and produce poor quality translations.",
        "To generate grammatical translations, lots of syntax-based models have been proposed by Galley et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2006), Huang et al. (2006), Mi et al. (2008), Shen et al. (2008), Xie et al. (2011), Zhang et al. (2008), etc.",
        "In these models, the syntactic units should be compatible with the syntactic structure of either the source sentence or the target sentence.",
        "These approaches can generate more grammatical translations by capturing the structural difference between language pairs.",
        "However, these models need special efforts to capture non-syntactic translation knowledge to improve the translation performance.",
        "It is desired to combine the advantages of syntax-based models and the HPB model (Stein et al., 2010).",

        "Rule (5) and (6) are not discriminative due to no consideration of their outside context during the translation.",

        "2 Related Work Ever since the invention of phrase-based model, a lot of efforts have been made to incorporate linguistic syntax.",
        "Cherry(2008) and Marton and Resnik (2008) leverage linguistic constituent to constrain the decoding softly.",
        "In their methods, a translation hypothesis gets an extra credit if it respects the parse tree but may incur a cost if it violates a constituent boundary.",
        "The soft constrain based methods achieved promising results on various language pairs.",
        "One problem of these methods is that exactly matching syntactic constraints cannot always guarantee a good translation, and violating syntactic structure does not always induce a poor translation.",
        "It could be more reasonable if the credit and penalty is learnt from the parallel training data.",
        "In this work, we learn this kind of constrain knowledge directly from the syntactic structures over the training corpus.",
        "Xiong et al. (2009) present a method that automatically learns syntactic constraints from training data for the ITG based translation (Wu, 1997; Xiong et al., 2006).",
        "They utilize the syntactic constraints to estimates the extent to which a span is bracketable.",
        "Though the effect was demonstrated on the ITG based model, the method is also applicable to the HPB model.",
        "The main difference between Xiong et al. (2009) and our work is that we try to estimate the structural consistency of each rule 2228 against the source syntax tree.",
        "For rules which are same in the source side but different in the target side, our method will distinguish the inconsistency degree for different rules.",
        "While, for such rules, Xiong et al. (2009) will give a same score which will be used to compete with rules in other spans.",
        "More recently, Huang et al. (2013) associate each non-terminal with the distribution of tags that is used to measure the consistency of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans.",
        "Our work is similar to Huang et al. (2013) since we also represent the syntactic variation of translation rules in the form of distribution.",
        "The main difference is that they annotate non-terminals with head POS tags while we use dependency triples (over both terminals and non-terminals) to explicitly represent both the dependency relations inside the rule, and that between the rule and its context.",
        "Both above related work and our work need parse the source sentence to get syntactic context before decoding.",
        "There are also some methods incorporating syntax information without the need of online parsing the source sentences (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Shen et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010).",
        "They parse the training data to label the non-terminals with syntactic tags.",
        "During the bottom-up de-coding, the tags are used to model the substitution of non-terminals in a soft way (Shen et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010) or in a hard way (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "Gao et al. (2011) derive soft constraints from the source dependency parsing for the HPB translation.",
        "They focus on the relative order of each dependent word and its head word after translation, while our method models whether the dependency information of a rule matches the context or not.",
        "Our work utilizes contextual information around translation rules.",
        "In this sense, it is similar to He et al. (2008) and Liu et al. (2008).",
        "The main difference between their work and our work is that they leverage lexical context for rule selection while we focus on the syntactic contextual information.",
        "3 Hierarchical Phrase based Machine Translation Our model proposed in this paper is an extension of the HPB model (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Formally, HPB model is a weighted synchronous context free grammar.",
        "It employs a generalization of the standard plain phrase extraction approach in order to acquire the synchronous rules of the grammar directly from word-aligned parallel text.",
        "Rules have the form of: where X is a nonterminal, and are both strings of terminals and non-terminals from source and target side respectively, and ?",
        "is a one-to-one correspondence between nonterminal occurrences in and .",
        "Associated with each rule is a set of feature functions with the form .",
        "These feature functions are combined into a log-linear model.",
        "When a rule is applied during SMT decoding, its score is calculated as: ?",
        "where is the weight associated with feature function .",
        "The feature weights are typically optimized using minimum error rate training algorithm (Och, 2003).",
        "4 Soft Dependency Matching Model In order to incorporate syntactic knowledge to refine both the word ordering and word sense disambiguation for HPB model, we propose a soft dependency matching model (SDMM).",
        "It extends HPB rule into a form which is named as SDMM rule: where RDT(rule's dependency triples) is a set of dependency triples defined on source string .",
        "Each element in RDT is a triple representing dependency knowledge in the form: {m-h-l} where m and h are the dependent and head respectively, l is the label of the dependency relation type.",
        "m and h could be any of terminals, non-terminals, LC and RC, where LC denotes the left context and RC the right context.",
        "In the following two sub-sections, we will explain the details of SDMM rule extensions for both plain phrases (i.e., there are no non-terminals in both ) and hierarchical rules (i.e., there are at 2229 least one non-terminal in both ) respectively.",
        "For simplicity, we ignore the correspondence in the representations of both HPB rules and SDMM rules.",

        "4.1 SDMM Over Plain Phrase Rules Figure 2 illustrates a parallel sentence together with word alignments and source dependency parse tree, from which we can extract the phrase pairs of HPB rules like: (11) < ?",

        "Formally, the RDT corresponding to phrase pair (11) is {?-LC-dobj}.",
        "The RDT corresponding to phrase pair (12) is {LC-?-nsubj, LC-?-prep}.",
        "Now we describe how to build the RDT when a phrase pair is extracted from a sentence pair during the training step.",
        "First, we initialize RDT to be empty.",
        "Then, for each dependency triple ?m-h-l?",
        "in the parse tree of the source sentence, if either m or h is covered by the source phrase in the rule, we add it to RDT.",
        "However, if both m and h are covered by the source phrase, we will ignore it because it holds less syntactic information beyond HPB rule itself.",
        "For example, the dependency triple ??",
        "-?",
        "- nummod?",
        "is excluded from RDT for both phrase pair (11) and phrase pair (12).",
        "In addition, we do not add the dependency triple ?m-h-l?",
        "into RDT if both m and h are not contained in source phrase, because it is not related to phrase pair at all.",
        "The dependency triple ??-?-pobj?",
        "is such a case for both phrase pair (11) and phrase pair (12).",
        "Finally, we normalize the word in RDT that is not covered by the source phrase with either LC (stands for the left context) or RC (stands for the right context) according to its relative position to the source phrase.",
        "For example, in the RDT for phrase pair (11), we normalize ??-?-dobj?",
        "as ?",
        "?-LC- dobj?",
        "since the word???",
        "is not covered by the source phrase and it is treated as left context.",
        "Note that for each context word outside the source phrase, we only record whether it is on the left or on the right of phrase.",
        "We do not further consider its lexical form and its distance to the source phrase.",
        "For example, in the two dependency triples in Figure 3(b), both the dependent word ???",
        "and ???",
        "are normalized into LC.",
        "In this way, we can generalize the dependency triples in RDT and alleviate the data sparseness problem.",
        "In fact, there might be duplicated dependency triples for a phrase pair.",
        "In this case, we only keep one of them.",
        "4.2 SDMM over Hierarchical Rules Hierarchical rules are usually generated by substituting sub-phrases with non-terminals from plain phrase pairs.",
        "For example, given the parallel sentence and the two phrase pairs in Section 4.1, we can get a hierarchical rule like: <?",
        "?",
        "X, borrowed X> To extend hierarchical rules into SDMM rules, we add dependency information to source terminals or non-terminals in RDT.",
        "Figure 4 shows an example representing an SDMM rule: 2230 Figure 4: An illustration of a hierarchical rule annotated with a set of dependency triples.",
        "The generation of SDMM rules over hierarchical rules is similar to that of plain phrase rules.",
        "The only difference lies in processing the non-terminals, whose dependencies are inferred from the words they covered.",
        "For example, the RDT of the above SDMM rule would be:{LC-?-nsubj, LC-?-prep, X-?-dobj} Similarly, any dependencies over two terminals contained in the source rule are not included in RDT, and dependencies inferred from same non-terminals are excluded as well.",
        "In addition, dependencies between two non-terminals are ignored.",
        "4.3 SDMM Rule Composing A same HPB rule (either plain phrase pair or a hierarchical rule) can be extracted from different bilingual sentences.",
        "Therefore, the same HPB rule could be extended into multiple SDMM rules.",
        "For ex-ample, given a parallel sentence pair shown in Figure 5, Figure 5: An example of a dependency tree over the source sentence together with the word-aligned target sentence.",
        "we might get a SDMM rule as shown in Figure 6.",
        "Compared to the SDMM rule in Figure 4, there is an additional dependency triple ?LC-?-tmod?",
        "in RDT.",
        "Figure 6: An illustration of dependency triples associated to a hierarchical rule.",
        "Intuitively, we can process SDMM rules independently although they share the same information of HPB rules.",
        "However, this will exacerbate the data sparseness problem and make the computation inefficient due to dramatically increased model size.",
        "An alternative way is only to keep the most frequent RDT information for the same HPB rules.",
        "Though this can get a very concise model, a lot of useful syntactic information might be lost.",
        "We propose a balanced composing method to make a trade-off between knowledge representation and computation efficiency of SDMM rules.",
        "Suppose there are more than one SDMM rules with different but the same HPB rule, we compose them by the union and get the new form of RDT as: ?",
        "In addition, we record the frequency of HPB rule as well as that of each dependency triple in RDT as: , where is the number of times that HPB rule is extracted from the training data, and is the frequency that and co-occur.",
