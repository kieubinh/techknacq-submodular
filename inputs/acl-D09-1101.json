        "Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution is the task of identifying which NPs (or mentions) refer to the same real-world entity or concept.",
        "Traditional learning-based coreference resolvers operate by training a model for classifying whether two mentions are co-referring or not (e.g., Soon et al.",
        "(2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Kehler et al.",
        "(2004), Ponzetto and Strube (2006)).",
        "Despite their initial successes, these mention-pair models have at least two major weaknesses.",
        "First, since each candidate antecedent for a mention to be resolved (henceforth an active mention) is considered independently of the others, these models only determine how good a candidate antecedent is relative to the active mention, but not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to other candidates.",
        "In other words, they fail to answer the critical question of which candidate antecedent is most probable.",
        "Second, they have limitations in their expressiveness: the information extracted from the two mentions alone may not be sufficient for making an informed coreference decision, especially if the candidate antecedent is a pronoun (which is semantically empty) or a mention that lacks descriptive information such as gender (e.g., Clinton).",
        "To address the first weakness, researchers have attempted to train a mention-ranking model for determining which candidate antecedent is most probable given an active mention (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2008)).",
        "Ranking is arguably a more natural reformulation of coreference resolution than classification, as a ranker allows all candidate antecedents to be considered simultaneously and therefore directly captures the competition among them.",
        "Another desirable consequence is that there exists a natural resolution strategy for a ranking approach: a mention is resolved to the candidate antecedent that has the highest rank.",
        "This contrasts with classification-based approaches, where many clustering algorithms have been employed to coordinate the pairwise coreference decisions (because it is unclear which one is the best).",
        "To address the second weakness, researchers have investigated the acquisition of entity-mention coreference models (e.g., Luo et al.",
        "(2004), Yang et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "Unlike mention-pair models, these entity-mention models are trained to determine whether an active mention belongs to a preceding, possibly partially-formed, coreference cluster.",
        "Hence, they can employ cluster-level features (i.e., features that are defined over any subset of mentions in a preceding cluster), which makes them more expressive than mention-pair models.",
        "Motivated in part by these recently developed models, we propose in this paper a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention-ranking mod-",

        "els and entity-mention models.",
        "Specifically, we recast coreference as the problem of determining which of a set of preceding coreference clusters is the best to link to an active mention using a learned cluster ranker.",
        "In addition, we show how discourse-new detection (i.e., the task of determining whether a mention introduces a new entity in a discourse) can be learned jointly with corefer-ence resolution in our cluster-ranking framework.",
        "It is worth noting that researchers typically adopt a pipeline coreference architecture, performing discourse-new detection prior to coreference resolution and using the resulting information to prevent a coreference system from resolving mentions that are determined to be discourse-new (see Poesio et al.",
        "(2004) for an overview).",
        "As a result, errors in discourse-new detection could be propagated to the resolver, possibly leading to a deterioration of coreference performance (see Ng and Cardie (2002a)).",
        "Jointly learning discourse-new detection and coreference resolution can potentially address this error-propagation problem.",
        "In sum, we believe our work makes three main contributions to coreference resolution:",
        "Proposing a simple, yet effective coreference model.",
        "Our work advances the state-of-the-art in coreference resolution by bringing learning-based coreference systems to the next level of performance.",
        "When evaluated on the ACE 2005 coreference data sets, cluster rankers outperform three competing models – mention-pair, entity-mention, and mention-ranking models – by a large margin.",
        "Also, our joint-learning approach to discourse-new detection and coreference resolution consistently yields cluster rankers that outperform those adopting the pipeline architecture.",
        "Equally importantly, cluster rankers are conceptually simple and easy to implement and do not rely on sophisticated training and inference procedures to make coreference decisions in dependent relation to each other, unlike relational coreference models (see McCallum and Wellner (2004)).",
        "Bridging the gap between machine-learning approaches and linguistically-motivated approaches to coreference resolution.",
        "While machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have received a lot of attention since the mid-90s, popular learning-based coreference frameworks such as the mention-pair model are arguably rather unsatisfactory from a linguistic point of view.",
        "In particular, they have not leveraged advances in discourse-based anaphora resolution research in the 70s and 80s.",
        "Our work bridges this gap by realizing in a new machine learning framework ideas rooted in Lappin and Leass's (1994) heuristic-based pronoun resolver, which in turn was motivated by classic salience-based approaches to anaphora resolution.",
        "Revealing the importance of adopting the right model.",
        "While entity-mention models have previously been shown to be worse or at best marginally better than their mention-pair counterparts (Luo et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2008), our cluster-ranking models, which are a natural extension of entity-mention models, signiicantly outperformed all competing approaches.",
        "This suggests that the use of an appropriate learning framework can bring us a long way towards highperformance coreference resolution.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work.",
        "Section 3 describes our baseline coreference models: mention-pair, entity-mention, and mention-ranking.",

        "As mentioned previously, the work most related to ours is Lappin and Leass (1994), whose goal is to perform pronoun resolution by assigning an anaphoric pronoun to the highest-scored preceding cluster.",
        "Nevertheless, Lappin and Leass's work differs from ours in several respects.",
        "First, they only tackle pronoun resolution rather than the full coreference task.",
        "Second, their algorithm is heuristic-based; in particular, the score assigned to a preceding cluster is computed by summing over the weights associated with the factors applicable to the cluster, where the weights are determined heuristically, rather than learned, unlike ours.",
        "Like many heuristic-based pronoun resolvers (e.g., Mitkov (1998)), they first apply a set of constraints to ilter grammatically incompatible candidate antecedents and then rank the remaining ones using salience factors.",
        "As a result, their cluster-ranking model employs only factors that capture the salience of a cluster, and can therefore be viewed as a simple model of attentional state (see Grosz and Sidner (1986)) realized by coreference clusters.",
        "By contrast, our resolution strategy is learned without applying hand-coded constraints in a separate filtering step.",
        "In particular, we attempt to determine the compatibility between a cluster and an active mention, using factors that determine not only salience (e.g., the distance between the cluster and the mention) but also lexical and grammatical compatibility, for instance.",
        "Entity-mention coreference models.",
        "Luo et al.",
        "(2004) represent one of the earliest attempts to investigate learning-based entity-mention models.",
        "They use the any predicate to generate cluster-level features as follows: given a binary-valued feature x defined over a pair of mentions, they introduce an any-x cluster-level feature, which has the value true if x is true between the active mention and any mention in the preceding cluster under consideration.",
        "Contrary to common wisdom, this entity-mention model underperforms its mention-pair counterpart in spite of the generalization from mention-pair to cluster-level features.",
        "In Yang et al.",
        "'s (2004) entity-mention model, a training instance is composed of an active mention m,k, a preceding cluster C, and a mention rrij in C that is closest in distance to rrik in the associated text.",
        "The feature set used to represent the instance is primarily composed of features that describe the relationship between rrij and nik, as well as a few cluster-level features.",
        "In other words, the model still relies heavily on features used in a mention-pair model.",
        "In particular, the inclusion of rrij in the feature vector representation to some extent reflects the authors' lack of confidence that a strong entity-mention model can be trained without mention-pair-based features.",
        "Our ranking model, on the other hand, is trained without such features.",
        "More recently, Yang et al.",
        "(2008) have proposed another entity-mention model trained by inductive logic programming.",
        "Like their previous work, the scarcity of cluster-level predicates (only two are used) under-exploits the expressiveness of entity-mention models.",
        "Mention ranking.",
        "The notion of ranking candidate antecedents can be traced back to centering algorithms, many of which use grammatical roles to rank forward-looking centers (see Grosz et al.",
        "(1995), Walker et al.",
        "(1998), and Mitkov (2002)).",

        "Unlike ours, however, their model ranks mentions rather than clusters, and relies on an independently-trained discourse-new detector.",
        "Discourse-new detection.",
        "Discourse-new detection is often tackled independently of coreference resolution.",
        "Pleonastic its have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Kennedy and Bogu-raev (1996)) and learning-based techniques such as rule learning (e.g., Müller (2006)), kernels (e.g., Versley et al.",
        "(2008)), and distributional methods (e.g., Bergsma et al.",
        "(2008)).",
        "Non-anaphoric definite descriptions have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised methods (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)).",
        "General discourse-new detectors that are applicable to different types of NPs have been built using heuristics (e.g., Byron and Gegg-Harrison (2004)) and modeled generatively (e.g., Eisner and Char-niak (2007)) and discriminatively (e.g., Uryupina (2003)).",
        "There have also been attempts to perform joint inference for discourse-new detection and coreference resolution using integer linear programming (ILP), where a discourse-new classifier and a coreference classifier are trained independently of each other, and then ILP is applied as a post-processing step to jointly infer discourse-new and coreference decisions so that they are consistent with each other (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2007)).",

        "Specifically, for each feature x shown in the last two blocks in Table 1, we first convert x into an equivalent set of binary-valued features if it is multi-valued.",
        "Then, for each resulting binary-valued feature x^, we create four binary-valued cluster-level features: (1) none-x?, is true when x5 is false between nik and each mention in cf, (2) most-false-x5 is true when x5 is true between nik and less than half (but at least one) of the mentions in Cj; (3) most-true-x5 is true when x5 is true between nik and at least half (but not all) of the mentions in c-,; and (4) all-Xj, is true when x5 is true between nik and each mention in Cj.",

        "In particular, the instance representation employed by a cluster ranker is identical to that used by an entity-mention model, where each training instance i(cj, nik) represents a preceding cluster Cj and a discourse-old mention nik and consists of cluster-level features formed from predicates.",
        "Unlike in an entity-mention model, however, in a cluster ranker, (1) a training instance is created between each discourse-old mention nik and each of its preceding clusters; and (2) since we are training a model for ranking clusters, the assignment of class values to training instances is similar to that of a mention ranker.",
        "Specifically, the class value of a training instance i(cj, nik) created for nik is the rank of Cj among the competing clusters, which is 2 if nik belongs to Cj, and 1 otherwise.",

        "The cluster ranker described above can be used to determine which preceding cluster a discourse-old mention should be linked to, but it cannot be used to determine whether a mention is discourse-new or not.",
        "The reason is simple: all the training instances are generated from discourse-old mentions.",
        "Hence, to jointly learn discourse-new detection and coreference resolution, we must train the ranker using instances generated from both discourse-old and discourse-new mentions.",
        "Specifically, when training the ranker, we provide each active mention with the option to start a new cluster by creating an additional instance that (1) contains features that solely describe the active mention (i.e., the features shown in the second block of Table 1), and (2) has the highest rank value among competing clusters (i.e., 2) if it is discourse-new and the lowest rank value (i.e., 1) otherwise.",
