        "Tweets, short messages of less than 140 characters shared through the Twitter service 1, have become an important source of fresh information.",
        "As a result, the task of named entity recognition (NER) for tweets, which aims to identify mentions of rigid designators from tweets belonging to named-entity types such as persons, organizations and locations (2007), has attracted increasing research interest.",
        "For example, Ritter et al. (2011) develop a system that exploits a CRF model to segment named",
        "entities and then uses a distantly supervised approach based on LabeledLDA to classify named entities.",
        "Liu et al. (2011) combine a classifier based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with a CRF-based model to leverage cross tweets information, and adopt the semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled tweets.",
        "However, named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets, which transforms named entities mentioned in tweets to their unambiguous canonical forms, has not been well studied.",
        "Owing to the informal nature of tweets, there are rich variations of named entities in them.",
        "According to our investigation on the data set provided by Liu et al. (2011), every named entity in tweets has an average of 3.3 variations 2.",
        "As an illustrative example, we show ?Anneke Gron-loh?, which may occur as ?Mw.,Gronloh?, ?Anneke Kronloh?",
        "or ?Mevrouw G?.",
        "We thus propose NEN for tweets, which plays an important role in entity retrieval, trend detection, and event and entity tracking.",
        "For example, Khalid et al. (2008) show that even a simple normalization method leads to improvements of early precision, for both document and passage retrieval, and better normalization results in better retrieval performance.",
        "Traditionally, NEN is regarded as a septated task, which takes the output of NER as its input (Li et al., 2002; Cohen, 2005; Jijkoun et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2011).",
        "One limitation of this cascaded approach is that errors propagate from NER to NEN and there is no feedback from NEN to NER.",
        "As demonstrated by Khalid et al. (2008), most NEN errors are caused",
        "by recognition errors.",
        "Another challenge of NEN is the dearth of information in a single tweet, due to the short and noise-prone nature of tweets.",
        "Reportedly, the accuracy of a baseline NEN system based on Wikipedia drops considerably from 94% on edited news to 77% on news comments, a kind of user generated content (UGC) with similar style to tweets (Jijkoun et al., 2008).",
        "We propose jointly conducting NER and NEN on multiple tweets using a graphical model, to address these challenges.",
        "Intuitively, improving the performance of NER boosts the performance of NEN.",
        "For example, consider the following two tweets: ??",
        "?",
        "?Alex's jokes.",
        "Justin's smartness.",
        "Max's randomnes?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "and ??",
        "?",

        "?",
        "?.",
        "Identifying ?Alex?",
        "and ?Alex Russo?",
        "as PERSON will encourage NEN systems to normalize ?Alex?",
        "into ?Alex Russo?.",
        "On the other hand, NEN can guide NER.",
        "For instance, consider the following two tweets: ??",
        "?",
        "?",
        "she knew Burger King when he was a Prince!?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "and ??",
        "?",
        "?",
        "I'm craving all sorts of food: mcdonalds, burger king, pizza, chinese?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?.",
        "Suppose the NEN system believes that ?burger king?",
        "cannot be mapped to ?Burger King?",
        "since these two tweets are not similar in content.",
        "This will help NER to assign them different types of labels.",
        "Our method optimizes these two tasks simultaneously by enabling them to interact with each other.",
        "This largely differentiates our method from existing work.",
        "Furthermore, considering multiple tweets simultaneously allows us to exploit the redundancy in tweets, as suggested by Liu et al. (2011).",
        "For example, consider the following two tweets: ??",
        "?",
        "?Bobby Shaw you don't invite the wind?",
        "?",
        "?",
        "?",

        "?",
        "?",
        "?.",
        "Recognizing ?Bobby Shaw?",
        "in the first tweet as a PERSON is easy owing to its capitalization and the following word ?you?, which in turn helps to identify ?bobby shaw?",
        "in the second tweet as a PERSON.",
        "We adopt a factor graph as our graphical model, which is constructed in the following manner.",
        "We first introduce a random variable for each word in every tweet, which represents the BILOU (Beginning, the Inside and the Last tokens of multi-token entities as well as Unit-length entities) label of the corresponding word.",
        "Then we add a factor to connect two neighboring variables, forming a conventional linear chain CRFs.",
        "Hereafter, we use tm to denote the mth tweet ,tim and yim to denote the ith word of of tm and itsBILOU label, respectively, and f im to denote the factor related to yi?1m and yim.",
        "Next, for each word pair with the same lemma, denoted by tim and t j n, we introduce a binary random variable, denoted by zijmn, whose value indicates whether tim and tjn belong to two mentions of the same entity.",
        "Finally, for any zijmn we add a factor, denoted by f ijmn, to connect yim, y j n and zijmn.",
        "Factors in the same group ({f ijmn} or {f im}) share the same set of feature templates.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates an example of our factor graph for two tweets.",
        "NEN on multiple tweets.",
        "Blue and green circles represent NE type (y-serials) and normalization variables (z-serials), respectively; filled circles indicate observed random variables; blue rectangles represent the factors connecting neighboring y-serial variables while red rectangles stand for the factors connecting distant y-serial and z-serial variables.",
        "It is worth noting that our factor graph is different from the skip-chain CRFs (Galley, 2006) in the sense that any skip-chain factor of our model consists not only of two NE type variables (yim and y j n), which is the case for skip-chain CRFs, but also a normalization variable (zijmn).",
        "It is these normalization variables that enable us to conduct NER and NEN jointly.",
        "We manually add normalization information to the data set shared by Liu et al. (2011), to evaluate our method.",
        "Experimental results show that our method achieves 83.6% F1 for NER and 82.6% Accuracy for NEN, outperforming the baseline with 80.2%F1 for NER and 79.4% Accuracy for NEN.",

        "1.",
        "We introduce the task of NEN for tweets, and propose jointly conducting NER and NEN for",
