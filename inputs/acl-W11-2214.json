        "Many words in a language have several distinct meanings.",
        "For example, \"earth\" may refer to the planet Earth, dirt, or solid ground, depending on the context.",
        "The goal of Word Sense Induction (WSI) is to automatically discover the different senses by examining how a word is used.",
        "This unsupervised discovery process produces a sense inventory where the number of senses is corpus-driven and where senses may reflect additional usages not present in a predefined sense inventory, such as those for medicine or law (Dorow and Widdows, 2003).",
        "Furthermore, these discovered senses can be used to automatically expand lexical resources such as WordNet or FrameNet (Klapaftis and Manandhar, 2010).",
        "Discovering the multiple senses is frequently confounded by the relationships between a word's senses.",
        "While homonyms such as \"bass\" or \"bank\" have unrelated senses, many polysemous words have interrelated senses, with lexicographers often in disagreement for the number of fine-grained senses (Palmer et al., 2007).",
        "For example, the most frequent four senses for \"law\" according to WordNet, shown in Table 1, are similar in several aspects and could be ascribed interchangeably in some contexts.",
        "The difficulty of automatically distinguishing two senses is proportional to their similarity because of the increasing likelihood of the two senses sharing similar contexts.",
        "While the issue distinguishing between related senses is a recognized issue for Word Sense Disambiguation (Chugur et al., 2002; McCarthy, 2006), which uses supervised training to learn sense distinctions, measuring the impact of sense relatedness on the harder problem of WSI remains unad-dressed.",
        "The recent SemEval WSI tasks (Agirre and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar and Klapaftis, 2009) have provided a standard framework for evaluating WSI systems, with a controlled training corpus designed to limit sense ambiguity in the example contexts.",
        "However, given the potential relatedness of a word's senses, we view it necessary to consider how WSI methods perform relative to the degree of contextual ambiguity.",
        "Our goal is therefore to quantify the similarity at which a WSI approach is unable to distinguish between two senses, which reflects the sense granularity at which the approach operates.",
        "We propose two new evaluations.",

        "Frequently, WSI is treated as an unsupervised clustering problem: The contexts in which a word appears are clustered in order to discover its senses (Navigli, 2009).",
        "We selected four diverse clustering algorithms for evaluation based on three criteria: (1) the ability to automatically determine the final number of clusters given an upper bound or a set of parameters, (2) an efficient run time, and (3) high quality results in either WSI or other fields related to text analysis.",
        "The first criteria is essential for WSI; the final number of senses must be derived without supervision in order to reflect the true number of senses present in the corpus.",
        "K-Means K-Means builds clusters based on the similarity between two data points.",
        "Clusters grow by assigning data points to the cluster with the most similar centroid.",
        "After every data point is assigned, each cluster's centroid is recalculated to be the average of all the data points assigned to the cluster.",
        "This process repeats until the centroids converge to a fixed point.",
        "We choose initial seeds at random and use the H2 criterion function (Zhao and Karypis, 2001).",
        "Although K-Means is efficient and widely used, it requires the number of clusters to be specified a priori.",
        "Therefore, we follow the WSI model of Pedersen and Kulkarni (2006) and use the Gap Statistic (Tibshirani et al., 2000) to automatically determine the number of clusters.",
        "The Gap Statistic runs K-Means repeatedly with different values of K, ranging from 1 to some sensible maximum.",
        "The Gap Statistic first induces a data model from the feature distributions of the initial dataset and then for each K, creates a set of artificial datasets by sampling from the derived model.",
        "K is increased until the \"gap\", i.e. the distance between the objective function of the original dataset and the average objective function of the artificial datasets, is larger then the gap for the previous K value.",
        "We calculate the gap using 10 artificial data sets sampled from the model.",
        "Spectral Clustering Spectral Clustering interprets a dataset's elements as vertices in graph with edges based on their similarity (Ng et al., 2001).",
        "Clusters are found by identifying the graph partition that produces the minimum conductance between every partition.",
        "This can be thought of as trying to find small islands that are connected by as few bridges as possible.",
        "We refer the reader to (von Luxburg, 2007) for further technical details.",
        "To our knowledge, only He et al.",
        "(2010) have applied spectral clustering to WSI, which was performed on a Chinese dataset.",
        "However, the algorithm used by He et al.",
        "requires the number of clusters to be specified.",
        "We instead use a hybrid spectral clustering algorithm, first applied to information retrieval (Cheng et al., 2006), that automatically selects the number of clusters.",
        "This algorithm recursively partitions a dataset in half by finding the cut that produces the minimum conductance, which builds a tree of partitions.",
        "This split is done until either every data point is in its own partition or a maximum number of partitions is found.",
        "Partitions are then dynamically merged, starting at leaf partitions, based on a clustering criteria.",
        "We use the relaxed correlation criteria (Cheng et al., 2006), which tries to maximize both inter cluster similarity and intra cluster dissimilarity.",
        "The final cluttering generated is then the best tree-respecting partition of the original data set.",
        "Clustering By Committee Pantel and Lin (2002) found that K-Means clustering folded all features found in a cluster into the centroid, many of which are not useful for identifying the desired word sense.",
        "To overcome this, they proposed a novel clustering algorithm for WSI, Clustering by Committee (CBC), which includes only the most distinguishing features for a cluster into the centroid.",
        "For each context, an initial set of \"committees\" is formed by clustering the most similar contexts to each context, with the resulting committees ranked to prefer larger, highly similar clusters.",
        "The final set of committees (sense clusters) are selected by recursively identifying the highest ranking committees that are dissimilar to each other and then repeating the process for any contexts not similar to existing committees.",
        "In essence, CBC aims to find the clusters that are similar to the largest set of contexts, while keeping clusters dissimilar from each other.",
        "CBC's recursion ensures that contexts dissimilar to the large committees are still grouped into their own smaller committees, which enables the discovery of infrequent senses with distinct contexts.",
        "We use a hard sense assignment for each context, i.e., a context is labeled with only one sense according to the most similar cluster.",
        "Streaming K-Means As WSI moves into inducing senses from Web-scale amounts of data, existing clustering algorithms that keep all contexts in memory become impractical.",
        "Jurgens and Stevens (2010a) proposed an on-line hybrid clustering solution using on-line K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, which automatically decided the number of clusters without retaining all the contexts.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, theirs is the only work using an on-line approach.",
        "We extend this work by applying a more theoretically sound online K-Means algorithm, called Streaming K-Means (Braverman et al., 2011), to WSI.",
        "We use Streaming K-Means to conduct a direct algorithmic comparison with K-Means in the hopes that online approaches can be made just as effective as off-line approaches.",
        "Streaming K-Means processes each data point only once, thus reducing the memory overhead dramatically.",
        "Instead of recording each data point, it immediately assigns each data point to a cluster and maintains K• C clusters.",
        "C varies as the algorithm runs, initially being set to 0.",
        "When assigning a data point, it is only assigned to an existing cluster when their similar is above some threshold, otherwise the data point becomes the centroid of a new cluster.",
        "Once C reaches a threshold, based on an estimate of the number of data points, or the overall K-Means clustering cost reaches some limit, the centroids are treated as new data points and re-clustered, with the goal of merging some centroids.",
        "We follow (Jur-gens and Stevens, 2010a) and cluster the final centroids with Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, with the average link criteria as suggested by (Ped-ersen and Bruce, 1997)."

        "Because we treat word ordering as a syntactic feature, we limit the context to words occurring in the same sentence.",
