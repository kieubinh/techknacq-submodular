        "Since in each of these three cases there is no pretheoretical ambiguity involved, it is clear that this lexicon violates the following efficiency-motivated ideal on human language lexicons, in the Chomskyan sense of locus of non-systematic information: ideal of functionality a lexicon is ideally a function from morphemes to category labels, modulo genuine ambiguity Another efficiency-motivated ideal which the CCG lexicon in Table 2 can be argued to violate is the following: ideal of atomicity a lexicon is a mapping from morphemes ideally to atomic category labels In the above example, the transitive verb love is mapped to the decidedly non-atomic category label (S\\NPsb)/NPobi.",
        "Lexicons which violate the j criteria of functionality and atomicity are not just inefficient in terms of storage space and development time.",
