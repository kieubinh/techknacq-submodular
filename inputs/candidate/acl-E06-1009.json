        "The goal of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) is to offer efficient and natural access to applications and services, such as email and calendars, travel and entertainment booking, and product recommendation.",
        "In evaluating nine SDS in the DARPA Communicator domain (flight, hotel, and rental car hire), Walker et al.",
        "(2001) found that (1) shorter task duration correlates with higher user satisfaction, and (2) the information presentation phase of dialogues is the primary contributor to dialogue duration.",
        "During this phase, the typical system enumerates the set of options that match the user’s constraints, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The user can then refine these options by offering new constraints.",
        "When the number of options to be presented is large, this process can be painstaking, leading to reduced user satisfaction.",
        "Moreover, as",
        "Walker et al.",
        "(2004) observe, having to access the set of available options sequentially makes it difficult for the user to remember the various aspects of multiple options and to compare them in memory.",
        "Clearly, alternative strategies to sequential presentation of information in SDS are needed.",
        "Recently, two approaches have been proposed.",
        "In the user-model (UM) based approach, the system identifies a small number of options that best match the user’s preferences (Moore et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2004).",
        "In the summarize and refine (SR) approach, the system structures the large number of options into a small number of clusters that share attributes.",
        "The system summarizes the clusters based on their attributes and then prompts the user to provide additional constraints (Polifroni et al., 2003; Chung, 2004).",
        "In this paper, we present an algorithm that combines the benefits of these two approaches in an approach to information presentation that integrates user modelling with automated clustering.",
        "Thus, the system provides detail only about those options that are of some relevance to the user, where relevance is determined by the user model.",
        "If there are multiple relevant options, a cluster-based tree structure orders these options to allow for stepwise refinement.",
        "The effectiveness of the tree structure, which directs the dialogue flow, is optimized by taking the user’s preferences into account.",
        "Complex tradeoffs between alternative options are presented explicitly to allow for a better overview and a more informed choice.",
        "In addition, we address the issue of giving the user a good overview of the option space, despite selecting only the relevant options, by briefly accounting for the remaining (irrelevant) options.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe the prior approaches in more detail, and discuss their limitations (Section 2).",
        "In section 3, we describe our approach, which integrates user preferences with automated clustering and summarization in an attempt to overcome the problems of the original approaches.",
        "Section 4 presents our clustering and content structuring algorithms and addresses issues in information presentation.",
        "In Section 5, we describe an evaluation of our approach and discuss its implications."

        "Previous work in natural language generation showed how a multi-attribute decision-theoretic model of user preferences could be used to determine the attributes that are most relevant to mention when generating recommendations tailored to a particular user (Carenini and Moore, 2001).",
        "In the MATCH system, Walker et al.",
        "(2004) applied this approach to information presentation in SDS, and extended it to generate summaries and comparisons among options, thus showing how the model can be used to determine which options to mention, as well as the attributes that the user will find most relevant to choosing among them.",
        "Evaluation showed that tailoring recommendations and comparisons to the user increases argument effectiveness and improves user satisfaction (Stent et al., 2002).",
        "MATCH included content planning algorithms to determine what options and attributes to mention, but used a simple template based approach to realization.",
        "In the FLIGHTS system, Moore et al.",
        "(2004) focussed on organizing and expressing the descriptions of the selected options and attributes, in ways that are both easy to understand and memorable.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows a description of options that is tailored to a user who prefers flying business class, on direct flights, and on KLM, in that order.",
        "In FLIGHTS, coherence and naturalness of descriptions were increased by reasoning about information structure (Steedman, 2000) to control intonation, using referring expressions that highlight attributes relevant to the user (e.g., “the cheapest flight” vs. “a KLM flight” ), and signalling discourse relations (e.g., contrast) with appropriate intonational and discourse cues.",
        "This prior work demonstrated that the user model-based approach can concisely present a relatively small number of options, pointing out the ways in which those options satisfy user preferences.",
        "It is an appropriate strategy for SDS when there are a small number of options to present, either because the number of options is limited or because users can supply sufficient constraints to winnow down a large set before querying the database of options.",
        "However, there are several limitations to this approach.",
        "First, it does not scale up to presenting a large number of options.",
        "When there are hundreds of options to consider (e.g., when choosing among consumer products, hotels, or restaurants) there may be many options that are close in score.",
        "In addition, users may not be able to provide constraints until they hear more information about the space of options.",
        "This brings up a second problem with the UM-based approach, namely that it does not provide the user with an overview of the option space, because options scoring below a specified threshold are not mentioned.",
        "This is related to the third problem, which is that users might miss out on options they would have chosen if they had heard about them.",
        "These last two problems may reduce user confidence in the system, if users have the perception that the system is not telling them about all of the available options.",
        "This may ultimately lead to a decrease in user satisfaction."

        "Qu and Beale (2003) had previously addressed the problem of responding to user queries with several constraints and used linguistic cues to determine which constraints had to be relaxed.",
        "Our discussion and evaluation of the SR approach is based on Chung’s version.",
        "Although the SR approach provides a solution to the problem of presenting information when there are large numbers of options in a way that is suitable for SDS, it has several limitations.",
        "First, there may be long paths in the dialogue structure.",
        "Because the system does not know about the user’s preferences, the option clusters may contain many irrelevant entities which must be filtered out successively with each refinement step.",
        "In addition, the difficulty of summarizing options typically increases with their number, because values are more likely to be very diverse, to the point that a summary about them gets uninformative (“I found flights on 9 airlines.”).",
        "A second problem with the SR approach is that exploration of tradeoffs is difficult when there is no optimal option.",
        "If at least one option satisfies all requirements, this option can be found efficiently with the SR strategy.",
        "But the system does not point out alternative tradeoffs if no “optimal” option exists.",
        "For example, in the flight booking domain, suppose the user wants a flight that is cheap and direct, but there are only expensive direct and cheap indirect flights.",
        "In the SR approach, as described by Polifroni, the user has to ask for cheap flights and direct flights separately and thus has to explore different refinement paths.",
        "Finally, the attribute that suggests the next user constraint may be suboptimal.",
        "The procedure for computing the attribute to use in suggesting the next restriction to the user is based on the considerations for efficient summarization, that is, the attribute that will partition the data set into the smallest number of clusters.",

        "In this paper, we have shown that information presentation in SDS can be improved by an approach that combines a user model with structuring of options through clustering of attributes and successive refinement.",
        "In particular, when presented with dialogues generated by a system that combines user modelling with successive refinement (UMSR) and one that uses refinement without reference to a user model (SR), participants reported that the combined system provided them with a better overview of the available options and that they felt more certain to have been presented with all relevant options.",
        "Although the presentation of complex tradeoffs usually requires relatively long system turns, participants were still able to cope with the amount of information presented.",
        "For some dialogues, subjects even felt they could access relevant options more quickly despite longer system turn length.",
        "In future work, we would like to extend the clustering algorithm to not use a fixed number of target clusters but to depend on the number of natural clusters the data falls into.",
        "We would also like to extend it to be more sensitive to the user model when forming clusters (e.g., to be more sensitive at lower price levels for a user for whom price is very important than for a user who does not care about price).",
        "The explicit presentation of tradeoffs made by the UMSR system in many cases leads to dialogue turns that are more complex than typical dialogue turns in the SR system.",
        "Even though participants did not report that our system was harder to understand, it would be interesting to investigate how well users can understand and remember information from the system when part of their concentration is absorbed by another task, for example when using the system while driving a car."
