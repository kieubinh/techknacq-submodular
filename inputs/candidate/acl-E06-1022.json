        "Addressing is an aspect of every form of communication.",
        "It represents a form of orientation and directionality of the act the current actor performs toward the particular other(s) who are involved in an interaction.",
        "In conversational communication involving two participants, the hearer is always the addressee of the speech act that the speaker performs.",
        "Addressing, however, becomes a real issue in multi-party conversation.",
        "The concept of addressee as well as a variety of mechanisms that people use in addressing their speech have been extensively investigated by conversational analysts and social psychologists (Goffman, 1981a; Goodwin, 1981; Clark and Carlson, 1982).",
        "Recently, addressing has received considerable attention in modeling multi-party interaction in various domains.",
        "Research on automatic addressee identification has been conducted in the context of mixed human-human and human-computer interaction (Bakx et al., 2003; van Turnhout et al., 2005), human-human-robot interaction (Katzenmaier et al., 2004), and mixed human-agents and multi-agents interaction (Traum, 2004).",
        "In the context of automatic analysis of multi-party face-to-face conversation, Otsuka et al.",
        "(2005) proposed a framework for automating inference of conversational structure that is defined in terms of conversational roles: speaker, addressee and unaddressed participants.",
        "In this paper, we focus on addressee identification in a special type of communication, namely, face-to-face meetings.",
        "Moreover, we restrict our analysis to small group meetings with four participants.",
        "Automatic analysis of recorded meetings has become an emerging domain for a range of research focusing on different aspects of interactions among meeting participants.",
        "The outcomes of this research should be combined in a targeted application that would provide users with useful information about meetings.",
        "For answering questions such as “Who was asked to prepare a presentation for the next meeting?” or “Were there any arguments between participants A and B?”, some sort of understanding of dialogue structure is required.",
        "In addition to identification of dialogue acts that participants perform in multi-party dialogues, identification of addressees of those acts is also important for inferring dialogue structure.",
        "There are many applications related to meeting research that could benefit from studying addressing in human-human interactions.",
        "The results can be used by those who develop communicative agents in interactive intelligent environments and remote meeting assistants.",
        "These agents need to recognize when they are being addressed and how they should address people in the environment.",
        "This paper presents results on addressee identi",

        "The goals in the current paper are (1) to find relevant features for addressee classification in meeting conversations using information obtained from multi-modal resources - gaze, speech and conversational context, (2) to explore to what extent the performances of classifiers can be improved by combining different types of features obtained from these resources, (3) to investigate whether the information about meeting context can aid the performances of classifiers, and (4) to compare performances of the Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers for the task of addressee prediction over various feature sets."

        "When a speaker contributes to the conversation, all those participants who happen to be in perceptual range of this event will have “some sort of participation status relative to it”.",
        "The conversational roles that the participants take in a given conversational situation make up the “participation framework” (Goffman, 1981b).",
        "Goffman (1976) distinguished three basic kinds of hearers: those who overhear, whether or not their unratified participation is unintentional or encouraged; those who are ratified but are not specifically addressed by the speaker (also called unaddressed recipients (Goffman, 1981a)); and those ratified participants who are addressed.",
        "Ratified participants are those participants who are allowed to take part in conversation.",
        "Regarding hearers’ roles in meetings, we are focused only on ratified participants.",
        "Therefore, the problem of addressee identification amounts to the problem of distinguishing addressed from unaddressed participants for each dialogue act that speakers perform.",
        "Goffman (1981a) defined addressees as those “ratified participants () oriented to by the speaker in a manner to suggest that his words are particularly for them, and that some answer is therefore anticipated from them, more so than from the other ratified participants”.",
        "According to this, it is the speaker who selects his addressee; the addressee is the one who is expected by the speaker to react on what the speaker says and to whom, therefore, the speaker is giving primary attention in the present act.",
        "In meeting conversations, a speaker may address his utterance to the whole group of participants present in the meeting, or to a particular subgroup of them, or to a single participant in particular.",
        "A speaker can also just think aloud or mumble to himself without really addressing anybody (e.g. “What else do I want to say?” (while trying to evoke more details about the issue that he is presenting)).",
        "We excluded self-addressed speech from our study.",
        "Addressing behavior is behavior that speakers show to express to whom they are addressing their speech.",
        "It depends on the course of the conversation, the status of attention of participants, their current involvement in the discussion as well as on what the participants know about each others’ roles and knowledge, whether explicit addressing behavior is called for.",
        "Using a vocative is the explicit verbal way to address someone.",
        "In some cases the speaker identifies the addressee of his speech by looking at the addressee, sometimes accompanying this by deictic hand gestures.",
        "Addressees can also be designated by the manner of speaking.",
        "For example, by whispering, a speaker can select a single individual or a group of people as addressees.",
        "Addressees are often designated by the content of what is being said.",
        "For example, when making the suggestion “We all have to decide together about the design”, the speaker is addressing the whole group.",
        "In meetings, people may perform various group actions (termed as meeting actions) such as presentations, discussions or monologues (McCowan et al., 2003).",
        "A type of group action that meeting participants perform may influence the speaker’s addressing behavior.",
        "For example, speakers may show different behavior during a presentation than during a discussion when addressing an individual: regardless of the fact that a speaker has turned his back to a participant in the audience during a presentation, he most probably addresses his speech to the group including that participant, whereas the same behavior during a discussion, in many situations, indicates that that participant is unaddressed.",
        "In this paper, we focus on speech and gaze aspects of addressing behavior as well as on contextual aspects such as conversational history and meeting actions."

        "In this section, we present our motivation for feature selection, referring also to some existing work",
        "on the examination of cues that are relevant for addressee identification.",
        "Adjacency pairs and addressing - Adjacency pairs (AP) are minimal dialogic units that consist of pairs of utterances called “first pair-part” (or a-part) and the “second pair-part” (or b-part) that are produced by different speakers.",
        "Examples include question-answers or statement-agreement.",
        "In the exploration of the conversational organization, special attention has been given to the a-parts that are used as one of the basic techniques for selecting a next speaker (Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "For addressee identification, the main focus is on b-parts and their addressees.",
        "It is to be expected that the apart provides a useful cue for identification of addressee of the b-part (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "However, it does not imply that the speaker of the apart is always the addressee of the b-part.",
        "For example, A can address a question to B, whereas B’s reply to A’s question is addressed to the whole group.",
        "In this case, the addressee of the b-part includes the speaker of the apart.",
        "Dialogue acts and addressing When designing an utterance, a speaker intends not only to perform a certain communicative act that contributes to a coherent dialogue (in the literature referred to as dialogue act), but also to perform that act toward the particular others.",
        "Within a turn, a speaker may perform several dialogue acts, each of those having its own addressee ( e.g.",
        "I agree with you [agreement; addressed to a previous speaker] but is this what we want [information request; addressed to the group]).",
        "Dialogue act types can provide useful information about addressing types since some types of dialogue acts such as agreements or disagreements tend to be addressed to an individual rather than to a group.",
        "More information about the addressee of a dialogue can be induced by combining the dialogue act information with some lexical markers that are used as addressee “indicators” (e.g. you, we, everybody, all of you) (Jovanovic and op den Akker, 2004).",
        "Gaze behavior and addressing Analyzing dyadic conversations, researchers into social interaction observed that gaze in social interaction is used for several purposes: to control communication, to provide a visual feedback, to communicate emotions and to communicate the nature of relationships (Kendon, 1967; Argyle, 1969).",
        "Recent studies into multi-party interaction emphasized the relevance of gaze as a means of addressing.",
        "Vertegaal (1998) investigated to what extent the focus of visual attention might function as an indicator for the focus of “dialogic attention” in four-participants face-to-face conversations.",
        "“Di-alogic attention” refers to attention while listening to a person as well as attention while talking to one or more persons.",
        "Empirical findings show that when a speaker is addressing an individual, there is 77% chance that the gazed person is addressed.",
        "When addressing a triad, speaker gaze seems to be evenly distributed over the listeners in the situation where participants are seated around the table.",
        "It is also shown that on average a speaker spends significantly more time gazing at an individual when addressing the whole group, than at others when addressing a single individual.",
        "When addressing an individual, people gaze 1.6 times more while listening (62%) than while speaking (40%).",
        "When addressing a triad the amount of speaker gaze increases significantly to 59%.",
        "According to all these estimates, we can expect that gaze directional cues are good indicators for addressee prediction.",
        "However, these findings cannot be generalized in the situations where some objects of interest are present in the conversational environment, since it is expected that the amount of time spent looking at the persons will decrease significantly.",
        "As shown in (Bakx et al., 2003), in a situation where a user interacts with a multimodal information system and in the meantime talks to another person, the user looks most of the time at the system, both when talking to the system (94%) and when talking to the user (57%).",
        "Also, another person looks at the system in 60% of cases when talking to the user.",
        "Bakx et al.",
        "(2003) also showed that some improvement in addressee detection can be achieved by combining utterance duration with gaze.",
        "In meeting conversations, the contribution of the gaze direction to addressee prediction is also affected by the current meeting activity and seating arrangement (Jovanovic and op den Akker, 2004).",
        "For example, when giving a presentation, a speaker most probably addresses his speech to the whole audience, although he may only look at a single participant in the audience.",
        "A seating arrangement determines a visible area for each meeting participant.",
        "During a turn, a speaker mostly looks at the participants who are in his visible area.",
        "Moreover, the speaker frequently looks at a single participant in his visual area when addressing a group.",
        "However, when he wants to address a single participant outside his visual area, he will often turn his body and head toward that participant.",
        "In this paper, we explored not only the effectiveness of the speaker’s gaze direction, but also the effectiveness of the listeners’ gaze directions as cues for addressee prediction.",
        "Meeting context and addressing As Goffman (1981a) has noted, “the notion of a conversational encounter does not suffice in dealing with the context in which words are spoken; a social occasion involving a podium event or no speech event at all may be involved, and in any case, the whole social situation, the whole surround, must always be considered”.",
        "A set of various meeting actions that participants perform in meetings is one aspect of the social situation that differentiates meetings from other contexts of talk such as ordinary conversations, interviews or trials.",
        "As noted above, it influences addressing behavior as well as the contribution of gaze to addressee identification.",
        "Furthermore, distributions of addressing types vary for different meeting actions.",
        "Clearly, the percentage of the utterances addressed to the whole group during a presentation is expected to be much higher than during a discussion."

        "As the only targets of interest for addressee identification are meeting participants, the meetings were annotated with the tag set that contains tags that are linked to each participant Px and the NoTarget tag that is used when the speaker does not look at any of the participants.",

        "A small decrease in the classification accuracies when excluding AP information (about 3%) indicates that remaining contextual, utterance and gaze features capture most of the useful information provided by AP.",

        "However, the highest accuracies for both classifiers are reached by combining contextual and utterance features with speaker’s gaze (BN:82.59%, NB:78.49%).",
        "We have also explored the effect of meeting context on the classification task.",
        "Surprisingly, addressee classifiers showed little gain from the information about meeting actions (BN:83.74%, NB:79.90%).",
        "For all feature sets, the Bayesian Network classifier outperforms the Naive Bayes classifier.",
        "In contrast to Vertegaal (1998) and Otsuka et al.",
        "(2005) findings, where it is shown that gaze can be a good predictor for addressee in four-participants face-to-face conversations, our results",
        "show that in four-participants face-to-face meetings, gaze is less effective as an addressee indicator.",
        "This can be due to several reasons.",
        "First, they used different seating arrangements which is implicated in the organization of gaze.",
        "Second, our meeting environment contains attentional ‘dis-tracters’ such as whiteboard, projector screen and notes.",
        "Finally, during a meeting, in contrast to an ordinary conversation, participants perform various meeting actions which may influence gaze as an aspect of addressing behavior.",
        "We will continue our work on addressee identification on the large AMI data collection that is currently in production.",
        "The AMI corpus contains more natural, scenario-based, meetings that involve groups focused on the design of a TV remote control.",
        "Some initial experiments on the AMI pilot data show that additional challenges for addressee identification on the AMI data are: roles that participants play in the meetings (e.g. project manager or marketing expert) and additional attentional ‘distracters’ present in the meeting room such as, the task object at first place and laptops.",
        "This means that a richer feature set should be explored to improve classifiers’ performances on the AMI data including, for example, the background knowledge about participants’ roles.",
        "We will also focus on the development of new models that better handle conditional and contextual dependencies among different types of features."
