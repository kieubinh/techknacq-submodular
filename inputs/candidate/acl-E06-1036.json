        "Thanks to a discourse structure one can precisely point out an information, provide it a local context, situate it globally, link it to others.",
        "The context of our research is to improve automatic discourse analysis.",
        "A key feature of the most popular discourse theories (RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987), SDRT (Asher, 1993), etc.)",
        "is the distinction between two sorts of discourse relations or rhetorical functions: the subordinating and the coordinating relations (some parts of a text play a subordinate role relative to other parts, while some others have equal importance).",
        "In this paper, we focus our attention on a discourse feature we assume supporting coordination relations, namely the Textual Parallelism.",
        "Based on psycholinguistics studies (Dubey et al., 2005), our intuition is that similarities concerning the surface, the content and the structure of textual units can be a way for authors to explicit their intention to consider these units with the same rhetorical importance.",
        "Parallelism can be encountered in many specific discourse structures such as continuity in information structure (Kruijff-Korbayov´a and Kruijff, 1996), frame structures (Charolles, 1997), VP ellipses (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997), headings (Summers, 1998), enumerations (Luc et al., 1999), etc.",
        "These phenomena are usually treated mostly independently within individual systems with ad-hoc resource developments.",
        "In this work, we argue that, depending on description granularity we can proceed, computing syntagmatic (succession axis of linguistic units) and paradigmatic (substitution axis) similarities between units can allow us to generically handle such discourse structural phenomena.",
        "Section 2 introduces the discourse parallelism phenomenon.",
        "Section 3 develops three methods we implemented to detect it: a similarity degree measure, a string editing distance (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) and a tree editing distance1 (Zhang and Shasha, 1989).",

        "This account is not limited to the semantic dimension as defined by (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) who consider text fragments as parallel if the same predicate can be inferred from them with coreferential or similar pairs of arguments.",
        "We observe parallelism at various structural levels of text: among heading structures, VP ellipses and others, enumerations of noun phrases in a sentence, enumerations with or without markers such as frame introducers (e.g. “In France, ...In Italy, ... ”) or typographical and layout markers.",
        "The underlying assumption is that parallelism between some textual units accounts for a rhetorical coordination relation.",
        "It means that these units can be regarded as equally important.",
        "By describing textual units in a two-tier framework composed of a paradigmatic level and syntagmatic level, we argue that, depending on the description granularity we consider (potentially at the character level for item numbering), we can detect a wide variety of parallelism phenomena.",

        "First, it seems that a different ordering of the parallel constituents in the sentences alter the performances of the edit distance algorithms (3.2; 3.3).",
        "The following example (Green) received a low score with both methods: When we consider AnsV as our dependent variable, the model for the High Web group is still not significant, and there is still a high probability that the coefficient of LI is 0.",
        "For our Low Web group, who followed significantly more intra-article links than the High Web group, the model that results is significant and has the following equation: <EQN/>.",
        "This is due to the fact that both algorithms do not allow the inversion of two constituents and thus are unable to find all the links from the first sentence to the other.",
        "The parallelism measure is robust to inversion.",
        "Sometimes, the syntactic parser gave different analyses for the same expression, which made mapping between the sentences containing this expression more difficult, especially for the tree edit distance.",
        "The syntactic structure has less importance for the other methods, which are thus more insensitive to an incorrect analysis.",
        "Finally, the parallelism measure seems more adapted to a diffuse distribution of the parallel constituents in the sentences, whereas edit distances seem more appropriate when parallel constituents are concentrated in a certain part of the sentences, in similar syntactic structures.",
        "The following example (Green) obtained very high scores with the edit distances only: Strong relations are also said to exist between words that have synsets connected by a single horizontal link or words that have synsets connected by a single IS-A or INCLUDES relation.",
        "A regular relation is said to exist between two words when there is at least one allowable path between a synset containing the first word and a synset containing the second word in the WordNet database."
