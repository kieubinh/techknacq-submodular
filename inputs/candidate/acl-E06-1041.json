        "The problem of Generating Referring Expressions (GRE) can be summed up as a search for the properties in a knowledge base (KB) whose combination uniquely distinguishes a set of referents from their dis-tractors.",
        "The content determination strategy adopted in such algorithms is usually based on the assumption (made explicit in Reiter (1990)) that the space of possible descriptions is partially ordered with respect to some principle(s) which determine their adequacy.",
        "Traditionally, these principles have been defined via an interpretation of the Gricean maxims (Dale, 1989; Reiter, 1990; Dale and Reiter, 1995; van Deemter, 2002)1.",
        "However, little attention has been paid to contextual or intentional influences on attribute selection (but cf. Jordan and Walker (2000); Krahmer and The-une (2002)).",
        "Furthermore, it is often assumed that all relevant knowledge about domain objects is represented in the database in a format (e.g. attribute-value pairs) that requires no further processing.",
        "This paper is concerned with two scenarios which raise problems for such an approach to GRE: 1.",
        "Real-valued attributes, e.g. size or spatial coordinates, which represent continuous dimensions.",
        "The utility of such attributes depends on whether a set of referents have values that are ‘sufficiently",
        "close’ on the given dimension, and ‘sufficiently distant’ from those of their distractors.",
        "We discuss this problem in §2.",
        "2.",
        "Perspective-taking The contextual appropriateness of a description depends on the perspective being taken in context.",
        "For instance, if it is known of a referent that it is a teacher, and a sportsman, it is better to talk of the teacher in a context where another referent has been introduced as the student.",
        "This is discussed further in §3.",
        "Our aim is to motivate an approach to GRE where these problems are solved by preprocessing the information in the knowledge base, prior to content determination.",
        "To this end, §4 describes a clustering algorithm and shows how it can be applied to these different problems to structure the KB prior to GRE."

        "Several types of information about domain entities, such as gradable properties (van Deemter, 2000) and physical location, are best captured by real-valued attributes.",
        "Here, we focus on the example of location as an attribute taking a tuple of values which jointly determine the position of an entity.",
        "The ability to distinguish groups is a well-established feature of the human perceptual apparatus (Wertheimer, 1938; Treisman, 1982).",
        "Representing salient groups can facilitate the task of excluding distractors in the search for a referent.",
        "For instance, the set of referents marked as the intended referential target in Figure 1 is easily distinguishable as a group and warrants the use of a spatial description such as the objects in the top left corner, possibly with a collective predicate, such as clustered or gathered.",
        "In case of reference to a subset of the marked set, although location would be insufficient to distinguish the targets, it would reduce the distractor set and facilitate reference resolution2.",
        "In GRE, an approach to spatial reference based on grouping has been proposed by Funakoshi et al.",
        "2Location has been found to significantly facilitate resolution, even when it is logically redundant (Arts, 2004)",
        "(2004).",
        "Given a domain and a target referent, a sequence of groups is constructed, starting from the largest group containing the referent, and recursively narrowing down the group until only the referent is identified.",
        "The entire sequence is then rendered linguistically.",
        "The algorithm used for identifying perceptual groups is the one proposed by Thorisson (1994), the core of which is a procedure which takes as input a list of pairs of objects, ordered by the distance between the entities in the pairs.",
        "The procedure loops through the list, finding the greatest difference in distance between two adjacent pairs.",
        "This is determined as a cutoff point for group formation.",
        "Two problems are raised by this approach: P1 Ambiguous clusters A domain entity can be placed in more than one group.",
        "If, say, the input list is ({a, b}, {c, e}, {a, f }) and the greatest difference after the first iteration is between {c, e} and {a, f }, then the first group to be formed will be {a, b, c, e} with {a, f } likely to be placed in a different group after further iterations.",
        "This may be confusing from a referential point of view.",
        "The problem arises because grouping or clustering takes place on the basis of pairwise proximity or distance.",
        "This problem can be partially circumvented by identifying groups on several perceptual dimensions (e.g. spatial distance, colour, and shape) and then seeking to merge identical groups determined on the basis of these different qualities (see Thorisson (1994)).",
        "However, the grouping strategy can still return groups which do not conform to human perceptual principles.",
        "A better strategy is to base clustering on the Nearest Neighbour Principle, familiar from computational geometry (Prepaarata and Shamos, 1985), whereby elements are clustered with their nearest neighbours, given a distance function.",
        "The solution offered below is based on this principle.",
        "P2 Perceptual proximity Absolute distance is not sufficient for cluster identification.",
        "In Figure 1, for example, the pairs {e1, e2} and {e5, e6} could easily be consecutively ranked, since the distance between e1 and e2 is roughly equal to that between e5 and e6.",
        "However, they would not naturally be clustered together by a human observer, because grouping of objects also needs to take into account the position of the surrounding elements.",
        "Thus, while e1 is as far away from e2 as e5 is from e6, there are elements which are closer to {e1, e2} than to {e5, e6}.",
        "The proposal in §4 represents a way of getting around these problems, which are expected to arise in any kind of domain where the information given is the pairwise distance between elements.",
        "Before turning to the framework, we consider another situation in GRE where the need for clustering could arise."

        "A description is functionally relevant if it succeeds in distinguishing the intended referent(s), but conversational relevance arises in part from implicatures carried by the use of attributes in context.",

        "The two kinds of problems discussed here could be resolved by preprocessing the KB in order to identify available perspectives.",
        "One way of doing this is to group available properties into clusters of semantically similar ones.",

        "The output of the target and baseline algorithms was compared to human output in the following ways: 1.",
        "By item In each of the eight test domains, an agreement score was calculated for each domain element e (i.e. 13 scores in each domain).",
        "Let Us be the set of distinct groups containing e proposed by the experimental participants, and let Ua be the set of unique groups containing e proposed by the algorithm (|Ua |= 1 in case of the target algorithm, but not necessarily for the baselines, since they do not impose a partition).",
        "For each pair (Ua,, Us,) of algorithm-human clusters, the agreement score was defined as",
        "i.e. the ratio of the number of elements on which the human/algorithm agree, and the number of elements on which they do not agree.",
        "This returns a number in (0, 1) with 1 indicating perfect agreement.",
        "The maximal such score for each entity was selected.",
        "This controlled for the possible advantage that the target algorithm might have, given that it, like the human participants, partitions the domain.",
        "2.",
        "By participant An overall mean agreement score was computed for each participant using the above formula for the target and baseline algorithms in each domain.",
        "Results by item Table 3 shows the mean and modal agreement scores obtained for both target and baseline in each domain type.",
        "At a glance, the target algorithm performed better than the baseline on the spatial domains, with a modal score of 1, indicating perfect agreement on 60% of the objects.",
        "The situation is different in the semantic domains, where target and baseline performed roughly equally well; in fact, the modal score of 1 accounts for 75% baseline scores.",
        "Unsurprisingly, the difference between target and baseline algorithms was reliable on the spatial domains (t = 2.865, p < .01), but not on the semantic domains (t < 1, ns).",
        "This was confirmed by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), testing the effect of algorithm (target/baseline) and domain type (spatial/semantic) on agreement results.",
        "There was a significant main effect of domain type (F = 6.399, p = .01), while the main effect of algorithm was marginally significant (F = 3.542, p = .06).",
        "However, there was a reliable type × algorithm interaction (F = 3.624, p = .05), confirming the finding that the agreement between target and human output differed between domain types.",
        "Given the relative lack of agreement between participants in the semantic clustering task, this is unsurprising.",
        "Although the analysis focused on maximal scores obtained per entity, if participants do not agree on groupings, then the means which are statistically compared are likely to mask a significant amount of variance.",
        "We now turn to the analysis by participants.",
        "Results by participant The difference between target and baselines in agreement across participants was significant both for spatial (t = 16.6, p < .01) and semantic (t = 5.759, t < .01) domain types.",
        "This corroborates the earlier conclusion: once participant variation is controlled for by including it in the statistical model, the differences between target and baseline show up as reliable across the board.",
        "A univariate ANOVA corroborates the results, showing no significant main effect of domain type (F < 1, ns), but a highly significant main effect of algorithm (F = 233.5, p < .01) and a significant interaction (F = 44.3, p < .01).",
        "Summary The results of the evaluation are encouraging, showing high agreement between the output of the algorithm and the output that was judged by humans as most appropriate.",
        "They also suggest framework of §4 corresponds to human intuitions better than the baselines tested here.",
        "However, these results should be interpreted with caution in the case of semantic clustering, where there was significant variability in human agreement.",
        "With respect to spatial clustering, one outstanding problem is that of reciprocal pairs which are too distant from eachother to form a perceptually well-formed cluster.",
        "We are extending the empirical study to new domains involving such cases, in order to infer from the human data a threshold on pairwise distance between entities, beyond which they are not clustered."
