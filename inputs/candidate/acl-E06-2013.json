        "Shallow semantic parsing has been an active area of research during the last few years.",
        "Semantic parsers, which are typically based on the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or PropBank formalisms, have proven useful in a number of NLP projects, such as information extraction and question answering.",
        "The main reason for their popularity is that they can produce a flat layer of semantic structure with a fair degree of robustness.",
        "Building English semantic parsers for the FrameNet standard has been studied widely (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004).",
        "These systems typically address the task of identifying and classifying Frame Elements (FEs), that is semantic arguments of predicates, for a given target word (predicate).",
        "Although the FE layer is arguably the most central, the FrameNet annotation standard defines a number of additional semantic layers, which contain information about support expressions (verbs and prepositions), copulas, null arguments, slot-fillers, and aspectual particles.",
        "This information can for example be used in a semantic parser to refine the meaning of a predicate, to link predicates in a sentence together, or possibly to improve detection and classification of FEs.",
        "The task of automatic reconstruction of the additional semantic layers has not been addressed by any previous system.",
        "In this work, we describe a system that automatically identifies the entities in those layers."

      "text": [
        "FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2003) is a comprehensive lexical database that lists descriptions of words in the frame-semantic paradigm (Fillmore, 1976).",
        "The core concept is the frame, which is conceptual structure that represents a type of situation, object, or event, coupled with a semantic valence description that describes what kinds of semantic arguments (frame elements) are allowed or required for that particular frame.",
        "The frames are arranged in an ontology using relations such as inheritance (such as the relation between COMMUNICATION and COM-MUNICATION_NOISE) and causative-of (such as KILLING and DEATH).",
        "For each frame, FrameNet lists a set of lemmas or lexical units (mostly nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but also a few prepositions and adverbs).",
        "When such a word occurs in a sentence, it is called a target word that evokes the frame.",
        "FrameNet comes with a large set of manually annotated example sentences, which is typically used by statistical systems for training and testing.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of such a sentence.",
        "Here, the target word eat evokes the INGESTION frame.",

        "• The FE layer, which defines the spans and semantic roles of the arguments of the predicate.",
        "• A part-of-speech-specific layer, which contains aspectual information for verbs; and copulas, support expressions, and slot filling information for nouns and adjectives.",

        "Some noun targets, typically denoting events, are often constructed using support verbs.",

        "Thus, the dependents of a support verb are annotated as FEs, just like for a verb target.",
        "Support verbs are annotated using the SUPP label on the Noun or Adjective layer.",
        "In the following sentence, there is a support verb (underwent) for the noun target (operation).",
        "[Frances Patterson] PATIENT underwent an operation at RMH today and is expected to be hospitalized for a week or more.",
        "The support verbs do not change the core semantics of the noun target (that is, they bear no relation to the frame).",
        "However, they may determine the relation between the FEs and the target (“point-of-view supports”, such as “undergo an operation” or “perform an operation”) or provide aspectual information (such as “start an operation”).",
        "The following sentence shows an example where a governing verb is not a support verb of the noun target.",
        "An automatic system must be able to distinguish support verbs from other verbs.",
        "A senior nurse observed the operation.",
        "Although a large majority of the support expressions are verbs, there are additionally some cases of support prepositions, such as the following example:"
