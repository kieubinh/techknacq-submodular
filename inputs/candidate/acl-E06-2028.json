        "When it does not refer to any referent, as in the sentence Thus, it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular... the pronoun is semantically empty or non-anaphoric.",
        "Any anaphora resolution system starts by identifying the pronoun occurrences and distinguishing the anaphoric and non-anaphoric occurrences of it.",
        "The first systems that tackled this classification problem were based either on manually written rules or on the automatic learning of relevant surface clues.",
        "Whatever strategy is used, these systems see their performances limited by the quality of knowledge they exploit, which is usually only partially reliable and heterogeneous.",
        "This article describes a new approach to go beyond the limits of traditional systems.",
        "This approach stands on the formalism, still little exploited for NLP, of Bayesian Network (BN).",
        "As a probabilistic formalism, it offers a great expression capacity to integrate heterogeneous knowledge in a single representation (Peshkin, 2003) as well as an elegant mechanism to take into account an a priori estimation of their reliability in the classification decision (Roth, 2002).",
        "In order to validate our approach we carried out various experiments on a corpus made up of abtsracts of genomic articles.",

        "The rules expresses some constraints which vary according to the delimiter.",
        "They concern the left context of the pronoun (it should not be immediately preceded by certain words like before, from to), the distance between the pronoun and the delimiter (it must be shorter than 25 words long), and finally the lexical items occurring between the pronoun and the delimiter (the sequence must or must not contain certain words belonging to specific sets, such as words expressing modality over the sentence content, e.g. certain, known, unclear...).",

        "In order to avoid this pitfall, (Lappin, 1994) proposes some more constrained rules in the form of finite state automata.",
        "Based on linguistic knowledge the automata recognize specific sequences like It is not/may be<Modaladj>; It is <Cogved> that <Subject> where <Modaladj> and <Cogv> are modal adjective and cognitive verbs classes known to introduce non-anaphoric it (e.g. necessary, possible and recommend, think).",
        "This system has a good precision (few false positive cases), but has a low recall (many false negative cases).",

        "It obtains 92.71%Acc to be compared with a 90.78%Acc score for the LC rules on the same corpus.",
        "The difficulty, however, comes from the fact that the information on which 1Accuraccy(Acc) is a classification measure: Acc=P+n+r� where p is the number of anaphoric P+N pronoun occurences tagged as non-anaphoric, which we call the false positive cases, n the number of non-anaphoric pronoun ocurrences tagged as anaphoric, the false negative cases.",

        "2 For instance in the sentences It is well documented that treatment of serum-grown... and It is generally accepted that Bcl-2 exerts... the it occurences are not classified as non-anaphorics because documented does not belong to the original verb class <Cogv> and generally does not appear in the previous automaton.",
