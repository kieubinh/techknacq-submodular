        "While standard information retrieval (IR) systems present the results of a query in the form of a ranked list of relevant documents, question answering (QA) systems attempt to return them in the form of sentences (or paragraphs, or phrases), responding more precisely to the user’s request.",
        "However, in most state-of-the-art QA systems the output remains independent of the questioner’s characteristics, goals and needs.",
        "In other words, there is a lack of user modelling: a 10-year-old and a University History student would get the same answer to the question: “When did the Middle Ages begin?”.",
        "Secondly, most of the effort of current QA is on factoid questions, i.e. questions concerning people, dates, etc., which can generally be answered by a short sentence or phrase (Kwok et al., 2001).",
        "The main QA evaluation campaign, TREC-QA 1, has long focused on this type of questions, for which the simplifying assumption is that there exists only one correct answer.",
        "Even recent TREC campaigns (Voorhees, 2003; Voorhees, 2004) do not move sufficiently beyond the factoid approach.",
        "They account for two types of non-factoid questions –list and definitional– but not for non-factoid answers.",
        "In fact, a) TREC defines list questions as questions requiring multiple factoid",
        "answers, b) it is clear that a definition question may be answered by spotting definitional passages (what is not clear is how to spot them).",
        "However, accounting for the fact that some simple questions may have complex or controversial answers (e.g. “What were the causes of World War II?”) remains an unsolved problem.",
        "We argue that in such situations returning a short paragraph or text snippet is more appropriate than exact answer spotting.",
        "Finally, QA systems rarely interact with the user: the typical session involves the user submitting a query and the system returning a result; the session is then concluded.",
        "To respond to these deficiencies of existing QA systems, we propose an adaptive system where a QA module interacts with a user model and a dialogue interface (see Figure 1).",
        "The dialogue interface provides the query terms to the QA module, and the user model (UM) provides criteria to adapt query results to the user’s needs.",
        "Given such information, the goal of the QA module is to be able to discriminate between simple/factoid answers and more complex answers, presenting them in a TREC-style manner in the first case and more appropriately in the second.",
        "Related work To our knowledge, our system is among the first to address the need for a different approach to non-factoid (complex/controversial)",
        "answers.",
        "Although the three-tiered structure of our QA module reflects that of a typical web-based QA system, e.g. MULDER (Kwok et al., 2001), a significant aspect of novelty in our architecture is that the QA component is supported by the user model.",
        "Additionally, we drastically reduce the amount of linguistic processing applied during question processing and answer generation, while giving more relief to the post-retrieval phase and to the role of the UM."

        "Semantic similarity Within each of the retained documents, we seek the sentences which are semantically most relevant to the query by applying the metric in (Alfonseca et al., 2001): we represent each document sentence p and the query q as word sets P = {pw1, ... , pwm} and Q = {qw1, ... , qwn}.",
