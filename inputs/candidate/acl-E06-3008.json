        "Animacy is a an inherent property of the referents of nouns which has been claimed to figure as an influencing factor in a range of different grammatical phenomena in various languages and it is correlated with central linguistic concepts such as agentivity and discourse salience.",
        "Knowledge about the animacy of a noun is therefore relevant for several different kinds of NLP problems ranging from coreference resolution to parsing and generation.",
        "In recent years a range of linguistic studies have examined the influence of argument animacy in grammatical phenomena such as differential object marking (Aissen, 2003), the passive construction (Dingare, 2001), the dative alternation (Bresnan et al., 2005), etc.",
        "A variety of languages are sensitive to the dimension of animacy in the expression and interpretation of core syntactic arguments (Lee, 2002; Øvrelid, 2004).",
        "A key generalisation or tendency observed there is that prominent grammatical features tend to attract other prominent features;1 subjects, for instance, will tend to be animate and agentive, whereas objects prototypically are inanimate and themes/patients.",
        "Exceptions to this generalisation express a more marked structure, a property which has consequences, for instance, for the distributional properties of the structure in question.",
        "Even though knowledge about the animacy of a noun clearly has some interesting implications, little work has been done within the field of lexical acquisition in order to automatically acquire such knowledge.",
        "Or˘asan and Evans (2001) make use of hyponym-relations taken from the Word Net resource (Fellbaum, 1998) in order to classify animate referents.",
        "However, such a method is clearly restricted to languages for which large scale lexical resources, such as the Word Net, are available.",
        "Merlo and Stevenson (2001) present a method for verb classification which relies only on distributional statistics taken from corpora in order to train a decision tree classifier to distinguish between three groups of intransitive verbs.",
        "This paper presents experiments in automatic classification of the animacy of unseen Norwegian common nouns, inspired by the method for verb classification presented in Merlo and Stevenson (2001).",
        "The learning task is, for a given common noun, to classify it as either belonging to the class animate or inanimate.",
        "Based on correlations between animacy and other linguistic dimensions, a set of morphosyntactic features is presented and shown to differentiate common nouns along the binary dimension of animacy with promising results.",
        "The method relies on aggregated relative frequencies for common noun lemmas, hence might be expected to seriously suffer from data sparseness.",
        "Experiments attempting to empirically locate a frequency threshold for the classification method will therefore be presented.",
        "It turns out that a subset of the chosen morphosyntactic ap-proximators of animacy show a resilience to data sparseness which can be exploited in classification.",
        "By backing off to this smaller set of features, we show that we can maintain the same classification accuracy also for lower frequency nouns.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 identifies and motivates the set of chosen features for the classification task and describes how these features are approximated through feature extraction from an automatically annotated corpus of Norwegian.",
        "In section 3, a group of experiments testing the viability of the method and chosen features is presented.",
        "Section 4 goes on to investigate the effect of sparse data on the classification performance and present experiments which address possible remedies for the sparse data problem.",
        "Section 5 sums up the main findings of the previous sections and outlines a few suggestions for further research."

        "As mentioned above, animacy is highly correlated with a number of other linguistic concepts, such as transitivity, agentivity, topicality and discourse salience.",
        "The expectation is that marked configurations along these dimensions, e.g. animate objects or inanimate agents, are less frequent in the data.",
        "However, these are complex notions to translate into extractable features from a corpus.",
        "In the following we will present some morphological and syntactic features which, in different ways, approximate the multifaceted property of animacy: Transitive subject and (direct) object As mentioned earlier, a prototypical transitive relation involves an animate subject and an inanimate object.",
        "In fact, a corpus study of animacy distribution in simple transitive sentences in Norwegian revealed that approximately 70% of the subjects of these types of sentences were animate, whereas as many as 90% of the objects were inanimate (Øvrelid, 2004).",
        "Although this corpus study involved all types of nominal arguments, including pronouns and proper nouns, it still seems that the frequency with which a certain noun occurs as a subject or an object of a transitive verb might be an indicator of its animacy.",
        "Demoted agent in passive Agentivity is another related notion to that of animacy, animate beings are usually inherently sentient, capable of acting volitionally and causing an event to take place - all properties of the prototypical agent (Dowty, 1991).",
        "The passive construction, or rather the property of being expressed as the demoted agent in a passive construction, is a possible approximator of agentivity.",
        "It is well known that transitive constructions tend to passivize better (hence more frequently) if the demoted subject bears a prominent thematic role, preferably agent.",
        "Anaphoric reference by personal pronoun Anaphoric reference is a phenomenon where the animacy of a referent is clearly expressed.",
        "The Norwegian personal pronouns distinguish their antecedents along the animacy dimension - animate han/hun ‘he/she’ vs. inanimate den/det ‘it-MASC/NEUT’.",
        "Anaphoric reference by reflexive pronoun Reflexive pronouns represent another form of anaphoric reference, and, may, in contrast to the personal pronouns locate their antecedent locally, i.e. within the same clause.",
        "In the prototypical reflexive construction the subject and the reflexive object are coreferent and it describes an action directed at oneself.",
        "Although the reflexive pronoun in Norwegian does not distinguish for animacy, the agentive semantics of the construction might still favour an animate subject.",
        "Genitive s There is no extensive case system for common nouns in Norwegian and the only",
        "distinction that is explicitly marked on the noun is the genitive case by addition of -s. The genitive construction typically describes possession, a relation which often involves an animate possessor."

        "For this end, a 15 million word version of the Oslo Corpus, a corpus of Norwegian texts of approximately 18.5 million words, was employed.",
        "The corpus is mor-phosyntactically annotated and assigns an underspecified dependency-style analysis to each sentence.3 For each noun, relative frequencies for the different morphosyntactic features described above were computed from the corpus, i.e. the frequency of the feature relative to this noun is divided by the total frequency of the noun.",
        "For transitive subjects (SUBJ), we extracted the number of instances where the noun in question was unambiguously tagged as subject, followed by a finite verb and an unambiguously tagged object.",
        "The frequency of direct objects (OBJ) for a given noun was approximated to the number of instances where the noun in question was unambiguously tagged as object.",
        "We here assume that an unambiguously tagged object implies an unambiguously tagged subject.",
        "However, by not explicitly demanding that the object is preceded by a subject, we also capture objects with a “missing” subject, such as objects occurring in relative clauses and infinitival clauses.",
        "As mentioned earlier, another context where animate nouns might be predominant is in the by-phrase expressing the demoted agent of a passive verb (PASS).",
        "Norwegian has two ways of expressing the passive, a morphological passive (verb + s) and a periphrastic passive (bli + past participle).",
        "The counts for passive by-phrases allow for both types of passives to precede the by-phrase containing the noun in question.",
        "With regard to the property of anaphoric reference by personal pronouns, the extraction was bound to be a bit more difficult.",
        "The anaphoric personal pronoun is never in the same clause as the antecedent, and often not even in the same sentence.",
        "Coreference resolution is a complex problem, and certainly not one that we shall attempt to solve in the present context.",
        "However, we might attempt to come up with a metric that approximates the coreference relation in a manner adequate for our purposes, that is, which captures the different coreference relation for animate as opposed to inanimate nouns.",
        "To this end, we make use of the common assumption that a personal pronoun usually refers to a discourse salient element which is fairly recent in the discourse.",
        "Now, if a sentence only contains one core argument (i.e. an intransitive subject) and it is followed by a sentence initiated by a personal pronoun, it seems reasonable to assume that these are coreferent (Hale and Charniak, 1998).",
        "For each of the nouns then, we count the number of times it occurs as a subject with no subsequent object and an immediately following sentence initiated by (i) an animate personal pronoun (ANAAN) and (ii) an inanimate personal pronouns (ANAIN).",
        "The feature of reflexive coreference is easier to approximate, as this coreference takes place within the same clause.",
        "For each noun, the number of occurrences as a subject followed by a verb and the 3.person reflexive pronoun seg ‘him/her-/itself’ are counted and its relative frequency recorded.",
        "The genitive feature (GEN) simply contains relative frequencies of the occurrence of each noun with genitive case marking, i.e. the suffix -s."

        "The above experiments have shown that the classification of animacy for Norwegian common nouns is achievable using distributional data from a mor-phosyntactically annotated corpus.",
        "The chosen morphosyntactic features of animacy have proven to differentiate well between the two classes.",
        "As we have seen, the transitive subject, direct object and morphological genitive provide stable features for animacy even when the data is sparse(r).",
        "Four groups of experiments have been reported above which indicate that a reasonable remedy for sparse data in animacy classification consists of backing off to a smaller feature set in classification.",
        "These experiments indicate that a classifier trained on highly frequent nouns (experiment 1) backed off to the most frequent features (experiment 3) sufficiently capture generalizations which pertain to nouns with absolute frequencies down to approximately fifty occurrences and enables an unchanged performance approaching 90% accuracy.",
        "Even so, there are certainly still possibilities for improvement.",
        "As is well-known, singleton occurrences of nouns abound and the above classification method is based on data for lemmas, rather than individual instances or tokens.",
        "One possibility to be explored is token-based classification of animacy, possibly in combination with a lemma-based approach like the one outlined above.",
        "Such an approach might also include a finer subdivision of the nouns.",
        "We have chosen to classify along a binary dimension, however, it might be argued that this is an artificial dichotomy.",
        "(Za-enen et al., 2004) describe an encoding scheme for the manual encoding of animacy information in part of the English Switchboard corpus.",
        "They make a three-way distinction between human, other animates, and inanimates, where the ‘other animates’ category describes a rather heterogeneous group of entities: organisations, animals, intelligent machines and vehicles.",
        "However, what these seem to have in common is that they may all be construed linguistically as ani",
        "mate beings, even though they, in the real world, are not.",
        "Interestingly, the two misclassified inanimate nouns in experiment 1, were bil ‘car’ and fly ‘air plane’, both vehicles.",
        "A token-based approach to classification might better capture the context-dependent and dual nature of these types of nouns.",
        "Automatic acquisition of animacy in itself is not necessarily the primary goal.",
        "By testing the use of acquired animacy information in various NLP applications such as parsing, generation or coreference resolution, we might obtain an extrinsic evaluation measure for the usefulness of animacy information.",
        "Since very frequent nouns are usually well described in other lexical resources, it is important that a method for animacy classification is fairly robust to data sparseness.",
        "This paper suggests that a method based on seven morphosyntactic features, in combination with feature back-off, can contribute towards such a classification."
