        "Based on the observation that recognition errors may result in ungrammatical sentences, especially in dictation application where an acceptable level of accuracy of generated documents is indispensable, we propose to incorporate two kinds of linguistic features into error detection: lexical features of words, and syntactic features from a robust lexicalized parser.",

        "The proliferation of speech recognition (SR) systems is hampered by the ever-presence of recognition errors and the significant amount of effort involved in error correction.",
        "A user study (Sears et al., 2001) showed that users spent one-third of their time finding and locating errors and another one-third of the time correcting errors in a hand-free dictation task.",
        "Successfully detecting SR errors can speed up the entire process of error correction.",
        "Therefore, we focus on error detection in this study.",
        "A common approach to detecting SR errors is annotating confidence at the word level.",
        "The majority of confidence annotation methods are based on feature combination, which follows two steps: (i) extract useful features characteristics of the correctness of words either from the inner components of an SR system (SR-dependent features) or from the recognition output (SR-independent features); and (ii) develop a binary classifier to separate words into two groups: correct recognitions and errors.",
        "Various features extracted from different components of an SR system, such as the acoustic model, the language model, and the decoder, have been proven useful to detecting recognition errors (Chase, 1997; Pao et al., 1998; San-Segundo et al., 2001).",
        "Nonetheless, merely using these features is inadequate, because the information conveyed by these features has already been considered when SR systems generate the output.",
        "A common observation is that the combination of SR-dependent features can only marginally improve the performance achieved by using only the best single feature (Zhang and Rudnicky, 2001; Sarikaya et al., 2003).",
        "Hence information sources beyond the SR system are desired in error detection.",
        "High-level linguistic knowledge is a good candidate for additional information sources.",
        "It can be extracted from the SR output via natural language processing, which compensates for the lack of high",
        "level linguistic knowledge in a typical SR system.",
        "A user study (Brill et al., 1998) showed that humans can utilize linguistic knowledge at various levels to improve the SR output by selecting the best utterance hypotheses from N-best lists.",
        "Linguistic features from syntactic, semantic, and dialogue discourse analyses have proven their values in error detection in domain specific spoken dialogue systems, e.g. (Rayner et al., 1994; Carpenter et al., 2001; Sarikaya et al., 2003).",
        "However, few studies have investigated the merit of linguistic knowledge for error detection in dictation, a domain-independent application.",
        "Transformation-based learning (TBL) is a rule-based learning method.",
        "It has been used in error correction (Mangu and Padmanabhan, 2001) and error detection (Skantze and Edlund, 2004).",
        "The rules learned by TBL show good interpretability as well as good performance.",
        "Although statistical learning methods have been widely used in confidence annotation (Carpenter et al., 2001; Pao et al., 1998; Chase, 1997), their results are difficult to interpret.",
        "Therefore, we select TBL to derive error patterns from the SR output in this study.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we review the extant work on utilizing linguistic features in error detection.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce linguistic features used in this study.",
        "In Section 4, we describe transformation-based learning and define the transformations, followed with reporting the experimental results in Section 5.",
        "Finally, we summarize the findings of this study and suggest directions for further research in Section 6."
