        "The instant and automatic detection of new events is very useful in situations where novel information needs to be detected from a real-time stream of rapidly growing data.",
        "These real-life situations occur in scenarios like financial markets, news analyses, and intelligence gathering.",
        "In this paper we focus on creating a system to immediately identify stories reporting new events in a stream of news - a daunting task for a human analyst given the enormous volume of data coming in from various sources.",
        "The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) program, a DARPA funded initiative, seeks to develop technologies that search, organize and structure multilingual news-oriented textual materials from a variety of broadcast news media.",
        "One of the tasks in this program, New Event Detection (NED), involves constant monitoring of streams of news stories to identify the first story reporting topics of interest.",
        "A topic is defined as “a seminal event or activity, along with directly related events and activities” (Allan, 2002).",
        "An earthquake at a particular place is an example of a topic.",
        "The first story on this topic is the story that first carries the report on the earthquake’s occurrence.",
        "The other stories that make up the topic are those discussing the death toll, the rescue efforts, the reactions from different parts of the world, scientific discussions, the commercial impact and so on.",
        "A good NED system would be one that correctly identifies the article that reports the earthquake’s occurrence as the first story.",
        "NED is a hard problem.",
        "For example, to distinguish stories about earthquakes in two different places, a vector space model system would rely on a tf-idf weighting scheme that will bring out the difference by weighting the locations higher.",
        "More often then not, this doesn’t happen as the differences are buried in the mass of terms in common between stories describing earthquakes and their aftermath.",
        "In this paper we reduce the dependence on tf-idf weighting by showing the utility of creating",
        "three distinct representations of each story based on named entities.",
        "This allows us to view NED as a binary classification problem - i.e., each story has to be classified into one of two categories - old or new, based on features extracted using the three different representations.",
        "The paper starts by summarizing the previous work on NED in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we explain the rationale behind our intuition.",
        "Section 4 describes the experimental setup, data pre-processing, and our baseline NED system.",
        "We then briefly describe the evaluation methodology for NED in Section 5.",
        "Model creation and the results of applying these models to test data are detailed in Section 6.",
        "In the same section, we describe the effect on performance if the manually transcribed version of broadcast news is replaced with ASR output.",
        "Since its hard to recognize named entities from ASR data, performance expectedly deteriorates.",
        "We follow a novel approach to work around the problem resulting in statistically significant improvement in performance.",
        "The results are analyzed in Section 7.",

        "Previous approaches to NED have concentrated on developing similarity metrics or better document representations or both.",
        "A summer workshop on topic-based novelty detection held at Johns Hopkins University extensively studied the NED problem.",
        "Similarity metrics, effect of named entities, preprocessing of data, and language and Hidden Markov Models were explored (Allan et al., 1999).",
        "Combinations of NED systems were also discussed.",
        "In the context of this paper, selective re-weighting of named entities didn’t bring about expected improvement.",
        "Improving NED by better comparison of stories was the focus of following papers.",
        "In an approach to solve on-line NED, when a new document was encountered it was processed immediately to extract features and build up a query representation of the document’s content (Papka and Allan, 1998).",
        "The document’s initial threshold was determined by evaluating it with the query.",
        "If the document did not trigger any previous query by exceeding this particular threshold, it was marked as a new event.",
        "Unlike the previous paper, good improvements on TDT benchmarks were shown by extending a basic incremental TF-IDF model to include source-specific models, similarity score normalization techniques, and segmentation of documents (Brants et al., 2003).",
        "Other researchers have attempted to build better document models.",
        "A combination of evidence derived from two distinct representations of a document’s content was used to create a new representation for each story (Stokes and Carthy, 2001).",
        "While one of the representations was the usual free text vector, the other made use of lexical chains (created using WordNet) to obtain the most prevalent topics discussed in the document.",
        "The two vectors were combined in a linear fashion and a marginal increase in effectiveness was observed.",
        "NED approaches that rely on exploiting existing news tracking technology were proved to inevitably exhibit poor performance (Allan et al., 2000).",
        "Given tracking error rates, the lower and upper bounds on NED error rates were derived mathematically.",
        "These values were found to be good approximations of the true NED system error rates.",
        "Since tracking and filtering using full-text similarity comparison approaches were not likely to make the sort of improvements that are necessary for high-quality NED results, the paper concluded that an alternate approach to NED was required.",
        "This led to a series of research efforts that concentrated on building multi-stage NED algorithms and new ways to combine evidence from different sources.",
        "In the topic-conditioned novelty detection approach, documents were classified into broad topics and NED was performed within these categories (Yang et al., 2002).",
        "Additionally, named entities were re-weighted relative to the normal words for each topic, and a stop list was created for each topic.",
        "The experiments were done on a corpus different from the TDT corpus and, apparently didn’t scale well to the TDT setting.",
        "The DOREMI research group treated named entities like people and locations preferentially and developed a new similarity measure that utilized the semantics classes they came up with (Makkonen et al., 2002).",
        "They explored various definitions of the NED task and tested their system accordingly.",
        "More recently, they utilized a perceptron to learn a weight",
        "function on the similarities between different semantic classes to obtain a final confidence score for each story (Makkonen et al., 2004).",
        "The TDT group at UMass introduced multiple document models for each news story and modified similarity metrics by splitting up stories into only named entities and only terms other than named entities (Kumaran and Allan, 2004).",
        "They observed that certain categories of news were better tackled using only named entities, while using only topic terms for the others helped.",
        "In approaches similar to named entity tagging, part-of-speech tagging (Farahat et al., 2003) has also been successfully used to improve NED.",
        "Papers in the TDT2003 and TDT2004 workshops validated the hypothesis that ensemble single-feature classifiers based on majority voting exhibited better performance than single classifiers working with a number of features on the NED task (Braun and Kaneshiro, 2003; Braun and Kaneshiro, 2004).",
        "Examples of features they used are cosine similarity, text tiling output and temporally-weighted tf-idf.",
        "Probabilistic models for online clustering of documents, with a mechanism for handling creation of new clusters have been developed.",
        "Each cluster was assumed to correspond to a topic.",

        "The modification was based on additional evidence in the form of overlap of named entities and topic terms (terms in the document not identified as named entities) with the closest story reported by a baseline system.",
