        "The original motivation for using question series in the TREC 2004 question answering track was the desire to model aspects of dialogue processing in an evaluation task that included different question types.",
        "The structure introduced by the series also proved to have an important additional benefit: the series is at an appropriate level of granularity for aggregating scores for an effective evaluation.",
        "The series is small enough to be meaningful at the task level since it represents a single user interaction, yet it is large enough to avoid the highly skewed score distributions exhibited by single questions.",
        "An analysis of the reliability of the per-series evaluation shows the evaluation is stable for differences in scores seen in the track.",
        "The development of question answering technology in recent years has been driven by tasks defined in community-wide evaluations such as TREC, NTCIR, and CLEF.",
        "The TREC question answering (QA) track started in 1999, with the first several editions of the track focused on factoid questions.",
        "A factoid question is a fact-based, short answer question such as How many calories are there in a Big Mac?.",
        "The track has evolved by increasing the type and difficulty of questions that are included in the test set.",
        "The task in the TREC 2003 QA track was a combined task that contained list and definition questions in addition to factoid questions (Voorhees, 2004).",
        "A list question asks for different instances of a particular kind of information to be returned, such as List the names of chewing gums.",
        "Answering such questions requires a system to assemble an answer from information located in multiple documents.",
        "A definition question asks for interesting information about a particular person or thing such as Who is Vlad the Impaler?",
        "or What is a golden parachute?.",
        "Definition questions also require systems to locate information in multiple documents, but in this case the information of interest is much less crisply delineated.",
        "Like the NTCIR4 QACIAD challenge (Kato et al., 2004), the TREC 2004 QA track grouped questions into series, using the series as abstractions of information-seeking dialogues.",
        "In addition to modeling a real user task, the series are a step toward incorporating context-processing into QA evaluation since earlier questions in a series provide some context for the current question.",
        "In the case of the TREC series, each series contained factoid and list questions and had the target of a definition associated with it.",
        "Each question in a series asked for some information about the target.",
        "In addition, the final question in each series was an explicit “other” question, which was to be interpreted as “Tell me other interesting things about this target I don’t know enough to ask directly”.",
        "This last question was roughly equivalent to the definition questions in the TREC 2003 task.",
        "This paper examines the efficacy of series-based QA evaluation, and demonstrates that aggregating scores over individual series provides a more meaningful evaluation than averages of individual question",
        "scores.",
        "The next section describes the question series that formed the basis of the TREC 2004 evaluation.",
        "Since TREC uses different evaluation protocols for different question types, the following section describes the way in which individual question types were evaluated.",
        "Section 3 contrasts the scores obtained by aggregating individual question scores by question type or by series, and shows the use of series leads to a reliable evaluation at differences in scores that are observed in practice."

        "A question series as used in the TREC 2004 QA track consisted of several factoid questions, zero to two list questions, and exactly one Other question.",

        "The series a question belonged to, the order of the question in the series, and the type of each question (factoid, list, or Other) were all explicitly encoded in the XML format used to describe the test set.",
        "Example series (minus the XML tags) are shown in figure 1.",
        "A target was a person, an organization, or thing that was a plausible match for the scenario assumed for the task: that the questioner was an “average” adult reader of US newspapers who was looking for more information about a term encountered while reading the paper.",
        "The TREC 2004 test set contains 65 series.",
        "Of the 65 targets, 23 are PERSONs, 25 are ORGANI-ZATIONs, and 17 are THINGs.",
        "The series contain a total of 230 factoid questions, 56 list questions, and 65 (one per target) Other questions.",
        "Each series contains at least four questions, counting the Other question, with most series containing five or six questions.",
        "The maximum number of questions in a series is ten.",
        "Question series were also the fundamental structure used in the QACIAD challenge (Question Answering Challenge for Information Access Dialogue) of NTCIR4.",
        "However, there are some important differences between the QACIAD and TREC series.",
        "The QACIAD series model a more natural flow of questions in an information-seeking dialogue.",
        "Given other evaluation requirements (most questions need to have an answer in the source documents, answers to earlier questions should not be given in later questions, etc.",
        "), the series in the TREC test set are heavily edited versions of the series collected from the original information seekers.",
        "The resulting edited series appear as a stilted conversational style when viewed from the perspective of true dialogue, and the series do not reflect the full range of information requested in the original series.",
        "(For example, TREC requires list question answers to be concrete entities such as cities or book titles while the information seekers often asked for fuzzier information such as lists of descriptive qualities.)",
        "The QACIAD challenge contained two types of series, gathering series and browsing series.",
        "In a gathering series, all of the questions are related to a single target (that was not explicitly given in QACIAD), while questions in a browsing series can refer to unrelated targets.",
        "The TREC series are all gathering type series with the target explicitly given.",
        "Finally, the QACIAD series consist of list questions only, since factoid questions are treated as list questions with a single answer.",
        "Systems participating in the TREC evaluation were required to process series independently from one another, and were required to process an individual series in question order.",
        "That is, systems were allowed to use questions and answers from earlier questions in a series to answer later questions in that same series, but could not “look ahead” and use later questions to help answer earlier questions.",
        "The series was the unit used to structure the test set, but there was no requirement for systems to process a series as a unit.",
        "Some systems appended the target to each of the questions in its series and then processed all resulting question strings independently as in earlier TREC evaluations.",
        "Per-series evaluation is still valid since the task to be evaluated is defined in terms of the series and is independent of how systems choose to process the questions.",

        "In the first step, all of the answer strings from all of the systems’ responses are presented to the assessor in a single list.",
