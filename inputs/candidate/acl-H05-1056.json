        "Named entity recognition (NER), the identification of entity names in free text, is a well-studied problem.",
        "In most previous work, NER has been applied to news articles (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1999; McCal-lum and Li, 2003)), scientific articles (e.g., (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004)), or web pages (e.g., (Freitag, 1998)).",
        "These genres of text share two important properties: documents are written for a fairly broad audience, and writers take care in preparing documents.",
        "Important genres that do not share these properties include instant messaging logs, newsgroup postings and email messages.",
        "We refer to these genres as “informal” text.",
        "Informal text is harder to process automatically.",
        "Informal documents do not obey strict grammatical conventions.",
        "They contain grammatical and spelling errors.",
        "Further, since the audience is more restricted, informal documents often use group and task-specific abbreviations and are not self-contained.",
        "Because of these differences, existing NER methods may require modifications to perform well on informal text.",
        "In this paper, we investigate NER for informal text with an experimental study of the problem of recognizing personal names in email – a task that is both useful and non-trivial.",
        "An application of interest is corpus anonymization.",
        "Automatic or semi-automatic email anonymization should allow using large amounts of informal text for research purposes, for example, of medical files.",
        "Person-name extraction and other NER tasks are helpful for automatic processing of informal text for a large variety of applications (Culotta et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2005).",
        "We first present four corpora of email text, annotated with personal names, each roughly comparable in size to the MUC-6 corpus1.",
        "We experimentally evaluate the performance of conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), a state-of-the art machine-learning based NER methods on these corpora.",
        "We then turn to examine the special attributes of email text (vs. newswire) and suggest venues for improving extraction performance.",
        "One important observation is that email messages often include some structured, easy-to-recognize names, such as names within a header, names appearing in automatically-generated phrases, as well as names in signature files or sign-offs.",
        "We therefore suggest a set of specialized structural features for email; these features are shown to significantly improve performance on our corpora.",
        "We also present and evaluate a novel method for exploiting repetition of names in a test corpus.",
        "Techniques for exploiting name repetition within documents have been recently applied to newswire text",
        "(e.g., (Humphreys et al., 1998)), scientific abstracts (e.g., (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004)) and seminar announcements (Sutton and Mccallum, 2004); however, these techniques rely on either NP analysis or capitalization information to pre-identify candidate coreferent name mentions, features which are not reliable in email.",
        "Furthermore, we argue that name repetition in email should be inferred by examining multiple documents in a corpus, which is not common practice.",
        "We therefore present an alternative efficient scheme for increasing recall in email, using the whole corpus.",

        "We showed that repetitions within a single document are more common in newswire text, and that repetitions that span multiple documents are more common in email corpora.",
        "Additional analysis confirms that the potential gains in recall from exploiting multiple-document repetition is much higher than the potential gains from exploiting single-document repetition.",
        "Based on this insight, we introduced a simple and effective method for exploiting multiple-document repetition to improve an extractor.",
        "One drawback of the recall-enhancing approach is that it requires the entire test set to be available: however, our test sets are of only moderate size (83 to 264 documents), and it is likely that a similar-size sample of unlabeled data would be available in many practical applications.",
        "The approach substantially improves recall and often improves F1 performance; furthermore, it can be easily used with any NER method.",
        "Taken together, extraction performance is substantially improved by this approach.",
        "The improvements seem to be strongest for email corpora collected from closely interacting groups.",
        "On the Mgmt-Teams dataset, which was designed to reduce the value of memorizing specific names appearing in the training set, F 1 performance is improved from 68.1% for the out-of-the-box system (or 82.0% for the dictionary-augmented system) to 91.3%.",
        "For the less difficult Mgmt-Game dataset, F 1 performance is improved from 79.2% for an out-of-the-box CRF-based NER system (or 90.7% for a CRF-based system that uses several large dictionaries) to 95.4%.",
        "As future work, experiments should be expanded to include additional entity types and other types of informal text, such as blogs and forum postings."
