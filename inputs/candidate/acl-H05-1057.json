        "In other words, names of people, places and organizations are key entities of a news story.",
        "For many tasks, like in topic detection and tracking (TDT), the entities form an important feature for distinguishing topics from one another.",
        "For example, it is the people that distinguish stories on the 2004 election from stories on the 2000 U.S election.",
        "Names, especially rare and foreign ones are a problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as they are often out of vocabulary (OOV) i.e., they do not exist in the lexicon of the ASR system.",

        "We get statistically significant improvements in results for ad-hoc retrieval when the query is just the name of a person.",

        "That names can be spelled differently is a problem that has been addressed by the database community in great detail.",
        "They found that the problem was rising in significance with the increasing interest in reconciling different databases.",
        "Differences in names due to spelling errors, spelling variants and transliteration errors have been dealt with by different kinds of approximate string matching techniques like Soundex, Phonix, and String Edit distance (James C. French, 1997; Zobel and Dart, 1996).",
        "The nature of the problem is identical when the domain consists of databases of documents but in order to apply techniques that were developed for names by the database community one would have to first detect names in the corpus, and then normalize them to some canonical form.",
        "This is the approach taken by Raghavan and Allan (Raghavan and Allan, 2004) who showed that normalizing names using Soundex codes resulted in a 10% improvement on the TDT3 Story Link Detection Task.",
        "They tested their method on newswire stories only.",
        "Their difficulty in applying Soundex to the ASR documents was that detecting names in ASR is too error prone for their methods to be useful (Miller et al., 2000).",
        "Spoken document retrieval was a track at the TREC-6,7 and 8 (Voorhees and Harman, 1997; Voorhees and Harman, 1998; Voorhees and Harman, 1999) conferences.",
        "At the TREC-8 SDR track the conclusion was that ASR is not really an issue for ad hoc retrieval.",
        "However, the queries in those tracks were not centered on any entity.",
        "The TREC-8 proceedings also acknowledge that mean average precision dropped as named entity word error rate (NEWER) increased.",
        "A typical speech recognizer has a lexicon of about 60K and for this size of a lexicon, about 10% of the person names are out of vocabulary (OOV).",
        "The problem of alternate spellings of names has also been explored by the cross lingual information retrieval community (Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003).",
        "The problem with names in machine translated text is quite similar to the problem with names in ASR text, except that the errors caused by a speech recognizer are often phonetic confusions, which is not necessarily the case for machine translation errors.",
        "Spelling errors of names in machine translated text are typically consistent.",
        "A given word in the source language always translates to the same word in the target language for a given machine translation system.",
        "As seen earlier, ASR systems do not exhibit such consistency.",
        "Another problem that resembles the one we are addressing in this paper is that of spelling correction.",
        "Spelling correction has been tackled in several different ways (Durham et al., 1983), in some cases with the use of contextual cues (Golding and Roth, 1999) and in some cases it has been modeled as a “noisy channel problem” (Kernighan et al., 1990).",
        "The latter approach is similar to ours because we also approach the problem of spelling variations due to speech recognizer errors as analogous to the errors caused by a noisy channel.",
        "However, spelling correction methods must rectify human errors (typographic errors and common confusions) whereas speech recognizer errors are different.",
        "Additionally, the argument that Jon Smith and John Smythe may genuinely be different people and should not be considered to be the same entity is more of a cross-document co-reference problem.",
        "The problem we are attempting to solve in this paper is one of grouping names that “sound like” each other together, without considering the problem of cross document co-reference.",
        "For example, the name Lewinsky has 199 occurrences in the TDT3 corpus, and also appears as Lewinski (1324 times), and Lewenskey (171 times).",
        "Most of these occurrences refer to Monica Lewinsky.",
        "The aim is to group all these variants together, without taking into consideration which ones refer to the same person.",
        "We then measure the effectiveness of our methods on various retrieval tasks.",
        "Perhaps the most similar work from the point of view of the task is work in word spotting in audio output (Amir et al., 2001).",
        "The queries are single words and the task is to locate their mention in audio.",
        "The starting point in that work is however, a phonetic transcript of the audio signal and the emphasis is not on locating names.",
        "Our starting point is automatic speech recognizer output, and we aim to locate names in particular."

        "Names are grouped such that if P(CAT|kate) is high (above some threshold) then there is a link between CAT and kate.",

        "We would expect this model to learn a high probability for similar sounding alphabets, e.g., a high probability for P(C|k).",
        "Depending on where the training set of pairs of names for this method comes from, we get two possible systems.",
        "These are called the Generative Unsupervised method and Generative Supervised method respectively.",
        "Note that the Generative Unsupervised method is not completely unsupervised; we still need the parallel text of ASR and manual transcripts, but we don’t need a human to do the added grouping of names into equivalence classes.",
        "A character level translation model helps us generalize better to unseen words.",
        "We also grouped together names that differ by a string edit distance of one, giving a fifth system.",
        "In particular, we use the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966), that is the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions needed to convert one string to the other.",
        "Many methods employed by the database community build on string edit distance.",
        "The method works well but has some disadvantages.",
        "Consider a user who types in a query containing a name such that the spelling, as typed by the user, never occurs in the corpus.",
        "To employ string edit distance, one would have to compare the query name against all the words in the vocabulary of the corpus to find the most similar strings.",
        "With a generative model, only the query needs to be expanded using the translation model, thereby speeding up the search process.",

        "For TDT3 we got statistically significant improvements (an improvement in mean average precision from 0.715 to 0.757) over the baseline using string edit distance.",
        "On the remaining corpora we got little or no improvement by our methods.",
        "We proceed to explain why this is the case for each of the corpora.",
        "The TREC-7 corpus has only 5 queries with a mention of a name resulting in hardly any gains overall.",
        "Similar was the case for TREC-6.",
        "Again in the case of the TDT2 corpus, since we used entire documents as stories, there are enough words in the query that a few recognition errors can be tolerated and therefore traditional retrieval is good for the task.",
        "There is evidence from previous TREC tracks (Voorhees and Harman, 1999) that shorter queries result in a decrease in retrieval performance and hence we see some improvements for TDT3.",
        "Besides, the TDT3 queries were rich in names.",
        "We wanted to check how our methods performed on outputs of different ASR systems.",
        "Spoken document retrieval on the TREC-7 data with the output of Dragon systems, which has a word error rate of 29.5%, results in an improvement of 6% using the Simple Aligned method.",
        "The NIST-B2 system with a higher WER (46.6%) has an improvement in Mean Average Precision of 6.5%.",
        "Similarly with the CUHTK (WER 35.6%) and NIST-B 1 (WER 33.8%) and Sheffield (WER 24.6 %) systems we obtained improvements of 1.6%, 0.39% and 0.05% respectively using the Simple Aligned method.",
        "Thus, with increasing WER, the named entity word error rate increases significantly, and therefore the benefits of our method are more apparent in such situations."

        "We showed (both intrinsically and extrinsically) that string edit distance is an effective technique for locating name variants.",
        "We also developed a set of generative models and showed that they are almost",
        "as effective at name finding and document retrieval, but are probably more efficient than string edit distance.",
        "The generative models need to be trained on parallel text and therefore require human effort for training the models.",
        "The advantage of one method over the other is dependent on the size of the corpus and the availability of resources.",
        "The problem has not been of significance in previous TREC tasks or in TDT, because we have always escaped the problem of misspelled names by virtue of the nature of those tasks.",
        "In the TREC tasks very few queries are centered on an entity.",
        "In all the TDT tasks, one is usually required to compare entire stories with each other.",
        "A story is long enough that there are enough words that are in the vocabulary (just like a very long query) or that are correctly recognized, that the ASR errors do not really matter.",
        "Therefore, the TDT tasks also do not suffer as a result of these ASR errors.",
        "We can improve and apply our methods to other domains like Switchboard data (Godfrey et al., 1992).",
        "Our methods also generalize well across languages since there are no language specific techniques employed."
