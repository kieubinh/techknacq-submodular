        "Recent work has motivated the need for systems that support “Information Synthesis” tasks, in which a user seeks a global understanding of a topic or story (Amigo et al., 2004).",
        "In contrast to the classical question answering setting (e.g. TREC-style Q&A (Voorhees and Tice, 2000)), in which the user presents a single question and the system returns a corresponding answer (or a set of likely answers), in this case the user has a more complex information need.",
        "Similarly, when reading about a complex news story, such as an emergency situation, users might seek answers to a set of questions in order to understand it better.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows the interface to our Web-based news summarization system, which a user has queried for information about Hurricane Isabel.",
        "Understanding such stories is challenging for a number of reasons.",
        "In particular, complex stories contain many sub-events (e.g. the devastation of the hurricane, the relief effort, etc.)",
        "In addition, while some facts surrounding the situation do not change (such as “Which area did the hurricane first hit?”), others may change with time (“How many people have been left homeless?”).",
        "Therefore, we are working towards developing a system for question answering from clusters of complex stories published over time.",
        "As can be seen at the bottom of Figure 1, we plan to add a component to our current system that allows users to ask questions as they read a story.",
        "They may then choose to receive either a precise answer or a question-focused summary.",
        "Currently, we address the question-focused sentence retrieval task.",
        "While passage retrieval (PR) is clearly not a new problem (e.g. (Robertson et al., 1992; Salton et al., 1993)), it remains important and yet often overlooked.",
        "As noted by (Gaizauskas et al., 2004), while PR is the crucial first step for question answering, Q&A research has typically not empha",
        "sized it.",
        "The specific problem we consider differs from the classic task of PR for a Q&A system in interesting ways, due to the time-sensitive nature of the stories in our corpus.",
        "For example, one challenge is that the answer to a user’s question may be updated and reworded over time by journalists in order to keep a running story fresh, or because the facts themselves change.",
        "Therefore, there is often more than one correct answer to a question.",
        "We aim to develop a method for sentence retrieval that goes beyond finding sentences that are similar to a single query.",
        "To this end, we propose to use a stochastic, graph-based method.",
        "Recently, graph-based methods have proved useful for a number of NLP and IR tasks such as document re-ranking in ad hoc IR (Kurland and Lee, 2005) and analyzing sentiments in text (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "In (Erkan and Radev, 2004), we introduced the LexRank method and successfully applied it to generic, multi-document summarization.",
        "Presently, we introduce topic-sensitive LexRank in creating a sentence retrieval system.",
        "We evaluate its performance against a competitive baseline, which considers the similarity between each sentence and the question (using IDF-weighed word overlap).",

        "In addition, the input to our system is a set of documents relevant to the topic of the query that the user has already identified (e.g. via a search engine).",
        "Our system does not rank the input documents, nor is it restricted in terms of the number of sentences that may be selected from the same document.",
        "The output of our system, a ranked list of sentences relevant to the user’s question, can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specific answers from the extracted sentences.",

        "There are edges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceeds a given threshold.",
        "The degree of a given node is an indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences.",
