        "There are several sources of error in written language.",
        "Typing errors can be divided into two groups (Kucich, 1992): typographic errors and cognitive errors.",
        "Typographic errors are the result of mistyped keys and can be described in terms of keyboard key proximity.",
        "Cognitive errors on the other hand, are caused by a misunderstanding of the correct spelling of a word.",
        "They include phonetic errors, in which similar sounding letter sequences are substituted for the correct sequence; and homonym errors, in which a word is substituted for another word with the same pronunciation but a different meaning.",
        "Spelling errors can also be grouped into errors that result in another valid word, such as homonym errors, versus those errors that result in a non-word.",
        "Generally non-word errors are easier to detect and correct.",
        "In addition to its traditional use in word processing, spelling correction also has applications in optical character recognition and hand",
        "writing recognition.",
        "Spelling errors in this context are caused by inaccurate character recognition.",
        "Spelling correction is a well developed research problem in the field of computational linguistics.",
        "The first dictionary based approach to spelling correction (Damerau, 1964) considers all words that can not be found in a dictionary as misspellings.",
        "The correct word is found by making a single edit operation (insertion, deletion, or substitution) on the misspelled word and rechecking the dictionary for the inclusion of the altered version.",
        "This method works well for correcting most typos, but often misspelled words are off by more than one character.",
        "A method of quantifying string-to-string distance is introduced in (Wagner and Fischer, 1974), allowing the consideration of multiple edit operations when determining candidate corrections.",
        "Each edit operation is assigned a fixed cost.",
        "Edit operations, though, can be more accurately modelled by considering every possible insertion, deletion, and substitution operation individually instead of having a fixed cost for each operation.",
        "For example, the application of probabilistic models to spelling correction is explored in (Kernighan, Church, and Gale, 1990), in which a confusion matrix describes the probability of each letter being substituted for another.",
        "The Bayesian noisy channel model is used to determine the the error probabilities, with the simplifying assumption that each word has at most one spelling error.",
        "In (Ristad and Yianilos, 1997), a probabilistic model of edit distance is learned from pairs of misspelled words and their corrections.",
        "This extends Kernighan’s approach by allowing multiple edit operations rather than assuming a single edit.",
        "The probability of edit operations is learned from a corpus of pairs of misspelled words and corrections.",
        "Search query correction is an interesting branch of spelling correction.",
        "Due to the wide variety of search queries, dictionary based spelling correction is not adequate for correcting search terms.",
        "The concept of using query logs to aid in spelling correction is explored in (Brill and Cucerzan, 2004).",
        "It is noted that using traditional Levenshtein distance as an error model can lead to inappropriate corrections, so a weighted distance measure is used instead.",
        "This paper focuses on deriving a language model and probabilistic error model directly from search query logs without requiring a corpus of misspelled words paired with their corrections.",
        "The task of search query spelling correction is analyzed, and an implementation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn an error model is described, with reference to similar approaches.",
        "In Section 2, the make-up of search queries is analyzed in the context of spelling correction.",
        "Section 3 details the noisy channel model spelling correction framework and describes how the EM algorithm is applied to learn an error model.",
        "The learned error model is explored in Section 4.",
        "The derived model is tested in Section 5 by comparing its performance in the single word spelling correction task to popular spell checking applications.",

        "Prior to running the EM algorithm, the edit distance table is seeded with initial values.",
        "The initialization stage assigns high probability (low edit distance) to characters being typed correctly, and a lower probability for character substitutions.",
