        "Previous works aimed at identifying – through clusters of words – concepts, subtopics or themes that are prominent within a corpus of texts (e.g., Pereira et al., 1993; Li, 2002; Lin and Pantel, 2002).",
        "The current work deals with extending this line of research to identify corresponding themes across a corpus pre-divided to several sub-corpora, which are focused on different, yet related, topics.",
        "This research task has been defined quite recently (Dagan et al., 2002), and has not been explored extensively yet.",
        "One could think, however, of many potential applications for drawing correspondences across textual resources: comparison of related firms or products, identifying equivalen-cies in news published in different countries, and so on.",
        "The experimental part of our work deals with revealing correspondences between different religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism.",

        "Term clustering methods in general, and in this work in particular, rely on word co-occurrence statistics: terms sharing similar words co-occurrence statistics are clustered together.",
        "Different topics, however, are characterized by distinctive terminology and typical word co-locations.",
        "Therefore, given a pre-divided corpus, similar co-occurrence patterns would typically be extracted from the same topical sub-corpus.",
        "When the terminology and typical phrases employed by each topic differ greatly (even if the top",
        "ics are essentially related, e.g. different religions), the tendency to form topic-specific clusters intensifies regardless of factors that otherwise could have impact this tendency, such as the co-occurrence window size.",
        "Consequently, corresponding key terms of different topics may not be assigned by a standard method to the same cluster, in contrast to our goal.",
        "The method described in this paper aims precisely at this problem: it is designed to neutralize salient co-occurrence patterns within each topical sub-corpus and to promote less salient patterns that are shared across the sub-corpora.",
        "In an earlier line of research we have formulated the above problem and addressed it within a probabilistic vector-based setting, presenting two related heuristic algorithms (Dagan et al., 2002; Marx et al., 2004).",
