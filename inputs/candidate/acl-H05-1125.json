        "Natural spoken language is often regarded as the obvious choice for a human-computer interface.",
        "However, despite significant research efforts in automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Huang et al., 2001), existing ASR systems are still not sufficiently robust to a wide variety of speaking conditions, noise, accented speakers, etc.",
        "ASR-based interfaces are therefore often abandoned by users after a short initial trial period.",
        "In addition, natural speech is optimal for communication between humans but suboptimal for manipulating computers, windows-icons-mouse-pointer (WIMP) interfaces, or other electromechanical devices (such as a prosthetic robotic arm).",

        "For example, in order to move a cursor from the bottom-left to the upper-right of a screen, the user might have to repeatedly utter “up” and “right” or “stop” and “go” after setting an initial trajectory and rate, which is quite inefficient.",

        "The second parameter, pitch, is also extracted but is currently not mapped to any control dimension in the VJ-WIMP application but will be in the future.",
        "The third parameter is vowel quality.",
        "Unlike consonants, which are characterized by a greater degree of constriction in the vocal tract, vowels have much inherent signal energy and are therefore well-suited to environments where both high accuracy and noise-robustness are crucial.",
        "Vowels can be characterized using a 2-D space parameterized by F 1 and F2, the first and second vocal-tract formants (resonant frequencies).",
        "We initially experimented with directly extracting F1/F2 and using them for directly specifying 2-D continuous control.",
        "While we have not ruled out the use of F1/F2 in the future, we have so far found that even the best F1/F2 detection algorithms available are not yet accurate enough for precise real-time specification of movement.",

        "Many state-of-the-art pitch trackers are based on dynamic programming (DP).",
        "This, however, often requires the meticulous design of local DP cost functions.",
        "The forms of these cost functions are usually empirically determined and/or their parameters are tuned by algorithms such as gradient descent (D.Talkin, 1995).",
        "Since different languages and applications may follow very different pitch transition patterns, the cost functions optimized for certain languages and applications may not be the most appropriate for others.",
        "Our VJ system utilizes a graphical model mechanism to automatically optimize the parameters of these cost functions, and has been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance (X.Li et al., 2004; J.Malkin et al., 2005).",
        "For frame-by-frame vowel classification, our design constraints are the need for extremely low latency and low computational cost.",
        "Probability estimates for vowel classes thus need to be obtained as soon as possible after the vowel has been uttered or after any small change in voice quality has occurred.",
        "It is well known that models of vowel classification that incorporate temporal dynamics such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be quite accurate.",
        "However, the frame-by-frame latency requirements of VJ make HMMs unsuitable for vowel classification since HMMs estimate the likelihood of a model based on the entire utterance.",
        "An alternative is to utilize causal “HMM-filtering”, which computes likelihoods at every frame based on all frames seen so far.",
        "We have empirically found, however, that slightly non-causal and quite localized estimates of the vowel category probability is sufficient to achieve user satisfaction.",
        "Specifically, we obtain probability estimates of the form P(V [Xt–T, • • • , Xt+T), where V is a vowel class, and Xt–T, ... , Xt+T are feature frames within a length 27- + 1 window of features centered at time t. After several empirical trials, we decided on neural networks for vowel classification because of the availability of efficient discriminative training algorithms and their computational simplicity.",
        "Specifically we use a simple 2-layer multilayer perceptron (Bishop, 1995) whose input layer consists of 26 * 7 = 182 nodes, where 26 is the dimension of Xt, the MFCC feature vector, and 27- + 1 = 7 is the",
        "number of consecutive frames, and that has 50 hidden nodes (the numbers 7 and 50 were determined empirically).",
        "The output layer has 4 output nodes representing 4 vowel probabilities.",
        "During training, the network is optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the output and the true label distribution, thus achieving the aforementioned probabilistic interpretation.",
        "The VJ engine needs not only to detect that the user is specifying a vowel (for continuous control) but also a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern (for discrete control) quickly and with a low probability of confusion (a VJ system also uses C and CV patterns for discrete commands).",
        "Requiring an initial consonant will phonetically distinguish these sounds from the pure vowel segments used for continuous control – the VJ system constantly monitors for changes that indicate the beginning of one of the discrete control commands.",
        "The vowel within the CV and CVC patterns, moreover, can help prevent background noise from being misclassified as a discrete sound.",
        "Lastly, each such pattern currently requires an ending silence, so that the next command (a new discrete sound or continuous control vowel) can be accurately initiated.",
        "In all cases, a simple threshold-based rejection mechanism is used to reduce false positives.",
        "To recognize the discrete control signals, HMMs are employed since, as in standard speech recognition, time warping is necessary to normalize for different signal durations corresponding to the same class.",
        "Specifically, we embed phone HMMs into “word” (C, CV, or CVC) HMMs.",
        "In this way, it is possible to train phone models using a training set that covers all possible phones, and then construct an application-specific discrete command vocabulary without retraining by recombining existing phone HMMs into new word HMMs.",

To determine movement speed, we first calculate a scalar",

        "Olwal & Feiner’s system moves the mouse only after recognizing entire words.",
        "de Mauro’s “voice mouse” http://www.dii.unis i. it/ –maggini/research/voicemouse.html focuses on continuous cursor movements similar to the VJ scenario; however, the voice mouse only starts moving after the vocalization has been completed leading to long latencies, and it is not easily portable to other applications.",
        "Lastly, the commercial dictation program Dragon by ScanSoft includes MouseGridTM(Dra, 2004) which allows discrete vocal commands to recursively 9-partition the screen, thus achieving log-command access to a particular screen point.",
        "A VJ system, by contrast, uses continuous aspects of the voice, has change latency (about 60ms) not much greater than reaction time, and allows the user to make instantaneous directional change using one’s voice (e.g., a user can draw a ”U” shape in one breath)."

        "We plan next to further improve our system by evaluating a number of novel pattern classification techniques to increase accuracy and user-independence, and to introduce additional vocal characteristics (possibilities include vibrato, degree of nasality, rate of change of any of the above as an independent parameter) to increase the available simultaneous degrees of freedom controllable via the voice.",
        "Moreover, we plan to develop algorithms to decouple unintended user correlations of these parameters, and to further advance both our adaptation and acceleration algorithms."
