        "The problem of developing a dialog manager can be expressed as the task of building a specific dialog policy for the dialog system to follow as it interacts with the user.",
        "A dialog policy can be thought of as an enumeration of all of the states a dialog system can be in, and the corresponding action to take from each of those states.",
        "Thus a policy completely specifies the behavior of a dialog manager.",
        "Most conventional approaches to accomplishing this task seek to directly model human interactions in some manner.",
        "These techniques include hand-crafting a policy, using a Wizard-of-Oz approach in an iterative manner and inducing a policy from a human-human dialog corpus.",
        "All three approaches have shortcomings that make them less than ideal for developing dialog systems.",
        "The approach of hand-crafting of a dialog policy is problematic as it is difficult to predict how a user with interact with it, making it difficult to craft an optimal policy.",
        "To get around this, an iterative approach can be used, with a Wizard taking the place of the system.",
        "However, it is still difficult to train a wizard, and it is difficult to explore many different strategies in order to find the optimal one.",
        "Human-human dialog can be used for policy generation, as this should represent optimal behavior to accomplish a task.",
        "However, computers are not capable of behaving exactly as a human.",
        "In addition, humans might not interact with a computer as they would another person.",
        "Recently a number of researchers have proposed using reinforcement learning to alleviating the problems encountered with more conventional methods of developing dialog policies.",
        "With the development of a good policy evaluation function, reinforcement learning can effectively and quickly explore a large policy space.",
        "There is the additional benefit that it will learn a policy that is optimal for the capabilities of the system.",
        "The main drawback of reinforcement learning approaches is that they require some form of conversational partner to train the system against.",
        "Conventionally, these partners have taken the form of a human (Walker, 2000; Singh et al., 2002) or a simulated user (Levin et al., 2000; Scheffler and Young, 2002; Georgila et al., 2005).",
        "These two types of conversational partners limit the complexity and diversity of policies that can be generated by reinforcement learning.",
        "These two approaches to training partners limit the whole system to the abilities of the partners themselves.",
        "For a human partner we",
        "run into the significant time and effort problems that were present in Wizard-of-Oz and handcrafting policy development.",
        "With a simulated user the system is limited by the complexity and flexibility of the simulated user, which itself can require a large degree of handcrafting by its creator.",
        "In this paper, we propose a solution to the conversational partner problem of generating a dialog policy with reinforcement learning.",
        "We have taken a complex collaborative task and used reinforcement learning, applied to both participants, to develop a dialog policy for the task.",
        "By training both agents simultaneously we are able to avoid the uncertainties of creating a user to train against, as well as the time and data limitations of training directly against humans.",
        "Our training approach allows us to avoid these conventional drawbacks even while applying reinforcement learning to complex tasks.",

        "A number of researchers have explored using reinforcement learning to create a policy for a dialog system.",
        "Walker (2000) trained a dialog system, ELVIS, to learn a dialog strategy for supporting spoken language access to a user’s email.",
        "The main function of ELVIS is to provide verbal summaries of email folders.",
        "This summary could consist of simple statements about the number of messages or a more detailed description of current emails.",
        "Reinforcement learning is used to determine the best settings for a variety of properties of the system.",
        "For example, the system must learn to choose between email reading styles of reading back the full email first, reading a summary of the email first, or prompting the user with the two choices of reading styles.",
        "The system also learns whether it is better to take a mixed initiative or a system initiative strategy when interacting with the user.",
        "To enable the learning process, ELVIS utilized human users as its conversational partner.",
        "Users performed a set of tasks with ELVIS, with each run using different state-property values, which were randomly chosen for that dialog.",
        "In order to support humans as a training partner Walker restricted the policy space so that it would only contain policies that were capable of accomplishing the available system tasks.",
        "Thus, during training the users would not be faced with a system that simply could not perform the tasks asked of it.",
        "ELVIS was trained with a Q-learning approach that sought to determine the expected utility at each state, where utility was a subjective function involving such variables as task completion and user satisfaction.",
        "The state variables utilized in the training process were (a) whether the user’s name is known, (b) what the initiative style is, (c) the task progress, and (d) what the user’s current goal is.",
        "Given these state variables, ELVIS was able to learn the best style to adopt in responding to the user’s requests at various points in the dialog.",
        "One major shortcoming of the conversational partner used with ELVIS is its reliance upon human interaction for training.",
        "This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the learning problem was one of fitting together preexisting policy components, but would be severely limiting if the goal was to learn a complete dialog policy.",
        "The amount of data necessary for learning a complete policy makes direct human interaction in the learning process unrealistic.",
        "Levin et al.",
        "(2000) tackles a slightly different reinforcement-learning task.",
        "She is learning a policy to use in a dialog system built from a small set of atomic actions.",
        "This system is trained to provide a verbal interface to an airline flight database.",
        "This system is able to provide users with a way to find flights that meet a dynamic set of criteria.",
        "The dialog agent’s state consists of information regarding the departure city, destination city, flight date, etc.",
        "Levin takes a useful approach in reducing the size of true state space by simply tracking when a particular state variable has a value rather than including the specific value in the state.",
        "For instance during a dialog when the system determines that the departure city is New York it does not distinguish this from when it has determined that the departure city is Chicago.",
        "To converse with the dialog agent during reinforcement learning, Levin uses a “simulated user.” The simulated user is created from a corpus of human dialogs with a prior airline system.",
        "In de",
        "veloping this user Levin makes the simplifying assumption that a user’s response is based solely on the previous prompt.",
        "Then the specific probabilities for each user response are determined by examining the corpus for exchanges that match the possible prompts for the new dialog agent as well as hand crafting some of the probabilities.",
        "During the actual learning the agent used Monte Carlo training with exploring starts in order to fully explore the state space.",
        "The “simulated user” method of supplying the conversational partner seems difficult and not particularly applicable to tasks where a dialog corpus does not already exist, but Kearns and Singh (1998) indicates that the accuracy of the transition probabilities for the probabilistic user is not critical for the dialog agent to learn an optimal strategy.",
        "While this experiment does allow for the dialog agent to learn a complex strategy, the notion of learning against a simulated user limits the space of policies that will be considered during training.",
        "Training against a conversational partner that is a model of a human automatically prejudices the system towards policies that we would be inclined towards building by hand and precludes the sincere exploration of all possible policies."

        "For our experiment we use the task presented in Yang and Heeman (2004), which is a modification of the DesignWorld task of Walker (1995).",
        "The task requires 2 conversants to agree on 5 pieces of furniture to place in a room.",
        "Both conversants know all of the furniture items that can be chosen, which differ by color, type and point value.",
        "Each conversant also has private preferences about which furniture items it wants in the room; such as ‘if there is a red couch in the room, I also want a lamp in the room’.",
        "Each preference has a score.",
        "As this is a collaborative task, the conversants have the goal of finding the 5 furniture items that have the highest score, where the score is the sum of the point value of each of the 5 chosen furniture items less the scores for any violated preferences of either conversant.",
        "The conversational agents work to achieve their goal by performing the following actions: propose, accept, reject, inform, and release turn.",
        "If there is not a current proposal, either agent can propose an item, which makes that item into the current proposal.",
        "If there is a current proposal, the other conversant can accept it or reject it.",
        "Accepting an item results in that item being included in the task solution and removes it as the current proposal.",
        "Rejecting a proposed item removes it as the current proposal.",
        "When an item has been rejected it remains a valid choice for future proposals.",
        "In addition to accepting or rejecting a proposal, either conversant may inform the other conversant of preferences that are violated by the current proposal.",
        "A preference is violated by the current proposal if the addition of that proposed item to the solution set would cause the solution set to violate the preference.",
        "When a conversant informs of a violated preference, that preference becomes mutually known and so affects future decisions by both participants.",
        "Only preferences that are not known by the other conversant are communicated.",
        "For turn taking, we include the action release turn, which the conversant that currently has the turn can perform to signal that it is relinquishing the turn (cf. Traum and Hinkelman, 1992).",
        "Note that after a release turn, the other agent must make the next move, which could itself be a release turn.",
        "The inclusion of this action allows conversants to perform multiple actions in a row, such as a reject, an inform, and a propose.",
        "Our approach to turn taking differs slightly from Yang and Heeman, as they make it an implicit part of other actions.",
        "In order to successfully utilize these actions in a dialog, some reasoning effort is required of the conversants.",
        "Conversants must be able to determine what preferences are violated by a pending proposal and which of the remaining items makes the best proposal.",
        "In order to keep the reasoning effort manageable, we follow Yang and Heeman and use a greedy algorithm to pick the item that results in the best score for the item plus the set of items already accepted.",
        "The conversants do not consider interactions with the items that will be subsequently added to the plan.",

        "We formulated the state of the dialog agents with many of the more specific details of the actual state of the task removed.",
        "For instance the agent state does not include specific information about the furniture item that is the pending proposal, rather the agent’s state only indicates that there is a pending proposal.",

        "We changed the hand-crafted policies slightly from Yang and Heeman so that the policies would not fail if they encountered unexpected input.",
        "For example, for the restricted policy for A (the conversant who proposes but never informs), if the learned policy proposes an item, A always rejects it.",

        "For each baseline policy, we show the performance with the policy pair, and then with each side of the baseline policy interacting with the learned policy.",
        "We see that although the performance of the learned policy is not as good as with the handcrafted pair, the performance is close, with the major shortcoming being a general increase in dialog length.",
        "Thus, the policies that we have learned our robust against different strategies a user might want to use."

        "In this paper, we proposed using reinforcement for learning a dialog strategy for the system.",
        "Our approach differs from past research in that we learn the system policy in conjunction with learning a user policy.",
        "This approach of learning the user policy allows us to minimize human involvement, as neither a training corpus must be collected nor a simulated user built.",
        "Thus, the only human input required for this approach was to define the domain task and to define success in that domain.",
        "While our training approach did not always find an effective policy, we overcame this obstacle by carefully choosing a ratio for the weights in the objective function and by running the learning algorithm multiple times.",
        "Our approach resulted in learned system and user dialog policies that achieved comparable performance with handcrafted system and user policy pairs.",
        "Furthermore, the learned system policies were robust.",
        "When the learned system policies ‘conversed’ with the handcrafted user policies, the resulting dialogs had comparable solution quality to what the handcrafted system and user policies achieved together.",
        "Even with the lack of convergence our approach could be applied to more complicated domains in order to learn an effective dialog policy.",
        "Our approach would be especially useful in situations where there are no existing corpora of human-human interactions for the domain or as a way to provide a check against a policy based on human intuition.",
        "In most situations where the domain requires significant collaboration between the dialog system and the user, training both the system and a user simultaneously will prove to be much less costly and labor intensive approach."
