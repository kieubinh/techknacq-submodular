        "Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment problem addresses structural ambiguity in natural language processing which is a major source of errors in parsing.",
        "The goal of PP attachment is to decide the attachment site of a given PP in the sentence.",
        "For example, consider the following sentences a) Mary ate the salad with a fork.",
        "b) Mary ate the salad with croutons.",
        "In sentence a), the PP 'with a fork' attaches to the verb eat rather than the noun salad and is called adverbial attachment.",
        "In sentence b), the PP 'with croutons' attaches to salad rather than eat and is called adjectival attachment.",
        "The problem of disambiguation between the PP attachment sites has received wide attention in natural language processing.",
        "Many rule-based methods, statistical methods which comprise of supervised and unsupervised methods and hybrid methods are proposed for the ambiguity resolution.",
        "212 A. Bharath√Ø et al.",
        "The prominent among the supervised methods which use annotated corpora for ambiguity resolution is the transformation-based approach by Brill and Resnik [1] with reported accuracy of 80% and the back-off approach to smoothen the probabilities of unseen attachments by Collins and Brooks [2] with reported accuracy of 84.5%.",
        "Ratnaparakhi et al. [7] considered lexical information within the verb phrase and used maximum entropy model to achieve the accuracy of 81.6%.",
        "Stetina and Nagao [9] used the WordNet thesaurus and sense tagged corpus to achieve the accuracy of 88.1% using a decision tree for classification.",
        "Though supervised methods dominate unsupervised methods in performance and the accuracy achieved by Stetino and Nagao [9] is close to the human accuracy of 88.2% reported by Ratnaparakhi et al. [7], the non-availability of large amount of annotated corpus is a serious limitation.",
        "On the other hand, the unsupervised methods use un-annotated corpus and infer attachment site based on the lexical association.",
        "Hindle and Rooth [4] used the lexical associations of verbs and nouns by computing co-occurrence frequencies, which resulted in 82% correct attachments for a set of around 3000 test cases from the Penn Tree bank.",
        "Pantel and Lin [6] proposed an iterative approach using unsupervised training data.",
        "The algorithm uses contextually similar words derived from a collocation database and a corpus based thesaurus for classification with 84% accuracy.",
        "Zavrel et al. [11] proposed a nearest-neighbor algorithm using memory based learning with an accuracy of 84.4%.",
        "Zhao and Lin [12] also used nearest-neighbor approach using various similarity measures and the algorithm achieved 86.5% accuracy using the cosine of mutual information as the similarity measure.",
        "Srinivas and Bhattacharya [8] extracted unambiguous data from raw corpus based on heuristics, expanded it using WordNet and used it as a training set, which yielded an accuracy of 83.86% on test data prepared by Ratnaparakhi et al. [7].",
        "Volk [10] combined the supervised and unsupervised approaches and used the back-off model for disambiguation on German corpus, achieving an accuracy of about 81% with a small annotated corpus of 10,000 sentences.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach which combines the strength of supervised and unsupervised approaches and also uses WordNet information whenever available to improve the disambiguation of attachment of a given PP.",
        "Our approach handles the problem of sparse data and the use of WordNet significantly differs from the earlier approaches (Stetino and Nagao [9]; Srinivas and Bhattacharya [8]).",
        "The training phase consists of supervised and unsupervised learning from annotated and un-annotated corpora and computing supervised and unsupervised scores.",
        "The supervised scores for quadruplets, triplets and pairs are analogous to the scores considered by Collins and Brooks [2].",
        "Further, information is iteratively extracted from the un-annotated corpus and is used to compute unsupervised scores for triplets and pairs.",
        "In addition, synonyms of verb and nouns present in a quadruplet are extracted from WordNet and their supervised and unsupervised scores are appropriately used to compute supervised and unsupervised WordNet scores respectively.",
        "All the calculated scores effectively give probability estimates of verb and noun attachments in the given situation.",
        "A convex combination of all these scores is used for disambiguation of the attachment of a given PP using a back-off model similar to Volk [10].",
        "The approach achieves an accuracy of 86.5% on the test data in [7] containing 2998 quadruplets.",
        "The algorithm was also tested on two other data sets and achieved an average accuracy of 86.68% with 100% recall over all three data sets.",
        "We further extend the algorithm to handle the problem of multiple PP attachment.",
        "A sentence often contains multiple prepositions, increasing the number of possible attachment sites and thus complicating the PP attachment problem further.",
        "For instance, out of 1223 sentences extracted from Penn Tree Bank, containing at least one preposition, all had two prepositions and 43% had three prepositions.",
        "The problem of multiple PP attachment has not received much attention in the literature.",
        "To our knowledge, there is a single reported attempt by Merlo et al. [5] to disambiguate attachment sites in case of multiple PPs in a sentence.",
        "They used generalized back-off approach, reusing the single PP attachment training information for multiple PP attachment and achieved an accuracy of 84.3% for first PP, 69.6% for the second and 43.6% for the third PP on data extracted from Penn Tree Bank.",
        "Our extended algorithm when run on the data extracted from Penn Tree Bank showed the accuracy of 86.5% for the first PP, 71.9% for the second and 58% for the third PP.",
        "The algorithm was also applied to the test data used by Merlo et al. [5] and resulted in the accuracy of 88.99% for the first PP and 73.4% for the second PP.",
        "The noun belonging to the last PP in the sentence is not available in this test data and hence the accuracy of our algorithm for the third PP could not be calculated.",
        "The algorithm showed improvement over the accuracy achieved by Merlo et al. for the first two PPs.",

[7]; Pantel and Lin [6]; Volk [10], among others).",
        "Thus, the PP attachment problem simplifies to the binary classification task of attaching the PP (Fi,iVi) to V (adverbial attachment) or to N (adjectival attachment).",
        "In case a sentence contains multiple prepositions, the attachment sites for all the PPs need to be determined.",

        "The increase in the number of possible attachment sites of subsequent PPs complicates the problem.",
        "Also, the presence of multiple verbs in the sentence further adds to the existing complexity.",
        "Note that the attachment ambiguity of the first PP (Fi,iVi) is the same as that of a single PP discussed earlier.",
        "We assume that the attachment of a PP in a sentence is independent of the attachment of any other PP that occurs before or after it in the sentence.",

        "For instance, the clause boundaries for the example sentence of Section 2 are",
        "ACET [will shortly be opening a new office in the east end of London [to serve clients in North and East London]]",
        "The second PP 'in North and East London' falls in the clause headed by the verb 'serve', which rules out the verb 'open' as a possible attachment site.",
        "The preposition may still have a verb and multiple nouns as its attachment sites within the same clause.",
        "Though we assume independence of PP attachments, we make use of linguistic knowledge to rule out certain attachment sites.",
        "We apply a rule which does not allow edges corresponding to the attachments to cross.",
        "For instance, in a structure of the type Va Na Fi iVi F2 N2 if (Fi,iVi) attaches to Va then (F2,iV2) cannot attach to Na.",
        "In the above example, if the PP (Fi,iVi) 'in the east end' attaches to 'open', then the PP 'of London' can not attach to 'office'.",
        "Though the above rule further reduces the possible attachment sites, the ambiguity in the attachment sites of the preposition still persists.",

        "As a first step towards using the single PP algorithm, we construct all possible quadruplets using the verb and available nouns with this PP.",
        "For instance, if the possible attachment sites of (P2,N2) are Va, Na and Ni, then the quadruplets constructed are (Va, Na, P2, N2), (Va,N1,P2,N2).",
        "Given any multiple PP sentence, the attachment site of the first preposition is decided based on the algorithm described in Section 5.",
        "For each of the subsequent PPs, we first run the single PP attachment algorithm for all the constructed quadruplets.",
        "If all the quadruplets give verb as its attachment, adverbial attachment is assigned for the PP.",
        "If the attachments given by quadruplets are contradictory, we compute XScore for each of the quadruplet, defined as where √ü is an appropriately selected normalizing constant between 0 and 1, E\\ is FinalVScorei for the quadruplet (V,N,Pi,Ni) and E2 is FinalNScorei for the quadruplet (y,N,P\\,N\\) defined in (7) and (8), where i is sup or unsup, as the case may be.",
        "We pick the quadruplet with highest XScore and the PP attachment given by this quadruplet is assigned to the PP.",

        "The noun belonging to the last PP in the sentence is not available in this test data.",
        "Hence only those tuples with two or more PPs could be used to test the accuracy of the attachment of first PP.",
        "Similarly, to test for accuracy of the attachment of the second PP, we had to use tuples from the sentences with three PPs.",
        "Since all the tuples had a maximum of three PPs only, the accuracy of our algorithm for the attachment of the third PP could not be calculated for data set III.",

        "In this work, we have looked at the problems of both single PP attachment as well as multiple PP attachment.",
        "We combine both supervised and unsupervised methods along with the WordNet information in our algorithm.",
        "Our use of WordNet information significantly differs from the earlier approaches using WordNet.",
        "The training data from annotated corpora contains quadruplets with PP attachment information, whereas in case of unsupervised training, the data consists of co-occurrence information about the PP and its attachment sites.",
        "The training data sets have been extracted from WSJ as well as BNC.",
        "Two existing test data sets ([7], [5]) and a third data set extracted from WSJ were used for evaluating the accuracy of the algorithm.",
        "The precision of 86.32% with a recall of 92% was achieved on Ratnaparkhi's dataset [7] consisting of 2998 quadruplets.",
        "We achieved the average precision of 86.68% with 100% recall and the average of precision of 88.82% with 93.9% recall on the three data sets.",
        "Multiple PP attachment problem was reduced to a problem of stepwise attachment of PPs from left to right within a clause.",
        "As a result, the single PP attachment algorithm can be extended to disambiguate each PP attachment site.",
        "Based on the attachment decisions for the earlier PPs, certain later PP attachments are ruled out because of non-crossing of attachments.",
        "On the test data consisting of 1223 sentences extracted from WSJ the algorithm achieved the precision of 86.5% for the first PP and 71.9% and 58% respectively for subsequent PPs with 100% recall.",
        "The algorithm was also tested on the data set used in [5] and showed improvement over the accuracy by the earlier algorithm.",
        "Annotated corpus plays an important role in reaching these levels of accuracy and a larger annotated corpus would help in improving this accuracy.",
        "In conclusion, the algorithm shows significant improvement over earlier approaches to single and multiple PP attachment problem.",
        "Using thesaurus in place of WordNet is likely to improve the performance further since a thesaurus typically gives larger number of synonyms and does not provide subdivision of senses as fine as WordNet.",
        "This possibility is currently being investigated.",
        "While considering second and subsequent PPs in a multiple PP sentence, the quadruplets that are formed do not have information that the noun at a possible attachment site may or may not be an object of the verb.",
        "For example, consider the sentence He put the book on flowers on table.",
        "The PP 'on flowers' attaches to the noun 'book' where as 'on the table' attaches to the verb 'put'.",
        "With the verb like 'put', both prepositions 'on' are highly likely to be attached to 'put' because of the mandatory requirement of the verb frame.",
        "Thus the availability of verb frame information will make the task of PP attachment easier.",
        "Incorporation of such syntactic information would require a change in the algorithm and may be attempted in the future.",
        "In the presence of coordinate structure of two nouns or nous or verbs, our algorithm uses only the last element (noun or verb) in the coordinated structure.",
