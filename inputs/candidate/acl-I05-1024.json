        "Abstract.",
        "Many methods of term extraction have been discussed in terms of their accuracy on huge corpora.",
        "However, when we try to apply various methods that derive from frequency to a small corpus, we may not be able to achieve sufficient accuracy because of the shortage of statistical information on frequency.",
        "This paper reports a new way of extracting terms that is tuned for a very small corpus.",
        "It focuses on the structure of compound terms and calculates perplexity on the term unit's left-side and right-side.",
        "The results of our experiments revealed that the accuracy with the proposed method was not that advantageous.",
        "However, experimentation with the method combining perplexity and frequency information obtained the highest average-precision in comparison with other methods."

        "Term extraction, which is the task of extracting terminology (or technical terms) from a set of documents, is one of major topics in natural language processing.",
        "It has a wide variety of applications including book indexing, dictionary generation, and keyword extraction for information retrieval systems.",
        "Most automatic term extraction systems make a sorted list of candidate terms extracted from a given corpus according to the \"importance\" scores of the terms, so they require scores of \"importance\" for the terms.",
        "Existing scores include TF-IDF, C-Value [1], and FLR [9].",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method that involves revising the definition of the FLR method in a more sophisticated way.",
        "One of the advantages of the FLR method is its size-robustness, i.e, it can be applied to small corpus with less significant drop in performance than other standard methods like TF and IDF, because it is defined using more fine-grained features called term units.",
        "Our new method, called FPP, inherit this property while exhibiting better performance than FLR.",
        "At the same time, we also propose a new scheme for evaluating term extraction systems.",
        "Our idea is to use summaries1 of articles as a gold standard.",
        "This strategy is based on the assumption that summaries of documents can serve as collections of important terms because, in writing summaries, people may make an original document shorter by dropping unnecessary parts of original documents, while retaining essential fragments.",
        "Thus, we regard a term in an original document to be important if it also appears in the summary.",
        "2Term Extraction",
        "Term extraction is the task of extracting important terms from a given corpus.",
        "Typically, term extraction systems first extract term candidates,which are usually the noun phrases detected by handcrafted POS sequence patterns, from the corpus.",
        "After that, term candidates are sorted according to some importance score.",
        "Important terms, (i.e., terms that appear in the summary, in our problem setting,) are desired to be ranked higher than others.",
        "In this paper we focus on the second step, i.e., term candidate sorting by importance scores.",
        "We propose a new score of term importance by modifying an existing one in a more sophisticated manner.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, a term candidate is represented by W = w1w2• • • wn where wi represents a term unit contained in W ,and n is the number of term units contained in W. Here, atermunitis the basic element comprising term candidates that is not further decomporsable without destruction of meaning.",

        "Many methods of term scoring have been proposed in the literature [7] [3] [4].",

        "These methods can be mainly categorized into the following three types according to what types of features are used to calculate the scores.",
        " – Measurement by frequencies – Measurement by internal structures of term candidates – Combination of the above",
        "Frequency is one of the most basic features of term extraction.",
        "Usually, a term that appears frequently is assumed to be important.",
        "We introduce a score of this type: tf (W).",

        "An LR method [9] is based on the intuition that some words are used as term units more frequently than others, and a phrase that contains such \"good\" term units is likely to be important.",
        "The left score l(wi) of each term unit wi of a target term is defined as the number (or the number of types) of term units connected to the left of wi (i.e., appearing just in the left of wi in term candidates), and the right score r(wi) is defined in the same manner.3 An LR score lr(wi) is defined as the geometric mean of left and right scores:",

        "MC-Value [9] is a modified version of C-Value adapted for use in term collections that include the term of length 1 (i.e., n =1).",
        "We used MC-Value in the experiments because our task was to extract terms regardless of whether each term is one-word term or not.",
        "FLR.",
        "The LR method reflects the number of appearances of term units, but does not reflect that of a whole term itself.",
        "For example, even if \"natural language\" is more frequent than \"language natural\" and the former should be given a higher score than the latter, LR cannot be used to do this.",
        "An FLR method [9] was proposed to overcome this shortcoming of LR.",
        "It reflects both the frequencies and inner structures of terms.",
