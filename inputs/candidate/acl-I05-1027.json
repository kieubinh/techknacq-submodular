        "Text categorization (TC) is a task of assigning one or multiple predefined category labels to natural language texts.",
        "To deal with this sophisticated task, a variety of statistical classification methods and machine learning techniques have been exploited intensively[1], including the Naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier [2], the Vector Space Model (VSM)-based classifier [3], the example-based classifier [4], and the Support Vector Machine [5].",
        "Text filtering is a basic type of text categorization (two-class TC).",
        "It can find many real-life applications [6], a typical one is the ill information filtering, such as erotic information and garbage information filtering on the web, in emails and in short messages of mobile phone.",
        "It is obvious that this sort of information should be carefully controlled.",
        "On the other hand, the filtering performance using the existing methodologies is still not satisfactory in general.",
        "The reason lies in that there exist a number of documents with high degree of ambiguity, from the TC point of view, in a document collection, that is, there is a fuzzy area across the border of two classes (for the sake of expression, we call the class consisting of the ill information-related texts, or, the negative samples, the category of TARGET, and, the class consisting of the ill information-not-related texts, or, the positive samples, the category of NonTARGET).",
        "Some documents in one category may have great similarities with some other documents in the other category, for example, a lot of words concerning love story and sex are likely appear in both negative samples and positive samples if the filtering target is erotic information.",
        "We observe that most of the classification errors come from the documents falling into the fuzzy area between two categories.",
        "The idea of this paper is inspired by the fuzzy area between categories.",
        "A two-step TC method is thus proposed: in the first step, a classifier is used to fix the fuzzy area between categories; in the second step, a classifier (probably the same as that in the first step) with more subtle and powerful features is used to deal with documents in the fuzzy area which are thought of being unreliable in the first step.",
        "Experimental results validate the soundness of this method.",
        "Then we extend it from two-class TC to multi-class TC.",
        "Furthermore, in this two-step framework, we try to improve the classifier by taking the dependences among features into consideration in the second step, resulting in a Causality Naïve Bayesian Classifier.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the two-step method in the context of two-class Chinese TC; Section 3 extends it to multi-class TC; Section 4 introduces the Causality Naïve Bayesian Classifier; and Section 5 is conclusions."

        "In the second step, more subtle and powerful features will be designed in particular to tackle the unreliable area identified in the first step.",

        "Method-5: (i.e., the proposed method): Use Chinese words as features in the first step and then use word bigrams as features in the second step, reduce features with (8), and classify the documents in two steps.",
        "Note that the proportion of negative samples and positive samples is 1:6.",
        "Thus if all the documents in the test set is arbitrarily set to positive, the precision will reach 85.7%.",
        "For this reason, only the experimental results for negative samples are considered in evaluation, as given in Table 1.",
        "For each method, the number of features is set by the highest point in the curve of the classifier performance with respect to the number of features (For the limitation of space, we omit all the curves here).",
        "The numbers of features set in five methods are 4000, 500, 15000, 800 and 500+3000 (the first step + the second step) respectively.",
        "Comparing Method-1 and Method-2, we can see that feature reduction formula (8) is superior to (9).",
        "Moreover, the number of features determined in the former is less than that in the latter (500 vs. 4000).",
        "Comparing Method-2, Method-3 and Method-4, we can see that Chinese word bigrams as features have better discriminating capability meanwhile with more serious data sparseness: the performances of Method-3 and Method-4 are higher than that of Method-2, but the number of features used in Method-3 is more than those used in Method-2 and Method-4 (15000 vs. 500 and 800).",
        "Table 1 shows that the proposed method (Methond-5) has the best performance (95.54% F1) and good efficiency.",
        "It integrates the merit of words and word bigrams.",

        "The issue of how to classify Chinese documents characterized by high degree ambiguity from text categorization's point of view is a challenge.",
        "For this issue, this paper presents two solutions in a uniform two-step framework, which makes use of the distributional characteristics of misclassified documents, that is, most of the misclassified documents are near to the separate line between categories.",
        "The first solution is a two-step TC approach based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier.",
        "The second solution is to further introduce the dependences among features into the model, resulting in a two-step approach based on the so-called Causality Naïve Bayesian Classifier.",
        "Experiments show that the second solution is superior to the Naïve Bayesian Classifier, and is equal to CNB without exploring two-step strategy in performance, but has a higher computational efficiency than the latter.",
        "The first solution has the best performance in all the experiments, outperforming all other methods (including the second solution): in the two-class experiments, its F1 increases from the baseline 82.67% to the final 95.54%, and in the multi-class experiments, its average F1 increases from the baseline 91.48% to the final 98.56%.",
        "In addition, the other two conclusions can be drawn from the experiments: 1) Using Chinese word bigrams as features has a better discriminating capability than using words as features, but more serious data sparseness will be faced; 2) formula (8) is superior to (9) in feature reduction in both the two-class and multi-class Chinese text categorization.",
        "It is worth point out that we believe the proposed method is in principle language independent, though all the experiments are performed on Chinese datasets."
