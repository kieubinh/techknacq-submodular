        "It focused on temporal and event recognition in question answering systems and paid great attention to temporal relations among states, events and time expressions in temporal questions.",
        "TimeML (http://www.ti-meml.org), a temporal information (e.g. time expression, tense & aspect) annotation standard, has also been used for temporal question answering in this workshop [2].",
        "Correct understanding of a temporal question will greatly help extracting and verifying its answers and certainly improve the performance of any question answering system.",

        "In a general question answering system, the question classifier commonly classifies temporal questions into two classes, i.e. \"date\" and \"period\".",
        "With such a system, the above two questions are both assigned a \"date\".",
        "Whereas it is natural for the question [Ea] to be answered with a particular data (e.g. \"12/02/1809\"), it is not the case for question [Eb], because a proper answer could be \"35,000 years ago\".",
        "However, if it is known that the time granularity concerned is \"thousands of years\", answer extraction turn to be more targeted.",
        "The need for a more fine-grained classification is obvious.",
        "Although there were different question classification hierarchies, as reported [3,4,12,13,14], few inclined to introducing the classification hierarchy (e.g. \"year\", \"month\" and \"day\") which could give a clearer direction to guide answer extraction and verification of temporal questions.",
        "In the following, we try to find out whether temporal questions can be further classified into finer time granularity and how to classify them.",
        "By examining a temporal question corpus consisting of 348 questions, 293 of which are gathered from UIUC question answering labelled data (http://l2r.cs.",
        "uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Data/QA/QC), and the rest 55 from TREC 10 test corpus, we find two different cases.",
        "On the one hand, some questions are very straightforward in expressing the time granularities of the answers expected, e.g. the questions beginning with \"which year\" or \"for how many years\".",
        "On the other hand, some questions are not so obvious, e.g. the questions headed by \"when\" or \"for how long\".",
        "We call such questions ambiguous questions.",
        "Not surprisingly, the ambiguous When-and How long-like questions account for a large proportion in this temporal question corpus, i.e. 197 from 348 in total.",
        "We further investigate on those 197 ambiguous questions in order to find out whether they can be classified into finer time granularity.",
        "Three experimenters are requested to tag a time granularity to each question independently.",
        "Answers are not provided.",
        "The tag with two agreements is taken as the time granularity class of the corresponding temporal question.",
        "Otherwise the tag \"UNKNOWN\" is assigned.",
        "Reference answers for the questions are extracted from AltaVista Web Search (http://www.altavista.com).",
        "Comparing the time granularities tagged manually with those provided by the reference answers, we find that only 27 out of 197 questions are incorrectly tagged, in other words, the manually tagging accuracy is 86.2%.",
        "Errors exist though, the relatively high agreement between users' tagging and reference answers lights the hope of automatically determining the time granularities of temporal questions.",
        "Analysing the tagging results, it is revealed that the tagging errors arouse from three sources: insufficient world knowledge, different speaking habits and different expected information granularity among human.",
        "See the following examples:",
        "[Ec].",
        "When did the Neanderthal man live?",
        "User: year; Ref.",
        ": thousands of years [Ed].",

        "User: month; Ref.",
        ": week [Ee].",
        "When was the first Wall Street Journal published?",
        "For question [Ec], the time granularity should be \"thousands of years\", rather than \"year\".",

        "The time granularity of question [Ed] should be \"week\", but not \"month\" in accordance with the habit.",
        "For question [Ee], users' tag is \"year\", different from the reference answer's tag \"day\".",
        "However, both granularities are acceptable in commonsense, because the different users may want coarser or finer information.",
        "This observation suggests that incorporating question context, world knowledge, and speaking habits would help determine the time granularities of temporal questions.",
        "In this paper, we propose a fine-grained temporal question classification scheme, i.e. time granularity hierarchy, consisting of sixteen non-exclusive classes and scaling down from \"millions of years\" to \"second\".",
        "The SNoW-based classifier is then built to combine linguistic features (including word N-grams, granularity of time expressions and special patterns), user preferences and event types, and assign one of the sixteen classes to each temporal question.",
        "In our work, user preference, which characterizes world knowledge and speaking habits, is estimated by means of the time granularities of the entities and/or events involved.",
        "The SNoW-based classifier achieves 83.5% accuracy, almost close to 86.2% of manually tagging accuracy.",
        "Experiments also show that user preference makes a great contribution to time granularity classification.",

        "However, if a question seeking for a finer time granularity, e.g. \"day\", has been incorrectly determined as a coarser one, e.g. \"year\", it should also be taken as partly correct, which is reflected in accuracy2 (see Equation 10).",

        "There are six types of features: 15 user preferences (10 for the estimation of time granularities, 3 for the estimation distributions, and 2 for question focuses) (F1), 951 unigrams (F2), 9277 bigrams (F3), 10 granularity of time expressions (F4), 14 special patterns (F5), and 4 event types (F6).",

        "Accuracies of SNoW classifier on 194 test questions are presented in Table 1.",

        "It reveals that the classification errors mainly come from time granularity of \"month\", \"day\" and \"century\".",
        "Low accuracy on \"month\" and \"century\" accounts from absence of enough examples, i.e. examples for training and testing both less than five.",
        "Many \"day\" questions are incorrectly classified into \"year\", which accounts for the low accuracy on \"day\".",
        "The reason lies in that there are more \"year\" questions than \"day\" questions in the training question corpus (116 vs. 56).",
        "In general, we can extract three F1 features, one F4 feature, less than two F5 features, and one F6 feature from one question.",
        "It is hard for SNoW classifier to train and test independently on each of these types of the features because of the small feature number in one example question.",
        "However, the numbers of F2 and F3 features in a question are normally more than ten.",
        "So we take unigrams (F2) and bigrams (F3) as the basic feature set.",
        "Table 3 presents the accuracy when the rest four types of features are added into the basic feature set respectively.",
        "As expected user preference makes the most significant improvement, 7.82% in accuracy1 and 7.90% in accuracy2.",
        "Special patterns also play an important role, which makes 2.6% accuracy1 improvement.",
        "It is strange that event type makes such a modest improvement (0.5%).",
        "After analyzing the experimental results, we find that as there are only four event types, it makes limited contribution to 10-class time granularity classification."
