        "In previous alignment methods, some researchers employed statistical word alignment models to build alignment links [3], [4], [8], [11], [16].",
        "Some researchers used similarity and association measures to build alignment links [1], [15].",
        "One issue about word alignment is how to improve the performance of a word aligner when the training data are fixed.",
        "One possible solution is to use ensemble methods [5], [6].",
        "The ensemble methods were proposed to improve the performance of classifiers.",
        "An ensemble of classifiers is a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way (weighted or unweighted voting) to classify new examples.",
        "Many methods for constructing ensembles have been developed [5].",
        "One kind of methods is to resample the training examples.",
        "These methods include bagging [2], cross-validation committees [12] and boosting [7].",
        "The two former methods generate the classifiers in parallel while boosting generates the classifiers sequentially.",
        "In addition, boosting changes the weights of the training instance that is provided as input to each inducer based on the previously built classifiers.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach to improve word alignment with ensemble methods.",
        "Although word alignment is not a classification problem, we can still build different word aligners by resampling the training data.",
        "If these aligners perform accurately and diversely on the corpus [6], they can be employed to improve the word alignment results.",
        "Here, we investigate two ensemble methods: bagging and cross-validation committees.",
        "For both of the ensemble methods, we employ weighted and unweighted voting to build different ensembles.",
        "Experimental results indicate that both bagging and cross-validation committees improve the word alignment results.",
        "The weighted ensembles perform much better than the unweighted ensembles according to our word alignment results.",
