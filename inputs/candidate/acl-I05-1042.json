        "With three kinds of language pairs matched according to morph-syntactical similarity or difference, we investigate the effects of various morpho-syntactical information, such as base form, part-of-speech, and the relative positional information of a word in a statistical machine translation framework.",

        "And we integrate the models into a log-linear model.",
        "Experiments on multilingual translations showed that such morphological information as part-of-speech and base form are effective for improving performance in morphologically rich language pairs and that the relative positional features in a word group are useful for reordering the local word orders.",

        "For decades, many research efforts have contributed to the advance of statistical machine translation.",
        "Such an approach to machine translation has proven successful in various comparative evaluations.",
        "Recently, various works have improved the quality of statistical machine translation systems by using phrase translation [1,2,3,4] or using morpho-syntactic information [6,8].",
        "But most statistical machine translation systems still consider surface forms and rarely use linguistic knowledge about the structure of the languages involved[8].",
        "In this paper, we address the question of the effectiveness of morpho-syntactic features such as parts-of-speech, base forms, and relative positions in a chunk or an agglutinated word for improving the quality of statistical machine translations.",
        "Basically, we take a statistical machine translation model based on an IBM model that consists of a language model and a separate translation model [5]:",
        "The translation model links the source language sentence to the target language sentence.",
        "The target language model describes the well-formedness of the target language sentence.",
        "Empirical Study of Utilizing Morph-Syntactic Information in SMT 475",
        "One of the main problems in statistical machine translation is to learn the less ambiguous correspondences between the words in the source and target languages from the bilingual training data.",
        "When translating one source lan-guage(which may be inflectional or non-inflectional) into the morphologically rich language such like Japanese or Korean, the bilingual training data can be exploited better by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related inflected or agglutinated forms.",
        "In this study, we represent a word with its morphological features in both sides of the source and the target language to learn less ambiguous correspondences between the source and the target language words or phrases.",
        "In addition, we utilize the relative positional information of a word in its word group to consider the word order in an agglutinated word or a chunk.",
        "Another problem is to produce a correct target sentence.",
        "To produce more correct target sentence, we should consider the following problems: word reordering in a language pair with different word order, production of correct inflected and agglutinated words in an inflectional or agglutinative target language.",
        "In this study, we tackle the problem with language models.",
        "For learning language model that can treat morphological and word-order problem, we represent a word with its morphological and positional information.",
        "However, a word-based language model with enriched word is likely to suffer from a severe data sparseness problem.",
        "To alleviate the problem, we interpolate the word-based language model with a class-based n-gram model.",
        "In the next section, we briefly discuss related works.",
        "Then, we describe the method that utilizes morpho-syntactic information under consideration for improving the quality of translations.",
        "Then we report the experimental results with some analysis and conclude our study."

        "Few papers deal with the integration of linguistic information into the process of statistical machine translation.",
        "[8] introduced hierarchical lexicon models including base-form and POS information for translation from German into English.",
        "Irrelevant information contained in the German entries for the generation of the English translation were omitted.",
        "They trained the lexicon model using maximum entropy.",
        "[6] enriched English with knowledge to help select the correct full-form from morphologically richer languages such as Spanish and Catalan.",
        "In other words, they introduced a splicing operation that merged the pronouns/modals and verbs for treating differences in verbal expressions.",
        "To treat the unknown entries in the lexicon resulting from the splicing operation, they trained the lexicon model using maximum entropy and used linguistic knowledge just in the source language part and not in the target language.",
        "They don't use any linguistic knowledge in the target language and use full-form words during training.",
        "In addition, [6] and [8] proposed reordering operations to make similar word orders in the source and target language sentences.",
        "In other words, for the interrogative phrases with different word order from the declarative sentences, they introduced techniques of question inversion and removed unnecessary auxiliary verbs.",
        "But, such inversion techniques require additional preprocessing with heuristics.",
        "Unlike them, we investigate methods for utilizing linguistic knowledge in both of the source and the target language at the morpheme level.",
        "To generate a correct full-form word in a target language, we consider not only both the surface and base form of a morpheme but also the relative positional information in a full-form word.",
        "We strongly utilize the combined features in language modeling.",
        "By training alignments and language models with morphological and positional features at the morpheme-level, the severe data sparseness problem can be alleviated with the combined linguistic features.",
        "And the correspondence ambiguities between the source and target words can be decreased."

        "Generally, the probabilistic lexicon resulting from training a translation model contains all word forms occurring in the training corpus as separate entries, not taking into account whether they are inflected forms.",
        "A language model is also composed of the words in the training corpus.",
        "However, the use of a full-form word itself may cause severe data sparseness problem, especially relevant for more inflectional/agglutinative languages like Japanese and Korean.",

        "Japanese and Korean are highly inflectional and agglutinative languages, and in English inflection has only a marginal role; whereas Chinese usually is regarded as an isolating language since it has almost no inflectional morphology.",
        "As the syntactic role of each word within Japanese and Korean sentences are often marked, word order in a sentence plays a relatively small role in characterizing the syntactic function of each word than in English or Chinese sentences.",

        "to-Japanese translation, the SBPL model showed the best score in BLEU and mWER.",
        "In this language pair of highly inflectional and agglutinative languages, the part-of-speech information combined with surface form was the most effective in improving the performance.",
        "The base form and relative positional information were less effective than part-of-speech.",
        "It could be explained in several points: Japanese and Korean are very similar languages in the word order of SOVs and the ambiguities of translation correspondences in both directions were converged into 1.0 by combining the distinctive morphological information with the surface form.",
        "When refering to the vocabulay size of SP model in Table 2, it makes it more clear.",
        "The Japanese-to-Korean translation outperforms the Korean-to-Japanese.",
        "It might be closely related to the language model: the perplexity of the Korean language model is lower than Japanese according to our corpus statistics.",
        "Table 5 shows the performance of the English-to-Korean and Korean-to-English translation: a pair of highly inflectional and agglutinative language with partially free word-order and an inflectional language with rigid word order.",
        "In this language pair, the combined word representation models improved the translation performance into significantly higher BLEU and mWER scores in both directions.",
        "The part-of-speech and the base form information were distinctive features.",
        "When comparing the performance of SP, SB and SL models, part-of-speech might be more effective than base form or relative positional information, and the relative positional information in Korean might play a role not only in controlling word order in the language models but also in discriminating word correspondences during alignment.",
        "When the target language was Korean, we had higher BLEU scores in all the morpho-syntactic models but lower NIST scores.",
        "In other words, we took advantage of generating more accurate full-form eojeol with positional information, i.e. local word ordering.",
        "Table 6 shows the performance of the Chinese-to-Korean and Korean-to-Chinese translation: a pair of a highly inflectional and agglutinative language with partially free word order and a non-inflectional language with rigid word order.",
        "This language pair is a quite morpho-syntactically different.",
        "When a non-inflectional language is a target language(i.e. Korean-to-Chinese translation), the performance was the worst compared with other language pairs and directions in BLEU and mWER.",
        "On the other hand, the performance of Chinese-to-Korean was much better than Korean-to-Chinese, meaning that it is easier to generate Korean sentence from Chinese the same as in Japanese-to-Korean and English-to-Korean.",
        "In this language pair, we had gradual improvements according to the use of combined morpho-syntactic information, but there was no significant difference from the use of only the surface form.",
        "There was scant contribution of Chinese morphological information such as part-of-speech.",
        "On the other hand, we could get some advantageous Korean morpho-syntactic information in the Chinese-to-Korean translation, i.e., the advantage of language and translation models using morpho-syntactic information.",
        "In this paper, we described an empirical study of utilizing morpho-syntactic information in a statistical machine translation framework.",
        "We empirically investigated the effects of morphological information with several language pairs: Japanese and Korean with the same word order and high inflection/ agglutination, English and Korean, a pair of a highly inflecting and agglutinating language with partial free word order and an inflecting language with rigid word order, and Chinese-Korean, a pair of a highly inflecting and agglutinating language with partially free word order and a non-inflectional language with rigid word order.",
        "As the results of experiments, we found that combined morphological information is useful for improving the translation quality in BLEU and mWER evaluations.",
        "According to the language pair and the direction, we had different combinations of morpho-syntactic information that are the best for improving the translation quality: SP(surface form and part-of-speech) for translating J-to-K or K-to-J, SBP(surface form, base form and part-of-speech) for E-to-K or K-to-E, SPL(surface form, part-of-speech and relative position) for C-to-K.",
        "The utilization of morpho-syntactic information in the target language was the most effective.",
        "Language models based on morpho-syntactic information were very effective for performance improvement.",
        "The class-based n-gram models improved the performance with smoothing effects in the statistical language model.",
        "However, when translating an inflectional language, Korean into a non-inflectional language, Chinese with quite different word order, we found very few advantages using morphological information.",
        "One of the main reasons might be the relatively low performance of the Chinese morphological analyzer.",
        "The other might come from the linguistic difference.",
        "For the latter case, we need to adopt approaches to reflect the structural characteristics such like using a chunker/parser, context-dependent translation modeling."
