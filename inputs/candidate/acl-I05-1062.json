        "Traditional research into the automatic compilation of bilingual dictionaries from corpora exploits parallel texts, i.e. a text and its translation [17].",
        "From sentence-to-sentence aligned corpora, symbolic [2], statistical [11], or combined [7] techniques are used for word and expression alignments.",
        "The use of parallel corpora raises two problems:",
        " – as a parallel corpus is a pair of translated texts, the vocabulary appearing in the translated text is highly influenced by the source text, especially for technical domains;",
        " – such corpora are difficult to obtain for paired languages not involving English.",
        "New methods try to exploit comparable corpora: texts that are of the same text type and on the same subject without a source text-target text relationship.",
        "The main studies concentrate on finding in such corpora translation candidates for one-item words.",
        "For example, the French SWT manteau is translated in English by mantle in the domain of forestry, shield in the domain of marine activities, and by coat in the domain of clothing.",
        "The method is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts.",
        "Thus, for our three possible translations of manteau, three different lexical contexts are encountered which are expressed below by English lexical units:",
        " – manteau/mantle : vegetation, forest, wood...",
        " – manteau/shield : boat, sea, shipbuilding...",
        " – manteau/coat : cloth, cold, wear...",
        "These contexts can be represented by vectors, and each vector element represents a word which occurs within the window of the word to be translated.",
        "Translation is obtained by comparing the source context vector to each translation candidate vector after having translated each element of the source vector with a general dictionary.",
        "This method is known as the \"direct context-vector approach\".",
        "Using this method, [10] extracts English-Chinese one-item candidate translations from two years of English and Chinese newspaper articles by matching the context vector with 76% precision on the first 20 candidates.",
        "From English-German newspaper corpora of 85 million words, [14] improves the precision to 89% on the first one-item 10 candidates using the same techniques.",
        "[4] obtain 50% precision on the first one-item 10 candidates from a French/English corpus of 1.2 million words.",
        "[1] adapted this approach to deal with many-to-many word translations.",
        "In extracting English-Chinese nominal phrases belonging to general domains from the web, they obtain a precision of 91% on the first 3 candidates.",
        "Some improvements have been proposed by [9] to avoid the insufficient coverage of bilingual dictionary and thus not to get context vectors with too many elements that are not translated.",
        "This method is called \"similarity-vector approach\": it associates to the word to be translated the context vectors of the nearest lexical units that are in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "With this method, they obtain for one-item French-English words 43% and 51% precision on the ten and twenty first candidates applied on a medical corpus of 100 000 words (respectively 44% and 57% with the direct method) and 79% and 84% precision on the ten and twenty first candidates applied on a social science corpus of 8 millions words (respectively 35% and 42% with the direct method).",
        "If the results obtained in the field of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora are promising, they only cover either bilingual single words from general or specialised corpora, or bilingual nominal phrases from general corpora.",
        "Our goal is to find translation for multi-word terms (MWTs) from specialised comparable corpora.",
        "If MWTs are more representative of domain specialities than single-word terms (SWTs), pinpointing their translations poses specific problems:",
        " – SWTs and MWTs are not always translated by a term of the same length.",
        "For example, the French MWT peuplement forestier (2 content words) is translated into English as the SWT crop and the French term essence d'ombre (2 content words) as shade tolerant species (3 content words).",
        "This well-known problem, referred to as \"fertility\", is seldom taken into account in bilingual lexicon extraction, a word-to-word assumption being generally adopted.",
        " – When a MWT is translated into a MWT of the same length, the target sequence is not typically composed of the translation of its parts [13].",
        "For example, the French term plantation (énergétique is translated into English as fuel plantation where fuel is not the translation of energetique.",
        "This property is referred to as \"non-compositionality\".",
        " – A MWT could appear in texts under different forms reflecting either syntactic, morphological or semantic variations [12],[5].",
        "Term variations should betakenintoaccountinthetranslation process.",
        "For example, the French sequences amenagement de la foret and amenagement forestier refer to the same MWT and are both translated into the same English term: forest management.",
        "We propose tackling these three problems, fertility, non-compositionality, and variations, by using both linguistic and statistical methods.",
        "First, MWTs are identified in both the source and target language using a monolingual term extraction program.",
        "Second, a statistical alignment algorithm is used to link MWTs in the source language to single words and MWTs in the target language.",
        "Our alignment algorithm extracts the words and MWT contexts and proposes translations by comparing source and target words and MWT contexts."

        " – tokenisation and sentence segmentation; – part-of-speech and lemma tagging.",
        "First, ACABIT carries out shallow parsing: it scans the corpus, counts and extracts strings whose tag sequences characterise patterns of MWTs or one of their variants.",
        "The different occurrences referring to a MWT or one of its variants are grouped and constitute an unique candidate MWT.",
        "Thus the candidate MWT produit forestier 'forest product' appears under the following forms:",

        "The MWT candidates produit de la foret, produit agroforestier, non-produit agro-forestier,and sous-produit forestier, sous-produit de la foret have also been identified.",

        "Merging of two MWTs.",
        "Two MWT candidates are merged if they are synonymic variants obtained by derivation or conversion.",
        "Such variants include a relational adjective: either a denominal adjective, i.e. morphologically derived from a noun thanks to a suffix, such as forêt/forestier 'forest', or an adjective having a noun usage such as mathématique 'mathematical/mathematics'.",
        "Dissociation of some MWT variants.",
        "Syntactical variants that induce semantic discrepancies are retrieved from the set of the candidate variants and new MWT candidates are created.",

        "In the following steps, we do not consider a unique sequence reflecting a candidate MWT but a set of sequences.",
        "We consider only term variants that are grouped under a unique MWT.",
        "This grouping of term variations could be interpreted as a terminology normalisation in the same way as lemmatisation at the morphological level.",

        "Secondly, we aligned them using a statistical method adapted from similarity-vector approach for single words which exploits the context of these MWTs.",
        "This combined approach for MWTs gives satisfactory results compared to those for single word.",
        "It also allows us to obtain non compositional translations of MWTs.",
        "Our further works will concentrate on the interaction parameters, the combining of the source-to-target and target-to-source alignment results, and the handling of non-synonymic term variations."
