        "Although several researchers [1,2,3] have shown that heuristic rules are effective to detecting grammatical errors in the English writing of second language learners, it has been pointed out that it is hard to write heuristic rules for detecting article errors [1].",
        "To be precise, it is hard to write heuristic rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns which are particularly important in detecting article errors.",
        "The major reason for this is that whether a noun is a mass noun or a count noun greatly depends on its meaning or its surrounding context (Refer to Pelletier and Schubert [4] for detailed discussion on the mass count distinction).",
        "Article errors are very common among Japanese learners of English [1,5].",
        "This is perhaps because the Japanese language does not have an article system similar to that of English.",
        "Thus, it is favorable for error detecting systems aiming at Japanese learners of English to be capable of detecting article errors.",
        "In other words, such systems need to somehow distinguish mass and count nouns in the writing of Japanese learners of English.",
        "In view of this background, we propose a method for automatically distinguishing mass and count nouns in context to complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors.",
        "In this method, mass and count nouns are distinguished by words surrounding the target noun.",
        "Words surrounding the target noun are collected from a corpus and weighted based on their occurrences.",
        "The weighted words are used for distinguishing mass and count nouns in detecting article errors.",
        "Given the mass count distinction, errors concerning singular/plural usage, whicharealsocommoninthewritingofJapanese learners of English, can be detected as well as article errors.",
        "For example, given that the noun information is a mass noun, informations can be detected as an error.",
        "Considering this, we include errors concerning singular/plural usage in the target errors of this paper.",
        "Hereafter, to keep the notation simple, the target errors1 will be referred to as article errors.",
        "The next section describes related work on distinguishing mass and count nouns.",

        "Of the undetected article errors (22 out of 62), only four were due to the misclassification of mass and count nouns by the proposed method.",
        "The rest were article errors that were not detected even if the mass count distinction was given.",
        "For example, extra definite articles such as \"I like *the gardening.\"",
        "cannot be detected even if whether the noun \"gardening\" is a mass noun or a count noun is given.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to exploit other sources of information than the mass count distinction to detect these kinds of article error.",
        "For instance, exploiting the relation between sentences could be used to detect these kinds of article error.",
        "The proposed method outperformed the method using only the default rules in both recall and precision.",
        "This means that words surrounding the target nouns are good indicators of the mass count distinction.",
        "For example, the proposed method correctly distinguished the target noun place in the phrase beautiful place as a count noun by \"beautifulnp â€“ count\" and detected an article error from it whereas the method using only the default rules did not.",

        "This paper has proposed a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns to complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors.",

        "From the results, it follows that the proposed method can complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English.",
        "The experiments have also shown that approximately 35% of article errors in the target essays are not detected by the mass count distinction.",
