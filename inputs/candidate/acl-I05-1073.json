        "Named entities are important constituents to identify roles, meanings, and relationships in natural language sentences.",
        "However, named entities are productive, so that it is difficult to collect them in a lexicon exhaustively.",
        "They are usually \"unknown\" when we process natural language sentences.",
        "Recognizing named entities in documents is indispensable for many natural language applications such as information retrieval [2], summarization [3], question answering [7], and so on.",
        "Identifying named entities is even harder in Chinese than in many Indo-European languages like English.",
        "In Chinese, there are no delimiters to mark word boundaries and no special features such as capitalizations to indicate proper nouns, which constitute huge part of named entities.",
        "In the past, various approaches [1, 4, 10] have been proposed to recognize Chinese named entities.",
        "Most of them just focused on MUC-style named entities [8], i.e., personal names, location names, and organization names.",
        "The extensive studies cover nearly 80% of named entities in real documents [1].",
        "Although the performance of such kinds of named entity recognizers is satisfiable, the rest 20% of named entities are so far rarely mentioned and often ignored in previous studies.",
        "These rarely mentioned ones belong to various sorts, such as terminologies, aliases and nicknames, brands, etc.",
        "These sorts may not occur as frequently as personal names or location names in a corpus, but the importance of the former in documents",
        "Integrating Punctuation Rules and Naïve Bayesian Model",
        "of specific domains is no less than that of the latter.",
        "For example, knowing names of dishes would be very important to understand articles about cooking.",
        "Among these rarely addressed named entities, titles of creations, such as book names, song titles, sculpture titles, etc., are one of the most important sorts.",
        "According to Chen & Lee (2004)'s study [1] of Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (abbreviated ASBC corpus hereafter), about 7% of named entities are titles of creations.",
        "In other words, more than one-third of rarely mentioned named entities are titles of creations.",
        "Chinese title recognition is challenging for the following reasons.",
        "There are no limitations in length and structures of titles.",
        "They might be a common word, e.g. \"it W (Mistakes, a Chinese poem), a phrase, e.g. \"f»PÂé\\j^#\" (Norwegian Wood, a song), a sentence, e.g. \"HffiLQ.M%h&9i>&\" (Don't Cry for Me Argentina, a song), or even like nothing, e.g. \"0£fà • MtÀ&ftk\" (Rub • Undescribable, a Chinese poetry collection).",
        "Besides, the choice of characters to name titles has no obvious preferences.",
        "Till now, few publications touch on Chinese title recognition.",
        "There are even no available corpora with titles being tagged.",
        "Several QA systems, such as Sekine and Nobata (2004) [9], used fixed patterns and dictionaries to recognize part of titles in English or Japanese.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2004) [6] proposed an iterative method that constructs patterns and dictionaries to recognize English titles.",
        "Their method cannot be adapted to Chinese, however, because the most important feature employed is capitalization, which does not exist in Chinese.",
        "In this paper, we propose a pioneer study of Chinese title recognition.",
        "An approach of integrating punctuation rules, lexicon, and naïve Bayesian models is employed to recognize creation titles in Chinese documents.",
        "Section 2 discusses some cues for Chinese title recognition.",
        "Section 3 gives a system overview.",
        "Punctuation rules and title gazetteer identify part of titles and filter out part of non-titles.",
        "The rest of undetermined candidates are verified by naïve Bayesian model.",

        "All of these titles are treated as a single sort because they share the same characteristics, i.e., they are named by somebody with creativity, and thus there are nearly no regularity or limitations on their naming styles.",
        "The challenging issue is that, unlike MUC-style named entities (MUC7, 1998), titles are usually composed of common words, and most of them have no internal features like surnames or entity affixes, e.g. \" \" (City) in \" \" (Taipei City).",
        "In other words, most titles might look just like common strings in sentences.",
        "Thus it is even more difficult to decide which fragment of sentences might be a title than to determine if some fragment is a title.",
        "For the lack of internal features, external features or context information must be found to decide boundaries of titles.",
        "Table 1 shows some words preceding or following titles in one-tenth sampling of ASBC corpus with titles tagged manually.",
        "We can observe that quotation marks are widely used.",
        "This is because writers usually quote titles with punctuation marks to make them clear for readers.",
        "The most common used ones are the two pairs of quotation marks \" r j \" and \" r j \".",

        "In our analysis, only less than 7% of strings quoted in \" r j \" or \" r j \" are creation titles.",

        "Besides the usage of French quotes to mark book names, writers often use them to label various types of creation titles.",
        "According to our analysis on Web searching and the sampling corpus, about 20% of occurrences of titles in Traditional Chinese documents are quoted in \" \", and nearly no strings other than titles would be quoted in \" \".",
        "This punctuation mark shows a very powerful cue to deal with title recognition.",
        "Nevertheless, there are still 40% of titles without any marks around.",

        "This paper presents a pioneer study of Chinese title recognition.",
        "It achieves the precision of 0.510 and the recall of 0.685.",
        "The experiments reveal much valuable information and experiences for further researches.",
        "First, the punctuation rules proposed in this paper are useful to recognize creation titles with a high precision.",
        "They can relief our burdens in building more resources, make supervised learning feasible, and give us some clues in similar studies like recognition of other sorts of named entities.",
        "These useful rules are also helpful for those applications needing high accuracies.",
        "For example, we can exploit these rules on an information retrieval system to filter out noises and show only the information about the requested creation or the publication.",
        "Second, naïve Bayesian classifier could achieve a comparable recall on the verification of possible titles.",
        "Since we only adopt simple features and use a rough estimation in feature model building, the result shows that naïve Bayesian classifier is",

        "Third, our result shows that recognizing rarely seen sorts of named entities is practicable.",
        "Because un-recognized named entities might significantly affect subsequent applications in Chinese, in particular, segmentation, we should not ignore the problems introduced by Non-MUC style named entities.",
        "Our study suggests that the recognition of these rarely mentioned named entities is promising.",
        "The performances of many applications, such as natural language parsing and understanding, might be boosted through adding the mechanism of recognizing these rare named entities.",
        "Finally, our research can also be extended to other oriental languages, such as Japanese, in which there are no explicit features like specialized delimiters or capitalizations to mark creation titles.",
        "Just as Chinese, un-recognized named entities in these languages might affect the performances of natural language applications.",
        "Recognizing Non-MUC style named entities is an indispensable task to process these languages.",
