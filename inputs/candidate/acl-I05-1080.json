        "With its importance, a word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been known as a very important field of a natural language processing (NLP) and has been studied steadily since the advent of NLP in the 1950s.",
        "In spite of the long study, few WSD systems are used for practical NLP applications unlike part-of-speech (POS) taggers and syntactic parsers.",
        "The reason is because most of WSD studies have focused on only a small number of ambiguous words based on sense tagged corpus.",
        "In other words, the previous WSD systems disambiguate senses of just a few words, and hence are not helpful for other NLP applications because of its low coverage.",
        "Why have the studies about WSD stayed on the small number of ambiguous words?",
        "The answer is on sense tagged corpus where a few words are assigned to correct senses.",
        "Since the construction of the sense tagged corpus needs a great amount of times and cost, most of current sense tagged corpora contain a small number of words less than 100 and the corresponding senses to the words.",
        "The corpora, which have sense information of all words, have been built recently, but are not large enough to provide sufficient disambiguation information of the all words.",
        "Therefore, the methods based on the sense tagged corpora have difficulties in disambiguating senses of all words.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation by Relative Selection 921",
        "In this paper, we proposed a novel WSD method that requires no sense tagged corpus1 and that identifies senses of all words in sentences or documents, not a small number of words.",
        "Our proposed method depends on raw corpus, which is relatively very large, and on WordNet [1], which is a lexical database in a hierarchical structure."

      "heading": "2. Related Works",
      "text": [
        "There are several works for WSD that do not depend on a sense tagged corpus, and they can be classified into three approaches according to main resources used: raw corpus based approach [2], dictionary based approach [3,4] and hierarchical lexical database approach.",
        "The hierarchical lexical database approach can be reclassified into three groups according to usages of the database: gloss based method [5], conceptual density based method [6,7] and relative based method [8,9,10].",
        "Since our method is a kind of the relative based method, this section describes the related works of the relative based method.",
        "[8] introduced the relative based method using International Roget's Thesaurus as a hierarchical lexical database.",
        "His method is conducted as follows: 1) Get relatives of each sense of a target word from the Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "2) Collect example sentences of the relatives, which are representative of each sense.",
        "3) Identify salient words in the collective context and determine weights for each word.",
        "4) Use the resulting weights to predict the appropriate sense for the target word occurring in a novel text.",
        "He evaluated the method on 12 English nouns, and showed over than 90% precision.",
        "However, the evaluation was conducted on just a small part of senses of the words, not on all senses of them.",
        "He indicated that a drawback of his method is on the ambiguous relative: just one sense of the ambiguous relative is usually related to a target word but the other senses of the ambiguous relatives are not.",
        "Hence, a collection of example sentences of the ambiguous relative includes the example sentences irrelevant to the target word, which prevent WSD systems from collecting correct WSD information.",
        "For example, an ambiguous word rail is a relative of a meaning bird of a target word crane at WordNet, but the word rail means railway for the most part, not the meaning related to bird.",
        "Therefore, most of the example sentences of rail are not helpful for WSD of crane.",
        "His method has another problem in disambiguating senses of a large number of target words because it requires a great amount of time and storage space to collect example sentences of relatives of the target words.",
        "[9] followed the method of [8], but tried to resolve the ambiguous relative problem by using just unambiguous relatives.",
        "That is, the ambiguous relative rail is not utilized to build a training data of the word crane because the word rail is ambiguous.",
        "Another difference from [8] is on a lexical database: they utilized WordNet as a lexical database for acquiring relatives of target words instead of International Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "Since WordNet is freely available for research, various kinds of WSD studies based on WordNet can be compared with the method of [9].",
        "They evaluated their method on 14 ambiguous nouns and achieved a good performance comparable to the methods based on the sense tagged corpus.",
        "However, the evaluation was conducted on a small part of senses of the target words like [8].",
        "However, many senses in WordNet do not have unambiguous relatives through relationships such as synonyms, direct hypernyms, and direct hy-ponyms.2 A possible alternative is to use the unambiguous relatives in the long distance from a target word, but the way is still problematic because the longer the distance of two senses is, the weaker the relationship between them is.",
        "In other words, the unambiguous relatives in the long distance may provide irrelevant examples for WSD like ambiguous relatives.",
        "Hence, the method has difficulties in disambiguating senses of words that do not have unambiguous relatives near the target words in the WordNet.",
        "The problem becomes more serious when verbs, which most of the relatives are ambiguous, are disambiguated.",
        "Like [8], the method also has a difficulty in disambiguating senses of many words because the method collects the example sentences of relatives of many words.",
        "[10] reimplemented the method of [9] using a web, which may be a very large corpus, in order to collect example sentences.",
        "They built training datum of all noun words in WordNet whose size is larger than 7GB, but evaluated their method on a small number of nouns of lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2 as [8] and [9]."
