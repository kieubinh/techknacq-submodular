        "In this paper, the usage and function of Chinese punctuations are studied in syntactic parsing and a new hierarchical approach is proposed for parsing long Chinese sentences.",
        "It differentiates from most of the previous approaches mainly in two aspects.",
        "Firstly, Chinese punctuations are classified as ‘divide’ punctuations and ‘ordinary’ ones.",
        "Long sentences which include ‘divide’ punctuations are broken into suitable units, so the parsing will be carried out in two stages.",
        "This ‘divide-and-rule’ strategy greatly reduces the difficulty of acquiring the boundaries of sub-sentences and syntactic structures of sub-sentences or phrases simultaneously in once-level parsing strategy of previous approaches.",
        "Secondly, a grammar rules system including all punctuations and probability distribution is built to be used in parsing and disambiguating.",
        "Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the time consumption and numbers of ambiguous edges of traditional methods, and also improve the accuracy and recall when parsing long Chinese sentences."

        "Until recently, although punctuations are clearly important parts of the written Chinese, many Chinese parsing systems developed to date have simply ignored them.",
        "Some researches have been done on English punctuations in parsing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], their researches have used plenty of theoretical and experimental facts to prove that it is effective to incorporate punctuation information into parsing of long complex sentences.",
        "But as far as we know, little work has been done in Chinese syntactic parsing.",
        "Because the derivation of Chinese punctuations was referring to western language [3], they have many similarities in usage.",
        "Researches on Chinese punctuations in parsing will be valuable.",
        "However, our study shows, there are still differences between them, special research on Chinese punctuations is necessary.",
        "In this paper, differences in English and Chinese punctuations are compared and the special difficulty and corresponding cause in parsing Chinese long sentences are analyzed.",
        "Then a new hierarchical parsing (HP) approach is proposed instead of traditional parsing (TP) method.",
        "This ‘divide-and-rule’ strategy greatly reduces the time consumption.",
        "Open test shows, parsing accuracy and recall of HP method are both about 7% higher than those of TP.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is related work.",
        "Section 3 mainly discusses the special difficulties and solution in parsing long Chinese sentences.",
        "Then HP method is discussed in detail in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 gives the final experiment results and corresponding analyses.",
        "Finally, the further work is expected."

        "A lexical grammar accounts for the text-categories (text-clauses, text-phrases) occurring between the punctuation marks, and a text grammar deals with the structure of punctuation, and the relation of those marks to the lexical expressions they separate.",

        "In Jones’ theory, in a sense, conjoining punctuation could also be treated under the adjunctive principle [3].",

        "An integrated syntactic punctuation grammar is given.",
        "Jones’ method shows good modularity.",
        "However, the grammars he designed can only cover a subset of all punctuation phenomena.",

        "In essence, English is a kind of hypotaxis language, so an intact syntax structure denotes a sentence.",
        "When several simple sentences are connected to form a compound sentence, there should be obvious conjunctions between them.",
        "Differently, Chinese is a kind of parataxis language, and the language unit which expresses a complete thought is an intact Chinese sentence.",
        "Therefore, several sentences with associative meanings can be connected by come punctuations to form a compound one without any conjunctions.",
        "This type of sentence is called ‘run-on sentence’, and which is prevalent in Chinese.",
        "For example, we randomly selected 4431 sentences whose lengths are over 30 characters from a Chinese corpus named TCT 973.1 There are 1830 run-on sentences, covering 41.3%.",

        "So, in above Chinese sentences, commas are used not only as separating marks of sub-sentences but also as separating marks of components in one sub-sentence.",
        "However, lack of connections makes methods [7, 8] of segmenting complex sentences invalid.",
        "In this situation, acquisition of the boundaries of sub-sentences and syntactic structure of sub-sentences or phrases should be done simultaneously in once-level parsing strategy, which will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of parsing long sentences."
