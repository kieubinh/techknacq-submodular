        "First, we aim to realize the NLP technologies into the form which can be easily observed by ordinary people.",
        "It is difficult to evaluate NLP technology clearly by ordinary people.",
        "Thus, we set the target to answer second grade Japanese language test, as an example of intelligible application to ordinary people.",
        "The ability of this program will be shown by scores which are familiar to ordinary people.",
        "Second aim is to observe the problems of the NLP technologies by degrading the level of target materials.",
        "Those of the current NLP research are usually difficult, such as newspapers or technological texts.",
        "They require high accuracy language processing, complex world knowledge or semantic processing.",
        "The NLP problems would become more apparent when we degrade the target materials.",
        "Although questions for second grade students also require world knowledge, it is expected that the questions become simpler and are resolved without tangled techniques."
