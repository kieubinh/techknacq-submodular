        "can be considered as the most important natural language understanding system.",
        "Although SHRDLU was not “embodied”, having had only a small stick to manipulate objects, it certainly had several features that a conversational agent is supposed to have.",
        "It had a great potential, and it was very promising for future research on natural language understanding.",
        "Recently better technologies have become available in speech recognition and natural language processing.",
        "Major breakthroughs in the area of computer graphics have enabled us to generate complex, yet realistic 3-D animated agents or embodied lifelike agents in a virtual environment.",
        "Researchers are now in a good position to go beyond SHRDLU by combining these technologies (?).",
        "This paper presents a conversational animated agent system, K3.",
        "Since all the actions carried out by an agent of the K3 system are visible, we can evaluate the performance of the system by observing its animation.",
        "Visualizing the agents’ actions yields many interesting issues from a cognitive science point of view; more complex processes are involved than those found in most conventional natural language understanding systems.",
        "After sketching out the overview of the K3 system in section 2, Two distinctive features of K3 are discussed in section 3, and 4.",
        "Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and looks at future research agenda."

        "A screen shot of K3 is shown in Fig. 1.",
        "There are two agents and several objects in a virtual world.",
        "The current system accepts simple Japanese utterances with anaphoric and elliptical expressions, such as “Walk to the desk.” and “Further”.",
        "The size of the lexicon is about 100 words.",
        "The architecture of the K3 is illustrated in Fig. 2. system.",
        "The speech recognition module receives the user’s speech input and generates a sequence of words.",
        "The syntactic/semantic analysis module analyzes the word sequence to extract a case frame.",
        "This module accepts ill-formed speech input including postposition omission, inversion, and self-correction.",
        "At this stage, not all case slots are necessarily filled, because of ellipses in the utterance.",
        "Even in cases where there is no ellipsis, instances of objects are not identified at this stage.",
        "Resolving ellipses and anaphora, and identifying instances in the world are performed by the discourse analysis module.",
        "Anaphora resolution and instance identification are achieved by using plan-knowledge, which will be described in section 3.",
        "The discourse analysis module extracts the user’s goal as well and hands it over to the planning modules, which build a plan to generate the appropriate animation.",
        "In other words, the planning modules translate the user’s goal into animation data.",
        "However, the properties of these two ends are very different and straightforward translation is rather difficult.",
        "The user’s goal is represented in terms of symbols, while the animation data is a sequence of numeric values.",
        "To bridge this gap, we take a two-stage approach – macro-and micro-planning.",
        "During the macro-planning, the planner needs to know the physical properties of objects, such as their size, location and so on.",
        "For example, to pick up a ball, the agent first needs to move to the location at which he can reach the ball.",
        "In this planning process, the distance between the ball and the agent needs to be calculated.",
        "This sort of information is represented in terms of coordinate values of the virtual space and handled by the micro-planner.",
        "To interface the macro and micro-planning, we introduced the SPACE object to represent a location in the virtual space by its symbolic and numeric character.",
        "The SPACE object is described in section 4."

        "The second dialogue is different from the first one only in terms of the verbs in the first and third utterances.",
        "The syntactic structure of each sentence in the second dialogue (2-1)–(2-3) is the same as the corresponding sentence in the first dialogue (1-1)–(1-3).",
        "However, pronoun “it” in (1-3) refers to “the blue ball” in (1-2), and pronoun “it” in (2-3) refers to “the red ball” in (2-1).",
        "The difference between these two examples is not explained by the theories based on surface clues such as the centering theory (?",
        "; ?).",
        "In the setting of SHRDLU-like systems, the user has a certain goal of arranging objects in the world, and constructs a plan to achieve it through interaction with the system.",
        "As Cohen pointed out, users tend to break up the referring and predicating functions in speech dialogue (?).",
        "Thus, each user’s utterance suggests a part of plan rather than a whole plan that the user tries to perform.",
        "To avoid redundancy, users need to use anaphora.",
        "From these observations, we found that considering a user’s plan is indispensable in resolving anaphora in this type of dialogue system and developed an anaphora resolution algorithm using the relation between utterances in terms of partial plans (plan operators) corresponding to them.",
        "The basic idea is to identify a chain of plan operators based on their effects and preconditions.",

        "This process is generally called “plan recognition.” A plan operator used in our system is similar to that of STRIPS (?",
        "), which consists of precondition, effect and action description.",
        "Variables in the retrieved plan operator are filled with case fillers in the utterance.",
        "There might be missing case fillers when anaphora (zero pronoun) is used in the utterance.",
        "The system tries to resolve these missing elements in the plan operator.",
        "To resolve the missing elements, the system again uses clue words and the plan library.",
        "An overview of the anaphora resolution algorithm is shown in Figure 3.",
        "When the utterance includes clue words, the system uses them to search the history database for the preceding utterance that shares the same goal as the current utterance.",
        "Then, it identifies the referent on the basis of case matching.",
        "There are cases in which the proper preceding utterance cannot be identified even with the clue words.",
        "These cases are sent to the left branch in Fig. 3 where the plan library is used to resolve anaphora.",
        "When there is no clue word or the clue word does not help to resolve the anaphora, the process goes through the left branch in Fig. 3.",
        "First, the system enumerates the candidates of referents using the surface information, then filters them out with linguistic clues and the plan library.",
        "For example, demonstratives such as “this”, “that” are usually used for objects that are in the user’s view.",
        "Therefore, the referent of anaphora with demonstratives is restricted to the objects in the current user’s view.",
        "If the effect of a plan operator satisfies the precondition of another plan operator, and the utterances corresponding to these plan operators are uttered in discourse, they can be considered to intend the same goal.",
        "Thus, identifying a chain of effect-precondition relations gives important information for grouping utterances sharing the same goal.",
        "We can assume an anaphor and its referent appear within the same utterance group.",
        "Once the utterance group is identified, the system finds the referent based on matching variables between plan operators.",
        "After filtering out the candidates, there still might be more than one candidate left.",
        "In such a case, each candidate is assigned a score that is calculated based on the following factors: saliency, agent’s view, and user’s view."

        "In one-to-many conversations, agents must coordinate each other.",
