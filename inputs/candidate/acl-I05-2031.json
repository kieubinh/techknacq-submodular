        "The last decade has witnessed several attempts to increase the quality of MT systems by introducing new methods.",
        "The strong stress on stochastic methods in the NLP in general and in the MT in particular, the attempts to develop hybrid systems, a wide acceptance of translation-memory based systems among the translation professionals, the aim at limited domain speech-to-speech translation systems, all these (and many other) trends have demonstrated encouraging results in recent years.",
        "Developing and using new methods definitely moves the whole MT field forward, but one The work described in this paper has been supported by the grant of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic GACR No.405/03/0914 and partially also by the grant of the Grant Agency of the Charles University GAUK No.",
        "351/2005 should not forget about all the effort invested into the old systems.",
        "Reusing at least some parts of those systems may help to decrease the costs of new systems, especially when one of the languages is not a ”big” language and therefore there is not such a wide range of tools, grammars, dictionaries available as for example for English, German, Japanese or Spanish.",
        "In this paper we would like to describe one such attempt to reuse the existing system for a new language pair."

        "On the other hand, it is a question whether the typological differences between Czech and English justify the transfer being performed at the tectogrammatical (deep syntactic) level.",
        "Last but not least, one of our aims was to develop a rule-based MT system with minimal possible costs, either reusing the existing modules or trying to use (semi)automatic methods whenever possible, concentrating on areas where using the human labor would be extremely expensive (for example building a large coverage bilingual dictionary, cf. the following paragraphs.)"

        "It also exploits the parallel bilingual corpus of syntactically annotated texts, although not as a direct learning material, more like an additional source of linguistic data especially for the dictionary development and for the testing of the system.",
        "The task is complicated by the fact that this translation direction is according to our opinion more complicated than the reverse one.",
        "There are several reasons for this claim; the most prominent one is the free word-order nature of the source language.",
        "It generally means that it is very often necessary to make substantial changes of the word order if we want to get a grammatical English sentence, while when translating from English to Czech the results are more or less grammatically correct and comprehensible even if we don’t change the word order at all.",
        "Another problem of the Czech-English translation is the insertion of articles.",
