        "Biomedical literature available on the web has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years.",
        "Therefore, demand for efficiently processing these documents is increasing rapidly.",
        "There has been a surge of interest in mining biomedical literature.",
        "Some possible applications for such efforts include the reconstruction and prediction of pathways, establishing connections between genes and disease, finding the relationships between genes, and much more.",
        "Critical tasks for biomedical literature mining include named entity recognition (NER), tokenization, relation extraction, indexing and categorization/clustering (Cohen and Hunter, 2005).",
        "Among these technologies, NER is most fundamental.",
        "It is defined as recognizing objects of a particular class in plain text.",
        "Depending on required application, NER can extract objects ranging from protein/gene names to disease/virus names.",
        "In general, biomedical NEs do not follow any nomenclature (Shatkay and Feldman, 2003) and can comprise long compound words and short abbreviations (Pakhomov, 2002).",
        "Some NEs contain various symbols and other spelling variations.",
        "On average, any NE of interest has five synonyms.",
        "Biomedical NER is a challenging problem.",
        "There are many different aspects to deal with.",
        "For example, one can have unknown acronyms, abbreviations, or words containing hyphens, digits, letters, and Greek letters; Adjectives preceding an NE may or may not be part of that NE depending on the context and applications; NEs with the same orthographical features may fall into different categories; An NE may also belong to multiple categories intrinsically; An NE of one category may contain an NE of another category inside it.",
        "To tackle these challenges, researchers use three main approaches: dictionary-based, rule based, and machine learning.",
        "In biomedical domain, there are more and more well-curated resources, including lexical resources such as Lo268 cusLink (Maglott, 2002) and ontologies such as MeSH (NLM, 2003).",
        "One might think that dictionary-based systems relying solely on these resources could achieve satisfactory performance.",
        "However, according to (Pakhomov, 2002), they typically perform quite poorly, with average recall rates in the range of only 10-30%.",
        "Rule-based approaches, on the other hand, are more accurate, but less portable across domains.",
        "Therefore, we chose the machine learning approach.",
        "Various machine learning approaches such as ME (Kazama et al., 2002), SVM (Kazama et al., 2002; Song et al., 2004), HMM (Zhao, 2004) are applied to NER.",
        "In this paper, we chose ME as our framework since it is much easier to represent various features in such a framework.",
        "In addition, ME models are flexible enough to capture many correlated features, including overlapping and non-independent features.",
        "We can thus use multiple features with more ease than on an HMM system.",
        "ME-based tagger, in particular, excel at solving sequence tagging problems such as POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), general English NER (Borthwick, 1999), and Chunking (Koeling, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we describe how to construct a ME-based framework that can exploit shallow linguistic information in the recognition of biomedical named entities.",
        "Hopefully, our experience in integrating these features may prove useful for those interested in constructing machine learning based NER system."

        "In the Biomedical NER problem, we regard each word in a sentence as a token.",

In addition, we use the tag O to indicate that a token is not part of an NE.",
        "The NER problem can then be phrased as the problem of assigning one of 2n + 1 tags to each token, where n is the number of NE categories.",

        "ME computes the probability p(oIh) for any o from the space of all possible outcomes O, and for every h from the space of all possible histories H. A history is all the conditioning data that enables one to assign probabilities to the space of outcomes.",
        "In NER, history can be viewed as all information derivable from the training corpus relative to the current token.",
        "The computation of p(oIh) in ME depends on a set of binary-valued features, which are helpful in making predictions about the outcome.",
        "For instance, one of our features is: when all alphabets of the current token are capitalized, it is likely to be part of a biomedical NE.",
        "Formally, we can represent this feature as follows:",
        "As noted in (Borthwick, 1999), ME allows users to focus on finding features that characterizes the problem while leaving feature weight assignment to the ME estimation routine.",
        "When new features, e.g., syntax features, are added to ME, users do not need to reformulate the model as in the HMM model.",
        "The ME estimation routine can automatically calculate new weight assignments.",

        "It is still difficult to recognize long, complicated NEs and to distinguish between two overlapping NE classes, such as cell-line and cell type.",
        "This is because biomedical texts have complicated syntax and involve more expert knowledge than general domain news articles.",

        "Certain errors, such as those in boundary identification, are more tolerable if the main purpose is to discover relationships",
        "between NEs.",
        "In the future, we will exploit more linguistic features such as composite features and external features.",
        "Finally, to reduce human annotation effort and to alleviate the scarcity of available annotated corpora, we will develop machine learning techniques to learn from Web corpora in different biomedical domains."
