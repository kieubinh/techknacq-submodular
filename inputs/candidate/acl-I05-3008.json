        "In many empirical studies (Tseng and Chen (2002); Tseng (2003); Lua (1993); Chen (2004)), this view has been confirmed repeatedly.",
        "In the semantic studies of Chinese word formation, many descriptive and cognitive semantic approaches have been proposed, such as argument structure analysis (Chang 1998) and the frame-based semantic analysis (Chu 2004).",

        "This has given to the consideration of the em-beddedness of linguistic meanings within broader conceptual structures.",

        "For example, in a case of VV compound VA (denounce-scold, drop-on), it is difficult (and subjective) to say which character is the head that can assign a semantic class to the compound.",
