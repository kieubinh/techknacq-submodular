        "With the rapid development of the Internet, the capacity of textual information has been greatly improved.",
        "How to acquire accurate and effective information has become one of the great concerns among Internet users.",
        "Open-Domain Question Answering System (QA) has gain great popularities among scholars who care the above problem (Li, et al. 2002; Moldovan, et al. 2003; Zhang, et al. 2003), for QA can meet users demand by offering compact and accurate answers, rather than text with corresponding answers, to the questions presented in natural language.",
        "Therefore, it saves users great trouble to find out specific facts or figures from large quantity of texts.",
        "The study of Question Classification (QC), as a new field, corresponds with the research of QA.",
        "QC is an essential part of QA, for to correctly answer users questions, the system has to know what the users are looking for, and it is QC that presents important searching clues for the system.",
        "QC can be defined to match a question to one or several classes in K category so as to determine the answer type.",
        "Every class presents some semantic restrictions on the answer searching, which serves QA with various strategies in locating the correct answer.",
        "The result of QC can also serve QA in the answer selecting and extract, which influence the performance of QA directly.",
        "The first reason is that QC minish searching space.",
        "For example, if the system knows that the answer type to the question Who was the first astronaut to walk in space?",
        "is a persons name, it can confine the answer in the names, rather than every word in the texts.",
        "The second reason is that QC can determine the searching strategies and knowledge base QA may need.",
        "For instance, the question What county is California in?",
        "needs the name of a country as its answer, so system needs the knowledge of countries name and name entities tagging to identify and testify the place name, while the question What is Teflon?",
        "expects an answer in a sentence or a fragment, in the form of Teflon is <.... >.",
        "In fact, almost all the QA have the QC module and QC is the one of the most important factors what determines the QA system performance (Moldovan, et al. 2003).",
        "At present the studies on QC are mainly based on the text classification.",
        "Though QC is similar to TC in some aspects, they are clearly distinct in that Question is usually shorter, and contains less lexicon-based information than text, which brings great trouble to QC.",
        "Therefore to obtain higher classifying accuracy, QC has to make further analysis of sentences, namely QC has to extend interrogative sentence with syntactic and semantic knowledge, replacing or extending the vocabulary of the question with the semantic meaning of every words.",
        "In QC, many systems apply machine-learning approaches (Hovy, et al. 2002; Ittycheriah, et al. 2000; Zhang, et al. 2003).",
        "The classification is made according to the lexical, syntactic features and parts of speech.",
        "Machine learning approach is of great adaptability, and 90.0% of classifying accuracy is obtained with SVM method and tree Kernel as features.",
        "However, there is still the problem that the classifying result is affected by the accuracy of syntactic analyzer, which need manually to determine the weights of different classifying features.",
        "Some other systems adopting manual-rule method make QC, though may have high classifying accuracy, lack of adaptability, because regulation determination involves manual interference to solve the conflicts between regulations and to form orderly arranged rule base.",
        "The paper combines statistic and rule classifiers, specifically statistics preceding regulation, to classify questions.",
        "With rule classifier as supplementary to statistic, the advantages of respective classifier can be given full play to, and therefore the overall performance of the classifier combination will be better than the single one.",
        "Moreover, as far as the QC task is concerned, the paper compares various classifier combinations, statistic-rule classifier, voting Adaboost and ANN.",
        "To represent questions, the paper uses dependency structure from Minipar (Lin 1998) and linguistic knowledge from Wordnet (Miller 1995; Miller, et al. 2003).",
        "In the following parts of the paper, classifying method and features is first introduced, and then comparisons are made between different type features and between feature combination methods.",
        "The comparisons are testified in experiments.",
        "The last part of the paper is about the conclusion of the present research and about the introduction of the further work to be done on this issue."
