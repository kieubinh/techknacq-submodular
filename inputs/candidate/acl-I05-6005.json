        "Recently, medical malpractice has become a serious social problem(Kohn, Corrlgan and Donaldson, 1999).",
        "The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has reported that nursing teams are most frequently involved in medical accidents in hospitals(Healthcare Safety Promotion Network Project, 2001).",
        "The Japanese Nursing Association also states in its guidelines that nurses are encouraged to make nursing reports and to analyze the cause of accidents, which is helpful to prevent their recurrence.",
        "However, it is very difficult for nurses to make a detailed record during their working hours.",
        "We have been developing a nursing service support system based on nurses using wearable computers.",
        "The system is designed to record nursing activities and to give warnings when necessary.",
        "We will analyze the collected data to analyze the sequence of their tasks and to quantify their workload for the purpose of preventing medical accidents.",
        "To create such a support system, we need to acquire in-depth knowledge of nursing activities closely.",
        "As a first step, we are collecting nurses’ dialogues in hospitals, building dialogue corpora, and analyzing the terms in the corpora used to carry out nursing work.",
        "We have already collected data on nursing tasks in a specific hospital by using special devices to record voice data.",
        "As a next step, we transcribed conversation recorded by the devices.",
        "Since then, we have been building dialogue corpora in actual work sites.",
        "The corpora include various conversations with doctors, nurses, patients, and so on.",
        "We generally exchange information, update information, and share knowledge by conversation.",
        "We believe that some medical accidents might occur due to miscommunication.",
        "That is, nurses typically exchange patients’ information during conversation in clinical meetings, while at the same time taking care of patients and other nursing activities.",
        "On the other hand, huge corpora have been",
        "built from various voice data and text data(Kyoto Text Corpus, ; K. Maekawa, 2003).",
        "Furthermore, many types of tags have been developed for effective using of huge corpora(H. Koiso et al., 2000; M Araki, et al., 1999).",
        "However, since the traditional dialogue corpora were mostly recorded on a trial basis, their topics were usually fixed in the corpora, and word usage and meaning of terms were only defined clearly in one of them.",
        "In the real field, word usage, topics, and the meaning of terms could not easily be fixed.",
        "Furthermore, the corpora have different features from those of the real field data.",
        "For example, actual conversations include many types of miscommunications, misunderstanding, a resolution of the misunderstanding, and so on.",
        "Consequently, corpora built from such actual conversations can be reflected by miscommunication or misunderstanding.",
        "Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the real field data by rules built from the traditional corpora.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the corpora of the voice data recorded by the special devices, and to analyze the voice data to understand nursing activities.",
        "For developing a nursing service support system, we checked the corpora and other information such as medical charts, describe features of the corpora and their availability."

        "It is said that insufficient knowledge and experience both influence the performance of medical professionals and causes malpractice.",
        "On the other hand, by promoting the use of wearable sensors and environment sensors, it is possible to collect a huge amount of data on actions in the real world.",
        "Accordingly, some attempts have been made to utilize knowledge obtained by analyzing daily actions in the course of developing sensors for education and accident prevention.",
        "If important information could be obtained by analyzing nursing activities automatically recorded by wearable computers, it would be possible to automatically and more correctly make nursing reports.",
        "Furthermore, if the nursing reports could be objectively analyzed, the cost of investigating nursing practices could be kept down and more effective survey research on nursing activities could be conducted.",
        "Furthermore, it would be possible to protect nurses from malpractice claims by distinguishing between nursing activities during normal situations and during emergencies.",

        "Wearable computers can collect various types of data such as location, pas-someter results, and posture inclination.",
        "In our previous research, we used passometer, location, and cue words to grasp nursing activities.",
        "We could understand the nursing activities of a particular nurse but could not understand the relations and information flow among staff in a hospital.",
        "Dialogues between nurses are very important in the performance of nursing activities and maintaining staff relations.",
        "Dialogues between nurses",
        "and other people, such as patients, doctors, and patients’ family, are also important for obtaining a variety of conversation behaviors more efficiently.",
        "We believe that we can understand not only nursing activities but also conversation mechanisms by developing and analysing corpora of nurses’ dialogues.",
        "Therefore, we have conducted experiments to collect voice data of nurses talking during their activities.",
        "Our reasons and aims for focusing on voice data are as follows:",
        "• To more effectively make lengthy recordings than sensors with consumer model IC recorders • To obtain many data, such as medical charts, in addition to voice data • To collect and unify terms of nursing activities for developing a support system • To collect natural dialogue data for clarification of conversation mechanisms and information flows • To examine the appropriate sensors for understanding voice data • To comprehend problems in actual field recording",
        "In the following section, features of voice data collected in experiments are explained in detail.",
        "During nurses’ shift changes, they hold clinical meetings to discuss patient information, in the process modifying and confirming this information.",
        "Furthermore, if problems occur in their work area, they hold brief conferences to solve the problems by discussing their experiences.",
        "We have recorded nurses dialogues in clinical meetings and brief conferences by using special devices.",
        "At the same time, we have obtained such information as who participated in the clinical meetings and brief conferences.",
        "In the hospital where we carried out our experiments, clinical meetings are held in the morning and the evening time for about 20 minutes to one hour.",
        "The brief conferences are held at lunch time for about 30 minutes.",
        "Collected data were 80 trials for a one-week experiment.",
        "The entire recording time was about 20 hours.",
        "We made transcriptions of the collected data.",
        "Some sample data are shown in table 11 The transcription was made by four staff members, including an experienced specialist in making transcriptions, a nurse who had worked in hospitals for three years or longer, a pharmacist, and a part-time employee, and it was assumed that the latter three had no experience working in the field of transcription.",
        "To understand nursing activities, a one-day schedule of nursing activities should be recorded and analyzed.",
        "However, it is difficult to transcribe all such recorded data.",
        "Therefore, we recorded the voice data of nursing activities along with clues annotated by nurses using the special devices.",
        "To obtain voice data in hospitals, we developed an IC-recorder, a microphone with an event button, and an intermediate control box with a buzzer.",
        "The event button is used for explicit voice annotation when nurses start or complete a task.",
        "When the button is pushed, the buzzer sounds once and its sound is recorded, and then nurses record their tasks at the moment by speaking short sentences.",
        "The buzzer is also set to sound periodically (every 10 minutes) to prompt nurses to make voice input about their ongoing tasks.",
        "Simple signal processing can extract and classify event-driven and periodic voice records, as well as nurse call rings.",
        "Event-driven voice data recording is very use",
        "ful for accurately recording nursing activities.",
        "In addition, this approach can record nursing activities at the desired time.",
        "As a result, time information can be easily observed, and we can collect objective data on nursing activities.",
        "Therefore, our approach improves the efficiency of research on time utilization.",
        "In one department of a hospital, we have conducted experiments on collecting data of nursing work through voice annotations.",
        "The nurses work in three shifts, assigned to primary patients of each ward.",
        "All nurses were given instructions on the usage of our devices.",
        "The entire recording time was about 500 hours.",
        "Collected data were gathered from 39 trials for a one-week experiment involving 15 nurses using our devices.",
        "We also made transcriptions of the collected data.",
        "Some sample transcriptions are shown in Table.2.",

        "• With patients, families of patients and nurses, formal and many words expressing medical terms in simple words.",

        "Information on patients should smoothly be transferred from one shift nurse to the next shift nurse.",
