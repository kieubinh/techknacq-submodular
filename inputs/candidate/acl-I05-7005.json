        "Systems computing semantic relatedness should allow to approximate human intuitions about lexical semantic relations existing between words.",
        "For example, given the words Glass, Mug and Jewel, we note that while Glass and Mug display a fairly close semantic relatedness, the relation between Glass and Jewel is less close according to human judgements.",
        "Numerous metrics were proposed to compute semantic similarity.",
        "However, as noted by Hirst & Budanitsky (2005) similarity is a special case of a more general notion, semantic relatedness, which encompasses additional lexical semantic relations, such as meronymy, antonymy, functional association and more.",
        "Also, relatedness is more often required by NLP applications than just similarity, e.g. in information retrieval.",
        "Therefore, we focus on semantic relatedness and apply information content metrics to this more general task.",
        "No extensive studies or large-scale evaluations of semantic relatedness algorithms for languages other than English have been conducted so far, to our knowledge.",
        "As a consequence, we know little about the applicability of semantic relatedness metrics to other languages.",
        "We study the performance of semantic relatedness metrics across several parameters.",
        "We touch upon methodological issues in computing semantic relatedness proper (as opposed to semantic similarity) as an NLP task - what is about the human performance, lower and upper bounds for evaluation?",
        "The next parameter is WordNet versus other x-Nets - can we expect the same performance with resources constructed following WordNet principles, but divergent in some design decisions and in the coverage?",
        "Departing from that, we check the applicability of the methods developed for English to other languages - is the performance of the methods language-specific or will it be similar for other natural languages?",
        "The remainder of the paper will be structured as follows: Section 2 presents the design of a German dataset with human semantic relatedness judgments, which is followed by a description of the information content based semantic relatedness metrics in Section 3.",
        "Then, our experiments on computing information content of GermaNet concepts and semantic relatedness of word senses are presented in Section 4.",
        "The results are compared with two baselines in Section 5 and are followed by conclusions and an outline of future work."

        "Human judgments of semantic relatedness provide a gold standard for evaluating the results of automatic methods.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement defines an upper bound for the evaluation of automatic methods (Resnik, 1995).",
        "The main issues while designing a dataset in our study are the following: the choice of lexical units comprising the word pairs to be evaluated, the number of word pairs and human subjects, defining semantic relatedness and the rating scale for human judgments.",
        "The choice of lexical units is challenging as there is no well-defined criterion for that.",
        "If we would choose e.g. 65 items randomly, we would run into the risk of getting an unbalanced dataset with skewed value distributions, potentially leading to unreliable evaluations at a later stage.",
        "Another option is to have a very large dataset chosen randomly.",
        "In this case it becomes problematic to have a large number of human judges rating them manually for semantic relatedness.",
        "Therefore, we decided to keep the word pairs from the psycholinguistic experiment by Rubenstein & Goodenough (1965) and translate them into German.",
        "Advantages of this are: our results can be related (although not directly compared) to the results for English based on that dataset, the number of word pairs in the dataset by Rubenstein and Goodenough, i.e. 65 is reasonably large to generalize.",
        "A disadvantage is that we also include only nouns in the evaluation of semantic relatedness.",
        "We asked 24 subjects (native speakers of German) to rate 65 word pairs on a scale from 0 to 4 for semantic relatedness.",
        "Semantic relatedness was defined in a broader sense than just similarity.",
        "To determine the upper bound of performance for automatic semantic relatedness algorithms, we computed a summarized correlation coefficient for a set of 24 judges.",
        "This is based on the interclass reliability analysis in statistics.",
        "To get the average, we computed the bivariate correlations for all judges pairwise and then pooled them using Fisher's z transformation, yielding z = 1.1266.",
        "This number is transformed back to a correlation coefficient, yielding r = .8098, which is statistically signifi cant.",
        "We observe that the correlation coefficient in our study, i.e. the upper bound for evaluating the system's performance on the relatedness task, is lower than what had been reported by Resnik (1995) for the similarity task, r = .8848.",
        "This is caused by relaxed rating criteria based on a broader definition of semantic relatedness.",
        "Though this leads to more diverse human judgments, they are reliable to serve as an evaluation dataset for computational methods."

        "Frequencies of concepts (synsets) in GermaNet were estimated using a German newspaper corpus taz (see www.taz.de).",
        "This corpus covers a wide variety of topics and has about 172 million tokens.",
        "The number of tokens representing nouns is 52,490,873.",
        "They correspond to 2,326,397 distinct word forms and 1,912,577 unique stems.",
        "We produced a part of speech (POS) tagged version of the corpus using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1997).",
        "Resnik (1995) counted each word (noun) in the corpus as an occurrence of each synset subsuming it in a conceptual hierarchy.",
        "However, applying this procedure to a German corpus poses a problem, as the words are highly inflected.",
        "This means that any inflected form of a word which does not coincide with a base form represented in GermaNet will be missed.",
        "We employed a German version of the Porter algorithm to stem both the word forms in word frequency lists and the GermaNet word senses.",
        "As a result of stemming, word frequency lists are transformed into stem frequency lists.",
        "The reduction of different word types to a single stem may influence the data undesirably.",
        "However, as the effect is marginal, it is unlikely to bias the results considerably and can so far be neglected.",
        "To solve the issue of stem disambiguation, a special preprocessing component would be required.",
        "GermaNet is a German wordnet which adopted the major properties and database technology from Princeton's WordNet.",
        "However, GermaNet displays some structural diffÃ©rencies and content oriented modifi cations.",
        "Its designers relied mainly on linguistic evidence rather than psycholinguistic motivations.",
        "Example of discrepancies between GermaNet and WordNet are e.g. that GermaNet employs artifi cial, i.e. non-lexicalized concepts, and adjectives are structured hierarchically as opposed to WordNet.",
        "Currently, GermaNet includes about 40000 synsets with more than 60000 word senses modelling nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "E.g., the entry for \"Brot\" (Engl.",
        "bread) looks as follows: Sense 1 Brot => Back-ware = > ?festes Nahrungsmittel => Nahrung, Nahrungsmittel, Essen, Speisen => Objekt.",
        "Based on the stemming process described above, we analyzed the GermaNet coverage of the newspaper corpus.",
        "The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 1, where \"+\" before a number corresponds to the attribute \"found\" and \"-\" means not found.",
        "We present the percentage of tokens and stems which could or could not be mapped to a GermaNet word sense, and the proportion of synsets that could be assigned an information content value.",
        "Striking about the numbers is the low coverage of stems.",
        "The coverage is significantly higher for tokens, especially for nouns and adjectives.",
        "We can explain this as follows: The main source of the stems not found in GermaNet are compounds, which is an extremely productive form of word composition in German, e.g. BeschÃ¤ftigungsverhÃ¤ltnis (Engl, employment relation), Informationsmarketing (Engl.",
        "marketing of information), Betriebssystemkenntnis (Engl, knowledge about operating systems).",
        "The most compounds are low frequent words in German, whereas non-compound words are frequent and are covered rather well by GermaNet.",
        "Nevertheless, considering that the vast part of synsets in GermaNet finally get an IC value assigned, the calculation of information content in general seems not to be affected heavily by this effect.",
        "Table 1 : GermaNet coverage of the corpus.",
        "Resnik (1995) defined the procedure to compute information content from word frequencies.",
        "However, as we showed, the formula has to be rewritten for stems in strongly inflected languages, such as German.",
        "The resulting scheme is given in Equation 4, where count(n) is a function which returns the sum of occurrences for a particular stem n, and stems(c) is the set of stems subsumed by a concept c. The mapping to GermaNet is implemented on the basis of a stem associated with a certain POS.",
        "On the other hand, stemmed string representations of word senses in GermaNet are associated with distinct part of speech, too.",
        "n^stems(c) The concept probabilities are then computed according to Resnik's original proposal as the relative frequency, s. Equation 5, where N is the total number of stems (equal to the total number of original words as stems are in fact \"pointing\" to them), which could be found in GermaNet.",
        "We applied Resnik's and Lin's metrics in a straightforward manner based on the information content values of GermaNet concepts computed as outlined above.",
        "The results are based on 57 out of 65 word pairs in the evaluation dataset as the rest were missing in GermaNet.",
        "They are summarized in terms of interclass correlation coeffi -cient, yielding rres = .7152 and run = .7337.",
        "As noted in Hirst & Budanitsky (2005), jcn returns semantic distance, rather than a similarity value.",
        "Its implementation poses several additional questions: (1) What is the distance of two word senses belonging to the same synset?",
        "(2) What is the distance of two word senses with no lowest common subsumer?",
        "(3) How to compute the distance between a hyperhym and its hyponym?",
        "(4) How to evaluate the distance scores as opposed to relatedness scores output by alternative metrics?",
        "(1) The distance from the word sense to itself is represented by zero.",
        "Therefore, we believe that the distance of two word senses belonging to the same synset should be nonzero.",
        "This number can be defined as the smallest (minimum) distance value given a specific concept hierarchy.",
        "In order to compute it, we adopt the proposal by Sid Patwardhan outlined in http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wn-similarity/message/8.",
        "We assign the minimum distance value (given the GermaNet hierarchy and a specific corpus as the basis of information content) to synonymous word senses (this value should approach 0).",
        "In doing that, we look for the concept with the lowest IC value in the corpus.",
        "Typically, this is the concept Object in GermaNet.",
        "The frequency count of this concept minus 1 models a very similar concept, which is not identical to the one under consideration.",
        "From this, we can compute the IC value of an artificial concept and obtain the lowest value of distance possible for GermaNet given our particular corpus.",
        "E.g. the distance between \"Edelstein\" (Engl.",
        "gem) and \"Juwel\" (Engl.",
        "Jewel) is set to 3.4787E-08 according to this.",
        "(2) Contrary to that, the distance of two word senses with no LCS should be assigned the maximum distance value distmax.",
        "We compute distmax according to Equation 2, where we assume that the two concepts compared are the ones with the highest IC in our data (17.3441) and their lowest common superclass is the one with the smallest IC value (.17) in our data.",
        "This maximizes the possible distance value und results in distmax = 34.348 for our data.",
        "(3) Another special case of semantic distance occurs, if a subclass, e.g. \"Forst\" (Engl, forest) is compared with a superclass, e.g. \"Wald\" (Engl.",
        "wood).",
        "Then, the distance becomes negative.",
        "We take the absolute value for distance, as the direction is not essential in this case.",
        "(4) Hirst & Budanitsky (2005) suggest evaluating by applying a correlation measure to distance values, whereas a negative correlation value is obtained (as distance is the opposite of similarity).",
        "Following this suggestion, we obtained the correlation r = â€“ .5292.",
        "We investigated this matter and noticed that the bad correlation coeffi cient is due to 16 (!)",
        "out of 57 word pairs in our data, which do not have a lowest common superclass.",
        "According to the jcn algorithm, we assign distmax = 34.348 to them.",
        "The next highest value of semantic distance is 21.97, and the distribution of scores is skewed.",
        "Pedersen et al.",
        "(2004) convert semantic distance into similarity by taking the reciprocal of semantic distance simcijC2 = \\/diatcifi2.",
        "This changes the correlation to a positive number.",
        "However, the transformation is not linear and thus affects the distribution of scores, yielding a worse correlation coefficient on our data of r = .2915.",
        "In order to minimize the role of extremely small and extremely large numbers in the distance values, which skew the distribution of scores, we need a special normalization function.",
        "This function should map the scores to the range from 0 to 1, with small numbers for little and large numbers for high semantic relatedness.",
        "We define the normalization function given in Equation 6 using the hyperbolic tangent function: where distc\\fi2 is a distance score for a pair of concepts and c is a special constant.",
        "This constant can be determined by solving Equation 6, which results in Equation 7.",
        "In this transformation, we assume that distavg is the distance value of a word pair with an average human semantic relatedness score in a given dataset (5.2 for our data): This value should be mapped to simclC2 â€“ .5 in our application.",
        "Given this: The correlation coefficient for jcn is r = â€“ .5292 if no normalization is performed and r = .7379 if the scores are normalized as described above."
