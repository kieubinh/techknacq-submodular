        "Case structure (predicate-argument structure or logical form) represents what arguments are related to a predicate, and forms a basic unit for conveying the meaning of natural language text.",
        "Identifying such case structure plays an important role in natural language understanding.",
        "In English, syntactic case structure can be mostly derived from word order.",
        "For example, the left argument of the predicate is the subject, and the right argument of the predicate is the object in most cases.",
        "Blaheta and Charniak proposed a statistical method",
        "for analyzing function tags in Penn Treebank, and achieved a really high accuracy of 95.7% for syntactic roles, such as SBJ (subject) and DTV (dative) (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000).",
        "In recent years, there have been many studies on semantic structure analysis (semantic role labeling) based on PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "These studies classify syntactic roles into semantic ones such as agent, experiencer and instrument.",
        "Case structure analysis of Japanese is very different from that of English.",
        "In Japanese, postpositions are used to mark cases.",
        "Frequently used postpositions are “ga”, “wo” and “ni”, which usually mean nominative, accusative and dative.",
        "However, when an argument is followed by the topic-marking post-position “wa”, its case marker is hidden.",
        "In addi tion, case-marking postpositions are often omitted in Japanese.",
        "These troublesome characteristics make Japanese case structure analysis very difficult.",
        "To address these problems and realize Japanese case structure analysis, wide-coverage case frames are required.",
        "For example, let us describe how to apply case structure analysis to the following sentence: bentou-wa taberu lunchbox-TM eat (eat lunchbox) In this sentence, taberu (eat) is a verb, and bentou-wa (lunchbox-TM) is a case component (i.e. argument) of taberu.",
        "The case marker of “bentou-wa” is hidden by the topic marker (TM) “wa”.",
        "The analyzer matches “bentou” (lunchbox) with the most",
        "pressed only in English for space limitation.).",
        "examples person, child, boy, • • • lunch, lunchbox, dinner, • • • Since “bentou” (lunchbox) is included in “wo” examples, its case is analyzed as “wo”.",
        "As a result, we obtain the case structure “ φ:ga bentou:wo taberu”, which means that “ga” (nominative) argument is omitted, and “wo” (accusative) argument is “bentou” (lunchbox).",
        "In this paper, we run such case structure analysis based on example-based case frames that are constructed from a huge raw corpus in an unsupervised manner.",
        "Let us consider syntactic analysis, into which our method of case structure analysis is integrated.",
        "Recently, many accurate statistical parsers have been proposed (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for English, (Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) for Japanese).",
        "Since they somehow use lexical information in the tagged corpus, they are called “lexicalized parsers”.",
        "On the other hand, un-lexicalized parsers achieved an almost equivalent accuracy to such lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).",
        "Accordingly, we can say that the state-of-the-art lexicalized parsers are mainly based on unlexical (grammatical) information due to the sparse data problem.",
        "Bikel also indicated that Collins’ parser can use bilexical dependencies only 1.49% of the time; the rest of the time, it backs off to condition one word on just phrasal and part-of-speech categories (Bikel, 2004).",
        "This paper aims at exploiting much more lexical information, and proposes a fully-lexicalized probabilistic model for Japanese syntactic and case structure analysis.",
        "Lexical information is extracted not from a small tagged corpus, but from a huge raw corpus as case frames.",
        "This model performs case structure analysis by a generative probabilistic model based on the case frames, and selects the syntactic structure that has the highest case structure probability."

        "A large corpus is automatically parsed, and case frames are constructed from modifier-head examples in the resulting parses.",
        "The problems of automatic case frame construction are syntactic and semantic ambiguities.",
        "That is to say, the parsing results inevitably contain errors, and verb senses are intrinsically ambiguous.",
        "To cope with these problems, case frames are gradually constructed from reliable modifier-head examples.",
        "First, modifier-head examples that have no syntactic ambiguity are extracted, and they are disambiguated by a couple of a verb and its closest case component.",
        "Such couples are explicitly expressed on the surface of text, and can be considered to play an important role in sentence meanings.",
        "For instance, examples are distinguished not by verbs (e.g., “tsumu” (load/accumulate)), but by couples (e.g., “nimotsu-wo tsumu” (load baggage) and “keiken-wo tsumu” (accumulate experience)).",
        "Modifier-head examples are aggregated in this way, and yield basic case frames.",
        "Thereafter, the basic case frames are clustered to merge similar case frames.",
        "For example, since “nimotsu-wo tsumu” (load baggage) and “busshi-wo tsumu” (load supply) are similar, they are clustered.",
        "The similarity is measured using a thesaurus (Ike-hara et al., 1997).",

        "For example, consider the sentence in Figure 1.",
        "There are two possible dependency structures, and for each structure the product of probabilities indicated below of the tree is calculated.",
        "Finally, the model chooses the highest-probability structure (in this case the left one).",
        "Ci is decomposed into its predicate type fi (including the predicate’s inflection) and the rest case structure C5i.",
