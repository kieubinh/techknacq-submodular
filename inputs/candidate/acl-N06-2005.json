        "Large vocabulary speech recognition systems traditionally use phonemes as sub-word units.",
        "This requires a pronunciation dictionary, which maps the orthographic representation of words into a sequence of phonemes.",
        "The generation of such a dictionary is both time consuming and expensive since it often requires linguistic knowledge of the target language.",
        "Several approaches to automatic dictionary generation have been introduced in the past with varying degrees of success (Besling, 1994; Black et al., 1998).",
        "Nevertheless, these methods still require post editing by a human expert or using another manually generated pronunciation dictionary.",
        "As a solution to this problem, grapheme-based speech recognition (GBSR) has been proposed recently (Kanthak and Ney, 2002).",
        "Here, instead of phonemes, graphemes – orthographic representation of a word – are used as the sub word units.",
        "This makes the generation of the pronunciation dictionary a trivial task.",
        "GBSR systems have been successfully applied to several European languages (Killer et al., 2003).",
        "However, because of the generally looser relation of graphemes to pronunciation than phonemes, the use of context dependent modeling techniques and the sharing of parameters across different models are of central importance.",
        "The variations in the pronunciation of phonemes in different contexts are usually handled by clustering the similar contexts together.",
        "In the traditional approach, decision trees are used to cluster poly-phones – a phoneme in a specific context – together.",
        "Due to computational and memory constraints, individual trees are grown for each sub-state of each phoneme.",
        "This does not allow the sharing of parameters across polyphones with different center phonemes.",
        "Enhanced tree clustering (Yu and Schultz, 2003) lifts this constraint by growing trees which cover multiple phonemes.",
        "In this paper we present our experiments on applying grapheme-based speech recognition for Thai language.",
        "We compare the performance of the grapheme-based system with two phoneme-based systems, one using a hand-crafter dictionary, and the other using an automatically generated diction",

        "In the grapheme-based approach, the pronunciation dictionary is constructed by splitting a word into its constituent letters.",
        "Previous experiments have shown that the quality of the grapheme-based recognizer is highly dependent on the nature of the grapheme-to-phoneme relation of a specific language (Killer, 2003).",
        "In this section we have a closer look at the grapheme-to-phoneme relation in Thai.",
        "Thai, an alphabetical language, has 44 letters for 21 consonant sounds, 19 letters for 24 vowel sounds (9 short vowels, 9 long vowels and 6 diphthongs), 4 letters for tone markers (5 tones), few special letters, and numerals.",
        "There are some characteristics of Thai writing that can cause problems for GBSR:",
        "• Some vowel letters can appear before, after, above or below a consonant letter.",
        "e.g.",
        "In the word “ ” (/mae:w/), the vowel “ ” (/ae:/) appears before the consonant “ ” (/m/).",
        "• Some vowel and consonant letters can be combined together to make a new vowel.",
        "e.g.",
        "In the word “ ” /mua/, the vowel “ua” is composed of a vowel letter “ ” and a consonant letter “✄ ”.",
        "• Some vowels are represented by more than one vowel letter For example, the vowel /ae/ requires two vowel letters: “ ” and “ ”.",
        "To make a syllable, a consonant is inserted in between the two vowel letters.",
        "e.g. “ ” (/lae/).",
        "The consonant “ ” (/l/) is in the middle.",
        "• In some syllables, vowels letters are not explicitly written.",
        "e.g.",
        "The word “ ” (/yok/) consists of two consonant letter, “ ” (/y/) and “ ” (/k/).",
        "There is no letter to represent the vowel /o/.",
        "• The special letter “ ”, called Karan, is a deletion marker.",
        "If it appears above a consonant, that consonant will be ignored.",
        "Sometimes, it can also delete the immediately preceding consonant or the whole syllable.",
        "To make the relationship between graphemes and phonemes in Thai as close as possible we apply two preprocess steps:",
        "• Reordering of graphemes when a vowel comes before a consonant.",
        "• Merging multiple letters representing a single phoneme into one symbol.",
        "We use simple heuristic rules for this purpose; 10 rules for reordering and 15 for merging.",
        "In our initial experiments, reordering alone gave better results than reordering plus merging.",
        "Hence, we only used reordering rules for the rest of the experiments."
