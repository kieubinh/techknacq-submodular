        "The emergence of large collections of digitized spoken data has encouraged research in speech retrieval.",
        "Previous studies, notably those at TREC (Garafolo et al., 2000), have focused mainly on well-structured news documents.",
        "In this paper we report on work carried out for the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2005 Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) track (White et al., 2005).",
        "The document collection for the CL-SR task is a part of the oral testimonies collected by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education (VHI) for which some Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions are available (Oard et al., 2004).",
        "The data is conversional spontaneous speech lacking clear topic boundaries; it is thus a more challenging speech retrieval task than those explored previously.",
        "The CLEF data is also annotated with a range of automatic and manually",
        "generated sets of metadata.",
        "While the complete VHI dataset contains interviews in many languages, the CLEF 2005 CL-SR task focuses on English speech.",
        "Cross-language searching is evaluated by making the topic statements (from which queries are automatically formed) available in several languages.",
        "This task raises many interesting research questions; in this paper we explore alternative term weighting methods and content indexing strategies.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews details of the CLEF 2005 CL-SR task; Section 3 describes the system we used to investigate this task; Section 4 reports our experimental results; and Section 5 gives conclusions and details for our ongoing work."

        "The CLEF-2005 CL-SR collection includes 8,104 manually-determined topically-coherent segments from 272 interviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses and rescuers, totaling 589 hours of speech.",
        "Two ASR transcripts are available for this data, in this work we use transcripts provided by IBM Research in 2004 for which a mean word error rate of 38% was computed on held out data.",
        "Additional, metadata fields for each segment include: two sets of 20 automatically assigned thesaurus terms from different kNN classifiers (AK1 and AK2), an average of 5 manually-assigned thesaurus terms (MK), and a 3-sentence summary written by a subject matter expert.",
        "A set of 38 training topics and 25 test topics were generated in English from actual user requests.",
        "Topics were structured as Title, Description and Narrative fields, which correspond roughly to a 2-3 word Web query, what someone might first say to a librarian, and what that librarian might ultimately understand after a brief reference interview.",
        "To support CL-SR experiments the topics were re-expressed in Czech, German, French, and Spanish by native speakers in a manner reflecting",
        "the way questions would be posed in those languages.",

        "Their output was merged in order to allow for variety in lexical choices.",
        "All the translations of a topic Title field were combined in a merged Title field of the translated topics; the same procedure was adopted for the Description and Narrative fields.",
        "Czech language topics were translated using InterTrans, the only web-based MT system available to us for this language pair.",
        "Retrieval was carried out using the SMART IR system (Buckley et al., 1993) applying its standard stop word list and stemming algorithm.",
        "In system development using the training topics we tested SMART with many different term weighting schemes combining collection frequency, document frequency and length normalization for the indexed collection and topics (Salton and Buckley, 1988).",
        "In this paper we employ the notation used in SMART to describe the combined schemes: xxx.xxx.",
        "The first three characters refer to the weighting scheme used to index the document collection and the last three characters refer to the weighting scheme used to index the topic fields.",
        "For example, lpc.atc means that lpc was used for documents and atc for queries.",
        "lpc would apply log term frequency weighting (l) and probabilistic collection frequency weighting (p) with cosine normalization to the document collection (c).",
        "atc would apply augmented normalized term frequency (a), inverse document frequency weight (t) with cosine normalization (c).",
        "One scheme in particular (mpc.ntn) proved to have much better performance than other combinations.",
        "For weighting document terms we used term frequency normalized by the maximum value (m) and probabilistic collection frequency weighting (p) with cosine normalization (c).",
        "For topics we used non-normalized term frequency (n) and inverse document frequency weighting (t) without vector normalization (n).",
        "This combination worked very well when all the fields of the query were used; it also worked well with Title plus Description, but slightly less well with the Title field alone."

        "The CLEF 2005 CL-SR collection is quite small by IR standards, and it is well known that collection size matters when selecting term weighting schemes (Salton and Buckley, 1988).",
        "Moreover, the documents in this case are relatively short, averaging about 500 words (about 4 minutes of speech), and that factor may affect the optimal choice of weighting schemes as well.",
        "We therefore used the training topics to explore the space of available SMART term weighting schemes.",
        "Table 1 presents results for various weighting schemes with English topics.",
        "There are 3,600 possible combinations of weighting schemes available: 60 schemes (5 x 4 x 3) for documents and 60 for queries.",
        "We tested a total of 240 combinations.",
        "In Table 1 we present the results for 15 combinations (the best ones, plus some others to illustate the diversity of the results).",
        "mpc.ntn is still the best for the test topic set; but, as shown, a few other weighting schemes achieve similar performance.",
        "Some of the weighting schemes perform better when indexing all the topic fields (TDN), some on TD, and some on title only (T).",
        "npn.ntn was best for TD and lsn.ntn and lsn.atn are best for T. The mpc.ntn weighting scheme is used for all other experiments in this section.",

        "We believe that this results from our use of the 38 training topics to find a term weighting scheme that is particularly suitable for this collection.",
        "Relevance judgments are typically not available for training until the second year of an IR evaluation; using a search-guided process that does not require system results to be available before judgments can be performed made it possible to accelerate that timetable in this case.",
        "Table 2 shows that performance varies markedly with the choice of weighting scheme.",
        "Indeed, some of the classic weighting schemes yielded much poorer results than the one we ultimately selected.",
        "In this paper we presented results on the test queries, but we observed similar effects on the training queries.",
        "On combined manual and automatic data, the best MAP score we obtained for English topics is 0.4647.",
        "On automatic data, the best MAP is 0.2176.",
        "This difference could result from ASR errors or from terms added by human indexers that were not available to the ASR system to be recognized.",
        "In future work we plan to investigate methods of removing or correcting some of the speech recognition errors in the ASR transcripts using semantic coherence measures.",
        "In ongoing further work we are exploring the relationship between properties of the collection and the weighting schemes in order to better understand the underlying reasons for the demonstrated effectiveness of the mpc.ntn weighting scheme.",
        "The challenges of CLEF CL-SR task will continue to expand in subsequent years as new collections are introduced (e.g., Czech interviews in 2006).",
        "Because manually assigned segment boundaries are available only for English interviews, this will yield an unknown topic boundary condition that is similar to previous experiments with automatically transcribed broadcast news the Text Retrieval Conference (Garafolo et al., 2000), but with the additional caveat that topic boundaries are not known for the ground truth relevance judgments."
