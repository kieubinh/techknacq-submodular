        "Experimental results show that by using the proposed subset selection scheme we can get significant performance improvement in both Word Error Rate (WER) and Perplexity (PPL) over the models built from the entire web-corpus by using just 10% of the data.",
        "In addition incremental data selection enables us to achieve significant reduction in the vocabulary size as well as number of n-grams in the adapted language model.",
        "To demonstrate the gains from our method we provide a comparative analysis with a number of methods proposed in recent language modeling literature for cleaning up text."

        "One of the main challenges in the rapid deployment of NLP applications is the lack of in-domain data required for training statistical models.",
        "Language models, especially n-gram based, are key components of most NLP applications, such as speech recognition and machine translation, where they serve as priors in the decoding process.",
        "To estimate a n-gram language model we require examples of in-domain transcribed utterances, which in absence of readily available relevant corpora have to be collected manually.",
        "This poses severe constraints in terms of both system turnaround time and cost.",
        "This led to a growing interest in using the World Wide Web (WWW) as a corpus for NLP (Lapata, 2005; Resnik and Smith, 2003).",
        "The web can serve as a good resource for automatically gathering data for building task-specific language models.",
        "Web-pages of interest can be identified by generating query terms either manually or automatically from an initial set of in-domain sentences by measures such as TFIDF or Relative Entropy (R.E).",
        "These webpages can then be converted to a text corpus (which we will refer to as web-data) by appropriate preprocessing.",
        "However text gathered from the web will rarely fit the demands or the nature of the domain of interest completely.",
        "Even with the best queries and web crawling schemes, both the style and content of the web-data will usually differ significantly from the specific needs.",
        "For example, a speech recognition system requires conversational style text whereas most of the data on the web is literary.",
        "The mismatch between in-domain data and web-data can be seen as a semi-supervised learning problem.",
        "We can model the web-data as a mix of sentences from two classes: in-domain (I) and noise (N) (or out-of-domain).",
        "The labels I and N are latent and unknown for the sentences in web-data but we usually have a small number of examples of in-domain examples I.",
        "Selecting the right labels for the unlabeled set is important for benefiting from it.",
        "Recent research on semi-supervised learning shows that in many cases (Nigam et al., 2000; Zhu, 2005) poor preprocessing of unlabeled data might actually lower the performance of classifiers.",
        "We found similar results in our language modeling experiments where the presence of a large set of noisy N examples in training actually lowers the performance slightly in both perplexity and WER terms.",
        "Recent literature on building language models from text acquired from the web addresses this issue partly by using various rank-and-select schemes for identifying the set I (Ostendorf et al., 2005; Sethy, 2005; Sarikaya, 2005).",
        "However we believe that similar to the question of balance (Zhu, 2005) in semi-supervised learning for classification, we need to address the question of distributional similarity while selecting the appropriate utterances for building a language model from noisy data.",
        "The subset of sentences from web-data which are selected to build the adaptation language should have a distribution similar to the in-domain data model.",
        "To address the issue of distributional similarity we present an incremental algorithm which compares the distribution of the selected set and the in-domain examples by using a relative entropy (R.E) criterion.",
        "We will review in section 2 some of the ranking schemes which provide baselines for performance comparison and in section 3 we describe the proposed algorithm.",
        "Experimental results are provided in section 4, before we conclude with a summary of this work and directions for the future."

        "The central idea behind text cleanup schemes in recent literature, on using web-data for language modeling, is to use a scoring function that measures the similarity of each observed sentence in the web-data to the in-domain set and assigns an appropriate score.",
        "The subsequent step is to set a threshold in terms of either the minimum score or the number of top scoring sentences.",
        "The threshold can usually be fixed using a heldout set.",
        "Ostendorf (2005) use perplexity from an in-domain n-gram language model as a scoring function.",
        "More recently, a modified version of the BLEU metric which measures sentence similarity in machine translation has been proposed by Sarikaya (2005) as a scoring function.",
        "Instead of explicit ranking and thresholding it is also possible to design a classifier in a learning from positive and unlabeled examples framework (LPU) (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "In this system, a subset of the unlabeled set is selected as the negative or the noise set N. A two class classifier is then trained using the in-domain set and the negative set.",
        "The classifier is then used to label the sentences in the web-data.",
        "The classifier can then be iteratively refined by using a better and larger subset of the I/N sentences selected in each iteration.",
        "Rank ordering schemes do not address the issue of distributional similarity and select many sentences which already have a high probability in the in-domain text.",
        "Adapting models on such data has the tendency to skew the distribution even further towards the center.",
        "For example, in our doctor-patient interaction task short sentences containing the word ‘okay’ such as ‘okay’,‘yes okay’, ‘okay okay’ were very frequent in the in-domain data.",
        "Perplexity or other similarity measures give a high score to all such examples in the web-data boosting the probability of these words even further while other pertinent sentences unseen in the in-domain data such as ‘Can you stand up please?’ are ranked low and get rejected."

        "To address the issue of distributional similarity we developed an incremental greedy selection scheme based on relative entropy which selects a sentence if adding it to the already selected set of sentences reduces the relative entropy with respect to the in-domain data distribution.",
        "Let us denote the language model built from in-domain data as P and let Pilit be a language model for initialization purposes which we estimate by bagging samples from the same in-domain data.",
        "To describe our algorithm we will employ the paradigm of unigram probabilities though the method generalizes to higher n-grams also.",
        "Let W (i) be a initial set of counts for the words i in the vocabulary V initialized using Pilit.",
        "We denote the count of word i in the jth sentence sd of web-data with mid.",
        "Let nd = Ei mid be the number of words in the sentence and N = Ei W (i) be",
        "the total number of words already selected.",
        "The relative entropy of the maximum likelihood estimate of the language model of the selected sentences to the initial model P is given by",
        "Direct computation of R.E using the above expressions for every sentence in the web-data will have a very high computational cost since O(V) computations per sentence in the web-data are required.",
        "However given the fact that mid is sparse, we can split the summation H(j) into",
        "Intuitively, the term T1 measures the decrease in probability mass because of adding nd words more to the corpus and the term T2 measures the in-domain distribution P weighted improvement in probability for words with non-zero mid.",
        "For the R.E to decrease with selection of sentence sd we require T1 < T2.",
        "To make the selection more refined we can impose a condition T1 + thr (j) < T2 where thr (j) is a function of j.",
        "A good choice for thr (j) based on empirical study is a function that declines at the same rate as the ratio ln (N+n� ) N � nd/N Pz� 1/kj where k is the average number of words for every sentence.",
        "The proposed algorithm is sequential and greedy in nature and can benefit from randomization of the order in which it scans the corpus.",
        "We generate permutes of the corpus by scanning through the corpus and randomly swapping sentences.",
        "Next we do sequential selection on each permutation and merge the selected sets.",
        "The choice of using maximum likelihood estimation for estimating the intermediate language models for W (j) is motivated by the simplification in the entropy calculation which reduces the order from O(V) to O(k).",
        "However, maximum likelihood estimation of language models is poor when compared to smoothing based estimation.",
        "To balance the computation cost and estimation accuracy, we modify the counts W (j) using Kneser-Ney smoothing periodically after fixed number of sentences."
