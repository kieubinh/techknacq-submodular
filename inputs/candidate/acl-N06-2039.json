        "The creation of the Arabic Treebank (ATB) facilitates corpus based studies of many interesting linguistic phenomena in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).1 The ATB comprises manually annotated morphological and syntactic analyses of newswire text from different Arabic sources.",
        "We exploit the ATB for the novel task of automatically creating lexical semantic verb classes for MSA.",
        "We are interested in the problem of classifying verbs in MSA into groups that share semantic elements of meaning as they exhibit similar syntactic behavior.",
        "This",
        "manner of classifying verbs in a language is mainly advocated by Levin (1993).",
        "The Levin Hypothesis (LH) contends that verbs that exhibit similar syntactic behavior share element(s) of meaning.",
        "There exists a relatively extensive classification of English verbs according to different syntactic alternations, and numerous linguistic studies of other languages illustrate that LH holds cross linguistically, in spite of variations in the verb class assignment (Guerssel et al., 1985).",
        "For MSA, the only test of LH has been the work of Mahmoud (1991), arguing for Middle and Unac-cusative alternations in Arabic.",
        "To date, no general study of MSA verbs and alternations exists.",
        "We address this problem by automatically inducing such classes, exploiting explicit syntactic and morphological information in the ATB.",
        "Inducing such classes automatically allows for a large-scale study of different linguistic phenomena within the MSA verb system, as well as cross-linguistic comparison with their English counterparts.",
        "Moreover, drawing on generalizations yielded by such a classification could potentially be useful in several NLP problems such as Information Extraction, Event Detection, Information Retrieval and Word Sense Disambiguation, not to mention the facilitation of lexical resource creation such as MSA WordNets and ontologies."

        "This feature is of particular scientific interest because it is unique to the Semitic languages, and has an interesting potential correlation with argument structure.",
        "Subject animacy In an attempt to allow the clustering algorithm to use information closer to actual argument structure than mere syntactic frames, we add a feature that indicates whether a verb requires an animate subject.",
        "Following a technique suggested by Merlo and Stevenson, we take advantage of this tendency by adding a feature that is the number of times each verb occurs with each NP types as subject, including when the subject is pronominal or pro-dropped."

        "The effects of SUBJAnimacy, VerbPatt, and FRAME4 are not significantly different from using FRAME1 alone as a baseline, which indicates that these features do not independently contribute to improve clustering, i.e. FRAME1 implicitly encodes the information in VerbPatt and SUBJAnimacy.",

        "with soft clustering being better than hard clustering, while controlling for other factors.",
        "Among the control factors, verb number is significant (p < .001), with 125 verbs being better than both 276 and 407 verbs.",
        "The number of clusters is also significant (p < .001), with more clusters being better than fewer.",
        "As evident from the results of the statistical analysis, the various informational factors have an interesting effect on the quality of the clusters.",
        "Including lexical head information in the frames significantly improves clustering, confirming the intuition that such information is a necessary part of the alternations that define verb classes.",
        "However, as long as head information is included, configurational information about the frames does not appear to help the clustering, i.e. ordering of constituents is not significant.",
        "It seems that rich Arabic morphology plays a role in rendering order insignificant.",
        "Nonetheless, this is an interesting result from a linguistic perspective that begs further investigation.",
        "Also interesting is the fact that SUBJAnimacy and the VerbPatt do not help improve clustering.",
        "The non-significance of SUBJAnimacy is indeed surprising, given its significant impact on English clusterings.",
        "Perhaps the cues utilized in our study require more fine tuning.",
        "The lack of significance of the pattern information could indicate that the role played by the patterns is already encoded in the subcategorization frame, therefore pattern information is superfluous.",
        "The score of the best parameter settings with respect to the baseline is considerable given the novelty of the task and lack of good quality resources for evaluation.",
        "Moreover, there is no reason to expect that there would be perfect alignment between the Arabic clusters and the corresponding translated Levin clusters, primarily because of the quality of the translation, but also because there is unlikely to be an isomorphism between English and Arabic lexical semantics, as assumed here as a means of approximating the problem.",
        "In an attempt at a qualitative analysis of the resulting clusters, we manually examine several HYP clusters.",
        "As an example, one includes the verbs >aloqaY [meet], $ahid [view], >ajoraY [run an interview], {isotaqobal [receive a guest], Eaqad [hold a conference], >aSodar [issue].",
        "We note that they all share the concept of convening, or formal meetings.",
        "The verbs are clearly related in terms of their event structure (they are all activities, without an associated change of state) yet are not semantically similar.",
        "Therefore, our clustering approach yields a classification that is on par with the Levin classes in the coarseness of the cluster membership granularity.",
        "In summary, we observe very interesting clusters of verbs which indeed require more in depth lexical semantic study as MSA verbs in their own right."
