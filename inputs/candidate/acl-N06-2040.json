        "Dialog agents have been developed for a variety of navigation domains such as in-car driving directions (Dale et al., 2003), tourist information portals (Johnston et al., 2002) and pedestrian navigation (Muller, 2002).",
        "In all these applications, the human partner receives navigation instructions from a system.",
        "For these domains, contextual features of the physical setting must be taken into account for the agent to communicate successfully.",
        "In dialog systems, one misunderstanding can often lead to additional errors (Moratz and Tenbrink, 2003), so the system must strategically choose instructions and referring expressions that can be clearly understood by the user.",
        "Human cognition studies have found that the in front of/behind axis is easier to perceive than other relations (Bryant et al., 1992).",
        "In navigation tasks, this suggests that describing an object when it is in front of the follower is preferable to using other spatial relations.",
        "Studies on direction-giving language have found that speakers interleave repositioning commands (e.g. “Turn right 90 degrees”) designating objects of interest (e.g. “See that chair?”) and action commands (e.g. “Keep going”)(Tversky and Lee, 1999).",
        "The content planner of a spoken dialog system must decide which of these dialog moves to produce at each turn.",
        "A route plan is a linked list of arcs between nodes representing locations and decision-points in the world.",
        "A direction-giving agent must perform several content-planning and surface realization steps, one of which is to decide how much of the route to describe to the user at once (Dale et al., 2003).",
        "Thus, the system selects the next target destination and must describe it to the user.",
        "In an interactive system, the generation agent must not only decide what to say to the user but also when to say it."

        "Although the spatial details will vary for other spoken dialog domains, the process developed in this study for producing description dialog moves only at the appropriate times should be relevant for spoken dialog agents operating in other navigation domains.",
        "Building dialog agents for situated tasks provides a wealth of opportunity to study the interaction between context and linguistic behavior.",
        "In the future, the generation procedure for our interactive agent will be further developed in areas such as spatial descriptions and surface realization.",
