        "Spontaneous conversations are a very important type of speech data.",
        "Distilling important information from them has commercial and other importance.",
        "Compared with broadcast news, which has received the most intensive studies (Hori and Furui, 2003; Christensen et al.",
        "2004; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005), spontaneous conversations have been less addressed in the literature.",
        "Spontaneous conversations are different from broadcast news in several aspects: (1) spontaneous conversations are often less well formed linguistically, e.g., containing more speech disfluencies and false starts; (2) the distribution of important utterances in spontaneous conversations could be different from that in broadcast news, e.g., the beginning part of news often contains important information, but in conversations, information may be more evenly distributed; (3) conversations often contain discourse clues, e.g., question-answer pairs and speakers’ information, which can be utilized to keep the summary coherent; (4) word error rates (WERs) from speech recognition are usually much higher in spontaneous conversations.",
        "Previous work on spontaneous-conversation summarization has mainly focused on textual features (Zechner, 2001; Gurevych and Strube, 2004), while speech-related features have not been explored for this type of speech source.",
        "This paper explores and compares the effectiveness of both textual features and speech-related features.",
        "The experiments show that these features incrementally improve summarization performance.",
        "We also discuss problems (1) and (2) mentioned above.",
        "For (1), Zechner (2001) proposes to detect and remove false starts and speech disfluencies from transcripts, in order to make the text-format summary concise and more readable.",
        "Nevertheless, it is not always necessary to remove them.",
        "One reason is that original utterances are often more desired to ensure comprehensibility and naturalness if the summaries are to be delivered as excerpts of audio (see section 2), in order to avoid the impact of WER.",
        "Second, disfluencies are not necessarily noise; instead, they show regularities in a number of dimensions (Shriberg, 1994), and correlate with many factors including topic difficulty (Bortfeld et al., 2001).",
        "Rather than removing them, we explore the effects of disfluencies on summarization, which, to our knowledge, has not yet been addressed in the literature.",
        "Our experiments show that they improve summarization performance.",
        "To discuss problem (2), we explore and compare both textual features and speech-related features, as they are explored in broadcast news (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005).",
        "The experiments show that the structural feature (e.g. utterance position) is less effective for summarizing spontaneous conversations than it is in broadcast news.",
        "MMR",
        "and lexical features are the best.",
        "Speech-related features follow.",
        "The structural feature is least effective.",
        "We do not discuss problem (3) and (4) in this paper.",
        "For problem (3), a similar idea has been proposed to summarize online blogs and discussions.",
        "Problem (4) has been partially addressed by (Zechner & Waibel, 2000); but it has not been studied together with acoustic features.",
        "2 Utterance-extraction-based summarization Still at its early stage, current research on speech summarization targets a less ambitious goal: conducting extractive, single-document, generic, and surface-level-feature-based summarization.",
        "The pieces to be extracted could correspond to words (Koumpis, 2002; Hori and Furui, 2003).",
        "The extracts could be utterances, too.",
        "Utterance selection is useful.",
        "First, it could be a preliminary stage applied before word extraction, as proposed by Kikuchi et al.",
        "(2003) in their two-stage summarizer.",
        "Second, with utterance-level extracts, one can play the corresponding audio to users, as with the speech-to-speech summarizer discussed in Furui et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The advantage of outputting audio segments rather than transcripts is that it avoids the impact of WERs caused by automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
        "We will focus on utterance-level extraction, which at present appears to be the only way to ensure comprehensibility and naturalness if the summaries are to be delivered as excerpts of audio themselves.",
        "Previous work on spontaneous conversations mainly focuses on using textual features.",
        "Gurevych & Strube (2004) develop a shallow knowledge-based approach.",
        "The noun portion of WordNet is used as a knowledge source.",
        "The noun senses were manually disambiguated rather than automatically.",

        "The effectiveness of the structural feature is less significant than it is in broadcast news.",
        "According to the ROC curves presented in Christensen et al.",
        "(2004), the structural feature (utterance position) is one of the best features for summarizing read news stories, and is less effective when news stories contain spontaneous speech.",
        "Both their ROC curves cover larger area than the structural feature here in figure 1, that is, the structure feature is less effective for summarizing spontaneous conversation than it is in broadcast news.",
        "This reflects, to some extent, that",
        "information is more evenly distributed in spontaneous conversations.",
        "Now let us turn to the role of speech disfluencies, which are very common in spontaneous conversations.",
        "Previous work detects and removes disfluencies as noise.",
        "Indeed, disfluencies show regularities in a number of dimensions (Shriberg, 1994).",
        "They correlate with many factors including the topic difficulty (Bortfeld et al., 2001).",
        "Tables 1 4 above show that they improve summarization performance when added upon other features.",
        "Figure-1 shows that when used individually, they are better than the structural feature, and also better than acoustic features at the left 1/3 part of the figure, where the summary contains relatively fewer utterances.",
        "Disfluencies, e.g., pauses, are often inserted when speakers have word-searching problem, e.g., a problem finding topic-specific keywords: Speaker A: with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere.",
        "The above example is taken from a conversation that discusses pollution.",
        "The speaker inserts a filled pause uh in front of the word sulfur.",
        "Pauses are not randomly inserted.",
        "To show this, we remove them from transcripts.",
        "Section-2 of SWITCHBOARD (about 870 dialogues and 189,000 utterances) is used for this experiment.",
        "Then we insert these pauses back randomly, or insert them back at their original places, and compare the difference.",
        "For both cases, we consider a window with 4 words after each filled pause.",
        "We average the tf.idf scores of the words in each of these windows.",
        "Then, for all speaker-inserted pauses, we obtain a set of averaged tf.idf scores.",
        "And for all randomly-inserted pauses, we have another set.",
        "The mean of the former set (5.79 in table 5) is statistically higher than that of the latter set (5.70 in table 5).",
        "We can adjust the window size to 3, 2 and 1, and then get the following table.",
        "The above table shows that instead of randomly inserting pauses, real speakers insert them in front of words with higher tf.idf scores.",
        "This helps explain why disfluencies work."
