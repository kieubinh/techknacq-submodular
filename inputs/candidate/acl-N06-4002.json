        "With the advent of ever more powerful inexpensive silicon and the integration of computers with audio interfaces, the computing platforms on which spoken language technology resides have undergone dramatic changes, progressively reaching many more users, ever more conveniently.",

        "The type and scope of applications have concomitantly multiplied with the ready access of affordable useful technology.",
        "Like other initially expensive centralized hardware and even biological systems (!",
        "), as the cost curves come down, evolution progresses, and more processing can be conducted relatively or wholly autonomously, the processing itself can be far more distributed.",
        "So while there continue to be operations or services (e.g. call centers) which are still best done in a centralized fashion, the distribution and proliferation of standalone systems (e.g. PCs, and cell phones) become progressively more feasible and popular."

      "heading": "4. Speech Synthesis",
      "text": [
        "The primary focus of the present set of demonstrations is on speech recognition and synthesis.",
        "Starting with Homer Dudley's Voder (a manually-controlled speech synthesizer) at the 1939 World's Fair, audio examples of historical speech synthesis approaches and techniques clearly demonstrate extensive progress (see Resources).",
        "Video clips illustrate users interacting with different types of synthesis systems and applications.",
        "Mechanical speaking machines in the 1700's eventually gave way to electrical devices in the early 1920's, which in turn gave way to computer generation of speech by the 1960's. The invention of the speech spectrogram in the 1940's spurred in-depth speech research, and significantly facilitated speech signal and waveform analyses, which blossomed in the 1960's. Speech generation has taken two basic forms.",
        "With analysis-resynthesis the speech waveform is first parameterized and then regenerated or played back, as in the Voder.",
        "With the advent of powerful inexpensive microprocessors and DSP chips in the 1970's, a multitude of diverse sound-producing consumer products hit the market.",
        "The popular Speak 'n Spell learning toy introduced in 1978, was the most notable early entry.",
        "Articulatory synthesis, first demonstrated in 1958, models the components and the characteristics of the physical production system - the articulators, their movements and their trajectories, as well as the vocal tract, its resonances, excitations, etc.",
        "A clear understanding of such a system is highly desirable, and may eventually be achieved.",
        "Unfortunately, the underlying complexity of the speech production system still confounds understanding and application utility.",
        "Consequently, while studies in articulatory synthesis are still ongoing, they were largely superceded by formant synthesizers.",
        "Formant synthesis, also referred to as synthesis-by-rule, characterizes speech in terms of a source-filter model.",
        "In this model, one or more sound sources, representing the vibrating vocal cords and noise dynamically produced at articulator constrictions, excite one or more filters, representing the vocal tract and side-tube (e.g. nasal branch, etc.)",
        "resonances.",
        "A catalog of sounds (corresponding to (sub) phones, diphones, or other units) can be constructed and then reassembled (and smoothed) in accordance with a dictionary of word or phrase pronunciations.",
        "With careful selection of materials, and the careful tuning and adjustments of parameters, synthetic speech can be made to sound very natural.",
        "Although computationally efficient, automatically achieving high quality output is neither easy nor consistently achievable.",
        "Concatenative synthesis refers to the process of sequentially combining prerecorded exemplars of speech or other waveforms to produce the desired",
        "output.",
        "A large database (including many phonetic elements, allophones, words, etc.)",
        "of well-concatenated sound elements can easily produce synthetic speech indistinguishable from natural speech.",
        "This process is very memory-intensive, but typically produces the highest quality speech synthesis available.",
        "It is widely deployed in applications requiring natural-sounding speech output from a given voice.",
        "Although three major approaches are outlined here, a number of hybrid synthesizers, HMM synthesizers, and other synthesis methodologies are utilized to address different requirements."

      "text": [
        "In the past century, speech recognition has progressed from recognizing small vocabularies to transcribing general purpose dictation in real time, recognizing commands in noisy environments, and reliably extracting words and information from telephone conversations and television broadcasts.",
        "In 1922, the toy dog \"Rex\", would spring from his doghouse when he was called by name!",
        "Early digit recognizers were demonstrated in the 1950's and 1960's, when the predominant approach was to recognize whole word templates.",
        "This approach continued up to the beginning of the 1970's when it started being gradually replaced by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) systems using stochastic models to more accurately characterize the naturally highly variable speech signal.",
        "Spurred on by government funders for \"speech understanding\" in Europe, Japan, and the USA, many university and commercial laboratories commenced to advance the technology.",
        "Proceeding first through limited vocabulary systems and highly constrained grammars, systems gradually expanded the number of words they could simultaneously distinguish, despite greater variability in speakers, languages, and progressively more challenging acoustic/channel and natural language environments.",
        "Starting in the 1970's, hefty special-purpose commercial hardware systems were deployed for limited vocabulary industrial applications (e.g. for hands-free command/control, data entry, quality control, etc.",
        "), speaker verification, simple telephone data input and query systems, etc.",
        "Inexpensive PC sound board enabling discrete recognition started appearing in the market by the late 1970's to mid 1980's. In the latter 1980's, vocabulary expanded to several thousand words, and then in 1990, suddenly exploded to full general-purpose dictation capabilities, though still limited to discrete \"one word at a time\" input.",
        "Meanwhile in the early 1990's, the first speech audio-mining and audio information retrieval capabilities were successfully proven to work on prerecorded conversational continuous speech, on telephone and broadcast data.",
        "Real-time continuous speech dictation \"software only\" products became available and sold to millions of customers by the end of the 1990's. The availability of large corpora of recorded speech and text dramatically improved modeling capabilities and system performance for both dictation and transcription.",
        "Meantime telephone query systems allowed for users to engage in dialogue to get stock quotes, weather updates, and even make train and plane reservations.",
        "By the year 2000, commercial telephone directory assistance systems started appearing as well.",
        "Today call centers routinely employ speech technology to elicit and supply customer information through interactive spoken dialogue, in large part replacing expensive human operators.",
        "Though directed dialogues predominate, some mixed initiative dialogues (\"How can I help you?\") are becoming available.",
        "Spoken language translation programs, coupling speech recognition to machine translation software, started appearing first in the laboratory in the late 1990's, and then progressed to the marketplace on PCs and handheld devices, by about 2000.",
        "Major government-funded research initiatives are presently focusing on speech-to-speech systems with different language inputs and outputs.",
        "With embedded systems, speech input and output are now available on a growing number of consumer products including automotive navigation systems, PDAs and toys; hands-free voice",
        "dialing is shipping on millions of cell phones.",
        "Despite funding cuts and other setbacks about year 2000, the steady stream of ever improving speech technology is gradually becoming an integral part of systems and services, large and small.",
        "The issues we face in improving speech technology continue to be very challenging.",
        "The retrospective afforded by this demonstration reflects on the great progress that we have made!",
        "basic principals and history of speech recognition and synthesis.",
