        "Ndaona is a Matlab toolkit to create interactive three-dimensional models of data often found in NLP research, such as exploring the results of classification and dimensionality reduction algorithms.",
        "Such models are useful for teaching, presentations and exploratory research (such as showing where a classification algorithm makes mistakes).",
        "Ndaona includes embedding and graphics parameter estimation algorithms, and generates files in the format of Partiview (Levy, 2001), an existing free open-source fast multidimensional data displayer that has traditionally been used in the planetarium community.",
        "Partiview1 supports a number of enhancements to regular scat-terplots that allow it to display more than three dimensions’ worth of information."

        "Scatterplots are not the most efficient way of representing information (Grinstein et al., 2001).",
        "However, they are intuitive and stable (Wong and Berg-eron, 1997), and can be supplemented in several ways.",
        "We describe some of these augmentations in Section 1, basic Ndaona usage in Section 2, and finally a couple of some embedding methods in Section 3.",

      "heading": "1.1 Glyphs",
      "text": [
        "Glyphs are icons that provide a visual representation of a datum.",
        "A simple example of a glyph is a filled-in circle whose color and size convey two additional dimensions of information.",
        "More complex examples have been designed to present more information (Tukey and Tukey, 1981) (Ward, 2002).",
        "Partiview can use any image as a glyph, as long as all images used can fit in graphics memory.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows faces from the Frey Face Dataset2 in linear kernel space; two faces are close together then the vectors u and v representing have a high value of u v. In this case, each point has a natural visual representation – the face itself.",
        "And we therefore use the faces as lossless glyphs, with each glyph representing a 560-dimensional vector (20 x 28 pixel image).",
        "A second example is in Figure 2.",
        "It shows Mandarin syllables in a tone recognition experiment (Surendran et al., 2005), with two syllables close",
        "supplemented scatterplot showing the performance of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a 4-way Mandarin syllable tone classification task.",
        "Ndaona embedded syllables so that those classified similarly by the SVM are close together.",
        "The glyph for each syllable represents the 20-dimensional vector input to the SVM.",
        "Syllables with the same tone are represented by glyphs of the same color; the white syllables in the foreground have falling tone.",
        "together if the classification algorithm made similar predictions of their tone.",
        "The algorithm received for each syllable a 20-dimensional vector that described its normalized pitch contour of the syllable.",
        "In this case, a histogram of the pitch contour, with the area between the pitch contour and the horizontal axis shaded for enhanced visibility, results in a highly informative glyph.",
        "A close-up look at the low tone syllables reveals that the algorithm ‘thinks’ that any syllable whose pitch contour decreases towards the end has a falling tone which is what linguists expect.",
        "We can also tell that many of the mistakes made by the algorithm are due to the features and not the algorithm itself.",
        "For instance, the several high tone syllables that are close to the cluster of low-tone-syllables (and would thus be classified as having low tone by the algorithm) do in fact have a falling pitch contour."
