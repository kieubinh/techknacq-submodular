        "The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has proved to be a great and useful technique for unsupervised learning problems in natural language, but, unfortunately, its range of applications is largely limited by intractable E or M-steps, and its reliance on the maximum likelihood estimator.",
        "The natural language processing community typically resorts to ad-hoc approximation methods to get (some reduced form of) EM to apply to our tasks.",
        "However, many of the problems that plague EM can be solved with Bayesian methods, which are theoretically more well justified.",
        "This tutorial will cover Bayesian methods as they can be used in natural language processing.",
        "The two primary foci of this tutorial are specifying prior distributions and performing the necessary computations to perform inference in Bayesian models.",
        "The focus of the tutorial will be primarily on unsupervised techniques (for which EM is the obvious choice).",
        "Supervised and discriminative techniques will also be mentioned at the conclusion of the tutorial, and pointers to relevant literature will be provided."

        "He works primarily on problems in automatic document summarization and information extraction, using a variety of machine learning techniques.",
        "As a Bayesian, he has successfully applied variational inference and expectation propagation techniques to unsupervised learning problems in summarization.",
        "He has also successfully applied nonparametric infinite Bayesian models to problems in supervised clustering.",
