        "The last 6-7 years have seen a surge of interest in semi-supervised methods in the machine learning and NLP communities focused on the one hand on analysing the situations in which unlabelled data can be useful, and on the other hand, providing feasible learning algorithms.",
        "This recent research has resulted in a wide variety of interesting methods which are different with respect to the assumptions they make about the learning task.",
        "In this tutorial, we survey recent semi-supervised learning methods, discuss assumptions behind various approaches, and show how some of these methods have been applied to NLP tasks."
