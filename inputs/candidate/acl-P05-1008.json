        "This paper1 is concerned with the problem of controlling the output of natural language generation (NLG) systems.",
        "In many application scenarios the generator’s task is underspecified, resulting in multiple possible solutions (texts expressing the desired content), all equally good to the generator, but not equally appropriate for the application.",
        "Customising the generator directly to overcome this generally leads to ad-hoc, non-reusable solutions.",
        "A more modular approach is a generate-and-test architecture, in which all solutions are generated, and then ranked or otherwise selected according to their appropriateness in a separate post-Paiva and Evans (2004) provides an overview of our framework and detailed comparison with previous approaches to stylistic control (like Hovy (1988), Green and DiMarco (1993) and Langkilde-Geary (2002)).",
        "This paper provides a more detailed account of the system and reports additional experimental results.",
        "process.",
        "Such architectures have been particularly prominent in the recent development of empirically-based approaches to NLG, where generator outputs can be selected according to application requirements acquired directly from human subjects (e.g. Walker et al.",
        "(2002)) or statistically from a corpus (e.g. Langkilde-Geary (2002)).",
        "However, this approach suffers from a number of drawbacks:",
        "1.",
        "It requires generation of all, or at least many solutions (often hundreds of thousands), expensive both in time and space, and liable to lead to unnecessary interactions with other components (e.g. knowledge bases) in complex systems.",
        "Recent advances in the use of packed representations ameliorate some of these issues, but the basic need to compare a large number of solutions in order to rank them remains.",
        "2.",
        "The ‘test’ component generally does not give fine-grained control – for example, in a statistically-based system it typically measures how close a text is to some single notion of ideal (actually, statistically average) output.",
        "3.",
        "Use of an external filter does not combine well with any control mechanisms within the generator: e.g. controlling combinatorial explosion of modifier attachment or adjective order.",
        "In this paper we present an empirically-based method for controlling a generator which overcomes these deficiencies.",
        "It controls the generator internally, so that it can produce just one (locally) optimal solution; it employs a model of language variation, so that the generator can be controlled within a multidimensional space of possible variants; its view of the generator is completely holistic, so that it can accommodate any other control mechanisms intrinsic to the generation task.",
        "To illustrate our approach we describe a system for controlling ‘style’ in the sense of Biber (1988) during the generation of short texts giving instructions about doses of medicine.",
        "The paper continues as follows.",
        "In §2 we describe our overall approach.",

      "text": [
        "Our overall approach has two phases: (1) offline calculation of the control parameters, and (2) online application to generation.",
        "In the first phase we determine a set of correlation equations, which capture the relationship between surface linguistic features of generated texts and the internal generator decisions that gave rise to those texts (see figure 1).",
        "In the second phase, these correlations are used to guide the generator to produce texts with particular surface feature characteristics (see figure 2).",
        "The starting point is a corpus of texts which represents all the variability that we wish to capture.",
        "Counts for (surface) linguistic features from the texts in the corpus are obtained, and a factor analysis is used to establish dimensions of variation in terms of these counts: each dimension is defined by a weighted sum of scores for particular features, and factor analysis determines the combination that best accounts for the variability across the whole corpus.",
        "This provides a language variation model which can be used to score a new text along each of the identified dimensions, that is, to locate the text in the variation space determined by the corpus.",
        "The next step is to take a generator which can generate across the range of variation in the corpus, and identify within it the key choice points (CP1, CP2, ... CPn) in its generation of a text.",
        "We then allow the generator to freely generate all possible texts from one or more inputs.",
        "For each text so generated we record (a) the text’s score according to the variation model and (b) the set of decisions made at each of the selected choice points in the generator.",
        "Finally, for a random sample of the generated texts, a statistical correlation analysis is undertaken between the scores and the corresponding generator decisions, resulting in correlation equations which predict likely variation scores from generator decisions.",
        "In the second phase, the generator is adapted to use the correlation equations to conduct a best-first search of the generation space.",
        "As well as the usual input, the generator is supplied with target scores for each dimension of variation.",
        "At each choice point, the correlation equations are used to predict which choice is most likely to move closer to the target score for the final text.",
        "This basic architecture makes no commitment to what is meant by ‘variation’, ‘linguistic features’, ‘generator choice points’, or even ‘NLG system’.",
        "The key ideas are that a statistical analysis of surface features of a corpus of texts can be used to define a model of variation; this model can then be used to control a generator; and the model can also be used to evaluate the generator’s performance.",
        "In the next section we describe a concrete instantiation of this architecture, in which ‘variation’ is stylistic variation as characterised by a collection of shallow lexical and syntactic features."
