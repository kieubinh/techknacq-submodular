        "Unknown words constitute a major source of difficulty for Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging, yet relatively little work has been done on POS guessing of Chinese unknown words.",
        "The few existing studies all attempted to develop a unified statistical model to compute the probability of a word having a particular POS category for all Chinese unknown words (Chen et al., 1997; Wu and Jiang, 2000; Goh, 2003).",
        "This approach tends to miss one or more pieces of information contributed by the type, length, internal structure, or context of individual unknown words, and fails to combine the strengths of different models.",
        "The rule-based approach was rejected with the claim that rules are bound to overgenerate (Wu and Jiang, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid model that combines the strengths of a rule-based model with those of two statistical models for this task.",
        "The three models make use of different sources of information.",
        "The rule-based model is sensitive to the type, length, and internal structure of unknown words, with over-generation controlled by additional constraints.",
        "The two statistical models make use of contextual information and the likelihood for a character to appear in a particular position of words of a particular length and POS category respectively.",

        "The definition of what constitutes a word is problematic for Chinese, as Chinese does not have word delimiters and the boundary between compounds and phrases or collocations is fuzzy.",
        "Consequently, different NLP tasks adopt different segmentation schemes (Sproat, 2002).",
        "With respect to any Chinese corpus or NLP system, therefore, unknown words can be defined as character strings that are not in the lexicon but should be identified as segmentation units based on the segmentation scheme.",
        "Chen and Bai (1998) categorized Chinese unknown words into the following five types: 1) acronyms, i.e., shortened forms of long names, e.g., bˇei-d`a for bˇeij¯ıng-d`axu´e ‘Beijing University’; 2) proper names, including person, place, and organization names, e.g., M´ao-Z´ed¯ong; 3) derived words, which are created through affixation, e.g., xi`and`ai-hu`a ‘modernize’; 4) compounds, which are created through compounding, e.g., zhˇı-lˇaohˇu ‘paper tiger’; and 5) nu"

        "Other types of unknown words exist, such as loan words and reduplicated words.",
        "A monosyllabic or disyllabic Chinese word can reduplicate in various patterns, e.g., zˇou-zˇou ‘take a walk’ and pi`ao -pi`aoli`ang-li`ang ‘very pretty’ are formed by reduplicating zˇou ‘walk’ and pi`ao-li`ang ‘pretty’ respectively.",
        "The identification of acronyms, proper names, and numeric type compounds is a separate task that has received substantial attention.",
        "Once a character string is identified as one of these, its POS category also becomes known.",
        "We will therefore focus on reduplicated and derived words and compounds only.",
        "We will consider unknown words of the categories of noun, verb, and adjective, as most unknown words fall under these categories (Chen and Bai, 1998).",

        "(1997) examined all unknown nouns1, verbs, and adjectives and reported a 69.13% precision using Dice metrics to measure the affix-category association strength and an affix-dependent entropy weighting scheme for determining the weightings between prefix-category and suffix-category associations.",
        "This approach is blind to the type, length, and context of unknown words.",
        "Wu and Jiang (2000) calculated P(Cat,Pos,Len) for each character, where Cat is the POS of a word containing the character, Pos is the position of the character in that word, and Len is the length of that word.",
        "They then calculated the POS probabilities for each unknown word as the joint probabilities of the P(Cat,Pos,Len) of its component characters.",
        "This approach was applied to unknown nouns, verbs, and adjectives that are two to four characters long2.",
        "They did not report results on unknown word tagging, but reported that the new word identification and tagging mechanism increased parser coverage.",
        "We will show that this approach suffers reduced recall for multisyllabic",
        "words if the training corpus is small.",
        "Goh (2003) reported a precision of 59.58% on all unknown words using Support Vector Machines.",
        "Several reasons were suggested for rejecting the rule-based approach.",
        "First, Chen et al.",
        "(1997) claimed that it does not work because the syntactic and semantic information for each character or morpheme is unavailable.",
        "This claim does not fully hold, as the POS information about the component words or morphemes of many unknown words is available in the training lexicon.",
        "Second, Wu and Jiang (2000) argued that assigning POS to Chinese unknown words on the basis of the internal structure of those words will “result in massive over-generation” (p. 48).",
        "We will show that overgeneration can be controlled by additional constraints."

      "heading": "4.1 The Rule-Based Model",
      "text": [
        "The motivations for developing a set of rules for this task are twofold.",
        "First, the rule-based approach was dismissed without testing in previous studies.",
        "However, hybrid models that combine rule-based and statistical models outperform purely statistical models in many NLP tasks.",
        "Second, the rule-based model can incorporate information about the length, type, and internal structure of unknown words at the same time.",
        "Rule development involves knowledge of Chinese morphology and generalizations of the training data.",
        "Disyllabic words are harder to generalize than longer words, probably because their monosyllabic component morphemes are more fluid than the longer component morphemes of longer words.",
        "It is interesting to see if reduction in the degree of fluidity of its components makes a word more predictable.",
        "We therefore develop a separate set of rules for words that are two, three, four, and five",
        "or more characters long.",
        "The rules developed fall into the following four types: 1) reduplication rules (T1), which tag reduplicated unknown words based on knowledge about the reduplication process; 2) derivation rules (T2), which tag derived unknown words based on knowledge about the affixation process; 3) compounding rules (T3), which tag unknown compounds based on the POS information of their component words; and 4) rules based on generalizations about the training data (T4).",
        "Rules may come with additional constraints to avoid over-generation.",
        "The number of rules in each set is listed in Table 1.",
        "The complete set of rules are developed over a period of two weeks.",
        "As will be shown below, the order in which the rules in each set are applied is crucial for dealing with ambiguous cases.",
        "To illustrate how rules work, we discuss the complete set of rules for disyllabic words here3.",
        "These are given in Figure 1, where A and B refer to the component morpheme of an unknown AB.",
        "As rules for disyllabic words tend to overgenerate and as we prefer precision over recall for the rule-based model, most rules in this set are accompanied with additional constraints.",
        "In the first reduplication rule, the order of the three cases is crucial in that if A can be both a verb and a noun, AA is almost always a verb.",
        "The second rule tags a disyllabic unknown word formed by attaching the diminutive suffix er to a monosyllabic root as a noun.",
        "This may appear a hasty generalization, but examination of the data shows that er rarely attaches to monosyllabic verbs except for the few well-known cases.",
        "In the third rule, a categorizing suffix is one that attaches to other words to form a noun that refers to a category of people or objects, e.g., ji¯a ‘-ist’.",
        "The constraint “A is not a verb morpheme” excludes cases where B is polyse-mous and does not function as a categorizing suffix",
        "but a noun morpheme.",
        "Thus, this rule tags b`eng-y`e ‘water-pump industry’ as a noun, but not l´ı-y`e leave-job ‘resign’.",
        "The fourth rule tags words such as sh¯axi¯ang ‘sand-box’ as nouns, but the constraints prevent verbs such as s¯ong-k`ou ‘loosen-button’ from being tagged as nouns.",
        "S¯ong can be both a noun and a verb, but it is used as a verb in this word.",
        "The last two rules make use of two lists of characters extracted from the list of disyllabic words in the training data, i.e., those that have only appeared in the verb-initial and noun-final positions respectively.",
        "This is done because in Chinese, disyllabic compound verbs tend to be head-initial, whereas disyllabic compound nouns tend to be head-final.",
        "The fifth rule tags words such as d¯ıng-yˇao ‘sting-bite’ as verbs, and the additional constraints prevent nouns such as f´u-xi`ang ‘lying-elephant’ from being tagged as verbs.",
        "The last rule tags words such as xuˇeb`ei ‘snow-quilt’ as nouns, but not zh¯ai-sh¯ao pick-tip ‘pick the tips’.",
        "One derivation rule for trisyllabic words has a special status.",
        "Following the tagging guidelines of our training corpus, it tags a word ABC as verb/deverbal noun (v/vn) if C is the suffix hu`a ‘-ize’.",
