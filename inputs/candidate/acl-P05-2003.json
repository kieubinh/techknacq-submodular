        "Natural language cannot be simply reduced to lexicon and syntax.",
        "The fact that individual words cannot be combined freely or randomly is common for most natural languages.",
        "The ability of a word to combine with other words can be expressed either intensionally or extensionally.",
        "The former case refers to valency.",
        "Instances of the latter case are called collocations (ˇCermák and Holub, 1982).",
        "The term collocation has several other definitions but none of them is widely accepted.",
        "Most attempts are based on a characteristic property of collocations: non-compositionality.",
        "Choueka (1988) defines a collocational expression as “a syntactic and semantic unit whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived directly from the meaning or connotation of its components”.",
        "The term collocation has both linguistic and lexicographic character.",
        "It covers a wide range of lexical phenomena, such as phrasal verbs, light verb compounds, idioms, stock phrases, technological expressions, and proper names.",
        "Collocations are of high importance for many applications in the field of NLP.",
        "The most desirable ones are machine translation, word sense disambiguation, language generation, and information retrieval.",
        "The recent availability of large amounts of textual data has attracted interest in automatic collocation extraction from text.",
        "In the last thirty years a number of different methods employing various association measures have been proposed.",
        "Overview of the most widely used techniques is given e.g. in (Manning and Schütze, 1999) or (Pearce, 2002).",
        "Several researches also attempted to compare existing methods and suggested different evaluation schemes, e.g Kita (1994) or Evert (2001).",
        "A comprehensive study of statistical aspects of word cooccurrences can be found in (Evert, 2004).",
        "In this paper we present a compendium of 84 methods for automatic collocation extraction.",
        "They came from different research areas and some of them have not been used for this purpose yet.",
        "A brief overview of these methods is followed by their comparative evaluation against manually annotated data by the means of precision and recall measures.",
        "In the end we propose a statistical classification method for combining multiple methods and demonstrate a substantial performance improvement.",
        "In our research we focus on two-word (bigram) collocations, mainly for the reason that experiments with longer expressions would require processing of much larger amounts of data and limited scalability of some methods to high order n-grams.",
        "The experiments are performed on Czech data."

        "Most methods for collocation extraction are based on verification of typical collocation properties.",
        "These properties are formally described by mathematical formulas that determine the degree of association between components of collocation.",
        "Such formulas are called association measures and compute an association score for each collocation candidate extracted from a corpus.",
        "The scores indicate a chance of a candidate to be a collocation.",
        "They can be used for ranking or for classification – by setting a threshold.",
        "Finding such a threshold depends on the intended application.",
        "The most widely tested property of collocations is non-compositionality: If words occur together more often than by a chance, then this is the evidence that they have a special function that is not simply explained as a result of their combination (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "We think of a corpus as a randomly generated sequence of words that is viewed as a sequence of word pairs.",
        "Occurrence frequencies of these bigrams are extracted and kept in contingency tables (Table 1a).",
        "Values from these tables are used in several association measures that reflect how much the word coocurrence is accidental.",
        "A list of such measures is given in Table 2 and includes: estimation of bigram and unigram probabilities (rows 3–5), mutual information and derived measures (6– 11), statistical tests of independence (12–16), likelihood measures (17–18), and various other heuristic association measures and coefficients (19–57).",
        "Another frequently tested property is taken directly from the definition that a collocation is a syntactic and semantic unit.",
        "For each bigram occurring in the corpus, information of its empirical context (frequencies of open-class words occurring within a specified context window) and left and right immediate contexts (frequencies of words immediately preceding or following the bigram) is extracted (Table 1b).",
        "By determining the entropy of the immediate contexts of a word sequence, the association measures rank collocations according to the assumption that they occur as units in a (information-theoretically) noisy environment (Shimohata et al., 1997) (58–62).",
        "By comparing empirical contexts of a word sequence and its components, the association measures rank collocations according to the as",
        "sumption that semantically non-compositional expressions typically occur in different contexts than their components (Zhai, 1997).",
        "Measures (63–76) have information theory background and measures (77–84) are adopted from the field of information retrieval.",
        "Context association measures are mainly used for extracting idioms.",
        "Besides all the association measures described above, we also take into account other recommended measures (1–2) (Manning and Schütze, 1999) and some basic linguistic characteristics used for filtering non-collocations (85–87).",
        "This information can be obtained automatically from morphological taggers and syntactic parsers available with reasonably high accuracy for many languages."

        "Evaluation of collocation extraction methods is a complicated task.",
        "On one hand, different applications require different setting of association score thresholds.",
        "On the other hand, methods give different results within different ranges of their association scores.",
        "We need a complex evaluation scheme covering all demands.",
        "In such a case, Evert (2001) and other authors suggest using precision and recall measures on a full reference data or on n-best lists.",
        "Data.",
        "All the presented experiments were performed on morphologically and syntactically annotated Czech text from the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Hajiˇc et al., 2001).",
        "Dependency trees were broken down into dependency bigrams consisting of: lemmas and part-of-speech of the components, and type of dependence between the components.",
        "For each bigram type we counted frequencies in its contingency table, extracted empirical and immediate contexts, and computed all the 84 association measures from Table 2.",
        "We processed 81614 sentences with 1255 590 words and obtained a total of 202171 different dependency bigrams.",
        "Krenn (2000) argues that collocation extraction methods should be evaluated against a reference set of collocations manually extracted from the full candidate data from a corpus.",
        "However, we reduced the full candidate data from PDT to 21597 bigram by filtering out any bigrams which occurred 5 or less times in the data and thus we obtained a reference data set which fulfills requirements of a sufficient size and a minimal frequency of observations which is needed for the assumption of normal distribution required by some methods.",
        "We manually processed the entire reference data set and extracted bigrams that were considered to be collocations.",
        "At this point we applied part-of-speech filtering: First, we identified POSpatterns that never form a collocation.",
        "Second, all dependency bigrams having such a POS pattern were removed from the reference data and a final reference set of 8 904 bigrams was created.",
        "We no longer consider bigrams with such patterns to be collocation candidates.",
        "This data set contained 2 649 items considered to be collocations.",
        "The a priori probability of a bigram to be a collocation was 29.75 %.",
        "A stratified one-third subsample of this data was selected as test data and used for evaluation and testing purposes in this work.",
        "The rest was taken apart and used as training data in later experiments.",
        "Evaluation metrics.",
        "Since we manually annotated the entire reference data set we could use the suggested precision and recall measures (and their harmonic mean F-measure).",
        "A collocation extraction method using any association measure with a given threshold can be considered a classifier and the measures can be computed in the following way: # correctly classified collocations # total predicted as collocations # correctly classified collocations # total collocations The higher these scores, the better the classifier is.",
        "By changing the threshold we can tune the classifier performance and “trade” recall for precision.",
        "Therefore, collocation extraction methods can be thoroughly compared by comparing their precision-recall curves: The closer the curve to the top right corner, the better the method is.",
        "Results.",
        "Presenting individual results for all of the 84 association measures is not possible in a paper of this length.",
        "Therefore, we present precision-recall graphs only for the best methods from each group mentioned in Section 2; see Figure 1.",
        "The baseline system that classifies bigrams randomly, operates with a precision of 29.75 %.",
        "The overall best result was achieved by Pointwise mutual information: 30 % recall with 85.5 % precision (F-measure 44.4), 60 % recall with 78.4 % precision (F-measure 68.0), and 90 % recall with 62.5 % precision (F-measure 73.8)."

        "A motivating example is depicted in Figure 3: Association scores of Point-wise mutual information and Cosine context similarity are independent enough to be linearly combined to provide better results.",
        "Considering all association measures, we deal with a problem of high-dimensional classification into two classes.",
        "In our case, each bigram x is described by the attribute vector x= (x1, ... , x87) consisting of linguistic features and association scores from Table 2.",
        "Now we look for a function assigning each bigram one class : f (x) – *{collocation, non-collocation}.",
        "The result of this approach is similar to setting a threshold of the association score in methods using one association measure, which is not very use-full for our purpose.",
        "Some classification methods, however, output also the predicted probability P(x is collocation) that can be considered a regular association measure as described above.",

        "In the final step of our experiments, we attempted to reduce the attribute space of our data and thus obtain an attribute subset with the same prediction ability.",
        "We employed a greedy stepwise search method with attribute subset evaluation via logistic regression implemented in Weka.",
        "It performs a greedy search through the space of attribute subsets and iteratively merges subsets that give the best results until the performance is no longer improved.",
