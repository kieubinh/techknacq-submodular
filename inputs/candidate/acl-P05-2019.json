        "The pragmatic category of topic is notoriously difficult to pin down, and it has been defined in many ways (B¨uring, 1999; Davison, 1984; Engdahl and Vallduv´ı, 1996; Gundel, 1988; Lambrecht, 1994; Reinhart, 1982; Vallduv´ı, 1992).",
        "The common denominator is the notion of topic as what an utterance is about.",
        "We take this as our point of departure in this corpus-based investigation of the correlations between linguistic surface features and pragmatic topicality in Danish dialog.",
        "*We thank Daniel Hardt and two anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on drafts of this paper.",
        "Danish is a verb-second language.",
        "Its word order is fixed, but only to a certain degree, in that it allows any main clause constituent to occur in the pre-verbal position.",
        "The first position thus has a privileged status in Danish, often associated with topicality (Harder and Poulsen, 2000; Togeby, 2003).",
        "We were thus interested in investigating how well the topic correlates with the preverbal position, along with other features, if any.",
        "Our findings could prove useful for the further investigation of local dialog coherence in Danish.",

        "A topic expression, on the other hand, is an NP that formally expresses the topic in the utterance.",
        "Topic expressions were identified through a two-step procedure; 1) identifying topics and 2) determining the topic expressions on the basis of the topics.",
        "First, the topic was identified strictly based on pragmatic aboutness using a modified version of the ‘about test’ (Lambrecht, 1994; Reinhart, 1982).",
        "The about test consists of embedding the utterance in question in an ‘about-sentence’ as in Lam-brecht’s example shown below as (1):",

        "This is a paraphrase of the sentence the children went to school which indicates that the referent of the children is the topic because it is appropriate (in the imagined discourse context) to embed this referent as an NP in the about matrix clause.",
        "(Again, the referent of the children is the topic, while the NP the children is the topic expression.)",

        "This happened after considering which about construction gave the most coherent and natural sounding result combined with the utterance.",
