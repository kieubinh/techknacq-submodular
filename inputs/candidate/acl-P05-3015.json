        "In our experiments, we evaluate the generalization (coverage) of this bootstrapping approach under three testing schemas.",
        "Each of these schemas represented a certain level of test data coverage (recall).",

        "Their results were encouraging, and their studies raised additional questions.",
        "First, are there other appropriate syntactic extraction patterns in addition to appositives and prepositional phrases?",
        "Second, because the test data were extracted in the same manner as the training data in their experiments, the characteristics of the test cases were biased.",
