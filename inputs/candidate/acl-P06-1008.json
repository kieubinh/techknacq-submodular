        "Syntactic formalisms make it possible to describe precisely the question of grammaticality.",
        "When a syntactic structure can be associated to a sentence, according to a given grammar, we can decide whether or not the sentence is grammatical.",
        "In this conception, a language (be it natural or not) is produced (or generated) by a grammar by means of a specific mechanism, for example derivation.",
        "However, when no structure can be built, nothing can be said about the input to be parsed except, eventually, the origin of the failure.",
        "This is a problem when dealing with non canonical inputs such as spoken language, e-mails, non-native speaker productions, etc.",
        "From this perspective, we need robust approaches that are at the same time capable of describing precisely the form of the input, the source of the problem and to continue the parse.",
        "Such capabilities render it possible to arrive at a precise evaluation of the grammaticality of the input.",
        "In other words, instead of deciding on the grammaticality of the input, we can give an indication of its grammaticality, quantified on the basis of the description of the properties of the input.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of ranking the grammaticality of different sentences.",
        "This question is of central importance for the understanding of language processing, both from an automatic and from a cognitive perspective.",
        "As for NLP, ranking grammaticality makes it possible to control dynamically the parsing process (in choosing the most adequate structures) or to find the best structure among a set of solutions (in case of non-deterministic approaches).",
        "Likewise the description of cognitive processes involved in language processing by human has to explain how things work when faced with unexpected or non canonical material.",
        "In this case too, we have to explain why some productions are more acceptable and easier to process than others.",
        "The question of ranking grammaticality has been addressed from time to time in linguistics, without being a central concern.",
        "Chomsky, for example, mentioned this problem quite regularly (see for example (Chomsky75)).",
        "However he rephrases it in terms of “degrees of ’belongingness’ to the language”, a somewhat fuzzy notion both formally and linguistically.",
        "More recently, several approaches have been proposed illustrating the interest of describing these mechanisms in terms of constraint violations.",
        "The idea consists in associating weights to syntactic constraints and to evaluate, either during or after the parse, the weight of violated constraints.",
        "This approach is at the basis of Linear Optimality Theory (see (Keller00), and (Sorace05) for a more general perspective) in which grammaticality is judged on the basis of the total weights of violated constraints.",
        "It is then possible to rank different candidate struc",
        "tures.",
        "A similar idea is proposed in the framework of Constraint Dependency Grammar (see (Men-zel98), (Schr¨oder02)).",
        "In this case too, acceptability is function of the violated constraints weights.",
        "However, constraint violation cannot in itself constitute a measure of grammaticality without taking into account other parameters as well.",
        "The type and the number of constraints that are satisfied are of central importance in acceptability judgment: a construction violating 1 constraint and satisfying 15 of them is more acceptable than one violating the same constraint but satisfying only 5 others.",
        "In the same way, other informations such as the position of the violation in the structure (whether it occurs in a deeply embedded constituent or higher one in the structure) plays an important role as well.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach overcoming such limitations.",
        "It takes advantage of a fully constraint-based syntactic formalism (called Property Grammars, cf. (Blache05b)) that offers the possibility of calculating a grammaticality index, taking into account automatically derived parameters as well as empirically determined weights.",
        "This index is evaluated automatically and we present a psycholinguistic study showing how the parser predictions converge with acceptability judgments."

        "Constraints are generally used in linguistics as a control process, verifying that a syntactic structure (e.g. a tree) verifies some well-formedness conditions.",
        "They can however play a more general role, making it possible to express syntactic information without using other mechanism (such as a generation function).",
        "Property Grammars (noted hereafter PG) are such a fully constraint-based formalism.",
        "In this approach, constraints stipulate different kinds of relation between categories such as linear precedence, imperative co-occurrence, dependency, repetition, etc.",
        "Each of these syntactic relations corresponds to a type of constraint (also called property):",
        "• Linear precedence: Det � N (a determiner precedes the noun) • Dependency: AP --* N (an adjectival phrase depends on the noun) • Requirement: V[inf] ==>.",
        "to (an infinitive comes with to) • Exclusion: seems �A ThatClause[subj] (the verb seems cannot have That clause subjects) • Uniqueness : UniqNp{Det} (the determiner is unique in a NP) • Obligation: ObligNp{N, Pro} (a pronoun or a noun is mandatory in a NP) • Constituency : ConstNp{Det, AP, N, Pro} (set of possible constituents of NP)",
        "In PG, each category of the grammar is described with a set of properties.",
        "A grammar is then made of a set of properties.",
        "Parsing an input consists in verifying for each category of description the set of corresponding properties in the grammar.",
        "More precisely, the idea consists in verifying, for each subset of constituents, the properties for which they are relevant (i.e. the constraints that can be evaluated).",
        "Some of these properties are satisfied, some others possibly violated.",
        "The result of a parse, for a given category, is the set of its relevant properties together with their evaluation.",
        "This result is called characterization and is formed by the subset of the satisfied properties, noted P+, and the set of the violated ones, noted P–.",
        "For example, the characterizations associated to the NPs “the book” and “book the” are respectively of the form: P+={Det � N; Det --* N; N �A Pro; Uniq(Det), Oblig(N), etc.",
        "}, P–=0 P+={Det --* N; N �A Pro; Uniq(Det), Oblig(N), etc.",
        "}, P–={Det � N} This approach allows to characterize any kind of syntactic object.",
        "In PG, following the proposal made in Construction Grammar (see (Fillmore98), (Kay99)), all such objects are called constructions.",
        "They correspond to a phrase (NP, PP, etc.)",
        "as well as a syntactic turn (cleft, wh-questions, etc.).",
        "All these objects are described by means of a set of properties (see (Blache05b)).",
        "In terms of parsing, the mechanism consists in exhibiting the potential constituents of a given construction.",
        "This stage corresponds, in constraint solving techniques, to the search of an assignment satisfying the constraint system.",
        "The particularity in PG comes from constraint relaxation.",
        "Here, the goal is not to find the assignment satisfying the constraint system, but the best assignment (i.e. the one satisfying as much as possible the system).",
        "In this way, the PG approach permits to deal with more or less grammatical sentences.",
        "Provided that",
        "some control mechanisms are added to the process, PG parsing can be robust and efficient (see (Blache06)) and parse different material, including spoken language corpora.",
        "Using a constraint-based approach such as the one proposed here offers several advantages.",
        "First, constraint relaxation techniques make it possible to process any kind of input.",
        "When parsing non canonical sentences, the system identifies precisely, for each constituent, the satisfied constraints as well as those which are violated.",
        "It furnishes the possibility of parsing any kind of input, which is a prerequisite for identifying a graded scale of grammaticality.",
        "The second important interest of constraints lies in the fact that syntactic information is represented in a non-holistic manner or, in other words, in a decentralized way.",
        "This characteristic allows to evaluate precisely the syntactic description associated with the input.",
        "As shown above, such a description is made of sets of satisfied and violated constraints.",
        "The idea is to take advantage of such a representation for proposing a quantitative evaluation of these descriptions, elaborated from different indicators such as the number of satisfied or violated constraints or the number of evaluated constraints.",
        "The hypothesis, in the perspective of a gradi-ence account, is to exhibit a relation between a quantitative evaluation and the level of grammaticality: the higher the evaluation value, the more grammatical the construction.",
        "The value is then an indication of the quality of the input, according to a given grammar.",

        "The first idea that comes to mind when trying to quantify the quality of a characterization is to calculate the ratio of satisfied properties with respect to the total set of evaluated properties.",

        "• P+ = set of satisfied properties for AC • P– = set of violated properties for AC • N+ : number of satisfied properties N+ card(P+) • N– : number of violated properties N– card(P–) • Satisfaction ratio (SR): the number of satisfied properties divided by the number of evaluated properties SR = E+",
        "The SR value varies between 0 and 1, the two extreme values indicating that no properties are satisfied (SR=0) or none of them are violated (SR=1).",
        "However, SR only relies on the evaluated properties.",
        "It is also necessary to indicate whether a characterization uses a small or a large subpart of the properties describing the construction in the grammar.",
        "For example, the VP in our grammar is described by means of 25 constraints whereas the PP only uses 7 of them.",
        "Let’s imagine the case where 7 constraints can be evaluated for both constructions, with an equal SR.",
        "However, the two constructions do not have the same quality: one relies on the evaluation of all the possible constraints (in the PP) whereas the other only uses a few of them (in the VP).",
        "The following formula takes these differences into account:",
        "• E : number of relevant (i.e. evaluated) properties E = N+ + N– • T= number of properties specifying construction C = card(SC) • Completeness coefficient (CC) : the number of evaluated properties divided by the number of properties describing the construction in the grammar CC = T",
        "These purely quantitative aspects have to be contrasted according to the constraint types.",
        "Intuitively, some constraints, for a given construction, play a more important role than some others.",
        "For example, linear precedence in languages with poor morphology such as English or French may have a greater importance than obligation (i.e. the necessity of realizing the head).",
        "To its turn, obligation may be more important than uniqueness (i.e. impossible repetition).",
        "In this case, violating a property would have different consequences according to its relative importance.",
        "The following examples illustrate this aspect:",
        "(1) a.",
        "The the man who spoke with me is my brother.",
        "b.",
        "The who spoke with me man is my brother.",
        "In (1a), the determiner is repeated, violating a uniqueness constraint of the first NP, whereas (1c) violates a linearity constraint of the same NP.",
        "Clearly, (1a) seems to be more grammatical than (1b) whereas in both cases, only one constraint is violated.",
        "This contrast has to be taken into account in the evaluation.",
        "Before detailing this aspect, it is important to note that this intuition does not mean that constraints have to be organized into a ranking scheme, as with the Optimality Theory (see (Prince93)).",
        "The parsing mechanism remains the same with or without this information and the hi-erarchization only plays the role of a process control.",
        "Identifying a relative importance of the types of constraints comes to associate them with a weight.",
        "Note that at this stage, we assign weights to constraint types, not directly to the constraints, differently from other approaches (cf. (Menzel98), (Foth05)).",
        "The experiment described in the next section will show that this weighting level seems to be efficient enough.",
        "However, in case of necessity, it remains possible to weight directly some constraints into a given construction, overriding thus the default weight assigned to the constraint types.",
        "The notations presented hereafter are used to describe constraint weighting.",
        "Remind that P+ and P – indicate the set of satisfied and violated properties of a given construction.",
        "• pt : property belonging to P+ • pi : property belonging to P – • w (p) : weight of the property of type p • W+ : sum of the satisfied properties weights",

        "• QI: the quality index of a construction",
        "The QI index varies then between 1 and 1.",
        "A negative value indicates that the set of violated constraints has a greater importance than the set of satisfied one.",
        "This does not mean that more constraints are violated than satisfied, but indicates the importance of the violated ones.",
        "We now have three different indicators that can be used in the evaluation of the characterization: the satisfaction ratio (noted SR) indicating the ratio of satisfied constraints, the completeness coefficient (noted CC) specifying the ratio of evaluated constraints, and the quality index (noted QI) associated to the quality of the characterization according to the respective degree of importance of evaluated constraints.",
        "These three indices are used to form a global precision index (noted PI).",
        "These three indicators do not have the same impact in the evaluation of the characterization, they are then balanced with coefficients in the normalized formula:",
        "• PI = (kxQI)+(IxSR)+(mxCC)",
        "As such, PI constitutes an evaluation of the characterization for a given construction.",
        "However, it is necessary to take into account the “quality” of the constituents of the construction as well.",
        "A construction can satisfy all the constraints describing it, but can be made of embedded constituents more or less well formed.",
        "The overall indication of the quality of a construction has then to integrate in its evaluation the quality of each of its constituents.",
        "This evaluation depends finally on the presence or not of embedded constructions.",
        "In the case of a construction made of lexical constituents, no embedded construction is present and the final evaluation is the precision index PI as described above.",
        "We will call hereafter the evaluation of the quality of the construction the “grammaticality index” (noted GI).",
        "It is calculated as follows:",
        "• Let d the number of embedded constructions • If d = 0 then GI = PI, else",
        "In this formula, we note GI(CZ) the grammaticality index of the construction CZ.",

        "of each constituent.",
        "This means that the grammaticality index of a construction can be lowered when its constituents violate some properties.",

        "formula implements the propagation of the quality sign 4 Grammaticality index from PG We describe in the remainder of the paper predictions of the model as well as the results of a psycholinguistic evaluation of these predictions.",
        "The idea is to evaluate for a given set of sentences on the one hand the grammaticality index (done automatically), on the basis of a PG grammar, and on the other hand the acceptability judgment given by a set of subjects.",
        "This experiment has been done for French, a presentation of the data and the experiment itself will be given in the next section.",

        "Here we arrived at a highly reliable correlation of p = 0.86 (p = 0.67 including PPs) between PG grammaticality indices and acceptability judgements."

        "The method described in this paper makes it possible to give a quantified indication of sentence grammaticality.",
        "This approach is direct and takes advantage of a constraint-based representation of syntactic information, making it possible to represent precisely the syntactic characteristics of an input in terms of satisfied and (if any) violated constraints.",
        "The notion of grammaticality index we have proposed here integrates different kind of information: the quality of the description (in terms of well-formedness degree), the density of information (the quantity of constraints describing an element) as well as the structure itself.",
        "These three parameters are the basic indicators of the grammaticality index.",
        "The relevance of this method has been experimentally shown, and the results described in this paper illustrate the correlation existing between the prediction (automatically calculated) expressed in terms of GI and the acceptability judgment given by subjects.",
        "This approach also presents a practical interest: it can be directly implemented into a parser.",
        "The next step of our work will be its validation on large corpora.",
        "Our parser will associate a grammatical index to each sentence.",
        "This information will be validated by means of acceptability judgments acquired on the basis of a sparse sampling strategy."
