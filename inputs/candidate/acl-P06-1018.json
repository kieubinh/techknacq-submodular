        "Language utterances are both strongly structured and compositional and the structure of a complex utterance can be obtained by combining elementary structures associated to the elementary units of language.",
        "The most simple way to 1 A formalism A strongly simulates a formalism B if A has a better strong generative capacity than B, that is, if A can generate the languages generated by B with the same structures associated to the utterances of these languages.",
        "2 Whether a natural language utterance contains one or several structures depends on our point of view.",
        "On the one hand it is clear that a sentence can receive various structures according to the semantic, syntactic, morphological or phonological point of view.",
        "On the other hand these different structures are not independent from each other and even if they are not structures on the same objects (for instance the semantic units do not correspond one to one to the syntactic units, that is the words) there are links between the different objects of these structures.",
        "In other words, considering separately the different simple structures of the sentence does not take into account the whole structure of the sentence, because we lost the interrelation between structures of different levels.",
        "combine two structures A and B is unification, that is, to build a new structure C by partially superimposing A and B and identifying a part of the objects of A with those of B.",
        "This idea recalls an old idea, used by Jespersen (1924), Tesni6re (1934) or Ajduckiewicz (1935): the sentence is like a molecule whose words are atoms, each word bearing a valence (a linguistic term explicitly borrowed from chemistry) that forces or allows it to meet some other words.",
        "Nevertheless, unification grammars cannot directly take into account the fact that some linguistic units are unsaturated in a sense that they must absolutely combine with other structures to form a stable unit.",
        "Saturation is ensured by additional mechanisms, such as the distinction of terminal and non-terminal symbols in rewriting systems or by requiring some features to have an empty list as a value in HPSG.",
        "This paper presents a new family of formalisms, Polarized Unification Grammars (PUGs).",
        "PUGs extend Unification Grammars with an explicit control of the saturation of structures by attributing a polarity to each object.",
        "Using polarities allows integrating the treatment of saturation in the formalism of the rules.",
        "Thus the processing of saturation will pilot the combination of structures during the generation processing.",
        "Some polarities are neutral, others are not, but a final structure must be completely neutral.",

        "PUG is both an elementary formalism (structures simply combine by identifying objects) and a powerful formalism, equivalent to Turing machines and capable of handling strings, trees, dags, n-graphs and products of such structures (such as ordered trees).3 But, above all, PUG is a well-adapted formalism for writing grammars and it is capable of strongly simulating many classic formalisms.",
        "Part 2 presents the general framework of PUG and its system of polarities.",
        "Part 3 proposes several examples of PUG and the translation in PUG of rewriting grammars, TAG, HPSG and LFG.",
        "We hope that these translations shed light on some common features of these formalisms."
