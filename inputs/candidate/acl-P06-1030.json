        "We have developed an automated Japanese essay scoring system called Jess.",
        "The system needs expert writings rather than expert raters to build the evaluation model.",
        "By detecting statistical outliers of predetermined aimed essay features compared with many professional writings for each prompt, our system can evaluate essays.",
        "The following three features are examined: (1) rhetoric – syntactic variety, or the use of various structures in the arrangement of phases, clauses, and sentences, (2) organization – characteristics associated with the orderly presentation of ideas, such as rhetorical features and linguistic cues, and (3) content – vocabulary related to the topic, such as relevant information and precise or specialized vocabulary.",
        "The final evaluation score is calculated by deducting from a perfect score assigned by a learning process using editorials and columns from the Mainichi Daily News newspaper.",
        "A diagnosis for the essay is also given."

        "When giving an essay test, the examiner expects a written essay to reflect the writing ability of the ex-aminee.",
        "A variety of factors, however, can affect scores in a complicated manner.",
        "Cooper (1984) states that “various factors including the writer, topic, mode, time limit, examination situation, and rater can introduce error into the scoring of essays used to measure writing ability.” Most of these factors are present in giving tests, and the human rater, in particular, is a major error factor in the scoring of essays.",
        "In fact, many other factors influence the scoring of essay tests, as listed below, and much research has been devoted.",
        "• Handwriting skill (handwriting quality, spelling) (Chase, 1979; Marshall and Powers, 1969) • Serial effects of rating (the order in which essay answers are rated) (Hughes et al., 1983) .",
        "Topic selection (how should essays written on different topics be rated?)",
        "(Meyer, 1939) • Other error factors (writer’s gender, ethnic group, etc.)",
        "(Chase, 1986)",
        "In recent years, with the aim of removing these error factors and establishing fairness, considerable research has been performed on computer-based automated essay scoring (AES) systems (Burstein et al., 1998; Foltz et al., 1999; Page et al., 1997; Powers et al., 2000; Rudner and Liang, 2002).",
        "The AES systems provide the users with prompt feedback to improve their writings.",
        "Therefore, many practical AES systems have been used.",
        "E-rater (Burstein et al., 1998), developed by the Educational Testing Service, began being used for operational scoring of the Analytical Writing Assessment in the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), an entrance examination for business graduate schools, in February 1999, and it has scored approximately 360,000 essays per year.",
        "The system includes several independent NLP-based modules for identifying features relevant to the scoring guide from three categories: syntax, discourse, and topic.",
        "Each of the feature-recognition modules correlate the essay scores with assigned by human readers.",
        "E-rater uses a model-building module to select and weight predictive features for essay scoring.",
        "Project Essay",
        "Grade (PEG), which was the first automated essay scorer, uses a regression model like e-rater (Page et al., 1997).",
        "IntelliMetric (Elliot, 2003) was first commercially released by Vantage Learning in January 1998 and was the first AI-based essay-scoring tool available to educational agencies.",
        "The system internalizes the pooled wisdom of many expert scorers.",
        "The Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) is a set of software tools for scoring the quality of the conceptual content of essays based on latent semantic analysis (Foltz et al., 1999).",
        "The Bayesian Essay Test Scoring sYstem (BETSY) is a windows-based program that classifies text based on trained material.",
        "The features include multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes models (Rudner and Liang, 2002).",
        "Note that all above-mentioned systems are based on the assumption that the true quality of essays must be defined by human judges.",
        "However, Bennet and Bejar (1998) have criticized the overreliance on human ratings as the sole criterion for evaluating computer performance because ratings are typically based as a constructed rubric that may ultimately achieve acceptable reliability at the cost of validity.",
        "In addition, Friedman, in research during the 1980s, found that holistic ratings by human raters did not award particularly high marks to professionally written essays mixed in with student productions.",
        "This is a kind of negative halo effect: create a bad impression, and you will be scored low on everything.",
        "Thus, Bereiter (2003) insists that another approach to doing better than ordinary human raters would be to use expert writers rather than expert raters.",
        "Reputable professional writers produce sophisticated and easy-to-read essays.",
        "The use of professional writings as the criterion, whether the evaluation is based on holistic or trait rating, has an advantage, described below.",
        "The methods based on expert rater evaluations require much effort to set up the model for each prompt.",
        "For example, e-rater and PEG use some sort of regression approaches in setting up the statistical models.",
        "Depending on how many variables are involved, these models may require thousands of cases to derive stable regression weights.",
        "BETSY requires the Bayesian rules, and IntelliMetric, the AI-based rules.",
        "Thus, the methodology limits the grader’s practical utility to large-scale testing operations in which such data collection is feasible.",
        "On the other hand, a method based on professional writings can overcome this; i.e., in our system, we need not set up a model simulating a human rater because thousands of articles by professional writers can easily be obtained via various electronic media.",
        "By detecting a statistical outlier to predetermined essay features compared with many professional writings for each prompt, our system can evaluate essays.",
        "In Japan, it is possible to obtain complete articles from the Mainichi Daily News newspaper up to 2005 from Nichigai Associates, Inc. and from the Nihon Keizai newspaper up to 2004 from Nikkei Books and Software, Inc. for purposes of linguistic study.",
        "In short, it is relatively easy to collect editorials and columns (e.g., “Yoroku”) on some form of electronic media for use as essay models.",
        "Literary works in the public domain can be accessed from Aozora Bunko (http://www.aozora.gr.jp/).",
        "Furthermore, with regard to morphological analysis, the basis of Japanese natural language processing, a number of free Japanese morphological analyzers are available.",
        "These include JUMAN (http://www-lab25.kuee.kyotou.ac.jp/nlresource/juman.html), developed by the Language Media Laboratory of Kyoto University, and ChaSen (http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp/, used in this study) from the Matsumoto Laboratory of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.",
        "Likewise, for syntactic analysis, free resources are available such as KNP (http://www-lab25.",
        "kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nlresource/knp.html) from Kyoto University, SAX and BUP (http://cactus.aistnara.ac.jp/lab/nlt/f sax,bup}.html) from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, and the MSLR parser (http://tanaka-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/ pub/mslr/index -j.html) from the Tanaka Tokunaga Laboratory of the Tokyo Institute of Technology.",
        "With resources such as these, we prepared tools for computer processing of the articles and columns that we collect as essay models.",
        "In addition, for the scoring of essays, where it is essential to evaluate whether content is suitable, i.e., whether a written essay responds appropriately to the essay prompt, it is becoming possible for us to use semantic search technologies not based on pattern matching as used by search engines on the Web.",
        "The methods for implementing such technologies are explained in detail by Ishioka and Kameda (1999) and elsewhere.",
        "We believe that this statistical outlier detection ap",
        "proach to using published professional essays and columns as models makes it possible to develop a system essentially superior to other AES systems.",
        "We have named this automated Japanese essay scoring system “Jess.” This system evaluates essays based on three features : (1) rhetoric, (2) organization, and (3) content, which are basically the same as the structure, organization, and content used by e-rater.",
        "Jess also allows the user to designate weights (allotted points) for each of these essay features.",
        "If the user does not explicitly specify the point allotment, the default weights are 5, 2, and 3 for structure, organization, and content, respectively, for a total of 10 points.",
        "(Incidentally, a perfect score in e-rater is 6.)",
        "This default point allotment in which “rhetoric” is weighted higher than “organization” and “content” is based on the work of Watanabe et al.",
        "(1988).",
        "In that research, 15 criteria were given for scoring essays: (1) wrong/omitted characters, (2) strong vocabulary, (3) character usage, (4) grammar, (5) style, (6) topic relevance, (7) ideas, (8) sentence structure, (9) power of expression, (10) knowledge, (11) logic/consistency, (12) power of thinking/judgment, (13) complacency, (14) nuance, and (15) affinity.",
        "Here, correlation coefficients were given to reflect the evaluation value of each of these criteria.",
        "For example, (3) character usage, which is deeply related to “rhetoric,” turned out to have the highest correlation coefficient at 0.58, and (1) wrong/omitted characters was relatively high at 0.36.",
        "In addition, (8) sentence structure and (11) logic/consistency, which is deeply related to “organization,” had correlation coefficients of 0.32 and 0.26, respectively, both lower than that of “rhetoric,” and (6) topic relevance and (14) nuance, which are though to be deeply related to “content,” had correlation coefficients of 0.27 and 0.32, respectively.",
        "Our system, Jess, is the first automated Japanese essay scorer and has become most famous in Japan, since it was introduced in February 2005 in a headline in the Asahi Daily News, which is well known as the most reliable and most representative newspaper of Japan.",
        "The following sections describe the scoring criteria of Jess in detail.",
        "Sections 2, 3, and 4 examine rhetoric, organization, and content, respectively.",

        "These metrics are broken down further into various statistical quantities in the following sections.",
        "The distributions of these statistical quantities were obtained from the editorials and columns stored on the Mainichi Daily News CD-ROMs.",
        "Though most of these distributions are asymmetrical (skewed), they are each treated as a distribution of an ideal essay.",

        "Illustration: A conjunctive relationship most typified by the phrase “for example” having a structure that either explains or demonstrates by example.",
        "The “reverse connection” structure comes in the following types.",

        "In the scoring, we also determined whether the pattern in which these conjunctive relationships appeared in the essay was singular compared to that in the model editorials.",
        "This was accomplished by considering a trigram model (Jelinek, 1991) for the appearance patterns of forward and reverse connections.",

        "As shown by this example, an occurrence probability that is greater for no prior information would indicate that the forward-connection and reverse-connection appearance pattern is singular, in which case the points initially allocated to conjunctive relationships in a discussion would be reduced.",

        "Examining the scores for essay C, for example, we see that e-rater gave a perfect score of 6, while Jess gave only a score of 5 after converting to e-rater’s 6-point system.",
        "In other words, the length of the essay could not compensate for various weak points in the essay under Jess’s point-deduction system.",
        "The fifth column in Table 2 shows the processing time (CPU time) for Jess.",
        "The computer used was Plat’Home Standard System 801S using an 800-MHz Intel Pentium III running RedHat 7.2.",
        "The Jess program is written in C shell script, jgawk, jsed, and C, and comes to just under 10,000 lines.",
        "In addition to the ChaSen morphological analysis system, Jess also needs the kakasi kanji/kana converter program (http://kakasi.namagu.org/) to operate.",
        "At present, it runs only on UNIX.",
        "Jess can be executed on the Web at http://coca.rd.dnc.ac.jp/jess/."

        "Four hundred eighty applicants who were eager to be hired by a certain company entered their essays using a Web form without a time restriction, with the size of the text restricted implicitly by the Web screen, to about 800 characters.",
        "The theme of the essay was “What does working mean in your life.” Table 3 summarizes the correlation coefficients between the Jess score, average score of expert raters, and score of the linguistic understanding test (LUT), developed by Recruit Management Solutions Co., Ltd.",
        "The LUT is designed to measure the ability to grasp the correct meaning of words that are the elements of a sentence, and to understand the composition and the summary of a text.",
        "Five expert raters reted the essays, and three of these scored each essay independently.",
        "We found that the correlation between the Jess score and the average of the expert raters’ scores is not small (0.57), and is larger than the correlation coefficient between the expert raters’ scores of 0.48.",
        "That means that Jess is superior to the expert raters on average, and is substitutable for them.",
        "Note that the restriction of the text size (800 characters in this case) caused the low correlation owing to the difficulty in evaluating the organization and the development of the arguments; the essay scores even in expert rater tend to be dispersed.",
        "We also found that neither the expert raters nor Jess, had much correlation with LUT, which shows that LUT does not reflect features indicating writing ability.",
        "That is, LUT measures quite different laterals from writing ability.",
        "Another experiment using 143 university-students’ essays collected at the National Institute for Japanese Language shows a similar result: for the essays on “smoking,” the correlation between Jess and the expert raters was 0.83, which is higher than the average correlation of expert raters (0.70); for the essays on “festivals in Japan,” the former is 0.84, the latter, 0.73.",
        "Three of four raters graded each essay independently."

      "text": [
        "An automated Japanese essay scoring system called Jess has been created for scoring essays in college-entrance exams.",
        "This system has been shown to be valid for essays of 800 to 1,600 characters.",
        "Jess, however, uses editorials and columns taken from the Mainichi Daily News newspaper as learning models, and such models are not sufficient for learning terms used in scientific and technical fields such as computers.",
        "Consequently, we found that Jess could return a low evaluation of “content” even for an essay that responded well to the essay prompt.",
        "When analyzing content, a mechanism is needed for automatically selecting",
        "a term-document cooccurrence matrix in accordance with the essay targeted for evaluation.",
        "This enable the users to avoid reverse-engineering that poor quality essays would produce perfect scores, because thresholds for detecting the outliers on rhetoric features may be varied."
