        "Although several researchers (Kawai et al., 1984; McCoy et al., 1996; Schneider and McCoy, 1998; Tschichold et al., 1997) have shown that rule-based methods are effective to detecting grammatical errors in the writing of learners of English, it has been pointed out that it is hard to write rules for detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage.",
        "To be precise, it is hard to write rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns which are particularly important in detecting these errors (Kawai et al., 1984).",
        "The major reason for this is that whether a noun is a mass noun or a count noun greatly depends on its meaning or its surrounding context (refer to Allan (1980) and Bond (2005) for details of the mass count distinction).",
        "The above errors are very common among Japanese learners of English (Kawai et al., 1984; Izumi et al., 2003).",
        "This is perhaps because the",
        "Japanese language does not have a mass count distinction system similar to that of English.",
        "Thus, it is favorable for error detection systems aiming at Japanese learners to be capable of detecting these errors.",
        "In other words, such systems need to somehow distinguish mass and count nouns.",
        "This paper proposes a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns in context to complement the conventional rules for detecting grammatical errors.",
        "In this method, first, training data, which consist of instances of mass and count nouns, are automatically generated from a corpus.",
        "Then, decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns are learned from the training data.",
        "Finally, the decision lists are used with the conventional rules to detect the target errors.",
        "The proposed method requires a corpus to learn decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns.",
        "General corpora such as newspaper articles can be used for the purpose.",
        "However, a drawback to it is that there are differences in character between general corpora and the writing of non-native learners of English (Granger, 1998; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).",
        "For instance, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) point out that the word concentrate is usually used as a noun in a general corpus whereas it is a verb 91% of the time in essays written by non-native learners of English.",
        "Consequently, the differences affect the performance of the proposed method.",
        "In order to reduce the drawback, the proposed method is augmented by feedback; it takes as feedback learners’ essays whose errors are corrected by a teacher of English (hereafter, referred to as the feedback corpus).",
        "In essence, the feedback corpus could be added to a general corpus to generate training data.",
        "Or, ideally training data could be generated only from the feedback corpus just as",
        "from a general corpus.",
        "However, this causes a serious problem in practice since the size of the feedback corpus is normally far smaller than that of a general corpus.",
        "To make it practical, this paper discusses the problem and explores its solution.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the method for detecting the target errors based on the mass count distinction.",
        "Section 3 explains how the method is augmented by feedback.",

        "Nevertheless, we can tell that the former is a count noun and the latter is a mass noun from the contexts.",

        "In example 1, we can tell that the paper refers to something that can be read such as a newspaper or a scientific paper from read, and therefore it is a count noun.",
        "Likewise, in example 2, we can tell that the paper refers to a certain substance from made and pulp, and therefore it is a mass noun.",
        "Taking this observation into account, we define the template based on words surrounding the target noun.",
        "To formalize the template, we will use a random variable MC that takes either mass or count to denote that the target noun is a mass noun or a count noun, respectively.",
        "We will also use w and C to denote a word and a certain context around the target noun, respectively.",

        "Only an exception is “DL fbl (BNC)”.",
        "The reason is that the size of BNC is far larger than that of the feedback corpus and thus it did not affect the performance.",
        "This also explains that simply adding the feedback corpus to the general corpus achieved little or no improvement as “DL (EDR+FB)” and “DL (BNC+FB)” show.",
        "Unlike these, both “DL fb2 (BNC)” and “DL fb2 (EDR)” benefit from feedback since the effect of the general corpus is limited to some extent by the log function in Equation (9).",
        "Because of this, both benefit from feedback despite the differences in size between the feedback corpus and the general corpus.",
        "Although the experimental results have shown that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting the target errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English, even the best performing method (DL fb2 (EDR)) made 30 false-negatives and 29 false-positives.",
        "About 70% of the false-negatives were errors that required other sources of information than the mass count distinction to be detected.",
        "For example, extra definite articles (e.g., *the traveling) cannot be detected even if the correct mass count distinction is given.",
        "Thus, only a little improvement is expected in recall however much feedback corpus data become available.",
        "On the other hand, most of the",
        "false-positives were due to the decision lists themselves.",
        "Considering this, it is highly possible that precision will improve as the size of the feedback corpus increases."

        "This paper has proposed a feedback-augmented method for distinguishing mass and count nouns to complement the conventional rules for detecting grammatical errors.",
        "The experiments have shown that the proposed method detected 71% of the target errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English with a precision of 72% when it was augmented by feedback.",
        "From the results, we conclude that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage in the writing of Japanese learners of English.",
        "Although it is not taken into account in this paper, the feedback corpus contains further useful information.",
        "For example, we can obtain training data consisting of instances of errors by comparing the feedback corpus with its original corpus.",
        "Also, comparing it with the results of detection, we can know performance of each rule used in the detection, which make it possible to increase or decrease their log-likelihood ratios according to their performance.",
        "We will investigate how to exploit these sources of information in future work."
