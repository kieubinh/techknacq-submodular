        "Parallel bilingual corpora are critical resources for statistical machine translation (Brown 1993), and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie 1999).",
        "Additionally, parallel corpora have been exploited for various monolingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as word-sense disambiguation (Ng 2003) and paraphrase acquisition (Callison 2005).",
        "However, large scale parallel corpora are not readily available for most language pairs.",
        "Even where resources are available, such as for English-French, the data are usually restricted to government documents (e.g., the Hansard corpus, which consists of French-English translations of debates in the Canadian parliament) or newswire texts.",
        "The \"governmentese\" that characterizes these document collections cannot be used on its own to train data-driven machine translation systems for a range of domains and language pairs.",
        "With a sharply increasing number of bilingual web sites, web mining for parallel data becomes a promising solution to this knowledge acquisition problem.",
        "In an effort to estimate the amount of bilingual data on the web, (Ma and Liberman 1999) surveyed web pages in the de (German web site) domain, showing that of 150,000 websites in the .de domain, 10% are German-English bilingual.",
        "Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al. 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003; Zhang et al. 2006 ).",
        "These systems mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites, exploiting the fact that URLs of many parallel web pages are named with apparent patterns to facilitate website maintenance.",
        "Hence given a bilingual website, the mining systems use predefined URL patterns to discover candidate parallel documents within the site.",
        "Then content-based features will be used to verify the translational equivalence of the candidate pairs.",
        "However, due to the diversity of web page styles and website maintenance mechanisms, bilingual websites use varied naming schemes for parallel documents.",
        "For example, the United Nation’s website, which contains thousands of parallel pages, simply names the majority of its web pages with some computer generated ad-hoc URLs.",
        "Such a website then cannot be mined by the URL pattern-based mining scheme.",
        "To further improve the coverage of web mining, other patterns associated with translational parallelism are called for.",
        "Besides, URL pattern-based mining may raise concerns on high bandwidth cost and slow download speed.",
        "Based on descriptions of (Nie et al. 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004), the mining process requires a full host crawling to collect URLs before using URL patterns to discover the parallel documents.",
        "Since in many bilingual web sites, parallel documents are much sparser than comparable documents, a significant portion of internet bandwidth is wasted on downloading web pages without translational counterparts.",
        "Furthermore, there is a lack of discussion on the quality of mined data.",
        "To support machine translation, parallel sentences should be extracted from the mined parallel documents.",
        "However, current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al. 1991; Gale & Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen",
        "1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc.)",
        "are targeted on traditional textual documents.",
        "Due to the noisy nature of the web documents, parallel web pages may consist of non-translational content and many out-of-vocabulary words, both of which reduce sentence alignment accuracy.",
        "To improve sentence alignment performance on the web data, the similarity of the HTML tag structures between the parallel web documents should be leveraged properly in the sentence alignment model.",
        "In order to improve the quality of mined data and increase the mining coverage and speed, this paper proposes a new web parallel data mining scheme.",
        "Given a pair of parallel web pages as seeds, the Document Object Model1 (DOM) is used to represent the web pages as a pair of DOM trees.",
        "Then a stochastic DOM tree alignment model is used to align translationally equivalent content, including both textual chunks and hyperlinks, between the DOM tree pairs.",
        "The parallel hyperlinks discovered are regarded as anchors to new parallel data.",
        "This makes the mining scheme an iterative process.",
        "The new mining scheme has three advantages: (i) Mining coverage is increased.",
        "Parallel hyperlinks referring to parallel web page is a general and reliable pattern for parallel data mining.",
        "Many bilingual websites not supporting URL pattern-based mining scheme support this new mining scheme.",
        "Our mining experiment shows that, using the new web mining scheme, the web mining throughput is increased by 32%; (ii) The quality of the mined data is improved.",
        "By lever-aging the web pages’ HTML structures, the sentence aligner supported by the DOM tree alignment model outperforms conventional ones by 7% in both precision and recall; (iii) The bandwidth cost is reduced by restricting web page downloads to the links that are very likely to be parallel.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce the related work.",
        "In Section 3, a new web parallel data mining scheme is presented.",
        "Three component technologies, the DOM tree alignment model, the sentence aligner, and the candidate parallel page verification model are presented in Section 4, 5, and 6.",

        "A DOM tree alignment model is proposed to identify translationally equivalent text chunks and hyperlinks between two HTML documents.",
        "Parallel hyperlinks are used to pinpoint new parallel data, and make parallel data mining a recursive process.",
        "Parallel text chunks are fed into sentence aligner to extract parallel sentences.",
        "Benchmarks show that sentence aligner supported by DOM tree alignment achieves performance enhancement by 7% in both precision and recall.",
        "Besides, the new mining scheme reduce the bandwidth cost by 8~9 times on average compared with the URL pattern-based mining scheme.",
        "In addition, the new mining scheme is more general and reliable, and is able to mine more data.",
        "Using the new mining scheme alone, the mining throughput is increased by 32%, and when combined with URL pattern-based scheme, the mining throughput is increased by 41%."
