        "Because of the popularity of the Vector Space Model (VSM) in text information processing, document indexing (term extraction) acts as a prerequisite step in most text information processing tasks such as Information Retrieval (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) and Text Categorization (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "It is empirically known that the indexing scheme is a nontrivial complication to system performance, especially for some Asian languages in which there are no explicit word margins and even no natural semantic unit.",
        "Concretely, in Chinese Text Categorization tasks, the two most important index1 This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60573187 and 60321002, and the Tsinghua-ALVIS Project cosponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60520130299 and EU FP6.",
        "ing units (feature terms) are word and character-bigram, so the problem is: which kind of terms2 should be chosen as the feature terms, words or character-bigrams?",
        "To obtain an all-sided idea about feature choice beforehand, we review here the possible feature variants (or, options).",
        "First, at the word level, we can do stemming, do stop-word pruning, include POS (Part of Speech) information, etc.",
        "Second, term combinations (such as “word-bigram”, “word + word-bigram”, “character-bigram + character-trigram”3, etc.)",
        "can also be used as features (Nie et al., 2000).",
        "But, for Chinese Text Categorization, the “word or bigram” question is fundamental.",
        "They have quite different characteristics (e.g. bigrams overlap each other in text, but words do not) and influence the classification performance in different ways.",
        "In Information Retrieval, it is reported that bi-gram indexing schemes outperforms word schemes to some or little extent (Luk and Kwok, 1997; Leong and Zhou 1998; Nie et al., 2000).",
        "Few similar comparative studies have been reported for Text Categorization (Li et al., 2003) so far in literature.",
        "Text categorization and Information Retrieval are tasks that sometimes share identical aspects (Sebastiani, 2002) apart from term extraction (document indexing), such as tfidf term weighting and performance evaluation.",
        "Nevertheless, they are different tasks.",
        "One of the generally accepted connections between Information Retrieval and Text Categorization is that an information retrieval task could be partially taken as a binary classification problem with the query as the only positive training document.",
        "From this",
        "viewpoint, an IR task and a general TC task have a large difference in granularity.",
        "To better illustrate this difference, an example is present here.",
        "The words “制 (film producer)” and “译$q 片 (dubbed film)” should be taken as different terms in an IR task because a document with one would not necessarily be a good match for a query with the other, so the bigram “制(film production)” is semantically not a shared part of these two words, i.e. not an appropriate feature term.",
        "But in a Text Categorization task, both words might have a similar meaning at the category level (“film” category, generally), which enables us to regard the bigram “制” as a semantically acceptable representative word snippet for them, or for the category.",
        "There are also differences in some other aspects of IR and TC.",
        "So it is significant to make a detailed comparison and analysis here on the relative value of words and bigrams as features in Text Categorization.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 shows some experiments on different document collections to observe the common trends in the performance curves of the word-scheme and bigram-scheme; Section 3 qualitatively analyses these trends; Section 4 makes some statistical analysis to corroborate the issues addressed in Section 3; Section 5 summarizes the results and concludes."

        "The word is a natural semantic unit in Chinese language and expresses a complete meaning in text.",
        "The bigram is not a natural semantic unit and might not express a complete meaning in text, but there are also reasons for the bigram to be a good feature term.",
        "First, two-character words and three-character words account for most of all multi-character Chinese words (Liu and Liang, 1986).",
        "A two-character word can be substituted by the same bigram.",
        "At the granularity of most categorization tasks, a three-character words can often be substituted by one of its sub-bigrams (namely the “intraword bigram” in the next section) without a change of meaning.",
        "For instance, “标赛” is a sub-bigram of the word “锦标 赛UT (tournament)” and could represent it without ambiguity.",
        "Second, a bigram may overlap on two successive words (namely the “interword bigram” in the next section), and thus to some extent fills the role of a word-bigram.",
        "The word-bigram as a more definite (although more sparse) feature surely helps the classification.",
        "For instance, “ 气 预” is a bigram overlapping on the two successive words “ 天气 `1 (weather)” and “ 预报IR (forecast)”, and could almost replace the word-bigram (also a phrase) “天气预报(weather forecast)”, which is more likely to be a representative feature of the category “气象 学 (meteorology)” than either word.",
        "Third, due to the first issue, bigram features have some capability of identifying OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words11, and help improve the recall of classification.",
        "The above issues state the advantages of bigrams compared with words.",
        "But in the first and second issue, the equivalence between bigram and word or word-bigram is not perfect.",
        "For instance, the word “文学(literature)” is a also sub-bigram of the word “天文学 3C �?",
        "(astronomy)”, but their meanings are completely different.",
        "So the loss and distortion of semantic information is a disadvantage of bigram features over word features.",
        "Furthermore, one-character words cover about 7% of words and more than 30% of word occurrences in the Chinese language; they are effevtive in the word scheme and are not involved in the above issues.",
        "Note that the impact of effective one-character words on the classification is not as large as their total frequency, because the high frequency ones are often too common to have a good classification power, for instance, the word “的 (of, ‘s)”."

        "Except for a few models such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990), most models assume the feature space to be orthogonal.",
        "This assumption might not affect the effectiveness of the models, but the semantic redundancy and complementation among the feature terms do impact on the classification efficiency at a given dimensionality.",
        "According to the first issue addressed in the previous subsection, a bigram might cover for more than one word.",
        "For instance, the bigram “织物” is a sub-bigram of the words “织物A (fabric)”, “棉织物4 �/ VA (cotton fabric)”, “针织物�/ VA (knitted fabric)”, and also a good substitute of",

        "For instance, the bigram “篇 小 /J,, ” is a sub-bigram of the word-bigrams (phrases) “ 短篇小说 /J,4A(short story)”, “中 篇小说/J,4A(novelette)”, “长篇小说 4,4(novel)” and also a good substitute for them.",
        "So, as an addition to the second issue stated in the previous subsection, a bigram feature might even cover for more than one word-bigram.",
        "On the other hand, bigrams features are also redundant with regard to word features associated with them.",
        "For instance, the “锦 标 U.T” and “标 赛 ” are both sub-bigrams of the previously mentioned word “锦标赛”.",
        "In some cases, more than one sub-bigram can be a good representative of a word.",
        "We make a word list and a bigram list sorted by the feature selection criterion in a descending order.",

        "The relative redundancy rate in the word list keeps even while the dimensionality varies to a certain extent, because words that share a common sub-bigram might not have similar statistics and thus be scattered in the word feature list.",
        "Note that these words are possibly ranked lower in the list than the sub-bigram because feature selection criteria (such as Chi) often prefer higher frequency terms to lower frequency ones, and every word containing the bigram certainly has a lower frequency than the bigram itself.",
        "The relative redundancy in the bigram list might be not as even as in the word list.",
        "Good (representative) sub-bigrams of a word are quite likely to be ranked close to the word itself.",
        "For instance, “作曲” and “曲 家 ” are sub-bigrams of the word “作曲家 *(music composer)”, both the bigrams and the word are on the top of the lists.",
        "Theretofore, the bigram list has a relatively large redundancy rate at low dimensionalities.",
        "The redundancy rate should decrease along with the increas of dimensionality for: (a) the relative redundancy in the word list counteracts the redundancy in the bigram list, because the words that contain a same bigram are gradually included as the dimensionality increases; (b) the proportion of interword bigrams increases in the bigram list and there is generally no redundancy between interword bigrams and intraword bigrams.",
        "Last, there are more bigram features than word features because bigrams can overlap each other in the text but words can not.",
        "Thus the bigrams as a whole should theoretically contain more information than the words as a whole.",
