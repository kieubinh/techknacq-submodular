        "The trend in information retrieval systems is from document to sub-document retrieval, such as sentences in a summarization system and words or phrases in question-answering system.",

        "In this paper, we compare and contrast IDF with inverse sentence frequency (ISF) and inverse term frequency (ITF).",
        "A direct comparison reveals that all language models are highly correlated; however, the average ISF and ITF values are 5.5 and 10.4 higher than IDF.",

        "The vector based information retrieval model identifies relevant documents by comparing query terms with terms from a document corpus.",
        "The most common corpus weighting scheme is the term frequency (TF) x inverse document frequency (IDF), where TF is the number of times a term appears in a document, and IDF reflects the distribution of terms within the corpus (Salton and Buckley, 1988).",
        "Ideally, the system should assign the highest weights to terms with the most discriminative power.",
        "One component of the corpus weight is the language model used.",
        "The most common language model is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), which considers the distribution of terms between documents (see equation (1)).",
        "IDF has played a central role in retrieval systems since it was first introduced more than thirty years ago (Sparck Jones, 1972).",
        "N is the total number of corpus documents; ni is the number of documents that contain at least one occurrence of the term ti; and ti is a term, which is typically stemmed.",
        "Although information retrieval systems are trending from document to sub-document retrieval, such as sentences for summarization and words, or phrases for question answering, systems continue to calculate corpus weights on a language model of documents.",
        "Logic suggests that if a system identifies sentences rather than documents, it should use a corpus weighting scheme based on the number of sentences rather than the number documents.",
        "That is, the system should replace IDF with the Inverse Sentence Frequency (ISF), where N in (1) is the total number of sentences and ni is the number of sentences with term i.",
        "Similarly, if the system retrieves terms or phrases then IDF should be replaced with the Inverse Term Frequency (ITF), where N in (1) is the vocabulary size, and ni is the number of times a term or phrases appears in the corpus.",
        "The challenge is that although document language models have had unprecedented empirical success, language models based on a sentence or term do not appear to work well (Robertson, 2004).",
        "Our goal is to explore the transition from the document to sentence and term spaces, such that we may uncover where the language models start",
        "to break down.",
        "In this paper, we explore this goal by answering the following questions: How correlated are the raw document, sentence, and term spaces?",
        "How correlated are the IDF, ISF, and ITF values?",
        "How well does each language models conform to Zipf’ s Law and what are the slope coefficients?",
        "How sensitive is IDF with respect to subsets of a corpus selected at random, from journals, or from document sections including the abstract and body of an article?",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the theoretical and practical implications of this study; Section 3 describes the experimental design we used to study document, sentence, and term, spaces in our corpora of more than one-hundred thousand full-text documents; Section 4 discusses the results; and Section 5 draws conclusions from this study."

        "The transition from document to sentence to term spaces has both theoretical and practical ramifications.",
        "From a theoretical standpoint, the success of TFxIDF is problematic because the model combines two different event spaces – the space of terms in TF and of documents in IDF.",
        "In addition to resolving the discrepancy between event spaces, the foundational theories in information science, such as Zipf’ s Law (Zipf, 1949) and Shannon’s Theory (Shannon, 1948) consider only a term event space.",
        "Thus, establishing a direct connection between the empirically successful IDF and the theoretically based ITF may enable a connection to previously adopted information theories.",
        "Understanding the relationship among document, sentence and term spaces also has practical importance.",
        "The size and nature of text corpora has changed dramatically since the first IDF experiments.",
        "Consider the synthetic data shown in Figure 1, which reflects the increase in both vocabulary and corpora size from small (S), to medium (M), to large (L).",
        "The small vocabulary size is from the Cranfield corpus used in Sparck Jones (1972), medium is from the 0.9 million terms in the Heritage Dictionary (Pickett 2000) and large is the 1.3 million terms in our corpus.",
        "The small number of documents is from the Cranfield corpus in Sparck Jones (1972), medium is 100,000 from our corpus, and large is 1 million As a document corpus becomes sufficiently large, the rate of new terms in the vocabulary decreases.",
        "Thus, in practice the rate of growth on the x-axis of Figure 1 will slow as the corpus size increases.",
        "In contrast, the number of documents (shown on the y-axis in Figure 1) remains unbounded.",
        "It is not clear which of the two components in equation (1), the log2 (N) , which reflects the number of documents, or the log2 (ni) , which reflects the distribution of terms between documents within the corpus will dominate the equation.",
        "Our strategy is to explore these differences empirically.",
        "In addition to changes in the vocabulary size and the number of documents, the average number of terms per document has increased from 7.9, 12.2 and 32 in Sparck Jones (1972), to 20 and 32 in Salton and Buckley (1988), to 4,981 in our corpus.",
        "The transition from abstracts to full-text documents explains the dramatic difference in document length; however, the impact with respect to the distribution of terms and motivates us to explore differences between the language used in an abstract, and that used in the body of a document.",
        "One last change from the initial experiments is a trend towards an on-line environment, where calculating IDF is prohibitively expensive.",
        "This suggests a need to explore the stability of IDF so that system designers can make an informed decision regarding how many documents should be included in the IDF calculations.",
        "We explore the stability of IDF in random, journal, and document section subsets of the corpus."
