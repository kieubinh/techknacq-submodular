        "It includes dialog-based (both voice and online chat) and email support a user receives from a professional agent.",
        "Call centers have become a central focus of most companies as they allow them to be in direct contact with their customers to solve product-related and services-related issues and also for grievance redress.",
        "A typical call center agent handles over a hundred calls in a day.",
        "Gigabytes of data is produced every day in the form of speech audio, speech transcripts, email, etc.",
        "This data is valuable for doing analysis at many levels, e.g., to obtain statistics about the type of problems and issues associated with different products and services.",
        "This data can also be used to evaluate agents and train them to improve their performance.",
        "Todayâ€™s call centers handle a wide variety of domains such as computer sales and support, mobile phones and apparels.",
        "To analyze the calls in any domain, analysts need to identify the key issues in the domain.",
        "Further, there may be variations within a domain, say mobile phones, based on the service providers.",
        "The analysts generate a domain model through inspection of the call records (audio, transcripts and emails).",
        "Such a model can include a listing of the call categories, types of problems solved in each category, listing of the customer issues, typical questions-answers, appropriate call opening and closing styles, etc.",
        "In essence, these models provide a structured view of the domain.",
        "Manually building such models for various domains may become prohibitively resource intensive.",
        "Another important point to note is that these models are dynamic in nature and change over time.",
        "As a new version of a mobile phone is introduced, software is launched in a country, a sudden attack of a virus, the model may need to be refined.",
        "Hence, an automated way of creating and maintaining such a model is important.",

        "Current automatic speech recognition technology for telephone calls have moderate to high word error rates (Padmanabhan et al., 2002).",
        "We applied various feature engineering techniques to combat the noise introduced by the speech recognition system and applied text clustering techniques to group topically similar calls together.",

        "According to (Padmanabhan et al., 2002), word-error rates are in the range of 7 8% for read speech whereas for telephonic speech it is more than 30%.",
        "This degradation is due to the spontaneity of speech as well as the telephone channel.",
        "Most speech recognition systems perform well when trained for a particular accent (Lawson et al., 2003).",
        "However, with call centers now being located in different parts of the world, the requirement of handling different accents by the same speech recognition system further increases word error rates.",
        "Automatic Taxonomy Generation (ATG): In recent years there has been some work relating to mining domain specific documents to build an ontology.",
        "Mostly these systems rely on parsing (both shallow and deep) to extract relationships between key concepts within the domain.",
        "The ontology is constructed from this by linking the extracted concepts and relations (Jiang and Tan, 2005).",
        "However, the documents contain well formed sentences which allow for parsers to be used.",
        "Call Center Analytics: A lot of work on automatic call type classification for the purpose of categorizing calls (Tang et al., 2003), call routing (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Haffner et al., 2003), obtaining call log summaries (Douglas et al., 2005), agent assisting and monitoring (Mishne et al., 2005) has appeared in the past.",

        "Extraction of key phrases, which can be used as features, from the noisy transcribed calls is an important issue.",
        "For manually transcribed calls, which do not have any noise, in (Mishne et al., 2005) a phrase level significance estimate is obtained by combining word level estimates that were computed by comparing the frequency of a word in a domain-specific corpus to its frequency in an open-domain corpus.",
        "In (Wright et al., 1997) phrase level significance was obtained for noisy transcribed data where the phrases are clustered and combined into finite state machines.",

        "The transcription server, used for transcribing the call center data, is an IBM research prototype.",
        "The speech recognition system was trained on 300 hours of data comprising of help desk calls sampled at 6KHz.",
        "The transcription output comprises information about the recognized words along with their durations, i.e., beginning and ending times of the words.",
        "Further, speaker turns are marked, so the agent and customer portions of speech are demarcated without exactly naming which part is the agent and which the customer.",
        "It should be noted that the call center agents and the customers were of different nationalities having varied accents and this further made the job of the speech recognizer hard.",
        "The resultant transcriptions have a word error rate of about 40%.",
        "This high error rate implies that many wrong deletions of actual words and wrong insertion of dictionary words have taken place.",
        "Also often speaker turns are not correctly identified and voice portions of both speakers are assigned to a single speaker.",

        "A call center handles several hundred-thousand calls per year in various domains.",
        "It is very difficult to monitor the performance based on manual processing of the calls.",
        "The framework presented in this paper, allows a large part of this work to be automated.",
        "A domain specific model that is automatically learnt and updated based on the voice conversations allows the call center to identify problem areas quickly and allocate resources more effectively.",
        "In future we would like to semantically cluster the topic specific information so that redundant topics are eliminated from the list.",
        "We can use Automatic Taxonomy Generation(ATG) algorithms for document summarization (Kummamuru et al., 2004) to build topic taxonomies.",
        "We would also like to link our model to technical manuals, catalogs, etc.",
        "already available on the different topics in the given domain.",
        "Acknowledgements: We thank our colleagues Raghuram Krishnapuram and Sreeram Balakrish-nan for helpful discussions.",
        "We also thank Olivier Siohan from the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center for providing us with call transcriptions."
