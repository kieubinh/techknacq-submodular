        "Our long-term goal is to develop conversational robots with which we can have natural, fluent situated dialog.",
        "An inherent aspect of such situated dialog is reference to aspects of the physical environment in which the agents are situated.",
        "In this paper, we present a computational model which provides a context-dependent analysis of the environment in terms of spatial proximity.",
        "We show how we can use this model to ground spatial language that uses topological prepositions (“the ball near the box”) to identify objects in a scene.",
        "Proximity is ubiquitous in situated dialog, but there are deeper “cognitive” reasons for why we need a context-dependent model of proximity to facilitate fluent dialog with a conversational robot.",
        "This has to do with the cognitive load that processing proximity expressions imposes.",
        "Consider the examples in (1).",
        "Psycholinguistic data indicates that a spatial proximity expression (1b) presents a heavier cognitive load than a referring expression identifying an object purely on physical features (1a) yet is easier to process than a projective expression (1c) (van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2004).",

        "(1) a. the blue ball b. the ball near the box c. the ball to the right of the box",
        "One explanation for this preference is that feature-based descriptions are easier to resolve perceptually, with a further distinction among features as given in Figure 1, cf. (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "On the other hand, the interpretation and realization of spatial expressions requires effort and attention (Logan, 1994; Logan, 1995).",
        "Similarly we can distinguish between the cognitive loads of processing different forms of spatial relations.",
        "Focusing on static prepositions, topological prepositions have a lower cognitive load than projective prepositions.",
        "Topological prepositions (e.g. “at”, “near”) describe proximity to an object.",
        "Projective prepositions (e.g. “above”) describe a region in a particular direction from the object.",
        "Projective prepositions impose a higher cognitive load because we need to consider different spatial frames of reference (Krahmer and Theune, 1999; Moratz and Tenbrink, 2006).",
        "Now, if we want a robot to interact with other agents in a way that obeys the Principle of Minimal Cooperative Effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), it should adopt the simplest means to (spatially) refer to an object.",
        "However, research on spatial language in human-robot interaction has primarily focused on the use of projective prepositions.",
        "We currently lack a comprehensive model for topological prepositions.",
        "Without such a model,",
        "a robot cannot interpret spatial proximity expressions nor motivate their contextually and pragmatically appropriate use.",
        "In this paper, we present a model that addresses this problem.",
        "The model uses energy functions, modulated by visual and discourse salience, to model how spatial templates associated with other landmarks may interfere to establish what are contextually appropriate ways to locate a target relative to these landmarks.",
        "The model enables grounding of spatial expressions using spatial proximity to refer to objects in the environment.",
        "We focus on expressions using topological prepositions such as “near” or “at”.",

        "Overview §2 presents contextual effects we can observe in grounding spatial expressions, including the effect of interference on whether two objects may be considered proximal.",

        "These examples motivate the model in §3.",
        "Spatial reasoning is a complex activity that involves at least two levels of processing: a geometric level where metric, topological, and projective properties are handled, (Herskovits, 1986); and a functional level where the normal function of an entity affects the spatial relationships attributed to it in a context, cf. (Coventry and Garrod, 2004).",
        "We focus on geometric factors.",
        "Although a lot of experimental work has been done on spatial reasoning and language (cf. (Coventry and Garrod, 2004)), only Logan and Sadler (1996) examined topological prepositions in a context where functional factors were excluded.",
        "They introduced the notion of a spatial template.",
        "The template is centred on the landmark and identifies for each point in its space the acceptability of the spatial relationship between the landmark and the target appearing at that point being described by the preposition.",
        "Logan & Sadler examined various spatial prepositions this way.",
        "In their experiments, a human subject was shown sentences of the form “the X is [relation] the O”, each with a picture of a spatial configuration of an O in the center of an invisible 7-by-7 cell grid, and an X in one of the 48 surrounding positions.",
        "The subject then had to rate how well the sentence described the picture, on a scale from 1(bad) to 9(good).",
        "Figure 2 gives the mean goodness rating for the relation “near to” as a function of the position occupied by X (Logan and Sadler, 1996).",
        "It is clear from Figure 2 that ratings diminish as the distance between X and O increases, but also that even at the extremes of the grid the ratings were still above 1 (min.",
        "rating).",
        "Besides distance there are also other factors that determine the applicability of a proximal relation.",
        "For example, given prototypical size, the region denoted by “near the building” is larger than that of “near the apple” (Gapp, 1994).",
        "Moreover, an object’s salience influences the determination of the proximal region associated with it (Regier and Carlson, 2001; Roy, 2002).",
        "Finally, the two scenes in Figure 3 show interference as a contextual factor.",
        "For the scene on the left we can use “the blue box is near the black box” to describe object (c).",
        "This seems inappropriate in the scene on the right.",
        "Placing an object (d) beside",
        "(b) appears to interfere with the appropriateness of using a proximal relation to locate (c) relative to (b), even though the absolute distance between (c) and (b) has not changed.",
        "Thus, there is empirical evidence for several",
        "contextual factors determining the applicability of a proximal description.",
        "We argued that the location of other distractor objects in context may also interfere with this applicability.",

        "To represent distance we use a normalised distance function distnormalised (L, P, ARRAY), which returns a value between 0 and 1.1 The smaller the distance between L and P, the higher the absolute proximity value returned, i.e. the more acceptable it is to say that P is close to L. In this way, this component of the absolute proximity field captures the gradual gradation in applicability evident in Logan and Sadler (1996).",
