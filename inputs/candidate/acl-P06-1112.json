        "Answer Extraction is one of basic modules in open domain Question Answering (QA).",
        "It is to further process relevant sentences extracted with Passage / Sentence Retrieval and pinpoint exact answers using more linguistic-motivated analysis.",
        "Since QA turns to find exact answers rather than text snippets in recent years, answer extraction becomes more and more crucial.",
        "Typically, answer extraction works in the following steps:",
        "• Recognize expected answer type of a question.",
        "• Annotate relevant sentences with various types of named entities.",
        "• Regard the phrases annotated with the expected answer type as candidate answers.",
        "• Rank candidate answers.",
        "In the above work flow, answer extraction heavily relies on named entity recognition (NER).",
        "On one hand, NER reduces the number of candidate answers and eases answer ranking.",
        "On the other hand, the errors from NER directly degrade answer extraction performance.",
        "To our knowledge, most top ranked QA systems in TREC are supported by effective NER modules which may identify and classify more than 20 types of named entities (NE), such as abbreviation, music, movie, etc.",
        "However, developing such named entity recognizer is not trivial.",
        "Up to now, we haven’t found any paper relevant to QA-specific NER development.",
        "So, it is hard to follow their work.",
        "In this paper, we just use a general MUC-based NER, which makes our results reproducible.",
        "A general MUC-based NER can’t annotate a large number of NE classes.",
        "In this case, all noun phrases in sentences are regarded as candidate answers, which makes candidate answer sets much larger than those filtered by a well developed NER.",
        "The larger candidate answer sets result in the more difficult answer extraction.",
        "Previous methods working on surface word level, such as density-based ranking and pattern matching, may not perform well.",
        "Deeper linguistic analysis has to be conducted.",
        "This paper proposes a statistical method which exploring correlation of dependency relation paths to rank candidate answers.",
        "It is motivated by the observation that relations between proper answers and question phrases in candidate sentences are always similar to the corresponding relations in question.",
        "For example, the question ”What did Alfred Nobel invent?” and the",
        "candidate sentence ”... in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite.” For each question, firstly, dependency relation paths are defined and extracted from the question and each of its candidate sentences.",
        "Secondly, the paths from the question and the candidate sentence are paired according to question phrase mapping score.",
        "Thirdly, correlation between two paths of each pair is calculated by employing Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.",
        "The input of the calculation is correlations between dependency relations, which are estimated from a set of training path pairs.",
        "Lastly, a Maximum Entropy-based ranking model is proposed to incorporate the path correlations and rank candidate answers.",
        "Furthermore, sentence supportive measure are presented according to correlations of relation paths among question phrases.",
        "It is applied to re-rank the candidate answers extracted from the different candidate sentences.",
        "Considering phrases may provide more accurate information than individual words, we extract dependency relations on phrase level instead of word level.",
        "The experiment on TREC questions shows that our method significantly outperforms a density-based method by 50% in MRR and three state-of-the-art syntactic-based methods by up to 20% in MRR.",
        "Furthermore, we classify questions by judging whether NER is used.",
        "We investigate how these methods perform on the two question sets.",
        "The results indicate that our method achieves better performance than the other syntactic-based methods on both question sets.",

        "In recent years’ TREC Evaluation, most top ranked QA systems use syntactic information in answer extraction.",
        "Next, we will briefly discuss the main usages.",
        "(Kaisser and Becker, 2004) match a question into one of predefined patterns, such as ”When did Jack Welch retire from GE?” to the pattern ”When+did+NP+Verb+NPorPP”.",
        "For each question pattern, there is a set of syntactic structures for potential answer.",
        "Candidate answers are ranked by matching the syntactic structures.",
        "This method worked well on TREC questions.",
        "However, it is costing to manually construct question patterns and syntactic structures of the patterns.",
        "(Shen et al., 2005) classify question words into four classes target word, head word, subject word and verb.",
        "For each class, syntactic relation patterns which contain one question word and one proper answer are automatically extracted and scored from training sentences.",
        "Then, candidate answers are ranked by partial matching to the syntactic relation patterns using tree kernel.",
        "However, the criterion to classify the question words is not clear in their paper.",
        "Proper answers may have absolutely different relations with different subject words in sentences.",
        "They don’t consider the corresponding relations in questions.",
        "(Tanev et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005) compare syntactic relations in questions and those in answer sentences.",
        "(Tanev et al., 2004) reconstruct a basic syntactic template tree for a question, in which one of the nodes denotes expected answer position.",
        "Then, answer candidates for this question are ranked by matching sentence syntactic tree to the question template tree.",
        "Furthermore, the matching is weighted by lexical variations.",
        "(Wu et al., 2005) combine n-gram proximity search and syntactic relation matching.",
        "For syntactic relation matching, question tree and sentence subtree around a candidate answer are matched from node to node.",
        "Although the above systems apply the different methods to compare relations in question and answer sentences, they follow the same hypothesis that proper answers are more likely to have same relations in question and answer sentences.",
        "For example, in question ”Who founded the Black Panthers organization?”, where, the question word ”who” has the dependency relations ”subj” with ”found” and ”subj obj nn” with ”Black Panthers organization”, in sentence ”Hilliard introduced Bobby Seale, who co-founded the Black Panther Party here ...”, the proper answer ”Bobby Seale” has the same relations with most question phrases.",
        "These methods achieve high precision, but poor recall due to relation variations.",
        "One meaning is often represented as different relation combinations.",
        "In the above example, appositive rela",
        "tion frequently appears in answer sentences, such as ”Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale is ordered bound and gagged ...” and indicates proper answer Bobby Seale although it is asked in different way in the question.",
        "(Cui et al., 2004) propose an approximate dependency relation matching method for both passage retrieval and answer extraction.",
        "The similarity between two relations is measured by their co-occurrence rather than exact matching.",
        "They state that their method effectively overcomes the limitation of the previous exact matching methods.",
        "Lastly, they use the sum of similarities of all path pairs to rank candidate answers, which is based on the assumption that all paths have equal weights.",
        "However, it might not be true.",
        "For example, in question ”What book did Rachel Carson write in 1962?”, the phrase ”Rachel Carson” looks like more important than ”1962” since the former is question topic and the latter is a constraint for expected answer.",
        "In addition, lexical variations are not well considered and a weak relation path alignment algorithm is used in their work.",
        "Based on the previous works, this paper explores correlation of dependency relation paths between questions and candidate sentences.",
        "Dynamic time warping algorithm is adapted to calculate path correlations and approximate phrase mapping is proposed to cope with phrase variations.",
        "Finally, maximum entropy-based ranking model is developed to incorporate the correlations and rank candidate answers."

        "assigns equal weights to the paths of a candidate answer and question phrases, while CorME estimate the weights according to phrase type and path length.",
        "After training a ME model, the weights are assigned, such as 5.72 for topic path ; 3.44 for constraints path and 1.76 for target path.",
        "2) CorME incorporates approximate phrase mapping scores into path correlation measure.",
        "We further divide the questions into two classes according to whether NER is used in answer extraction.",
        "If the expected answer type of a question is unknown, such as ”How did James Dean die?” or the type cannot be annotated by NER, such as ”What ethnic group/race are Crip members?”, we put the question in Qw/oNE set, otherwise, we put it in QwNE.",
        "For the questions in Qw/oNE, we extract all basic noun phrases and verb phrases as candidate answers.",
        "Then, answer extraction module has to work on the larger candidate sets.",
        "Using a MUC-based NER, the recognized types include person, location, organization, date, time and money.",
        "In TREC04 questions, 123 questions are put in QwNE and 80 questions in Qw/oNE.",
        "We evaluate the performance on QwNE and Qw/oNE respectively, as shown in Table 2.",
        "The density-based method Density (0.11MRR) loses many questions in Qw/oNE, which indicates that using only surface word information is not sufficient for large candidate answer sets.",
        "On the contrary, SynPattern(0.36MRR), Strict-Pattern(0.36MRR), ApprMatch(0.42MRR) and CorME (0.47MRR) which capture syntactic information, perform much better than Density.",
        "Our method CorME outperforms the other syntactic-based methods on both QwNE and Qw/oNE.",
        "Es",
        "pecially for more difficult questions Qw/oNE, the improvements (up to 31% in MRR) are more obvious.",
        "It indicates that our method can be used to further enhance state-of-the-art QA systems even if they have a good NER.",
        "In addition, we evaluate component contributions of our method based on the main idea of relation path correlation.",
        "Three components are tested: 1.",
        "Appr.",
        "Mapping (Section 3.4).",
        "We replace approximate question phrase mapping with exact phrase mapping and withdraw the phrase mapping scores from path correlation measure.",
        "2.",
        "Answer Ranking (Section 4).",
        "Instead of using ME model, we sum all of the path correlations to rank candidate answers, which is similar to (Cui et al., 2004).",
        "3.",
        "Answer Re-ranking (Section 5).",
        "We disable this component and select top 5 answers according to answer ranking scores.",
        "The contribution of each component is evaluated with the overall performance degradation after it is removed or replaced.",
        "Some findings are concluded from Table 3.",
        "Performances degrade when replacing approximate phrase mapping or ME-based answer ranking, which indicates that both of them have positive effects on the systems.",
        "This may be also used to explain why CorME outperforms ApprMatch in Table 1.",
        "However, removing answer re-ranking doesn’t affect much.",
        "Since short questions, such as ”What does AARP stand for?”, frequently occur in TREC04, exploring the phrase relations for such questions isn’t helpful."

        "In this paper, we propose a relation path correlation-based method to rank candidate answers in answer extraction.",

        "Lastly, a ME-based ranking model is proposed to incorporate the path correlations and rank candidate answers.",
        "The experiment on TREC questions shows that our method significantly outperforms a density-based method by 50% in MRR and three state-of-the-art syntactic-based methods by up to 20% in MRR.",
        "Furthermore, the method is especially effective for difficult questions, for which NER may not help.",
        "Therefore, it may be used to further enhance state-of-the-art QA systems even if they have a good NER.",
        "In the future, we are to further evaluate the method based on the overall performance of a QA system and adapt it to sentence retrieval task."
