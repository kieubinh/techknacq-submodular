        "Unit selection synthesis1 – a technique which concatenates segments of natural speech selected from a database – has been found to be capable of producing high quality synthetic speech, especially for utterances that are similar to the speech in the database in terms of style, delivery, and coverage (Black and Lenzo, 2001).",
        "In particular, in the limited domain of a spoken language dialogue system, it is possible to achieve highly natural synthesis with a purpose-built voice (Black and Lenzo, 2000).",
        "However, it can be difficult to develop",
        "a synthetic voice for a dialogue system that produces natural speech completely reliably, and thus in practice output quality can be quite variable.",
        "Two important factors in this regard are the labeling process for the speech database and the direction of the dialogue system’s further development, after the voice has been built: when labels are assigned fully automatically to the recorded speech, label boundaries may be inaccurate, leading to unnatural sounding joins in speech output; and when further system development leads to the generation of utterances that are less like those in the recording script, such utterances must be synthesized using smaller units with more joins between them, which can lead to a considerable dropoff in quality.",
        "As suggested by Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002), one avenue for improving synthesis quality in a dialogue system is to have the system choose what to say in part by taking into account what is likely to sound natural when synthesized.",
        "The idea is to take advantage of the generator’s periphrastic ability:2 given a set of generated paraphrases that suitably express the desired content in the dialogue context, the system can select the specific paraphrase to use as its response according to the predicted quality of the speech synthesized for that paraphrase.",
        "In this way, if there are significant differences in the predicted synthesis quality for the various paraphrases – and if these predictions are generally borne out – then, by selecting paraphrases with high predicted synthesis quality, the dialogue system (as a whole) can more reliably produce natural sounding speech.",

        "Most previous work on integrating language generation and synthesis, e.g. (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988; Prevost and Steedman, 1994; Hitzeman et al., 1998; Pan et al., 2002), has focused on how to use the information present in the language generation component in order to specify contextually appropriate intonation for the speech synthesizer to target.",
        "For example, syntactic structure, information structure and dialogue context have all been argued to play a role in improving prosody prediction, compared to unrestricted text-to-speech synthesis.",
        "While this topic remains an important area of research, our focus is instead on a different opportunity that arises in a dialogue system, namely, the possibility of choosing the exact wording and prosody of a response according to how natural it is likely to sound when synthesized.",
        "To our knowledge, Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002) were the first to propose allowing the choice of wording and prosody to be jointly determined by the language generator and speech synthesizer.",
        "In their approach, a template-based generator passes a prosodically annotated word network to the speech synthesizer, rather than a single text string (or prosodically annotated text string).",
        "To perform the unit selection search on this expanded input efficiently, they employ weighted finite-state transducers, where each step of network expansion is then followed by minimization.",
        "The weights are determined by concatenation (join) costs, relative frequencies (negative log probabilities) of the word sequences, and prosodic prediction costs, for cases where the prosody is not determined by the templates.",
        "In a perception experiment, they demonstrated that by expanding the space of candidate responses, their system achieved higher quality speech output.",
        "Following (Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2002), Stone et al.",
        "(2004) developed a method for jointly determining wording, speech and gesture.",
        "In their approach, a template-based generator produces a word lattice with intonational phrase breaks.",
        "A unit selection algorithm then searches for a low-cost way of realizing a path through this lattice that combines captured motion samples with recorded speech samples to create coherent phrases, blending segments of speech and motion together phrase-by-phrase into extended utterances.",
        "Video demonstrations indicate that natural and highly expressive results can be achieved, though no human evaluations are reported.",
        "In an alternative approach, Pan and Weng (2002) proposed integrating instance-based realization and synthesis.",
        "In their framework, sentence structure, wording, prosody and speech waveforms from a domain-specific corpus are simultaneously reused.",
        "To do so, they add prosodic and acoustic costs to the insertion, deletion and replacement costs used for instance-based surface realization.",
        "Their contribution focuses on how to design an appropriate speech corpus to facilitate an integrated approach to instance-based realization and synthesis, and does not report evaluation results.",
        "A drawback of these approaches to integrating choice in language generation and synthesis is that they cannot be used with most existing speech synthesizers, which do not accept (annotated) word lattices as input.",
        "In contrast, the approach we introduce here can be employed with any speech synthesizer in principle.",
        "All that is required is that the language generator be capable of producing N-best outputs; that is, the generator must be able to construct a set of suitable paraphrases ex",
        "pressing the desired content, from which the top N realizations can be selected for reranking according to their predicted synthesis quality.",
        "Once the realizations have been reranked, the top scoring realization can be sent to the synthesizer as usual.",
        "Alternatively, when features derived from the synthesizer’s unit selection search can be made available – and if the time demands of the dialogue system permit – several of the top scoring reranked realizations can be sent to the synthesizer, and the resulting utterances can be rescored with the extended feature set.",
        "Our reranking approach has been inspired by previous work on reranking in parsing and generation, especially (Collins, 2000) and (Walker et al., 2002).",
        "As in Walker et al.’s (2002) method for training a sentence plan ranker, we use our generator to produce a representative sample of paraphrases and then solicit human judgements of their naturalness to use as data for training the ranker.",
        "This method is attractive when there is no suitable corpus of naturally occurring dialogues available for training purposes, as is often the case for systems that engage in human-computer dialogues that differ substantially from human-human ones.",
        "The primary difference between Walker et al.’s work and ours is that theirs examines the impact on text quality of sentence planning decisions such as aggregation, whereas ours focuses on the impact of the lexical and syntactic choice at the surface realization level on speech synthesis quality, according to the strengths and weaknesses of a particular synthetic voice."

        "This suggests that the synthesizer features have no substantial impact on our ranker, as we would expect ALL-TRI to be significantly higher than WORDS-TRI if so.",
        "However, since COSTS does significantly improve upon NGRAM2 (t = 3.5, p < 0.001), there is some value to the use of synthesizer features in the absence of WORDS.",
        "We also looked at the comparison for the WORDS models and COSTS.",
        "While WORDS-BI did not perform significantly better than COSTS ( t = 2.3, p < 0.025), the added trigrams in WORDS-TRI did improve ranker performance significantly over COSTS (t = 3.7, p < 3.29x10-4).",
        "Since COSTS ranks realizations in the much the same way as (Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2002), the fact that WORDS-TRI outperforms COSTS indicates that our discriminative reranking method can significantly improve upon their non-discriminative approach."

        "In this paper, we have presented a method for adapting a language generator to the strengths and weaknesses of a particular synthetic voice by training a discriminative reranker to select paraphrases that are predicted to sound natural when synthesized.",
        "In contrast to previous work on this topic, our method can be employed with any speech synthesizer in principle, so long as features derived from the synthesizer’s unit selection search can be made available.",
        "In a case study with the COMIC dialogue system, we have demonstrated substantial improvements in the naturalness of the resulting synthetic speech, achieving two-thirds of the maximum possible gain, and raising the average rating from “ok” to “good.” We have also shown that in this study, our discriminative method significantly outperforms an approach that performs selection based solely on corpus frequencies together with target and join costs.",
        "In future work, we intend to verify the results of our cross-validation study in a perception experiment with naive subjects.",
        "We also plan to investigate whether additional features derived from the synthesizer can better detect unnatural pauses or changes in speech rate, as well as F0 contours that fail to exhibit the targeting accenting pattern.",
        "Finally, we plan to examine whether gains in quality can be achieved with an off-the-shelf, general purpose voice that are similar to those we have observed using COMIC’s limited domain voice."
