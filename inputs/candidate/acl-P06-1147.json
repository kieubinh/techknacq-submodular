        "Question answering of a series of questions on one topic has gained more and more research interest in the recent years.",
        "The current TREC QA test set contains factoid and list questions grouped into different series, where each series has the target of a definition associated with it (Overview of the TREC 2004 Question Answering Track, Voorhees 2005).",
        "Usually, the target is also called \"topic\" by QA researchers.",
        "One of the restrictions of TREC QA is that \"questions within a series must be processed in order, without looking ahead.\" That is, systems are allowed to use answers to earlier questions to help answer later questions in the same series, but can not use later questions to help answer earlier questions.",
        "This requirement models the dialogue discourse between the user and the QA system.",
        "However our experiments on interactive QA system show that some impatient QA users will throw a bunch of questions to the system and waiting for the answers returned in all.",
        "This prompted us to consider building a QA system which can accept as many questions as possible from users once in all and utilizing the relations between these questions to help find answers.",
        "We would also like to know the performance difference between the QA system processing the question series in an order and the QA system processing the question series as a whole.",
        "We call the second type of QA system as batch QA system to avoid the ambiguity in the following description in this paper.",
        "What kind of relations between questions could be utilized is a key problem in building the batch QA system.",
        "By observing the test questions of TREC QA, we found that the questions given under the same topic are not independent at all.",
        "Figure-1 shows a series of three questions proposed under the topic \"Russian submarine Kursk Sinks\" and some relevant passages to this topic found in the TREC data set.",
        "These passages contain answers not to just one but to two or three of the questions.",
        "This indicates that the answers to these questions have high co-occurrence.",
        "In an automatic QA system which processes the questions independently, the answers to the questions may or may not always be extracted due to algorithmic limitations or noisy information around the correct answer.",
        "However in building a batch QA system, the interdependence between the answers could be utilized to help to filter out the noisy information and pinpoint the correct answer for each question in the series.",

        "As a powerful web search engine and external online knowledge resource, Google has been widely adopted in QA systems (Hovy et al. 2001; Cui 2005) as a tool to help passage retrieval and answer validation.",
        "Current QA systems mentioned above and represented at TREC have been developed to answer one question at the time.",
        "This may partially be an artifact of the earlier TREC QA evaluations which used large sets of independent questions.",
        "It may also partially reflect the intention of the current TREC QA Track that the question series introduced in TREC QA 2004 (Voorhees 2005) simulate an interaction with a human, thus expected to arrive one at a time.",
        "The co-occurrence of answers of a series of highly related questions has not yet been fully utilized in current automatic QA systems participating TREC.",
        "In this situation, we think it worthwhile to find out whether a series of highly related questions on a specific topic such as the TREC QA test questions can be answered together in a batch mode by utilizing the co-occurrences of the answers and how much it will help improve the QA system performance."
