        "A mechanism for automatically compressing sentences while preserving their grammaticality and most important information would greatly benefit a wide range of applications.",
        "Examples include text summarisation (Jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004) and information retrieval (Olivers and Dolan 1999).",
        "Sentence compression is a complex paraphrasing task with information loss involving substitution, deletion, insertion, and reordering operations.",
        "Recent years have witnessed increased interest on a simpler instantiation of the compression problem, namely word deletion (Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al.",
        "2003; Turner and Char-niak 2005).",
        "More formally, given an input sentence of words W = w1, w2,..., wn, a compression is formed by removing any subset of these words.",
        "Sentence compression has received both generative and discriminative formulations in the literature.",
        "Generative approaches (Knight and Marcu 2002; Turner and Charniak 2005) are instantiations of the noisy-channel model: given a long sentence l, the aim is to find the corresponding short sentences which maximises the conditional probability P(s1l).",
        "In a discriminative setting (Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al.",
        "2003; McDonald 2006), sentences are represented by a rich feature space (typically induced from parse trees) and the goal is to learn rewrite rules indicating which words should be deleted in a given context.",
        "Both modelling paradigms assume access to a training corpus consisting of original sentences and their compressions.",
        "Unsupervised approaches to the compression problem are few and far between (see Hori and Fu-rui 2004 and Turner and Charniak 2005 for exceptions).",
        "This is surprising considering that parallel corpora of original-compressed sentences are not naturally available in the way multilingual corpora are.",
        "The scarcity of such data is demonstrated by the fact that most work to date has focused on a single parallel corpus, namely the Ziff-Davis corpus (Knight and Marcu 2002).",
        "And some effort into developing appropriate training data would be necessary when porting existing algorithms to new languages or domains.",
        "In this paper we present an unsupervised model of sentence compression that does not rely on a parallel corpus – all that is required is a corpus of uncompressed sentences and a parser.",
        "Given a long sentence, our task is to form a compression by preserving the words that maximise a scoring function.",
        "In our case, the scoring function is an n-gram language model, “with a few strings attached”.",
        "While straightforward to estimate, a language model is a fairly primitive scoring function: it has no notion of the overall sentence structure, grammaticality or underlying meaning.",
        "We thus couple our language model with a small number of structural and semantic constraints capturing global properties of the compression process.",
        "We encode the language model and linguistic constraints as linear inequalities and use Integer Programming (IP) to infer compressions that are consistent with both.",
        "The IP formulation allows us to capture global sentence properties and can be easily manipulated to provide compressions tailored for specific applications.",
        "For example, we",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics could prevent overly long or overly short compressions or generally avoid compressions that lack a main verb or consist of repetitions of the same word.",
        "In the following section we provide an overview of previous approaches to sentence compression.",
        "In Section 3 we motivate the treatment of sentence compression as an optimisation problem and formulate our language model and constraints in the IP framework.",
        "Section 4 discusses our experimental set-up and Section 5 presents our results.",
        "Discussion of future work concludes the paper."

        "Jing (2000) was perhaps the first to tackle the sentence compression problem.",
        "Her approach uses multiple knowledge sources to determine which phrases in a sentence to remove.",
        "Central to her system is a grammar checking module that specifies which sentential constituents are grammatically obligatory and should therefore be present in the compression.",
        "This is achieved using simple rules and a large-scale lexicon.",
        "Other knowledge sources include WordNet and corpus evidence gathered from a parallel corpus of original-compressed sentence pairs.",
        "A phrase is removed only if it is not grammatically obligatory, not the focus of the local context and has a reasonable deletion probability (estimated from the parallel corpus).",
        "In contrast to Jing (2000), the bulk of the research on sentence compression relies exclusively on corpus data for modelling the compression process without recourse to extensive knowledge sources (e.g., WordNet).",
        "Approaches based on the noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu 2002; Turner and Charniak 2005) consist of a source model P(s) (whose role is to guarantee that the generated compression is grammatical), a channel model P(l �s) (capturing the probability that the long sentence l is an expansion of the compressed sentences), and a decoder (which searches for the compressions that maximises P(s)P(l �s)).",
        "The channel model is typically estimated using a parallel corpus, although Turner and Charniak (2005) also present semi-supervised and unsupervised variants of the channel model that estimate P(l �s) without parallel data.",
        "Discriminative formulations of the compression task include decision-tree learning (Knight and Marcu 2002), maximum entropy (Riezler et al.",
        "2003), support vector machines (Nguyen et al.",
        "2004), and large-margin learning (McDonald 2006).",
        "We describe here the decision-tree model in more detail since we will use it as a basis for comparison when evaluating our own models (see Section 4).",
        "According to this model, compression is performed through a tree rewriting process inspired by the shift-reduce parsing paradigm.",
        "A sequence of shift-reduce-drop actions are performed on a long parse tree, l, to create a smaller tree, s. The compression process begins with an input list generated from the leaves of the original sentence’s parse tree and an empty stack.",
        "‘Shift’ operations move leaves from the input list to the stack while ‘drop’ operations delete from the input list.",
        "Reduce operations are used to build trees from the leaves on the stack.",
        "A decision-tree is trained on a set of automatically generated learning cases from a parallel corpus.",
        "Each learning case has a target action associated with it and is decomposed into a set of indicative features.",
        "The decision-tree learns which action to perform given this set of features.",
        "The final model is applied in a deterministic fashion in which the features for the current state are extracted and the decision-tree is queried.",
        "This is repeated until the input list is empty and the final compression is recovered by traversing the leaves of resulting tree on the stack.",
        "While most compression models operate over constituents, Hori and Furui (2004) propose a model which generates compressions through word deletion.",
        "The model does not utilise parallel data or syntactic information in any form.",
        "Given a prespecified compression rate, it searches for the compression with the highest score according to a function measuring the importance of each word and the linguistic likelihood of the resulting compressions (language model probability).",
        "The score is maximised through a dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "Although sentence compression has not been explicitly formulated as an optimisation problem, previous approaches have treated it in these terms.",
        "The decoding process in the noisy-channel model searches for the best compression given the source and channel models.",
        "However, the compression found is usually suboptimal as heuristics are used to reduce the search space or is only locally optimal due to the search method employed.",
        "The decoding process used in Turner and Charniak’s (2005) model first searches for the best combination of rules to apply.",
        "As they traverse their list of compression rules they remove sentences outside the 100 best compressions (according to their channel model).",
        "This list is eventually truncated to 25 compressions.",
        "In other models (Hori and Furui 2004; McDonald 2006) the compression score is maximised",
        "using dynamic programming.",
        "The latter guarantees we will find the global optimum provided the principle of optimality holds.",
        "This principle states that given the current state, the optimal decision for each of the remaining stages does not depend on previously reached stages or previously made decisions (Winston and Venkataramanan 2003).",
        "However, we know this to be false in the case of sentence compression.",
        "For example, if we have included modifiers to the left of a head noun in the compression then it makes sense that we must include the head also.",
        "With a dynamic programming approach we cannot easily guarantee such constraints hold."

        "Our work models sentence compression explicitly as an optimisation problem.",
        "There are 2n possible compressions for each sentence and while many of these will be unreasonable (Knight and Marcu 2002), it is unlikely that only one compression will be satisfactory.",
        "Ideally, we require a function that captures the operations (or rules) that can be performed on a sentence to create a compression while at the same time factoring how desirable each operation makes the resulting compression.",
        "We can then perform a search over all possible compressions and select the best one, as determined by how desirable it is.",
        "Our formulation consists of two basic components: a language model (scoring function) and a small number of constraints ensuring that the resulting compressions are structurally and semantically valid.",
        "Our task is to find a globally optimal compression in the presence of these constraints.",
        "We solve this inference problem using Integer Programming without resorting to heuristics or approximations during the decoding process.",
        "Integer programming has been recently applied to several classification tasks, including relation extraction (Roth and Yih 2004), semantic role labelling (Pun-yakanok et al.",
        "2004), and the generation of route directions (Marciniak and Strube 2005).",

        "We now turn to the results of our elicitation study.",
        "We performed an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to examine the effect of different system compressions.",
        "Statistical tests were carried out on the mean of the ratings shown in Table 3.",
        "We observe a reliable effect of compression type by sub-retained in the compression.",
        "jects (F1 (3,165) = 132.74, p < 0.01) and items (F2(3,117) = 18.94, p < 0.01).",
        "Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that gold standard compressions are perceived as significantly better than those generated by all automatic systems (a < 0.05).",
        "There is no significant difference between the IP language model and decision-tree systems.",
        "However, the IP model with the significance score delivers a significant increase in performance over the language model and the decision tree (a < 0.05).",
        "These results indicate that reasonable compressions can be obtained with very little supervision.",
        "Our constraint-based language model does not make use of a parallel corpus, whereas our second variant uses only 50 parallel sentences for tuning the weights of the objective function.",
        "The models described in this paper could be easily adapted to other domains or languages provided that syntactic analysis tools are to some extent available."

        "In this paper we have presented a novel method for automatic sentence compression.",
        "A key aspect of our approach is the use of integer programming for inferring globally optimal compressions in the presence of linguistically motivated constraints.",
        "We have shown that such a formulation allows for a relatively simple and knowledge-lean compression model that does not require parallel corpora or access to large-scale knowledge bases.",
        "Our results demonstrate that the IP model yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art without any supervision.",
        "We also observe significant performance gains when a small amount of training data is employed (50 parallel sentences).",
        "Beyond the systems discussed in this paper, the approach holds promise for other models using decoding algorithms for searching the space of possible compressions.",
        "The search process could be framed as an integer program in a similar fashion to our work here.",
        "We obtain our best results using a model whose objective function includes a significance score.",
        "The significance score relies mainly on syntactic and lexical information for determining whether a word is important or not.",
        "An appealing future direction is the incorporation of discourse-based constraints into our models.",
        "The latter would highlight topical words at the document-level instead of considering each sentence in isolation.",
        "Another important issue concerns the portability of the models presented here to other languages and domains.",
        "We plan to apply our method to languages with more flexible word order than English (e.g., German) and more challenging spoken domains (e.g., meeting data) where parsing technology may be less reliable."
