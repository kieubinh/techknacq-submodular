        "The goal of Web-based Chinese-English (C-E) term translation mining is to acquire translations of terms or proper nouns which cannot be looked up in the dictionary from the Web using a statistical method, and then construct an application system for reading/writing assistant (e.g., 三国演 X4 The Romance of Three Kingdoms).",
        "During translating or writing foreign language articles, people usually encounter terms, but they cannot obtain native translations after many lookup efforts.",
        "Some skilled users perhaps resort to a Web search engine, but a large amount of retrieved irrelevant pages and redundant information hamper them to acquire effective information.",
        "Thus, it is necessary to provide a system to automatically mine translation knowledge of terms using abundant Web information so as to help users accurately read or write foreign language articles.",
        "The system of Web-based term translation mining has many applications.",

        "2) The construction tool of bilingual or multilingual dictionary for machine translation.",
        "The system can not only provide translation candidates for compiling a lexicon, but also rescore the candidate list of the dictionary.",
        "We can also use English as a medium language to build a lexicon translation bridge between two languages with few bilingual annotations (e.g., Japanese and Chinese).",
        "3) Provide the translations of unknown queries in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).",
        "4) As one of the typical application paradigms of the combination of CLIR and Web mining.",
        "Automatic acquisition of bilingual translations has been extensively researched in the literature.",
        "The methods of acquiring translations are usually summarized as the following six categories.",
        "1) Acquiring translations from parallel corpora.",
        "To reduce the workload of manual annotations, researchers have proposed different methods to automatically collect parallel corpora of different language versions from the Web (Kilgarriff, 2003).",
        "2) Acquiring translations from non-parallel corpora (Fung, 1997; Rapp, 1999).",
        "It is based on the clue that the context of source term is very similar to that of target translation in a large amount of corpora.",
        "3) Acquiring translations from a combination of translations of constituent words (Li et al., 2003).",
        "4) Acquiring translations using cognate matching (Gey, 2004)",
        "or transliteration (Seo et al., 2004).",
        "This method is very suitable for the translation between two languages with some intrinsic relationships, e.g., acquiring translations from Japanese to Chinese or from Korean to English.",
        "5) Acquiring translations using anchor text information (Lu et al., 2004).",
        "6) Acquiring translations from the Web.",
        "When people use Asia language (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) to write, they often annotate associated English meanings after terms.",
        "With the development of Web and the open of accessible electronic documents, digital library, and scientific articles, these resources will become more and more abundant.",
        "Thus, acquiring term translations from the Web is a feasible and effective way.",
        "Nagata et al.",
        "(2001) proposed an empirical function of the byte distance between Japanese and English terms as an evaluation criterion to extract translations of Japanese words, and the results could be used as a Japanese-English dictionary.",

        "Zhang and Vines (2004) proposed using a Web search engine to obtain translations of Chinese out-of-vocabulary terms from the Web to improve CLIR performance.",
        "The method used Chinese as query items, and retrieved previous 100 document snippets by Google, and then estimated possible translations using co-occurrence information.",
        "From the review above, we know that previous related researches didn’t concern the issue how to obtain effective Web pages with bilingual annotations, and they mainly utilized the frequency feature as the clue to mine the translation.",
        "In fact, previous 100 Web results seldom contain effective English equivalents.",

        "Our idea is based on the assumption that the meanings of Chinese technical terms aren’t exactly known just through their constituent characters and words, but the closely related semantics and vocabulary information may be inferred and predicted.",
        "For example, the corresponding unit translations of a term “=Q3i��” are respectively: three (=) , country, nation (Q3i), act, practice(�), and meaning, jus-tice(X).",

        "After expanding, the query item for the example above becomes \"=Q3i � � \"+ (three |country |nation |act |practice |meaning | justice).",

        "Unit segmentation.",
        "Getting the constituent units of a technical term is a segmentation procedure.",

        "In this paper, a segmentation method is employed to handle term segmentation so that possible meaningful constituent units are found.",
        "In the inner structure of proper nouns or terms, the rightmost unit usually contains a headword to reflect the major meaning of the term.",
        "Sometimes, the modifier starts from the leftmost point of a term to form a multi-character unit.",
        "As a result, forward maximum matching and backward maximum matching are respectively conducted on the term, and all the overlapped segmented units are added to candidate items.",
        "For example, for the term “abcd”, forward segmented units are “ab cd”, backward are “a bcd”, so “ab cd a bcd” will be viewed as our segmented items.",
        "Item translation knowledge base construction.",
        "Because the segmented units of a technical term or proper name often consist of abbreviation items with shorter length, limited translations provided by general dictionaries often cannot satisfy the demand of translation prediction.",

        "In this method, we only keep these nouns or adjective items consisting of 1-3 characters in the dictionary.",

        "ing the longer word including this item such as “NITI, NMI”.",

        "The results are listed in Table 1.",
        "As seen from this table, if there is no semantic prediction, the obtained translations from Web pages are about 48% in the top 30 candidates.",
        "This is because general search engines will retrieve more relevant Chinese Web pages rather than those effective pages including English meanings.",
        "Thus, the semantic prediction method is employed.",
        "Experiments demonstrate the method with semantic prediction distinctly improves the accuracy, about 36.8%.",
        "To further improve the performance, the feedback learning technique is proposed, and it increases the average accuracy of 6.5%.",
        "Though TM is very effective in mining the term translation, the multi-feature method fully utilizes the context of candidates, and therefore obtains more accurate results, about 92.8% in the top 5 candidates.",

        "One method is to use term frequency (TM) as an evaluation criterion, and the other method is to use multi-features (MF) as an evaluation criterion.",
        "Experimental results are shown as follows.",
        "From Table 2, we know the accuracy with top 5 candidates is about 86.0%.",
        "The method using multi-features is better than that of using term frequency, and improves an average accuracy of 7.94% Some examples of acquiring English translations of Chinese terms are provided in Table 3.",
