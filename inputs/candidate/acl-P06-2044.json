        "Some topics appear to carry a ‘focus marker’, indicating that they are particularly salient.",
        "We will outline a computationally tractable grammar for Somali in which focus marking emerges naturally from a consideration of the use of a range of sentence markers."

        "Somali has a fairly standard set of inflectional affixes for nouns and verbs, as outlined below.",
        "In addition, there are a substantial set of ‘spelling rules’ which insert and delete graphemes at the boundaries between roots and suffixes (and cli-tics).",
        "There is not that much to be said about the spelling rules – Fig. 1 shows the format of a typical rule, which we compile into an FST to be used during the process of lexical lookup.",
        "The rule in Fig. 1 would, for instance, say that the surface form ‘saca’ might correspond to the underlying form ‘sac+ka’, with a morpheme boundary and a ‘k’ inserted after the ‘c’.",
        "These rules, of which we currently employ about 30, can be efficiently implemented using the standard machinery of cascaded FSTs (Koskiennemi, 1985) interwoven with the general lookup process."

      "text": [
        "In general, a noun consists of a root and a single affix, which provides a combination of gender and number marking.",
        "The main complication is that there are several declension classes, with specific singular and plural suffixes for groups of classes (e.g. the plural ending for declensions 1 and 3 is ‘o ’) (Saeed, 1999; Lecarme, 2002).",
        "Some plural forms involve reduplication of some part of the word ending, e.g. declension 4 nouns form their plural by adding ‘aC’where ‘C’ is the final consonant of the root, but this can easily be handled by using spelling rules."

      "heading": "2.2 Verb morphology",
      "text": [
        "Verb morphology is slightly more complex.",

        "These include derivational affixes (Somali includes a passivising form which can only be applied to verbs which have a ‘causative’ argument, and a causative affix which adds such",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics an argument) and a set of inflectional affixes which mark aspect, tense and agreement (Andrzejewski, 1968).",
        "The forms of the tense and agreement markers vary depending on whether the clause containing the verb is the main clause or is a subordinate clause (either a relative clause or a sentential complement), marked by ±main and on whether it is in a context where the subject is required to be a zero item, marked by ±fullForm.",
        "Note that the situation here is fairly complicated: -fullForm versions are required in situations where the subject is forced by local syntactic constraints to be a zero.",
        "There are also situations where the subject is omitted for discourse reasons, and here the +fullForm version is used ((Lecarme, 1995) uses the terms ‘restrictive’ and ‘extensive’ for -fullForm and +f ul lForm respectively)."

        "The sentence marker ‘waa’ and the pronoun ‘uu’, for instance, combine to produce the form ‘wuu’ when they are adjacent to one another.",
        "In several cases, there are quite dramatic morphophonemic alterations at the boundary, so that it is extremely important to ensure that the processes of applying spelling rules and inspecting the lexicon are appropriately interwoven.",
        "The definite articles, in particular, require considerable care.",
        "There are a number of forms of the definite article, as in",
        "We deal with this by assuming that determiners have the form gender-root-case, where the gender markers are ‘k-’ (masculine) and ‘t-’ (feminine), and the case markers are ‘-’ (accusative) and ‘- u’ (nominative), with spelling rules that collapse ‘kau’ to ‘ku’ and ‘kiiu’ to ‘kii’.",
        "The definite articles, however, cliticise onto the preceding word, with consequential spelling changes.",
        "It is again important to ensure that the spelling changes are applied at the right time to ensure that we can recognise ‘barahu’ as ‘bare’ plus ‘k+a+u’, with appropriate changes to the ‘e’ at the end of the root ‘bare’ and the ‘k’ at the start of the determiner ‘ku’."

        "Ordinary topics introduce an item into the context, to be picked up by one of the core pronouns, without marking any of them as being more prominent than the others.",
        "The item to the left of ‘baa’ is indeed available as an anchor for a core pronoun, but it is also marked as being more important than the other topics.",
        "We deal with this by assuming that ‘baa’ sub-categorises for an NP to its left, and then forms a sentence marker looking to modify a sentence to its right.",

        "Somali does not possess distinct WH-pronouns (Saeed, 1999).",
        "Instead, the clitic pronouns (including the zero third-person pronoun) can act as WH-markers.",
        "This is a bit awkward for any parsing algorithm which depends propagating the WH-marker up the parse tree until a complete clause has been analysed, and then using it to decide whether that clause is a relative clause or not.",
        "We do not want to introduce two versions of each pronoun, one with a WH-marker and the other without, and then produce alternative analyses for each.",

        "We therefore leave the WH-marking on the clitic pronouns open until we have an analysis of the clause containing them.",
        "If we need to consider using this clause in a context where a relative clause is required, we inspect the clitic pronouns and decide which ones, if any are suitable for use as the pivot (i.e. the WH-pronoun which links to the modified analysis).",

        "We have outlined a computational treatment of Somali that runs right through from morphology and morphographemics to logical forms.",
        "The construction of logical forms is a fairly routine activity, given that we have carried out this work within a framework that has already been used for a number of other languages, and hence the machinery for deriving logical forms from semantically annotated parse trees is already available.",
        "The most notable point about Somali semantics within this framework is the inclusion of the basic illocution-ary force within the logic form, which allows us to also treat topic and focus as discourse phenomena within the logical form."
