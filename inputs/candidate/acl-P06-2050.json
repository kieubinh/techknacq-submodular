        "We believe that the conceptual knowledge information which has been grounded on Chinese characters can be used as a cognitively sound and computationally effective ontological lexical resource in performing some NLP tasks, and it will have contribution to the development of Semantic Web as well."

        "From the view of writing system and cognition, human conceptual information has been regarded as being wired in ideographic scripts.",
        "However, in reviewing the contemporary linguistic literatures concerning with the discussions of the essence of Chinese writing system, we found that the main theoretical dispute lies in the fact that, both structural descriptions and psycholinguistic modeling seem to presume that the notions of ideography and phonography are mutually exclusive.",
        "To break the theoretical impass´e, we take a pragmatic position in claiming the tripartite properties of Chinese characters: They are logographic (morpho-syllabic) in essence, function phonologically at the same time, and can be interpreted ideographically and implemented as concept instances by computers."
