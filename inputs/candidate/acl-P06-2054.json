        "Thus, we need new methods to import non-local information into sequential models.",
        "There are two types of method for using nonlocal information.",
        "One is to add edges to structure to allow higher-order dependencies and another is to add features (or observable variables) to encode the non-locality.",
        "An additional consistent edge of a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) explicitly models the dependencies between distant occurrences of similar words (Sutton and McCal-lum, 2004; Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "However, this approach requires additional time complexity in inference/learning time and it is only suitable for representing constraints by enforcing label consistency.",
        "We wish to identify ambiguous labels with more general dependency without additional time cost in inference/learning time.",
        "Another approach to modeling non-locality is to use observational features which can capture non-local information.",
        "Traditionally, many systems prefer to use a syntactic parser.",
        "In a language understanding task, the head word dependencies or parse tree path are successfully applied to learn and predict semantic roles, especially those with ambiguous labels (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Although the power of syntactic structure is impressive, using the parser-based feature fails to encode correct global information because of the low accuracy of a modern parser.",
        "Furthermore the inaccurate result of parsing is more serious in a spoken language understanding (SLU) task.",
        "In contrast to written language, spoken language loses much information including grammar, structure or morphology and contains some errors in automatically recognized speech.",
        "To solve the above problems, we present one method to exploit non-local information – the trigger feature.",
        "In this paper, we incorporate trigger pairs into a sequential model, a linear-chain CRF.",
        "Then we describe an efficient algorithm to extract the trigger feature from the training data itself.",
        "The framework for inducing trigger features is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion which measures the improvement of log-likelihood on the current parameters by adding a new feature (Pietra et al., 1997).",

        "In this paper, we have focused on a sequential model such as a linear-chain CRF.",
        "However, our method can also be naturally applied to arbitrary structured models, thus the first alternative is to combine our methods with a skip-chain CRF (Sutton and McCallum, 2004).",
        "Applying and extending our approach to other natural language tasks (which are difficult to apply a parser to) such as information extraction from email data or biomedical named entity recognition is a topic of future work."
