        "Evaluation has long been a stumbling block in the development of machine translation systems, due to the simple fact that there are many correct translations for a given sentence.",
        "Human evaluation of system output is costly in both time and money, leading to the rise of automatic evaluation metrics in recent years.",
        "In the 2003 Johns Hopkins Workshop on Speech and Language Engineering, experiments on MT evaluation showed that BLEU and NIST do not correlate well with human judgments at the sentence level, even when they correlate well over large test sets (Blatz et al., 2003).",
        "Liu and Gildea (2005) also pointed out that due to the limited references for every MT output, using the overlapping ratio of n-grams longer than 2 did not improve sentence level evaluation performance of BLEU.",
        "The problem leads to an even worse result in BLEU’S fluency evaluation, which is supposed to rely on the long n-grams.",
        "In order to improve sentence-level evaluation performance, several metrics have been proposed, including ROUGE-W, ROUGES (Lin and Och, 2004) and METEOR (Baner ee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "ROUGE-W differs from BLEU and NIST in that it doesn’t require the common sequence between MT output and the references to be consecutive, and thus longer common sequences can be found.",
        "There is a problem with loose-sequence-based metrics: the words outside the longest common sequence are not considered in the metric, even if they appear both in MT output and the reference.",
        "ROUGES is meant to alleviate this problem by computing the common skipped bi-grams instead of the LCS.",
        "But the price ROUGES pays is falling back to the shorter sequences and losing the advantage of long common sequences.",
        "METEOR is essentially a unigram based metric, which prefers the monotonic word alignment between MT output and the references by penalizing crossing word alignments.",
        "There are two problems with METEOR.",
        "First, it doesn’t consider gaps in the aligned words, which is an important feature for evaluating the sentence fluency; second, it cannot use multiple references simultaneously.)",
        "ROUGE and METEOR both use WordNet and Porter Stemmer to increase the chance of the MT output words matching the reference words.",
        "Such morphological processing and synonym extraction tools are available for English, but are not always available for other languages.",
        "In order to take advantage of loose-sequence-based metrics and avoid the problems in ROUGE and METEOR, we propose a new metric SIA, which is based on loose sequence alignment but enhanced with the following features:",
        "• Computing the string alignment score based on the gaps in the common sequence.",
        "Though ROUGE-W also takes into consider the gaps in the common sequence between the MT output and the reference by giving more credits to the n-grams in the common sequence, our method is more flexible in that not only do the strict n-grams get more credits, but also the tighter sequences.",
        "• Stochastic word matching.",
        "For the purpose of increasing hitting chance of MT outputs in references, we use a stochastic word matching in the string alignment instead of WORD-STEM and WORD-NET used in METEOR and ROUGE.",
        "Instead of using exact matching, we use a soft matching based on the similarity between two words, which is trained in a bilingual corpus.",
        "The corpus is aligned in the word level using IBM Model4 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Stochastic word matching is a uniform replacement for both morphological processing and synonym matching.",
        "More importantly, it can be easily adapted for different kinds of languages, as long as there are bilingual parallel corpora available (which is always true for statistical machine translation).",
        "• Iterative alignment scheme.",
        "In this scheme, the string alignment will be continued until there are no more co-occuring words to be found between the MT output and any one of the references.",
        "In this way, every co-occuring word between the MT output and the references can be considered and contribute to the final score, and multiple references can be used simultaneously.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives a recap of BLEU, ROUGE-W and METEOR; section 3 describes the three components of SIA; section 4 compares the performance of different metrics based on experimental results; section 5 presents our conclusion."

        "For every hypothesis, BLEU computes the fraction of n-grams which also appear in the reference sentences, as well as a brevity penalty.",
        "NIST uses a similar strategy to BLEU but further considers that n-grams with different frequency should be treated differently in the evaluation (Doddington, 2002).",
        "BLEU and NIST have been shown to correlate closely with human judgments in ranking MT systems with different qualities (Papineni et al., 2002; Doddington, 2002).",
        "ROUGE-W is based on the weighted longest common subsequence (LCS) between the MT output and the reference.",
        "The common subsequences in ROUGE-W are not necessarily strict n-grams, and gaps are allowed in both the MT output and the reference.",
        "Because of the flexibility, long common subsequences are feasible in ROUGE-W and can help to reflect the sentence-wide similarity of MT output and references.",
        "ROUGE-W uses a weighting strategy where the LCS containing strict n-grams is favored.",
        "Figure 1 gives two examples that show how ROUGE-W searches for the LCS.",
        "For mt1, ROUGE-W will choose either life is like chocolate or life is like box as the LCS, since neither of the sequences ’like box’ and ’like chocolate’ are strict n-grams and thus make no difference in ROUGE-W (the only strict n-grams in the two candidate LCS is life is).",
        "For mt2, there is only one choice of the LCS: life is of chocolate.",
        "The LCS of mt1 and mt2 have the same length and the same number of strict n-grams, thus they get the same score in ROUGE-W.",
        "But it is clear to us that mt1 is better than mt2.",
        "It is easy to verify that mt1 and mt2 have the same number of common 1 grams, 2-grams, and skipped 2-grams with the reference (they don’t have common n-grams longer than 2 words), thus BLEU and ROUGES are also not able to differentiate them.",
        "METEOR is a metric sitting in the middle of the n-gram based metrics and the loose se",
        "quence based metrics.",
        "It has several phases and in each phase different matching techniques (EXACT, PORTER-STEM, WORD-NET) are used to make an alignment for the MT output and the reference.",
        "METEOR doesn’t require the alignment to be monotonic, which means crossing word mappings (e.g. a b is mapped to b a) are allowed, though doing so will get a penalty.",
        "Figure 2 shows the alignments of METEOR based on the same example as ROUGE.",
        "Though the two alignments have the same number of word mappings, mt2 gets more crossed word mappings than mt1 , thus it will get less credits in METEOR.",

        "In SIA, the alignments are evaluated based on the geometric mean of the gaps in the reference side and the MT output side.",

        "This weighting method can help SIA capture more subtle difference of MT outputs than ROUGE-W does.",
        "For example, if SIA is used to align mt1 and ref in Figure 1, it will choose life is like box instead of life is like chocolate, because the average distance of ’box-box’ to its previous mapping ’like-like’ is less than ’chocolate-chocolate’.",
        "Then the score SIA assigns to mt1 is: (1x1+1x1+�/11x2+�/2 x5)x18=0.399 For mt2, there is only one possible alignment, its score in SIA is computed as:",
