        "This is due to a great extent to the heterogeneity of their semantic and syntactic properties.",
        "We sustain that such properties are mostly derived from the relations holding between adjectives and other POS.",

        "As well known, the experiment conducted by George Miller on the mental lexicon properties in the early 80s pointed out that lexical meaning is derived from a set of lexical and conceptual relations among concepts.",
        "Subsequently, a computational lexicon conceived as a semantic network has been built (the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998)).",
        "Given its psychological plausibility and its crucial role for applications like machine translation, information retrieval and language learning systems, among many others, this relational lexicon model is being extensively adopted for machine lexical knowledge representations, playing a leading role in this field.",
        "One of the most salient undertaking in this domain is EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), a multilingual database which stores wordnets for several European languages that follow the same main lines as the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998) and are interrelated amongst them.",
        "EuroWordNet wordnets follow the Princeton WordNet model, but they are richer concerning both the number and the nature of conceptual relations.",
        "The work depicted here programmatically adopts the EuroWordNet framework.",
        "In general terms, it deals with the specifications for an accurate modeling of lexical knowledge in a EuroWordNet wordnet-like database for Portuguese (WordNet.PT, henceforth), specifically focusing on the lexical semantics of adjectives.",
        "Although WordNet.PT (Marrafa, 2001; Marrafa, 2002) is being developed in the general EuroWordNet framework, basic research has been carried out on Portuguese in order to guarantee the WordNet.PT accuracy.",
        "This work has already led to some changes and new directions (cf. Marrafa et al., (2006) and Amaro et al., (2006), for instance).",
        "In this paper we propose a small set of new relations which allow a strongly empirical motivated encoding of the major POS in Word-Net.PT, despite the fact that we particularly focus on adjectives.",
        "The empirical issues at stake are described in section 2.",
        "In section 3 we discuss the strategies adopted in previous work carried out both in WordNet and EuroWordNet frameworks, in order to make their shortcomings apparent.",
        "In section 4 we present our proposal",
        "and argue for its relevance and soundness.",

      "text": [
        "Adjective semantic analysis and representation is far from being a trivial issue, as adjectives show a very particular linguistic behavior, namely in what concerns sense change depending on linguistic context.",
        "Being so, there are several different typologies and classifications of adjectives in the literature: semantic based classifications, syntactic based classifications, classifications regarding the relation holding between the adjective and the modified noun, and so on.",
        "As our work on this issue progresses, it has become clear that only a combination of syntactic and semantic criteria can offer interesting insights concerning adjective linguistic behavior and the identification of relevant common features, which may set the basis for an accurate modeling of this POS in computational relational lexica.",
        "In this section we will briefly look at some of the main adjective classifications.",
        "Regarding the way adjectives relate to the noun they modify, we consider two classes: property ascribing adjectives (in (1)), which add a new restriction to the properties introduced by the modified noun; and reference modifying adjectives (in (2)), which behave like a semantic operator, taking the reference of the modified noun as its argument1.",
        "(1) o livro azul ‘the blue book’ (2) o diamante falso ‘the fake diamond’",
        "Adjectives like falso (fake), for instance, deal with concepts instead of real or referential objects, showing how a concept applies to a particular object.",
        "These adjectives constitute a closed class with very particular properties, which makes them somewhat close to semantic operators.",
        "In this work we will therefore focus on property ascribing adjectives.",
        "1 This distinction between property ascribing adjectives and reference modifying adjectives is basically equivalent to the one used in the SIMPLE project (Lenci et al., 2000) (extensional vs. intensional adjectives, following Chier-chia and McConnel-Ginet (1990)) to address the semantics of adjectives.",
        "This distinction is also included in the EAGLES recommendations for a semantic typology of adjectives.",
        "Demonte (1999) classifies property ascribing adjectives based on their intrinsic meaning, a classification combining syntactic and semantic criteria to determine which adjectives belong to which class.",
        "Two main subclasses are considered: descriptive adjectives and relational adjectives.",
        "Each of these classes displays specific semantic and syntactic properties.",
        "In languages like Portuguese, descriptive adjectives can occur both in attributive and predicative contexts, while relational adjectives occur almost exclusively in attributive contexts2.",
        "Both prenominal and postnominal positions are possible for descriptive adjectives in attributive contexts.",
        "Relational adjectives, on the contrary, can only occur in postnominal position.",
        "Finally, descriptive adjectives are gradable, i.e. they can co-occur with degree adverbs, which is not the case for relational adjectives.",
        "However, these criteria are not always sufficient to make a clear-cut distinction between relational and descriptive adjectives.",
        "Demonte (1999) proposes some additional criteria in order to make a more accurate distinction between these adjectives: their occurrence in comparative structures, and the formation of polarity systems.",
        "(3) a. O sabor desta laranja é mais doce do que o daquela.",
        "‘this orange taste is sweeter than that one's’ b. o rapaz alto / o rapaz baixo ‘the tall boy / the short boy’",
        "(4) a.",
        "*Este sabor é mais mineral do que aquele.",
        "‘this taste is more mineral than that one’ b. o sabor mineral / *o sabor amineral",
        "‘the mineral taste / the amineral taste’ But most of all, and besides all the syntactical contrasts we have mentioned above, there is a clear contrast in the way these two adjective classes relate to the noun they modify.",
        "Descriptive adjectives ascribe a single property, setting a value for an attribute, whereas relational adjectives introduce a set of properties.",
        "(5) o prédio alto ‘the high building’ 2 Predicative contexts with relational adjectives are generally ruled out in Portuguese.",
        "Nonetheless, some specific contexts, like contrastive contexts, for instance, seem to license predicative uses of relational adjectives: (I) As próximas eleições são autárquicas, não são presidenciais.",
        "‘next election will be autarchic, not presidential’",
        "(6) a indústria alimentar ‘the alimentary industry’",
        "Looking at (5) and (6), we see that, while alto (high) sets the value of the height attribute of prédio (building) to high, alimentar (alimentary) does not ascribe a single property, but a set of properties to indústria (industry).",
        "Moreover, this set of properties corresponds to the main features describing another noun – alimento (food) in the example above.",
        "In fact, the way properties are ascribed to the modified nouns in (5) and in (6) are quite different.",
        "Ascribing a singular property usually corresponds to an incidence relation of this property in the nominal referent, while ascribing sets of properties usually entails more complex and diversified semantic relations.",
        "However, despite the relevance of the descriptive/relational dichotomy, it cannot account for the following contrasts:",
        "(7) a.",
        "*Ele viu a Maria alta.",
        "‘He saw Mary tall’ b. Ele viu a Maria triste.",
        "‘He saw Mary sad’.",
        "Both alta and triste are descriptive adjectives, but they do not behave in the same way regarding secondary predication.",
        "We can refine the classification, considering, for instance, the opposition between accidental properties and permanent or inherent properties (this distinction goes back to Milsark (1974; 1977) and Carlson (1977)).",
        "According to this distinction, the property denoted by alta (tall) belongs to the latter class and the property denoted by triste (sad) to the former one.",
        "However, as pointed out by Marrafa (2004) and previous work, the characterization of adjectives on the basis of this dichotomy is not straightforward, since certain adjectives are ambiguous with regard to those properties, as it is the case of triste (sad).",
        "In the example above triste (sad) denotes an accidental property, but in an expression like um livro triste (a sad book) it denotes a permanent property.",
        "Intuitively, we can say that triste (sad) expresses a state of tristeza (sadness), but we let the discussion of the status of this relation out of the scope of this paper.",
        "Nevertheless, this kind of adjectives is of great importance to model telic verbs.",
        "The semantics of telic verbs involves a change of state of their theme argument, i.e. the subevent that closes the whole event is an atomic event, (a state) that affects the theme and is different from its initial state.",
        "As argued in Marrafa (2005) and previous work, by default, verbs like lavar (to wash) are associated to the following Lexical-Conceptual Structure (LCS’ in Pustejovsky (1991)):",
        "(8) [T [P act(x,y)and ~ Q(y)], [eQ(y)]] T:transition, P:process, e: event, Q: atomic event",
        "When syntactically realized, the telic subevent generally corresponds to an adjectival constituent, like in the example below:",
        "(9) Ele lavou a camisa bem lavada.",
        "'He washed the shirt well washed' In (9) the absence of the telic expression bem lavada (well washed) does not induce ungrammaticality.",
        "However, in the case of verbs like tornar (to make), it seems impossible to assign a value to Q independently of the telic expression.",
        "(10) a. Ele tornou a Maria triste.",
        "‘He made Mary sad’ b.",
        "*Ele tornou a Maria.",
        "'He made Mary'",
        "Along the lines of Marrafa (1993) and further work, verbs like tornar (to make) are assumed here to be LCS deficitary, the telic expression filling the gap of the LCS of the verb.",
        "As shown below, the troponyms of these verbs incorporate the telic state: (12) a. Ele entristeceu a Maria.",
        "'He saddened Mary' b.",
        "*Ele entristeceu a Maria triste.",
        "'He saddened Mary sad' The grammaticality contrast above is due to the fact that entristecer (to sadden) incorporates the telic state.",
        "This justifies that this verb can be paraphrased by tornar triste (to make sad).",
        "In this section we have mainly focused on property ascribing adjectives.",
        "We have considered two main subclasses, descriptive and relational adjectives, briefly presenting their syntactic and semantic behavior with regard to gradability, formation of polarity systems and their occurrence in predicative and attributive (both pronominally and postnominally) contexts and comparative structures.",
        "We have also addressed the issue of adjective relation with the noun they modify.",
        "Different adjective behavior regarding secondary predication is also discussed and analyzed in terms of the opposition between acci",
        "dental and permanent properties.",
        "The properties discussed in this section should be encoded in computational relational lexica such as wordnets."

        "The SIMPLE project addresses the semantics of adjectives in a similar way, identifying a set of common features relevant for classifying and describing adjective behavior.",
        "However, as noted by Peters and Peters (2000), even though similarities exist “adjectives belonging to the same semantic class may differ from each other in numerous ways”, i.e. the classes established in this way are not homogeneous.",
        "In WordNet, descriptive and relational adjectives are distinguished, first, by being encoded in separate files, and second, by the relations holding between synsets.",
        "Descriptive adjectives are organized in clusters of synsets, each cluster being associated by semantic similarity to a focal adjective which is linked to a contrasting cluster through an antonymy relation.",
        "Therefore, antonymy is the basic semantic relation used in WordNet to encode descriptive adjectives.",
        "As argued for in Miller (1998), this cluster organization of adjectives seems to mirror psychological principles.",
        "In fact, this organization is clearly motivated if we recognize that these adjectives main function regards the expression of attributes, and that an important number of attributes are bipolar.",
        "Relational adjectives, on the other hand, do not have antonyms.",
        "Therefore, they cannot be organized in opposite clusters.",
        "As pointed out by Levi (1978), the intrinsic meaning of these adjectives is something along the following lines: ‘of, relating/pertaining to, associated with’ some noun.",
        "The way these adjectives are encoded in WordNet mirrors this as it links relational adjectives to the nouns they relate to.",
        "In GermaNet a distinct treatment of relational and descriptive adjectives is abandoned, as the distinction between these two classes is considered to be ‘not at all clear’.",
        "Nonetheless, the WordNet strategy for distinguishing between different adjective classes is maintained: listing lexical items in different files3.",
        "As pointed out in the previous section, even if the distinction between these two classes is not always clear-cut, testing adjectives against the set of syntactic and semantic criteria presented in section 2 allows us to distinguish descriptive from relational adjectives.",
        "We consider that this distinction can be mirrored in the database via the semantic relations expressed in the network, adjective listing in different files not being therefore necessary.",
        "In order to do this we propose several cross-POS relations, since in the EuroWordNet model, unlike what happens in WordNet where each POS forms a separate system, it is possible to relate lexical items belonging to different POS.",
        "Such an approach has the 3 GermaNet classifies the adjectives into 15 semantic classes, following the classes proposed by Hundsnurscher and Splett (1982), with some minor changes: perceptional, spatial, temporality-related, motion-related, material-related, weather-related, body-related, mood-related, spirit-related, behaviour-related, social-related, quantity-related, relational and general adjectives.",
