        "Lexical association measures are mathematical formulas determining the strength of association between two or more words based on their occurrences and cooccurrences in a text corpus.",
        "They have a wide spectrum of applications in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics such as automatic collocation extraction (Manning and Schütze, 1999), bilingual word alignment (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003) or dependency parsing.",
        "A number of various association measures were introduced in the last decades.",
        "An overview of the most widely used techniques is given e.g. in Manning and Schütze (1999) or Pearce (2002).",
        "Several researchers also attempted to compare existing methods and suggest different evaluation schemes, e.g Kita (1994) and Evert (2001).",
        "A comprehensive study of statistical aspects of word cooccurrences can be found in Evert (2004) or Krenn (2000).",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic collocation extraction based on combining multiple lexical association measures.",
        "We also address the issue of the evaluation of association measures by precision-recall graphs and mean average precision scores.",
        "Finally, we propose a stepwise feature selection algorithm that reduces the number of combined measures needed with respect to performance on held-out data.",
        "The term collocation has both linguistic and lexicographic character.",
        "It has various definitions but none of them is widely accepted.",
        "We adopt the definition from Choueka (1988) who defines a collocational expression as “a syntactic and semantic unit whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived directly from the meaning or connotation of its components”.",
        "This notion of collocation is relatively wide and covers a broad range of lexical phenomena such as idioms, phrasal verbs, light verb compounds, technological expressions, proper names, and stock phrases.",
        "Our motivation originates from machine translation: we want to capture all phenomena that may require special treatment in translation.",
        "Experiments presented in this paper were performed on Czech data and our attention was restricted to two-word (bigram) collocations – primarily for the limited scalability of some methods to higher-order n-grams and also for the reason that experiments with longer word expressions would require processing of much larger corpus to obtain enough evidence of the observed events."

        "To avoid the experiments to be biased by underlying data preprocessing (part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and parsing), we extracted the reference data from morphologically and syntactically annotated Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 containing about 1.5 million words annotated on analytical layer (PDT 2.0, 2006).",
        "A corpus of this size is certainly not sufficient for real-world applications but we found it adequate for our evaluation purposes – a larger corpus would have made the manual collocation extraction task infeasible.",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Dependency trees from the corpus were broken down into dependency bigrams consisting of lemmas of the head word and its modifier, their part-of-speech pattern, and dependency type.",
        "From 87 980 sentences containing 1504 847 words, we obtained a total of 635 952 different dependency bigrams types.",
        "Only 26 450 of them occur in the data more than five times.",
        "The less frequent bigrams do not meet the requirement of sufficient evidence of observations needed by some methods used in this work (they assume normal distribution of observations and become unreliable when dealing with rare events) and were not included in the evaluation.",
        "We, however, must agree with Moore (2004) arguing that these cases comprise majority of all the data (the Zipfian phenomenon) and thus should not be excluded from real-world applications.",
        "Finally, we filtered out all bigrams having such part-of-speech patterns that never form a collocation (conjunction– preposition, preposition–pronoun, etc.)",

        "The first (expected) observation was that the in-terannotator agreement among all the categories was rather poor: the Cohen’s n between annotators ranged from 0.29 to 0.49, which demonstrates that the notion of collocation is very subjective, domain-specific, and somewhat vague.",
        "The reason that three annotators were used was to get a more precise and objective idea about what can be considered a collocation by combining outcomes from multiple annotators.",
