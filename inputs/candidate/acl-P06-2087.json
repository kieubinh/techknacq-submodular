        "Information retrieval (IR) is a challenging endeavor due to problems caused by the underlying expressiveness of all natural languages.",
        "One of these problems, synonymy, is that authors and users frequently employ different words or expressions to refer to the same meaning (accident may be expressed as event, incident, problem, difficulty, unfortunate situation, the subject of your last letter, what happened last week, etc.)",
        "(Furnas et al., 1987).",
        "Another problem is ambiguity, where a specific term may have several (and sometimes contradictory) meanings and interpretations (e.g., the word horse as in Trojan horse, light horse, to work like a horse, horse about).",
        "In order to obtain better meaning-based matches between queries and documents, various propositions have been suggested, usually without giving any consideration to the underlying domain.",
        "During our participation in different international evaluation campaigns such as the TREC Genomics track (Hersh, 2005), the BioCreative initiative (Hirschman et al., 2005), as well as in our attempts to deliver advanced search tools for biologists (Ruch, 2006) and healthcare providers (Ruch, 2002) (Ruch, 2004), we were more concerned with domain-specific information retrieval in which systems must return a ranked list of MEDLINE records in response to an expert’s information request.",
        "This involved a set of available queries describing typical search interests, in which gene, protein names, and diseases were often essential for an effective retrieval.",
        "Biomedical publications however tend to generate new information very rapidly and also use a wide variation in terminology, thus leading to the current situation whereby a large number of names, symbols and synonyms are used to denote the same concepts.",
        "Current solutions to these issues can be classified into domain-specific strategies, such as thesaurus-based expansion, and domain-independent strategies, such as blind-feedback.",
        "By proposing to explore a third type of approach, which attempts to take advantage of argumentative specificities of scientific reports, our study initiates a new research direction for natural language processing applied to information retrieval.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "Various query expansion techniques have been suggested to provide a better match between user information needs and documents, and to increase retrieval effectiveness.",
        "The general principle is to expand the query using words or phrases having a similar or related meaning to those appearing in the original request.",
        "Various empirical studies based on different IR models or collections have shown that this type of search strategy should usually be effective in enhancing retrieval performance.",
        "Scheme propositions such as this should consider the various relationships between words as well as term selection mechanisms and term weighting schemes (Robertson, 1990).",
        "The specific answers found to these questions may vary; thus a variety of query expansion approaches were suggested (Efthimiadis, 1996).",
        "In a first attempt to find related search terms, we might ask the user to select additional terms to be included in a new query, e.g. (Velez et al., 1997).",
        "This could be handled interactively through displaying a ranked list of retrieved items returned by the first query.",
        "Voorhees (Voorhees, 1994) proposed basing a scheme based on the WordNet thesaurus.",
        "The author demonstrated that terms having a lexical-semantic relation with the original query words (extracted from a synonym relationship) provided very little improvement (around 1% when compared to the original unexpanded query).",
        "As a second strategy for expanding the original query, Rocchio (Rocchio, 1971) proposed accounting for the relevance or irrelevance of top-ranked documents, according to the user’s manual input.",
        "In this case, a new query was automatically built in the form of a linear combination of the term included in the previous query and terms automatically extracted from both the relevant documents (with a positive weight) and non-relevant items (with a negative weight).",
        "Empirical studies (e.g., (Salton and Buckley, 1990)) demonstrated that such an approach is usually quite effective, and could",
        "be used more than once per query (Aalbers-berg, 1992).",
        "Buckley et al.",
        "(Singhal et al., 1996b) suggested that we could assume, without even looking at them or asking the user, that the top k ranked documents are relevant.",
        "Denoted the pseudo-relevance feedback or blind-query expansion approach, this approach is usually effective, at least when handling relatively large text collections.",
        "As a third source, we might use large text corpora to derive various term-term relationships, using statistically or information-based measures (Jones, 1971), (Manning and SchÄutze, 2000).",
        "For example, (Qiu and Frei, 1993) suggested that terms to be added to a new query could be extracted from a similarity thesaurus automatically built through calculating co-occurrence frequencies in the search collection.",
        "The underlying effect was to add idiosyncratic terms to the underlying document collection, related to the query terms by language use.",
        "When using such query expansion approaches, we can assume that the new terms are more appropriate for the retrieval of pertinent items than are lexically or semantically related terms provided by a general thesaurus or dictionary.",
        "To complement this global document analysis, (Croft, 1998) suggested that text passages (with a text window size of between 100 to 300 words) be taken into account.",
        "This local document analysis seemed to be more effective than a global term relationship generation.",
        "As a forth source of additional terms, we might account for specific user information needs and/or the underlying domain.",
        "In this vein, (Liu and Chu, 2005) suggested that terms related to the user’s intention or scenario might be included.",
        "In the medical domain, it was observed that users looking for information usually have an underlying scenario in mind (or a typical medical task).",
        "Knowing that the number of scenarios for a user is rather limited (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, etiology), the authors suggested automatically building a semantic network based on a domain-specific thesaurus (using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) in this case).",
        "The effectiveness of this strategy would of course depend on the quality and completeness of domain-specific knowledge sources.",
        "Using the well-known term frequency (tf)/inverse document frequency (idf) retrieval model, the domain-specific query-expansion scheme suggested by Liu and Chu (2005) produces better retrieval performance than a scheme based on statistics (MAP: 0.408 without query expansion, 0.433 using statistical methods and 0.452 with domain-specific approaches).",
        "In these different query expansion approaches, various underlying parameters must be specified, and generally there is no single theory able to help us find the most appropriate values.",
        "Recent empirical studies conducted in the context of the TREC Genomics track, using the OHSUGEN collection (Hersh, 2005), show that neither blind expansion (Rocchio), nor domain-specific query expansion (thesaurus-based Gene and Protein expansion) seem appropriate to improve retrieval effectiveness (Aronson et al., 2006) (Abdou et al., 2006)."
