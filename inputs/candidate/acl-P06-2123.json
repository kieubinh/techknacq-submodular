        "By analyzing the top results in the first and second Bakeoffs, (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) and (Emerson, 2005), we found the top results were produced by direct or indirect use of so-called “IOB” tagging, which converts the problem of word segmentation into one of character tagging so that part-of-speech tagging approaches can be used for word segmentation.",
        "This approach was also called “LMR” (Xue and Shen, 2003) or “BIES” (Asahara et al., 2005) tagging.",
        "Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ”B” if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ”I” otherwise, and ”O” if the character functioned as an independent word.",
        "For example, “�(whole) ILA �(Beijing city)” is labeled as“�/O IL/B A/I �/I”.",
        "Thus, the training data in word sequences are turned into IOB-labeled data in character sequences, which are then used as the training data for tagging.",
        "For new test data, word boundaries are determined based on the results of tagging.",
        "While the IOB tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation, we found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.",
        "In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.",
        "If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded to a character-based one.",
        "Taking the same example mentioned above, “�ILA�” is la",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics beled as “ -/O ILA;/B r4/I” in the subword-based tagging, where “ILA;/B” is labeled as one unit.",
        "We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.",
        "There exists a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields a very low in-vocabulary rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).",
        "In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using CRFs for the IOB tagging, yielded a very high R-oov in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.",
        "While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.",
        "In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen this weakness.",
        "By this approach we can change the R-oov and R-iv and find an optimal tradeoff.",

        "In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The approach outperformed the character-based method using both the MaxEnt and CRF approaches.",
        "We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation.",
        "By setting the confidence threshold, R-oov and R-iv can be changed accordingly.",
        "This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on users’ requirements to R-oov and R-iv."
