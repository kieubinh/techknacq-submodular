        "A speaker’s utterance may convey different meaning to a hearer.",
        "Such ambiguities can be resolved by emphasizing accents in different positions.",
        "Focus information is needed to select correct positions for accent information.",
        "To determine focus information, a speaker’s intentions must be revealed.",
        "We apply speech act theory to written sentences, our input, to determine a speaker’s intention.",
        "Subsequently our system will produce a speaker utterance, the result of analysis.",
        "Several research publications, such as (Steed-man and Prevost, 1994) and (Klein, 2000), explore prosodic analysis for spoken language generation (SLG).",
        "Klein (2000) designs constraints for prosodic structures in the HPSG framework.",
        "His approach is based on an isomorphism of syntactic and prosodic trees.",
        "This approach is heavily syntax-driven and involves making prosodic trees by manipulation of the syntactic trees.",
        "This approach results in increased complexity since the type hierarchy of phrases must cross-classify prosodic phrases under syntactic phrases.",
        "Haji-Abdolhosseini (2003) extended Klein’s approach.",
        "Rather than referring to syntax, Haji-Abdolhosseini sets the information domain to interact between the syntactic-semantic domain and the prosodic domain.",
        "His work reduces the complexity of type hierarchies and constraints which are not related to the syntactic structure.",
        "He designs the information structure and defines constraints for the HPSG framework.",
        "However his work limits the number of tone selections because he only defines two tone marks: rise-fall-rise and fall to annotate a sentence.",
        "Our work is inspired by Haji-Abdolhosseini’s work.",
        "We design the focus structure for spoken language generation.",
        "Based on the focus theory (Von Heusinger, 1999), the focus part identifies what part of the sentence can be marked with the strong accent or emphasized by a high tone.",
        "By analyzing speech acts, we can understand how speech with prosody can convey distinct speaker intentions to a hearer.",
        "In the next section, we present an overview of our FET (Focus to Emphasize Tone) system and its processes.",
        "We will explain how to analyze focus information, design the FET structure, and find the relationships of focus with speech acts to prosodic marks in section 3.",
        "We implement our FET grammar for the Linguistic Knowledge Base (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), generate a set of focus words, explain the FET environment, and show an example in section 4.",
        "In the last section, we conclude the current state of our work and the future work.",
        "Our system generates the prosodic structure depending on the focus analysis.",
        "We use this prosodic structure to modify synthetic speech for SLG.",
        "Our FET structure is constrained by the speaker’s intention.",
        "To define prosody, we explore the relationships of focus and speech acts from various sentence types.",
        "The diagram of our FET system is shown in figure 1 and we present an overview of the FET system based on the LKB system below.",
        "Our input is a sentence and its focus criterion obtained from a user.",
        "In figure 1, the example sentence is “Kim bought a flower” and the focus criterion is G (see table 2).",
        "Our system is composed of four main steps.",
        "The first step is preprocessing.",
        "The LKB system with the English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake, 2002) parses a sentence.",
        "The LKB system analyzes the syntactic and semantic structures and generates the Minimal Recursive Semantic (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1995) representation.",
        "This step occurs before invoking the FET system.",
        "In the second step, we scan the MRS structure and collect any components and their relations among them obtained from the preprocessing step.",
        "We select only required information, such as sentence mood, from the MRS representation, assign a speech act code referring to a main verb of a sentence, and obtain from the MRS structure a set of focus words.",
        "These focus words are an input for the focus information analysis in the FET system.",
        "The third step is the FET analysis.",
        "This step generates the prosodic components inside the FET structure.",
        "Using our FET grammar, we input the focus words into the LKB system with the FET environment.",
        "This environment consists of the FET type hierarchy, constraints, rules, and structures including the focus and prosodic features.",
        "Since the LKB system with FET environment can analyze the focus relations corresponding to speech acts and sentence moods, the system completes the FET structure by generating a set of appropriate prosodic structures containing prosodic marks as a result.",
        "The last step is the postprocessing process.",
        "We extract words and their prosodic marks as Tone and Break Index (ToBI) representations (Silverman et al., 1992) from the FET structure.",
        "The extracting system processes the FET structure, extracts only our required prosodic fields.",
        "These fields are a set of words and their tone marks for a sentence.",
        "We use the set of words with tone marks to modify synthetic speech, which is generated by speech synthesis.",
        "We use the PRAAT (Boersma and Weenink, 2005) to modify the prosody of the synthetic speech for a sentence.",
        "Our output is an audio file of the sentence with modified prosody.",
        "Modifying prosody follows the tone marks which are analyzed by the FET system."
