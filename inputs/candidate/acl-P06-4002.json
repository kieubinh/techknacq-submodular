        "From the canned text approach, in which the computer prints out a text given by a programmer, to the template filling approach, in which predetermined templates are filled up to produce a desired output, the applications and limitations of language generation have been widely studied.",
        "Well known applications of natural language generation can be found in human-computer conversation (HCC) systems.",
        "One of the most famous HCC systems, ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966), uses the template filling approach to generate the system’s response to a user input.",
        "For a dialogue system, the template filling approach works well in certain situations, however due to the templates limitations, nonsense is produced easily.",
        "In recent research Inui et al.",
        "(2003) have used a corpus-based approach to language generation.",
        "Due to its flexibility and applicability to open domain, such an approach might be considered as more robust than the template filling approach when applied to dialogue systems.",
        "In their approach, Inui et al.",
        "(2003), applied keyword matching in order to extract sample dialogues from a dialogue corpus, i.e., utterance-response pairs.",
        "After applying certain transfer or exchange rules, the sentence with maximum occurrence probability is given to the user as the system’s response.",
        "Other HCC systems, e.g. Wallace (2005), have applied the corpus based approach to natural language generation in order to retrieve system’s trivial dialogue responses.",
        "However, the creation of the hand crafted knowledge base, that is to say, a dialogue corpus, is a highly time consuming and hard to accomplish task1.",
        "Therefore we aim to automatically generate and evaluate a database of trivial dialogue phrases that could be implemented as knowledge base language generator for open domain dialogue systems, or chatbots.",
        "In this paper, we propose the automatic generation of trivial dialogue phrases through the application of a transfer-like genetic algorithm (GA) approach.",
        "We propose as well, the automatic evaluation of the correctness2 of the generated phrase using the WWW as a knowledge database.",
        "The generated database could serve as knowledge base to automatically improve publicly available chat-bot3 databases, e.g. Wallace (2005).",
