        "Different text and literature mining techniques have been developed recently in order to facilitate efficient discovery of knowledge contained in large textual collections.",
        "The main goal of literature mining is to retrieve knowledge that is “buried” in a text and to present the distilled knowledge to users in a concise form.",
        "Its advantage, compared to “manual” knowledge discovery, is based on the assumption that automatic methods are able to process an enormous amount of text.",
        "It is doubtful that any researcher could process such a huge amount of information, especially if the knowledge spans across domains.",
        "For these reasons, literature mining aims at helping scientists in collecting, maintaining, interpreting and curating information.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a knowledge structuring system (KSS) we designed, in which terminology-driven knowledge acquisition (KA), knowledge retrieval (KR) and knowledge visualization (KV) are combined using automatic term recognition, automatic term clustering and terminology-based similarity calculation is explained.",
        "The system incorporates our proposed automatic term recognition / clustering and a visualization of retrieved knowledge based on the terminology, which allow users to access KSs visually though sophisticated GUIs."

        "In order to achieve real time processing for structuring knowledge, we adopt terminology / ontology-based similarity calculation, because knowledge can also be represented as textual documents or passages (e.g. sentences, subsections) which are efficiently characterized by sets of specialized (technical) terms.",

        "The lack of clear naming standards in a domain (e.g. biomedicine) makes ATR a non-trivial problem (Fukuda et al., 1998).",

        "In practice, two problems stem from this fact: 1) there are terms that have multiple meanings (term ambiguity), and, conversely, 2) there are terms that refer to the same concept (term variation).",
        "Generally, term ambiguity has negative effects on IE precision, while term variation decreases IE recall.",
        "These problems show the difficulty of using simple keyword-based IE techniques.",
        "Obviously, more sophisticated techniques, identifying groups of different terms referring to the same (or similar) concept(s), and, therefore, could benefit from relying on efficient and consistent ATR/ATC and term variation management methods are required.",
        "These methods are also important for organising domain specific knowledge, as terms should not be treated isolated from other terms.",

        "In the second step, the term candidates are assigned termhood scores (referred to as C-values) according to a statistical measure.",
        "The measure amalgamates four numerical corpus-based characteristics of a candidate term, namely the frequency of occurrence, the frequency of occurrence as a substring of other candidate terms, the number of candidate terms containing the given candidate term as a substring, and the number of words contained in the candidate term.",
        "The NC-value method further improves the C-value results by taking into account the context of candidate terms.",

        "Finally, new termhood estimations, referred to as NC-values, are calculated as a linear combination of the C-values and context factors for the respective terms.",

        "Each term variant is normalized (see table 1 as an example) and term variants having the same normalized form are then grouped into classes in order to link each term candidate to all of its variants.",
