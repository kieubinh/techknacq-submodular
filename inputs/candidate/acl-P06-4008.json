        "K-QARD is a framework for implementing a fully automated question answering system including the Web information extraction (IE).",
        "The goal of the framework is to provide a practical environment for the restricted domain question answering (QA) system with the following requirements:",
        "• Domain portability: Domain adaptation of QA systems based on the framework should be possible with minimum human efforts.",
        "• Robustness: The framework has to provide",
        "methodologies to ensure robust performance for various expressions of a question.",
        "For the domain portability, K-QARD is designed as a domain-independent architecture and it keeps all domain-dependent elements in external resources.",
        "In addition, the framework tries to employ various techniques for reducing the human effort, such as simplifying rules based on linguistic information and machine learning approaches.",
        "Our effort for the robustness is focused the question analysis.",
        "Instead of using a technique for deep understanding of the question, the question analysis component of K-QARD tries to extract only essential information for answering using the information extraction technique with linguistic information.",
        "Such approach is helpful for",
        "not only the robustness but also the domain portability because it generally requires smaller size of hand-crafted rules than a complex semantic grammar.",
        "K-QARD uses the structural information automatically extracted from Web pages which include domain-specific information for question answering.",
        "It has the disavantage that the coverage of QA system is limited, but it can simplify the question answering process with robust performance."

        "The component outputs the best-matched frame whose slots are filled with the information extracted from the question.",
        "In the answer finding component, K-QARD retrieves the answers from the database using the SQL generation script defined in each semantic frame.",
        "The SQL script dynamically generates SQL using the values of the frame slots.",
        "The answer generation component provides the answer to the user as a natural language sentence or a table by using the generation rules and the answer frames which consist of canned texts."

        "Template Relation(TR) recognition: Finding the relation between TEs and a question focus based on TR rules, and syntactic information, etc.",
        "Finally, the question analysis component selects the proper frame for the question and fills proper values of each slot of the selected frame.",
        "Compared to other question analysis methods such as the complex semantic grammar(Martin et al., 1996), our approach has several advantages.",
        "First, it shows robust performance for the variation of a question because IE-based approach does not require the understanding of the entire sentence.",
        "It is sufficient to identify and process only the important concepts.",
        "Second, it also enhances the portability of the QA systems.",
        "This method is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy and uses only limited context information.",
        "By virture of these characteristics, the question analysis can be processed by using a small number of simple rules.",

        "Then, several domain-specific named entities, such as a TV program name, and general named entities, such as a date, in the question are recognized using our dictionary and pattern-based named entity tagger(Lee et al., 2004).",
        "Finally some important words, such as domain-specific predicates, terminologies or interrogatives, are replaced by the proper concept names in the ontology.",

        "One of possible defects of using such linguistic information is the loss of the robustness caused by the error of the NLP components.",
