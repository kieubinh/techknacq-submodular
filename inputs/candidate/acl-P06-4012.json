        "We will present a series of graph-based tools for a variety of NLP tasks such as text summarization, passage retrieval, prepositional phrase attachment, and binary classification in general.",
        "Recently proposed graph-based methods (Szummer and Jaakkola, 2001; Zhu and Ghahra-mani, 2002b; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002a; Toutanova et al., 2004) are particularly well suited for transductive learning (Vapnik, 1998; Joachims, 1999).",
        "Transductive learning is based on the idea (Vapnik, 1998) that instead of splitting a learning problem into two possibly harder problems, namely induction and deduction, one can build a model that covers both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Unlabeled data are abundant as well as significantly cheaper than labeled data in a variety of natural language applications.",
        "Parsing and machine translation both offer examples of this relationship, with unparsed text from the Web and untranslated texts being computationally less costly.",
        "These can then be used to supplement manually translated and aligned corpora.",
        "Hence transductive methods are of great potential for NLP problems and, as a result, LexNet includes a number of transductive methods."

        "The LexRank score of each node gives the probability of a random walk ending up in that node in the long run.",
        "An extractive summary is generated by retrieving the sentences with the highest score in the graph.",

      "heading": "3 Biased LexRank: passage retrieval",
      "text": [
        "The basic idea behind Biased LexRank is to label a small number of sentences (or passages) that are relevant to a particular query and then propagate relevance from these sentences to other (unannotated) sentences.",
        "Relevance propagation is performed on a bipartite graph.",
        "In that graph, one of the modes corresponds to the sentences and the other – to certain words from these sentences.",
        "Each sentence is connected to the words that appear in it.",
        "Thus indirectly, each sentence is two hops away from any other sentence that shares words in it.",
        "Intuitively, the sentences that are close to the labeled sentences tend to get higher scores.",
        "However, the relevance propagation en",
        "ables us to mark certain sentences that are not immediate neighbors of the labeled sentences via indirect connections.",
        "The effect of the propagation is discounted by a parameter at each step so that the relationships between closer nodes are favored more.",
        "Biased LexRank also allows for negative relevance to be propagated through the network as the example shows.",
        "See Figures 2– 3 for a demonstration of Biased LexRank."

        "A number of NLP problems such as word sense disambiguation, text categorization, and extractive summarization can be cast as classification problems.",
        "This fact is used to great effect in the design and application of many machine learning methods used in modern NLP, including TUMBL, through the utilization of vector representations.",
        "Each object is represented as a vector of features.",
        "The main assumption made is that a pair of objects and will be classified the same way if the distance between them in some space is small (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002a).",
        "This algorithm propagates polarity information first from the labeled data to the features, capturing whether each feature is more indicative of positive class or more negative learned.",
        "Such information is further transferred to the unlabeled set.",
        "The backward steps update feature polarity with information learned from the structure of the unlabeled data.",
