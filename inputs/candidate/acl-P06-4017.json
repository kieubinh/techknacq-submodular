        "In this paper we describe the current state of a new lexical resource: the Hinoki treebank.",
        "The ultimate goal of our research is natural language understanding – we aim to create a system that can parse text into some useful semantic representation.",
        "This is an ambitious goal, and this presentation does not present a complete solution, but rather a roadmap to the solution, with some progress along the way.",
        "The first phase of the project, which we present here, is to construct a syntactically and semantically annotated corpus based on the machine readable dictionary Lexeed (Kasahara et al., 2004).",
        "This is a hand built self-contained lexicon: it consists of headwords and their definitions for the most familiar 28,000 words of Japanese.",
        "Each definition and example sentence has been parsed, and the most appropriate analysis selected.",
        "Each content word in the sentences has been marked with the appropriate Lexeed sense.",
        "The syntactic model is embodied in a grammar, while the semantic model is linked by an ontology.",
        "This makes it possible to test the use of similarity and/or semantic class based back-offs for parsing and generation with both symbolic grammars and statistical models.",
        "In order to make the system self sustaining we base the first growth of our treebank on the dictionary definition sentences themselves.",
        "We then train a statistical model on the treebank and parse the entire lexicon.",
        "From this we induce a thesaurus.",
        "We are currently tagging other genres with the same information.",
        "We will then use this information and the thesaurus to build a parsing model that combines syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We will also produce a richer ontology – for example extracting selectional preferences.",
        "In the last phase, we will look at ways of extending our lexicon and ontology to less familiar words."

        "Treebanking the output of the parser allows us to immediately identify problems in the grammar, and improving the grammar directly improves the quality of the treebank in a mutually beneficial feedback loop.",
        "The second reason is that we wanted to annotate to a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations.",
        "By using a Japanese grammar (JACY: Siegel (2000)) based on a monostratal theory of grammar (Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar) we could simultaneously annotate syntactic and semantic structure without overburdening the annotator.",
        "The treebank records the complete syntacto-semantic analysis provided by the HPSG grammar, along with an annotator’s choice of the most appropriate parse.",

        ".",

        "The third reason was that use of the grammar as a base enforces consistency – all sentences annotated are guaranteed to have well-formed parses.",
        "The last reason was the availability of a reasonably robust existing HPSG of Japanese (JACY), and a wide range of open source tools for developing the grammars.",

        "If at least one of the index word’s classes is subsumed by at least one of the genus’ classes, then we consider the relationship confirmed.",
