        "The Outilex Project (Blanc et al., 2006) aims to develop an open-linguistic platform, including tools, electronic dictionaries and grammars, dedicated to text processing.",
        "It is the result of the collaboration of ten French partners, composed of 4 universities and 6 industrial organizations.",
        "The project started in 2002 and will end in 2006.",
        "The platform which will be made freely available to research, development and industry in April 2007, comprises software components implementing all the fundamental operations of written text processing: text segmentation, morphosyntactic tagging, parsing with grammars and language resource management.",
        "All Language Resources are structured in XML formats, as well as binary formats more adequate to efficient processing; the required format converters are included in the platform.",
        "The grammar formalism allows for the combination of statistical approaches with resource-based approaches.",
        "Manually constructed lexicons of substantial coverage for French and English, originating from the former LADL1, will be distributed with the platform under LGPL-LR2 license.",
        "The platform aims to be a generalist base for diverse processings on text corpora.",
        "Furthermore, it uses portable formats and format converters that would allow for combining several software components.",
        "There exist a lot of platforms dedicated to NLP, but none are fully satisfactory for various reasons.",
        "Intex (Silberztein, 1993), FSM (Mohri et al., 1998) and Xelda3 are closed source.",
        "Unitex (Paumier, 2003), inspired by Intex has its source code under LGPL license4 but it does not support standard formats for Language Resources (LR).",
        "Systems like NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) and Gate (Cunningham, 2002) do not offer functionality for Lexical Resource Management.",
        "All the operations described below are implemented in C++ independent modules which interact with each others through XML streams.",
        "Each functionality is accessible by programmers through a specified API and by end users through binary programs.",
        "Programs can be invoked by a Graphical User Interface implemented in Java.",
        "This interface allows the user to define his own processing flow as well as to work on several projects with specific texts, dictionaries and grammars.",

        "Rules of segmentation in tokens and sentences are based on the categorization of characters defined by the Unicode norm.",
        "Each token is associated with information such as its type (word, number, punctuation, ...), its alphabet (Latin, Greek), its case (lowercase word, capitalized word, ...), and other information for the other symbols (opening or closing punctuation symbol, ...).",

      "text": [
        "By using lexicons and grammars, our platform includes the notion of multiword units, and allows for the handling of several types of morphosyntac-tic ambiguities.",
        "Usually, stochastic morphosyntactic taggers (Schmid, 1994; Brill, 1995) do not handle well such notions.",
        "However, the use of lexicons by companies working in the domain has much developed over the past few years.",
        "That is why Outilex provides a complete set of software components handling operations on lexicons.",
        "IGM also contributed to this project by freely distributing a large amount of the LADL lexicons6 with fine-grained tagsets7: for French, 109,912 simple lemmas and 86,337 compound lemmas; for English, 166,150 simple lemmas and 13,361 compound lemmas.",
        "These resources are available under LGPL-LR license.",
        "Outilex programs are compatible with all European languages using inflection by suffix.",
        "Extensions will be necessary for the other types of languages.",
        "Our morphosyntactic tagger takes a segmented text as an input; each form (simple or compound) is assigned a set of possible tags, extracted from",
        "indexed lexicons (cf. section 6).",
        "Several lexicons can be applied at the same time.",
        "A system of priority allows for the blocking of analyses extracted from lexicons with low priority if the considered form is also present in a lexicon with a higher priority.",
        "Therefore, we provide by default a general lexicon proposing a large set of analyses for standard language.",
        "The user can, for a specific application, enrich it by means of complementary lexicons and/or filter it with a specialized lexicon for his/her domain.",
        "The dictionary lookup can be parameterized to ignore case and diacritics, which can assist the tagger to adapt to the type of processed text (academic papers, web pages, emails, ...).",
        "Applied to a corpus of AFP journalistic telegrams with the above mentioned dictionaries, Outilex tags about 6,650 words per second8.",
        "The result of this operation is an acyclic automaton (sometimes, called word lattice in this context), that represents segmentation and tagging ambiguities.",
        "This tagged text can be serialized in an XML format, compatible with the draft model MAF (Morphosyntactic Annotation Frame-work)(Cl´ement and de la Clergerie, 2005).",
        "All further processing described in the next section will be run on this automaton, possibly modifying it."

      "heading": "5 Text Parsing",
      "text": [
        "Grammatical formalisms are very numerous in NLP.",
        "Outilex uses a minimal formalism: Recursive Transition Network (RTN)(Woods, 1970) that are represented in the form of recursive automata (automata that call other automata).",
        "The terminal symbols are lexical masks (Blanc and Dister, 2004), which are underspecified word tags i.e. that represent a set of tagged words matching with the specified features (e.g. noun in the plural).",
        "Trans-ductions can be put in our RTNs.",
        "This can be used, for instance, to insert tags in texts and therefore formalize relations between identified segments.",
        "This formalism allows for the construction of local grammars in the sense of (Gross, 1993).",
        "It has been successfully used in different types of applications: information extraction (Poibeau, 84.7 % of the token occurrences were not found in the dictionary; This value falls to 0.4 % if we remove the capitalized occurrences.",
        "The processing time could appear rather slow; but, this task involves not so trivial computations such as conversion between different charsets or approximated lookup using Unicode character properties.",
        "2001; Nakamura, 2005), named entity localization (Krstev et al., 2005), grammatical structure identification (Mason, 2004; Danlos, 2005)).",
        "All of these experiments resulted in recall and precision rates equaling the state-of-the-art.",
        "This formalism has been enhanced with weights that are assigned to the automata transitions.",
        "Thus, grammars can be integrated into hybrid systems using both statistical methods and methods based on linguistic resources.",
        "We call the obtained formalism Weighted Recursive Transition Network (WRTN).",
        "These grammars are constructed in the form of graphs with an editor and are saved in an XML format (Sastre, 2005).",
        "Each graph (or automaton) is optimized with epsilon transition removal, determinization and minimization operations.",
        "It is also possible to transform a grammar in an equivalent or approximate finite state transducer, by copying the sub-graphs into the main automaton.",
        "The result generally requires more memory space but can highly accelerate processing.",
        "Our parser is based on Earley algorithm (Earley, 1970) that has been adapted to deal with WRTN (instead of context-free grammar) and a text in the form of an acyclic finite state automaton (instead of a word sequence).",
        "The result of the parsing consists of a shared forest of weighted syntactic trees for each sentence.",
        "The nodes of the trees are decorated by the possible outputs of the grammar.",
        "This shared forest can be processed to get different types of results, such as a list of concordances, an annotated text or a modified text automaton.",
        "By applying a noun phrase grammar (Paumier, 2003) on a corpus of AFP journalistic telegrams, our parser processed 12,466 words per second and found 39,468 occurrences.",
        "The platform includes a concordancer that allows for listing in their occurring context different occurrences of the patterns described in the grammar.",
        "Concordances can be sorted according to the text order or lexicographic order.",
        "The concordancer is a valuable tool for linguists who are interested in finding the different uses of linguistic forms in corpora.",
        "It is also of great interest to improve grammars during their construction.",
        "Also included is a module to apply a transducer on a text.",
        "It produces a text with the outputs of the grammar inserted in the text or with recognized segments replaced by the outputs.",
        "In the case of a weighted grammar, weights are criteria to select between several concurrent analyses.",
        "A criterion on the length of the recognized sequences can also be used.",
        "For more complex processes, a variant of this functionality produces an automaton corresponding to the original text automaton with new transitions tagged with the grammar outputs.",
        "This process is easily iterable and can then be used for incremental recognition and annotation of longer and longer segments.",
        "It can also complete the morphosyntactic tagging for the recognition of semi-frozen lexical units, whose variations are too complex to be enumerated in dictionaries, but can be easily described in local grammars.",
        "Also included is a deep syntactic parser based on unification grammars in the decorated WRTN formalism (Blanc and Constant, 2005).",
        "This formalism combines WRTN formalism with functional equations on feature structures.",
        "Therefore, complex syntactic phenomena, such as the extraction of a grammatical element or the resolution of some co-references, can be formalized.",
        "In addition, the result of the parsing is also a shared forest of syntactic trees.",
        "Each tree is associated with a feature structure where are represented grammatical relations between syntactical constituents that have been identified during parsing."
