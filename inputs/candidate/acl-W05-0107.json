        "Most of the undergraduate computer science majors and about a third of the M.S.",
        "students come from the hi-tech corridor west of Chicago or small towns near the university.",
        "The remaining M.S.",
        "students are international students, currently mostly from India.",
        "This paper discusses my experiences in two semesters of teaching Introduction to NLP and three semesters of teaching an NLP unit in an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.",
        "Because the students have no background in linguistics and are not used to reading the type of academic prose found in the textbook (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000), the most successful units I have taught involved concrete assignments where students could see for themselves the phenomena discussed in class.",
        "Successful assignments also did not assume any background in linguistics, even such basic notions as part of speech.",
        "To provide an overview of the field, each year the NLP course contains three segments: one on a statistical approach to NLP, one on syntax, and one on a logic-based approach.",
        "The three segments are also chosen to include topics from phonology and morphology, syntax, and pragmatics.",
        "The specific content changes from year to year in an effort to find topics that both represent current issues in the field and capture the students’ imagination.",
        "This paper describes three of the most successful assignments.",
        "For each one, I describe the assignment, the topics the students learned, and why it was successful.",
        "The three assignments are: duplicating Kernighan et al.’s Bayesian approach",
        "to spelling correction, a study of Greenberg’s universals in a language other than English (usually the student’s native language), and a dialogue generation project using my research software."

        "The preferred career path among the students is to obtain a programming job in local industry, preferably in a hi-tech area.",
        "However, among both undergraduates and graduate students, a few continue their education.",
        "One minority student with no previous experience in research became interested and is now planning to apply to a PhD program.",
        "In general, students take the course out of a desire to do something different from the normal operating systems, networking and database courses.",
        "An occasional student also takes the course because it fits in their schedule or because it doesn’t have onerous prerequisites.",
        "In general, the international students have good to near-native competence in spoken English, although a few cannot not follow my lectures, and some do not have sufficient writing skills for an essay exam.",
        "All could read my lecture notes without difficulty.",
