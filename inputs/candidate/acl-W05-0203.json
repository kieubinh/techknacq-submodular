        "Multiple-choice question exams are widely used and are effective to assess students’ knowledge, however it is costly to manually produce those questions.",
        "Naturally, this kind of task should be done with a help of computer.",
        "Nevertheless, there have been very few attempts to generate multiple-choice questions automatically.",
        "Mitkov et al.",
        "(2003) generated questions for a linguistics exam in a semi-automatic way and evaluated that it exceeds manually made ones in cost and is at least equivalent in quality.",
        "There are some other researches that involve generating questions with multiple alternatives (Dicheva and Dimitrova, 1998).",
        "But to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to generate this kind of questions in a totally automatic way.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach to generate multiple-choice questions using machine learning techniques.",
        "The questions generated are those of fill-in-the-blank type, so it does not involve transforming declarative sentences into question sentences as in Mitkov’s work.",
        "This simplicity makes the method to be language independent.",
        "Although this application can be very versatile, in that it can be used to test any kind of knowledge as in history exams, as a purpose of this research we limit ourselves to testing student’s proficiency in a foreign language.",
        "One of the purposes of this research is to automatically extract important words or phrases in a text for a learner of the language."

        "1962 (100 true and 1862 false) instances were obtained.",
        "The label true here is supposed to indicate that it is possible to make a question with the sentence with a blank in the specified position, while many of the shifted positions which are labeled false can also be good blanks.",
        "A semi-supervised learning (Chakrabarti, 2003) 1 is conducted in the following manner to retrieve the instances that are potentially true among the ones initially classified as false.",
        "We retrieved the 13 instances (shown in Table 1.)",
        "which had initially been labeled as false and classified as true in a test-on-train result with a certainty 2 of more than 0.5 with a Naive Bayes classifier 3.",

        "The KNN classifier tends to be more accurate and seems to be more robust, although given the fact that it produces less blanks.",
        "The fact that an instance-based algorithm exceeds Naive Bayes, whose decision depends on the whole data, can be ascribed to a mixed nature of the training data.",
        "For example, blanks for grammar questions might have different features from ones for vocabulary questions.",
        "The result we sampled has exhibited another problem of Naive Bayes algorithm.",
        "In two articles among the data, it has shown the tendency to make a blank on be-verbs.",
        "Naive Bayes tends to choose the",
        "same word as a blank position, therefore generates many questions on the same word in one article.",
        "Another general problem of these methods would be that the blank positions are decided without consideration of one another; the question will be sometimes too difficult when another blank is next to or in the vicinity of the blank."
