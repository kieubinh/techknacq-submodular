        "Human one-to-one tutoring often yields significantly higher learning gains than classroom instruction (Bloom, 1984).",
        "This difference motivates natural language tutoring research, which hopes to discover which aspects of tutorial dialogs correlate with learning.",
        "Much of this research focuses on various dialog characteristics.",
        "For example, (Graesser et al., 1995) argue that the important components of tutoring include question answering and explanatory reasoning.",
        "In other work (Litman et al., 2004) examine dialog characteristics that can be identified automatically, such as ratio of student to tutor words, and average turn length.",
        "In this paper, rather than look at characteristics of the tutoring dialog itself, we feed the dialog into a computational model of student memory, in which we then find a measure correlated with learning.",
        "This “Landscape Model” (van den Broek et al., 1996) proves useful for predicting how much students remember from tutoring sessions, as measured by their learning gains.",
        "We will first briefly describe the Landscape Model.",
        "Then we will describe the tutoring experiments from which we draw a corpus of dialogs, and how the model was applied to this corpus.",
        "Finally, we cover the model’s success in predicting learning."

        "The Landscape Model was designed by van den Broek et al.",
        "(1996) to simulate human reading comprehension.",
        "In this model, readers process a text sentence-by-sentence.",
        "Each sentence contains explicitly mentioned concepts which are added into working memory.",
        "In addition, the reader may re-instantiate concepts from earlier reading cycles or from world knowledge in an effort to maintain a coherent representation.",
        "Concepts are entered into working memory with initial activation values, which then decay over subsequent reading cycles.",
        "After concepts are entered, the model calculates connection strengths between them.",
        "Two concepts that are active in working memory at the same time will be given a link.",
        "The higher the levels of concept activation, the stronger the link will be.",
        "Van den Broek et al.",
        "(1996) give this formula for calculating link strengths: This defines the strength of the connection between concepts x and y as the product of their activations (A) at each cycle i, summed over all reading cycles.",
        "Two matrices result from these calculations.",
        "The first is a matrix of activation strengths, showing all the active concepts and their values for each reading cycle.",
        "The second is a square matrix of link values showing the strength of the connection between",
        "each pair of concepts.",
