        "The main motivations behind developing automated essay assessment systems are to decrease the time in which students get feedback for their writings, and to reduce the costs of grading.",
        "The assumption in most of the systems is that the grades given by the human assessors describe the true quality of an essay.",
        "Thus, the aim of the systems is to “simulate” the grading process of a human grader and a system is usable only if it is able to perform the grading as accurately as human raters.",
        "An automated assessment system is not affected by errors caused by lack of consistency, fatigue or bias, thus it can help achieving better accuracy and objectivity of assessment (Page and Petersen, 1995).",
        "There has been research on automatic essay grading since the 1960s.",
        "The earliest systems, such as PEG (Page and Petersen, 1995), based their grading on the surface information from the essay.",
        "For example, the number of words and commas were counted in order to determine the quality of the essays (Page, 1966).",
        "Although these kinds of systems performed considerably well, they also received heavy criticism (Page and Petersen, 1995).",
        "Some researchers consider the use of natural language as a feature for human intelligence (Hearst et al., 2000) and writing as a method to express the intelligence.",
        "Based on that assumption, taking the surface information into account and ignoring the meanings of the content is insufficient.",
        "Recent systems and studies, such as e-rater (Burstein, 2003) and approaches based on LSA (Landauer et al., 1998), have focused on developing the methods which determine the quality of the essays with more analytic measures such as syntactic and semantic structure of the essays.",
        "At the same time in the 1990s, the progress of natural language processing and information retrieval techniques have given the opportunity to take also the meanings into account.",
        "LSA has produced promising results in content analysis of essays (Landauer et al., 1997; Foltz et al., 1999b).",
        "Intelligent Essay Assessor (Foltz et al., 1999b) and Select-a-Kibitzer (Wiemer-Hastings and Graesser, 2000) apply LSA for assessing essays written in English.",
        "In Apex (Lemaire and Dessus, 2001), LSA is applied to essays written in French.",
        "In addition to the essay assessment, LSA is applied to other educational applications.",
        "An intelligent tutoring system for providing help for students (Wiemer",
        "Hastings et al., 1999) and Summary Street (Stein-hart, 2000), which is a system for assessing summaries, are some examples of other applications of LSA.",
        "To our knowledge, there is no system utilizing PLSA (Hofmann, 2001) for automated essay assessment or related tasks.",
        "We have developed an essay grading system, Automatic Essay Assessor (AEA), to be used to analyze essay answers written in Finnish, although the system is designed in a way that it is not limited to only one language.",
        "It applies both course materials, such as passages from lecture notes and course textbooks covering the assignment-specific knowledge, and essays graded by humans to build the model for assessment.",
        "In this study, we employ both LSA and PLSA methods to determine the similarities between the essays and the comparison materials in order to determine the grades.",
        "We compare the accuracy of these methods by using the Spearman correlation between computer and human assigned grades.",

        "There are two approaches commonly used in the essay grading systems to determine the grade for the essay:",
        "1.",
        "The essay to be graded is compared to the human-graded essays and the grade is based on the most similar essays’ grades; or 2.",
        "The essay to be graded is compared to the essay topic related materials (e.g. textbook or model essays) and the grade is given based on the similarity to these materials.",
        "In our system, AEA (Kakkonen and Sutinen, 2004), we have combined these two approaches.",
        "The relevant parts of the learning materials, such as chapters of a textbook, are used to train the system with assignment-specific knowledge.",
        "The approaches based on the comparison between the essays to be graded and the textbook have been introduced in (Landauer et al., 1997; Foltz et al., 1999a; Lemaire and Dessus, 2001; Hearst et al., 2000), but have been usually found less accurate than the methods based on comparison to prescored essays.",
        "Our method attempts to overcome this by combining the use of course content and prescored essays.",
        "The essays to be graded are not directly compared to the prescored essays with for instance k-nearest neighbors method, but prescored essays are used to determine the similarity threshold values for grade categories as discussed below.",
        "Prescored essays can also be used to determine the optimal dimension for the reduced matrix in LSA as discussed in Kakkonen et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the grading process of our system.",
        "The texts to be analyzed are added into word-by-context matrix (WCM), representing the number of occurrences of each unique word in each of the contexts (e.g. documents, paragraphs or sentences).",
        "In WCM M, cell MZj contains the count of the word i occurrences in the context j.",
        "As the first step in analyzing the essays and course materials, the lemma of each word form occurring in the texts must be found.",
        "We have so far applied AEA only to essays written in Finnish.",
        "Finnish is morphologically more complex than English, and word forms are formed by adding suffixes into base forms.",
        "Because of that,",
        "base forms have to be used instead of inflectional forms when building the WCM, especially if a relatively small corpus is utilized.",
        "Furthermore, several words can become synonyms when suffixes are added to them, thus making the word sense disambiguation necessary.",
        "Hence, instead of just stripping suffixes, we apply a more sophisticated method, a morphological parser and disambiguator, namely Constraint Grammar parser for Finnish (FINCG) to produce the lemmas for each word (Lingsoft, 2005).",
        "In addition, the most commonly occurring words (stopwords) are not included in the matrix, and only the words that appear in at least two contexts are added into the WCM (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "We also apply entropy-based term weighting in order to give higher values to words that are more important for the content and lower values to words with less importance.",
        "First, the comparison materials based on the relevant textbook passages or other course materials are modified into machine readable form with the method described in the previous paragraph.",
        "The vector for each context in the comparison materials is marked with �z.",
        "This WCM is used to create the model with LSA, PLSA or another information retrieval method.",
        "To compare the similarity of an essay to the course materials, a query vector Xj of the same form as the vectors in the WCM is constructed.",
        "The query vector Xj representing an essay is added orfolded in into the model build with WCM with the method specific way discussed later.",
        "This folded-in query �Xj is then compared to the model of each text passage ��z in the comparison material by using a similarity measure to determine the similarity value.",
        "We have used the cosine of the angle between (�Xj, ��z ), to measure the similarity of two documents.",
        "The similarity score for an essay is calculated as the sum of the similarities between the essay and each of the textbook passages.",
        "The document vectors of manually graded essays are compared to the textbook passages, in order to determine the similarity scores between the essays and the course materials.",
        "Based on these measures, threshold values for the grade categories are defined as follows: the grade categories, g1, g2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", gC, are associated with similarity value limits, l1, l2, ... , lC+1, where C is the number of grades, and lC+1 = oc and normally l1 = 0 or – oc.",
        "Other category limits lz, 2 < i < C, are defined as weighted averages of the similarity scores for essays belonging to grade categories gz and gz−1.",
        "Other kinds of formulas to define the grade category limits can be also used.",
        "The grade for each essay to be graded is then determined by calculating the similarity score between the essay and the textbook passages and comparing the similarity score to the threshold values defined in the previous phase.",
        "The similarity score Sz of an essay dz is matched to the grade categories according to their limits in order to determine the correct grade category as follows: For each i, 1 < i < C, if lz < Sz < lz+1 then dz E gz and break."

        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998) is a corpus-based method used in information retrieval with vector space models.",
        "It provides a means of comparing the semantic similarity between the source and target texts.",
        "LSA has been successfully applied to automate giving grades and feedback on free-text responses in several systems as discussed in Section 1.",
        "The basic assumption behind LSA is that there is a close relationship between the meaning of a text and the words in that text.",
        "The power of LSA lies in the fact that it is able to map the essays with similar wordings closer to each other in the vector space.",
        "The LSA method is able to strengthen the similarity between two texts even when they do not contain common words.",
        "We describe briefly the technical details of the method.",
        "The essence of LSA is dimension reduction based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), an algebraic technique.",
        "SVD is a form of factor analysis, which reduces the dimensionality of the original WCM and thereby increases the dependency between contexts and words (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "SVD is defined as X = T0S0D0� , where X is the preprocessed WCM and T0 and D0 are orthonormal matrices representing the words and the contexts.",
        "S0 is a diagonal matrix with singular values.",
        "In the dimension reduction, the k highest singular values in S0 are selected and the rest are ignored.",
        "With this operation, an approximation matrix X� of the original matrix X is acquired.",
        "The aim of the dimension reduction is to reduce “noise” or unimportant details and to allow the underlying semantic structure to be",
        "come evident (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "In information retrieval and essay grading, the queries or essays have to be folded in into the model in order to calculate the similarities between the documents in the model and the query.",
        "In LSA, the folding in can be achieved with a simple matrix multiplication: �XQ = XTQ T0 So 1, where XQ is the term vector constructed from the query document with preprocessing, and T0 and S0 are the matrices from the SVD of the model after dimension reduction.",
        "The resulting vector �XQ is in the same format as the documents in the model.",
        "The features that make LSA suitable for automated grading of essays can be summarized as follows.",
        "First, the method focuses on the content of the essay, not on the surface features or keyword-based content analysis.",
        "The second advantage is that LSA-based scoring can be performed with relatively low amount of human graded essays.",
        "Other methods, such as PEG and e-rater typically need several hundred essays to be able to form an assignment-specific model (Shermis et al., 2001; Burstein and Marcu, 2000) whereas LSA-based IEA system has sometimes been calibrated with as few as 20 essays, though it typically needs more essays (Hearst et al., 2000).",
        "Although LSA has been successfully applied in information retrieval and related fields, it has also received criticism (Hofmann, 2001; Blei et al., 2003).",
        "The objective function determining the optimal decomposition in LSA is the Frobenius norm.",
        "This corresponds to an implicit additive Gaussian noise assumption on the counts and may be inadequate.",
        "This seems to be acceptable with small document collections but with large document collections it might have a negative effect.",
        "LSA does not define a properly normalized probability distribution and, even worse, the approximation matrix may contain negative entries meaning that a document contains negative number of certain words after the dimension reduction.",
        "Hence, it is impossible to treat LSA as a generative language model and moreover, the use of different similarity measures is limited.",
        "Furthermore, there is no obvious interpretation of the directions in the latent semantic space.",
        "This might have an effect if also feedback is given.",
        "Choosing the number of dimensions in LSA is typically based on an ad hoc heuristics.",
        "However, there is research done aiming to resolve the problem of dimension selection in LSA, especially in the essay grading domain (Kakkonen et al., 2005)."

        "Although standard EM algorithm can lead to good results, it may also overfit the model to the training data and perform poorly with unseen data.",
        "Furthermore, the algorithm is iterative and converges slowly, which can increase the runtime seriously.",
        "Hence, Hofmann (2001) proposes another approach called Tempered EM (TEM), which is a derivation of standard EM algorithm.",
        "In TEM, the M-step is the same as in EM, but a dampening parameter is introduced into the E-step as shown in equation (4).",
        "The parameter Q will dampen the posterior probabilities closer to uniform distribution, when Q < 1 and form the standard E-step when Q = 1.",

        "In PLSA, the folding in is done by using TEM as well.",
        "The only difference when folding in a new document or query q outside the model is that just the probabilities P(zk I q) are updated during the M-step and the P(wj I zk) are kept as they are.",
        "The similarities between a document di in the model and a query q folded in to the model can be calculated with the cosine of the angle between the vectors containing the probability distributions (P(zkIq))xk=1 and (P(zkIdi))xk=1 (Hofmann, 2001).",
        "PLSA, unlike LSA, defines proper probability distributions to the documents and has its basis in Statistics.",

        "PLSA is interpretable with its generative model, latent classes and illustrations in N-dimensional space (Hofmann, 2001).",
