        "Prince defines “old” and “new” with respect to the discourse model as well as the hearer’s point of view.",
        "Considering the interaction of both these aspects, we define as new an entity which has not been previously referred to and is yet unknown to the hearer, and as mediated an entity that is newly mentioned in the dialogue but that the hearer can infer from the prior context.3 This is mainly the case of generally known entities (such as “the sun”, or “the Pope” (L¨obner, 1985)), and bridging (Clark, 1975), where an entity is related to a previously introduced one.",
        "Whenever an entity is not new nor mediated is considered as old.",
        "Because finer-grained distinctions (e.g. (Prince, 1981; Lambrecht, 1994)) have proved hard to distinguish reliably in practice, we organise our scheme hierarchically: we use the three main classes described above as top level categories for which more specific subtypes can assigned.",
        "This approach preserves a high-level, more reliable distinction while allowing a finer-grained classification that can be exploited for specific tasks.",
        "Besides the main categories, we introduce two more classes.",
        "A category non-applicable is used for",
        "wrongly extracted markables (such as “course” in “of course”), for idiomatic occurrences, and expletive uses of “it”.",
        "Traces are automatically extracted as markables, but are left unannotated.",
        "In the rare event the annotators find some fragments too difficult to understand, a category not-understood can be assigned.",
        "Entities marked as non-applicable or not-understood are excluded from any further annotation.",
        "For all other markables, the annotators must choose between old, mediated, and new.",
        "For the first two, subtypes can also be specified: subtype assignment is encouraged but not compulsory.",
        "New The category new is assigned to entities that have not yet been introduced in the dialogue and that the hearer cannot infer from previously mentioned entities.",
        "No subtypes are specified for this category.",
        "Mediated Mediated entities are inferrable from previously mentioned ones, or generally known to the hearer.",
        "We specify nine subtypes: general, bound, part, situation, event, set, poss, func value, aggregation.4 Generally known entities such as “the moon” or “Italy” are assigned a subtype general.",
        "Most proper nouns fall into this subclass, but the annotator could opt for a different tag, depending on the context.",
        "Also mediated are bound pronouns, such as “them” in (1), which are assigned a subtype bound.5",

        "Four subtypes (part, situation, event, and set) are used to mark instances of bridging.",

        "Two old or med entities, for instance do not give rise to an old coordinated NP, unless it has been previously introduced as such.",
        "A mediated/aggregation tag is assigned instead.",
        "Old An entity is old when it is not new nor mediated.",
        "This is usually the case if an entity is coreferential with an already introduced entity, if it is a generic pronoun, or if it is a personal pronoun referring to the dialogue participants.",
        "Six different subtypes are available for old entities: identity, event, general, generic, ident generic, relative.",

        "(6) [... ] we camped in a tent, and uh there were two other couples with us.",
        "In addition, a coreference link is marked up between anaphor and antecedent, thus creating anaphoric chains (see also (Carletta et al., 2004)).",
        "The subtype event applies whenever the antecedent is a VP.",
        "In (7), “it” is old/event, as its antecedent is the VP “educate three”.",

        "I don’t know how my parents did it.",
        "Also classified as old are personal pronouns referring to the dialogue participants as well as generic pronouns.",
        "In the first case, a subtype general is specified, whereas the subtype for the second is generic.",
        "An instance of old/generic is “you” in (8).",
        "(8) up here you got to wait until Aug August until the water warms up.",
        "In a chain of generic references, the subtype ident generic is assigned, and a coreference link is marked up.",
        "Coreference is also marked up for relative pronouns: they receive a subtype relative and are linked back to their head.",
        "The guidelines contain a decision tree the annotators use to establish priority in case more than one class is appropriate for a given entity.",
        "For example, if a mediated/general entity is also old/identity the latter is to be preferred to the former.",
        "Similar precedence relations hold among subtypes.",
        "To provide more robust and reliable clues in annotating bridging types (e.g. for distinguishing between poss and part), we provided replacement tests and referred to relations encoded in knowledge bases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for part) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) (for situation)."

        "Since both words are contrastive, either or both could have L+H* accents, whereas “say” could not.",
        "The inclusion of the latter in the theme is consistent with the possibility of a rising boundary LH% after it.",
        "“The FBI has told him” is thematic because it links “Yemen’s president ”’s opinion to the previous discourse.",
        "It also would sound appropriate with an L+H*LH% tune.",
        "As can be seen, although theme/rheme and prosodic phrase boundaries align, in both cases the VP is split between information/intonation phrases.",
        "The independence of information structure and intonation structure from traditional surface structure is a major reason behind our use of ‘stand-off’ markup."
