        "The paradox of language change is that on the one hand, children seem to learn the language of their parents very robustly, and yet for example, the English spoken in 800 AD is foreign to speakers of Modern English, and Latin somehow diverged into numerous mutually foreign languages.",
        "A number of models and simulations have been studied using historical linguistics and acquisition studies to build on one another (Yang, 2002; Lightfoot, 1999; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996).",
        "This paper describes the initial stages of a long term project undertaken in consultation with Anthony Kroch, designed to integrate knowledge from these and other areas of linguistics into a mathematical model of the entire history of English.",
        "As a first step, this paper examines the verb-second phenomenon, which has caused some difficulty in other simulations.",
        "The history of English and other languages requires simulated populations to have certain long-term behaviors.",
        "Assuming that syntax can change without a non-syntactic driving force, these requirements place informative restrictions on the acquisition algorithm.",
        "Specifically, the behavior of this simulation suggests that children are aware of the topic of a sentence and use it during acquisition, that children take into account whether or not a sentence can be parsed by multiple hypothetical grammars, and that speakers are aware of variety in their linguistic environment but do not make as much use of it individually.",
        "As discussed in (Yang, 2002) and (Kroch, 1989), both Middle English and Old French had a syntactic rule, typical of Germanic languages, known as verb-second or V2, in which top-level sentences are re-organized: The finite verb moves to the front, and the topic moves in front of that.",
        "These two languages both lost V2 word order.",
        "Yang (2002) also states that other Romance languages once had V2 and lost it.",
        "However, Middle English is the only Germanic language to have lost V2.",
        "A current hypothesis for how V2 is acquired supposes that children listen for cue sentences that cannot be parsed without V2 (Lightfoot, 1999).",
        "Specifically, sentences with an initial non-subject topic and",
        "finite verb are the cues for V2:",
        "(1) [cr TopicXP cV [1p Subject ... ]] (2) [[On þis gær] wolde [þe king Stephne tæ-cen...]]",
        "[[in this year] wanted [the king Stephen seize...]] ‘During this year king Stephen wanted to seize...’ (Fischer et al., 2000, p. 130) This hypothesis suggests that the loss of V2 can be attributed to a decline in cue sentences in speech.",
        "Once the change is actuated, feedback from the learning process propels it to completion.",
        "Several questions immediately arise: Can the initial decline happen spontaneously, as a consequence of purely linguistic factors?",
        "Specifically, can a purely syntactic force cause the decline of cue sentences, or must it be driven by a phonological or morphological change?",
        "Alternatively, given the robustness of child language acquisition, must the initial decline be due to an external event, such as contact or social upheaval?",
        "Finally, why did Middle English and Old French lose V2, but not German, Yiddish, or Icelandic?",
        "And what can all of this say about the acquisition process?",
        "Yang and Kroch suggest the following hypothesis concerning why some V2 languages, but not all, are unstable.",
        "Middle English (specifically, the southern dialects) and Old French had particular features that obscured the evidence for V2 present in the primary linguistic data available for children:",
        "• Both had underlying subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.",
        "For a declarative sentence with topicalized subject, an SVO+V2 grammar generates the same surface word order as an SVO grammar without V2.",
        "Hence, such sentences are uninformative as to whether children should use V2 or not.",
        "According to estimates quoted in (Yang, 2002) and (Lightfoot, 1999), about 70% of sentences in modern V2 languages fall into this category.",
        "• Both allowed sentence-initial adjuncts, which came before the fronted topic and verb.",
        "• Subject pronouns were different from full NP subjects in both languages.",
        "In Middle English, subject pronouns had clitic-like properties that caused them to appear to the left of the finite verb, thereby placing the verb in third position.",
        "Old French was a pro-drop language, so subject pronouns could be omitted, leaving the verb first.",
        "The Middle English was even more complex due to its regional dialects.",
        "The northern dialect was heavily influenced by Scandinavian invaders: Sentence-initial adjuncts were not used, and subject pronouns were treated the same as full NP subjects.",
        "Other Germanic languages have some of these factors, but not all.",
        "For example, Icelandic has underlying SVO order but does not allow additional adjuncts.",
        "It is therefore reasonable to suppose that these confounds increase the probability that natural variation or an external influence might disturb the occurrence rate of cue sentences enough to actuate the loss of V2.",
        "An additional complication, exposed by manuscript data, is that the population seems to progress as a whole.",
        "There is no indication that some speakers use a V2 grammar exclusively and the rest never use V2, with the decline in V2 coming from a reduction in the number of exclusively V2 speakers.",
        "Instead, manuscripts show highly variable rates of use of unambiguously V2 sentences, suggesting that all individuals used V2 at varying rates, and that the overall rate decreased from generation to generation.",
        "Furthermore, children seem to use mixtures of adult grammars during acquisition (Yang, 2002).",
        "These features suggest that modeling only idealized adult speech may not be sufficient; rather, the mixed speech of children and adults in a transitional environment is crucial to formulating a model that can be compared to acquisition and manuscript data.",
        "A number of models and simulations of language learning and change have been formulated (Niyogi and Berwick, 1996; Niyogi and Berwick, 1997; Briscoe, 2000; Gibson and Wexler, 1994; Mitchener, 2003; Mitchener and Nowak, 2003; Mitchener and Nowak, 2004; Komarova et al., 2001) based on the simplifying assumption that speakers use one grammar exclusively.",
        "Frequently, V2 can never be lost in",
        "such simulations, perhaps because the learning algorithm is highly sensitive to noise.",
        "For example, a simple batch learner that accumulates sample sentences and tries to pick a grammar consistent with all of them might end up with a V2 grammar on the basis of a single cue sentence.",
        "The present work is concerned with developing an improved simulation framework for investigating syntactic change.",
        "The simulated population consists of individual simulated people called agents that can use arbitrary mixtures of idealized grammars called fuzzy grammars.",
        "Fuzzy grammars enable the simulation to replicate smooth, population-wide transitions from one dominant idealized grammar to another.",
        "Fuzzy grammars require a more sophisticated learning algorithm than would be required for an agent to acquire a single idealized grammar: Agents must acquire usage rates for the different idealized grammars rather than a small set of discrete parameter values."

        "The change of interest is the loss of V2 in Middle English and Old French, in particular why V2 was unstable in these languages but not in others.",
        "Therefore, the idealized grammars allowed in this simulation will be limited to four: All have underlying subject-verb-object word order, and allow sentence-initial adjuncts.",
        "The options are V2 or not, and pro-drop or not.",
        "Thus, a grammar is specified by a pair of binary parameter values.",
        "For simplicity, the pro-drop parameter as in Old French is used rather than trying to model the clitic status of Middle English subject pronouns.",
        "Sentences are limited to a few basic types of declarative statements, following the degree-0 learning hypothesis (Lightfoot, 1999): The sentence may or may not begin with an adjunct, the subject may be either a full noun phrase or a pronoun, and the verb may optionally require an object or a subject.",
        "A verb, such as rain, that does not require a subject is given an expletive pronoun subject if the grammar is not pro-drop.",
        "Additionally, either the adjunct, the subject, or the object may be topicalized.",
        "For a V2 grammar, the topicalized constituent appears just before the verb; otherwise it is indicated only by spoken emphasis.",
        "A fuzzy grammar consists of a pair of beta distributions with parameters a and Q, following the convention from (Gelman et al., 2004) that the density for Beta(a, Q) is",
        "Each beta distribution controls one parameter in the idealized grammar.' The special case of Beta(1,1) is the uniform distribution, and two such distributions are used as the initial state for the agent’s fuzzy grammar.",
        "The density for Beta(1 + m,1 + n) is a bump with peak at m/(m + n) that grows sharper for larger values of m and n. Thus, it incorporates a natural critical period, as each additional data point changes the mean less and less, while allowing for variation in adult grammars as seen in manuscripts.",
        "To produce a sentence, an agent with fuzzy grammar (Beta(a1, 01), Beta(a2, 02)) constructs an idealized grammar from a pair of random parameter settings, each 0 or 1, selected as follows.",
        "The agent picks a random number Qff – Beta(aff, �ff ), then sets parameter j to 1 with probability Qff and 0 with probability 1 – Qff .",
        "An equivalent and faster operation is to set parameter j to 1 with probability �ff and 0 with probability 1 – �ff , where �ff = aff / (aff + �ff ) is the mean of Beta(aff, Off).",
        "To learn from a sentence, an agent first constructs a random idealized grammar as before.",
        "If the grammar can parse the sentence, then some of the agent’s beta distributions are adjusted to increase the probability that the successful grammar is selected again.",
        "If the grammar cannot parse the sentence, then no adjustment is made.",
        "To adjust Beta(a, Q) to favor 1, the agent increments the first parameter, yielding Beta(a + 1, Q).",
        "To adjust it to favor 0, the agent increments the second parameter, yielding Beta(a, Q + 1).",
        "Within this general framework, many variations are possible.",
        "For example, the initial state of an agent, the choice of which beta distributions to update for particular sentences, and the social structure (who speaks to who) may all be varied.",
        "'The beta distribution is the conjugate prior for using Bayesian inference to estimate the probability a biased coin will come up heads: If the prior distribution is Beta(a, ,Q), the posterior after m heads and n tails is Beta(a + m,,3 + n).",
        "The simulation in (Briscoe, 2002) also makes use of Bayesian learning, but within an algorithm for which learners switch abruptly from one idealized grammar to another as estimated probabilities cross certain thresholds.",
        "The smoother algorithm used here is preferable because children do not switch abruptly between grammars (Yang, 2002).",
        "Furthermore, this algorithm allows simulations to include children’s highly variable speech.",
        "Children learning from each other is thought be an important force in certain language changes; for example, a recent change in the Icelandic case system, known as dative sickness, is thought to be spreading through this mechanism."

        "To the learning model outlined so far, we add the following restrictions.",
        "The social structure is fixed in a loop: There are n agents, each of which converses with its two neighbors.",
        "The parameters �i and Oi are restricted to be between 1 and N. Thus, the population can be in one of Non possible states, which is large but finite.",
        "Time is discrete with each time increment representing a single sentence spoken by some agent to a neighbor.",
        "The population is represented by a sequence of states (Xt)t�Z.",
        "The population is updated as follows by a transition function Xt+1 = O(Xt, Ut) that is fed the current population state plus a tuple of random numbers Ut.",
        "One agent is selected uniformly at random to be the hearer.",
        "With probability pr, that agent dies and is replaced by a baby in an initial state (Beta(1,1), Beta (1,1)).",
        "With probability 1 – pr, the agent survives and hears a sentence spoken by a randomly selected neighbor.",
        "Two variations of the learning process are explored here.",
        "The first, called LEARN-ALWAYS, serves as a base line: The hearer picks an idealized grammar according to its fuzzy grammar, and tries to parse the sentence.",
        "If it succeeds, it updates any one beta distribution selected at random in favor of the parameter that led to a successful parse.",
        "If the parse fails, no update is made.",
        "This algorithm is similar to Naive Parameter Learning with Batch (Yang, 2002, p. 24), but adapted to learn a fuzzy grammar rather than an idealized grammar, and to update the agent’s knowledge of only one syntactic parameter at a time.",
        "The second, called PARAMETER-CRUCIAL, is the same except that the parameter is only updated if it is crucial to the parse: The agent tries to parse the sentence with that parameter in the other setting.",
        "If the second parse succeeds, then the parameter is not considered crucial and is left unchanged, but if it fails, then the parameter is crucial and the original setting is reinforced.",
        "This algorithm builds on LEARN-ALWAYS by restricting learning to sentences that are more or less unambiguous cues for the speaker’s setting for one of the syntactic parameters.",
        "The theory of cue-based learning assumes that children incorporate particular features into their grammar upon hearing specific sentences that unambiguously require them.",
        "This process is thought to be a significant factor in language change (Lightfoot, 1999) as it provides a feedback mechanism: Once a parameter setting begins to decline, cues for it will become less frequent in the population, resulting in further decline in the next generation.",
        "A difficulty with the theory of cue-based learning is that it is unclear what exactly “unambiguous” should mean, because realistic language models generally have cases where no single sentence type is unique to a particular grammar or parameter setting (Yang, 2002, p. 34, 39).",
        "The definition of a crucial parameter preserves the spirit of cue-based learning while avoiding potential difficulties inherent in the concept of “unambiguous.” These modifications result in a finite-state Markov chain with several useful properties.",
        "It is irreducible, which means that there is a strictly positive probability of eventually getting from any initial state to any other target state.",
        "To see this, observe that there is a tiny but strictly positive probability that in the next several transitions, all the agents will die and the following sentence exchanges will happen just right to bring the population to the target state.",
        "This Markov chain is also aperiodic, which means that at any time t far enough into the future, there is a strictly positive probability that the chain will have returned to its original state.",
        "Aperiodicity is a consequence of irreducibility and the fact that there is a strictly positive probability that the chain does not change states from one time step to the next.",
        "That happens when a hearer fails to parse a sentence, for example.",
        "An irreducible aperiodic Markov chain al",
        "ways has a stationary distribution.",
        "This is a probability distribution on its states, normally denoted 7r, such that the probability that Xt = x converges to 7r(x) as t – * oc no matter what the initial state X0 is.",
        "Furthermore, the transition function preserves 7r, which means that if X is distributed according to 7r, then so is O(X, U).",
        "The stationary distribution represents the long term behavior of the Markov chain.",
        "Agents have a natural partial ordering >- defined",
        "This ordering means that the left-hand agent is slanted more toward 1 in both parameters.",
        "Not all pairs of agent states are comparable, but there are unique maximum and minimum agent states under this partial ordering,",
        "such that all agent states A satisfy Amax >- A >-Amin.",
        "Let us consider two population states X and Y and denote the agents in X by Aj and the agents in Y by Bj, where 1 < j < n. The population states may also be partially ordered, as we can define X >- Y to mean all corresponding agents satisfy Aj >- Bj .",
        "There are also maximum and minimum population states Xmax and Xmin defined by setting all agent states to Amax and Amin, respectively.",
        "A Markov chain is monotonic if the set of states has a partial ordering with maximum and minimum elements and a transition function that respects that ordering.",
        "There is a perfect sampling algorithm called monotonic coupling from the past (MCFTP) that generates samples from the stationary distribution 7r of a monotonic Markov chain without requiring certain properties of it that are difficult to compute (Propp and Wilson, 1996).",
        "The partial ordering >- on population states was constructed so that this algorithm could be used.",
        "The transition function O mostly respects this partial ordering, that is, if X >-Y, then with high probability O(X, U) >- O(Y, U).",
        "This monotonicity property is why O was defined to change only one agent per time step, and why the learning algorithms change that agent’s knowledge of at most one parameter per time step.",
        "However, O does not quite respect >-, because one can construct X, Y, and U such that X >- Y but O(X, U) and O(Y, U) are not comparable.",
        "So, MCFTP does not necessarily produce correctly distributed samples.",
        "However, it turns out to be a reasonable heuristic, and until further theory can be developed and applied to this problem, it is the best that can be done.",
        "The MCFTP algorithm works as follows.",
        "We suppose that (Ut)tEZ is a sequence of tuples of random numbers, and that (Xt)tEZ is a sequence of random states such that each Xt is distributed according to 7r and Xt+1 = O(Xt, Ut).",
        "We will determine X0 and return it as the random sample from the distribution 7r.",
        "To determine X0, we start at time T < 0 with a list of all possible states, and compute their futures using O and the sequence of Ut.",
        "If O has been chosen properly, many of these paths will converge, and with any luck, at time 0 they will all be in the same state.",
        "If this happens, then we have found a time T such that no matter what XT is, there is only one possible value for X0, and that random state is distributed according to 7r as desired.",
        "Otherwise, we continue, starting twice as far back at time 2T, and so on.",
        "This procedure is generally impractical if the number of possible states is large.",
        "However, if the Markov chain is monotonic, we can take the shortcut of only looking at the two paths starting at Xmax and Xmin at time T. If these agree at time 0, then all other paths are squeezed in between and must agree as well."

        "The fourth, SVO+V2+pro-drop, ought to be unstable and give way to SVO+pro-drop, since it approximates Old French before it changed.",

        "This modification ensures that no language within the simulation is a subset of any of the others.",
        "The addition of spoken stress is theoretically plausible for several reasons.",

        "Second, Chinese allows topics to be dropped where permitted by discourse, a feature also observed in the speech of children learning English.",

        "This state represents an even mixture of all four grammars and is clearly unrealistic.",
        "To see why this happens, imagine a fixed linguistic environment and an isolated agent learning from this environment with no birth-and-death process.",
        "This process is a Markov chain with a single absorbing state A, meaning that once the learner reaches state A it cannot change to any other state: Every learning step requires increasing one of the numerical parameters in the agent’s state, and if they are all maximal, then no further change can take place.",
        "Starting from any initial state, the agent will eventually reach the absorbing state.",
        "The number of states for an agent must be finite for practical and theoretical reasons, but by making N very large, the time it takes for an agent to reach A becomes far greater than its life span under the birth-and-death process, thereby avoiding the saturation problem.",

        "An additional modification was put in place to encourage agents toward using predominantly one grammar.",

        "Each agent has a probability prof dying and being replaced if it is selected.",
        "Therefore, the probability of an agent living to age m is (1 – pr)Ipr, with a mean of (1 – pr)/pr.",
        "For pr = 0.001, this gives an average life span of 999 listening interactions.",
        "Each agent is selected to listen or be replaced with probability 1/40, so the average lifespan is approximately 40, 000 steps of the Markov chain, which is between 215 and 216.",
        "Hence, the mixing time is on the order of 228-16 = 4096 times the lifespan of an individual agent.",
        "In real life, taking a lifespan to be 40 years, that corresponds to at least 160, 000 years.",
        "Furthermore, this is an underestimate, because true human language is far more complex and should have an even longer mixing time.",
        "Thus, this simulation suggests that the linguistic transitions we observe in real life taking place over a few decades are essentially transient behavior."

        "With reasonable parameter settings, populations in this simulation are able to both gain and lose V2, an improvement over other simulations, including earlier versions of this one, that tend to always converge to SVO+V2+pro-drop.",
        "Furthermore, such changes can happen spontaneously, without an externally imposed catastrophe.",
        "The simulation does not give reasonable results unless learners can tell which component of a sentence is the topic.",
        "Preliminary results suggest that the PARAMETER-CRUCIAL learning algorithm gives more realistic results than the LEARN-ALWAYS algorithm, supporting the hypothesis that much of language acquisition is based on cue sentences that are in some sense unambiguous indicators of the grammar that generates them.",
        "Timing properties of the simulation suggest that it takes many generations for a population to effectively forget its original state, suggesting that further research should focus on the simulation’s transient behavior rather than on its stationary distribution.",
        "In future research, this simulation will be extended to include other possible grammars, particularly approximations of Middle English and Icelandic.",
        "That should be an appropriate level of detail for studying the loss of V2.",
        "For studying the rise of V2, the simulation should also include V1 grammars as in Celtic languages, where the finite verb raises but the topic remains in place.",
        "According to Kroch (personal communication) V2 is thought to arise from V1 languages rather than directly from SOV or SVO languages, so the learning algorithm should be tuned so that V 1 languages are more likely to become V2 than non-V1 languages.",
        "The learning algorithms described here do not include any bias in favor of unmarked grammatical features, a property that is thought to be necessary for the acquisition of subset languages.",
        "One could easily add such a bias by starting newborns with non-uniform prior information, such as Beta(1, 20) for example.",
        "It is generally accepted that V2 is marked based on derivational economy.2 Pro-drop is more complicated, as there is no consensus on which setting is marked .3 The correct biases are not obvious, and determining them requires further research.",
        "Further extensions will include more complex population structure and literacy, with the goal of eventually comparing the results of the simulation to data from the Pennsylvania Parsed Corpus of Middle English."
