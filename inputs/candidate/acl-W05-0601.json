        "The large literature on term clustering, term similarity and weighting schemes shows that document similarity is a central topic in Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "The research efforts have mostly been directed in enriching the document representation by using clustering (term generalization) or adding compounds (term specifications).",
        "These studies are based on the assumption that the similarity between two documents can be expressed as the similarity between pairs of matching terms.",
        "Following this idea,",
        "term clustering methods based on corpus term distributions or on external prior knowledge (e.g. provided by WordNet) were used to improve the basic term matching.",
        "An example of statistical clustering is given in (Bekkerman et al., 2001).",
        "A feature selection technique, which clusters similar features/words, called the Information Bottleneck (IB), was applied to Text Categorization (TC).",
        "Such cluster based representation outperformed the simple bag-of-words on only one out of the three experimented collections.",
        "The effective use of external prior knowledge is even more difficult since no attempt has ever been successful to improve document retrieval or text classification accuracy, (e.g. see (Smeaton, 1999; Sussna, 1993; Voorhees, 1993; Voorhees, 1994; Moschitti and Basili, 2004)).",
        "The main problem of term cluster based representations seems the unclear nature of the relationship between the word and the cluster information levels.",
        "Even if (semantic) clusters tend to improve the system recall, simple terms are, on a large scale, more accurate (e.g. (Moschitti and Basili, 2004)).",
        "To overcome this problem, hybrid spaces containing terms and clusters were experimented (e.g. (Scott and Matwin, 1999)) but the results, again, showed that the mixed statistical distributions of clusters and terms impact either marginally or even negatively on the overall accuracy.",
        "In (Voorhees, 1993; Smeaton, 1999), clusters of synonymous terms as defined in WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998) were used for document retrieval.",
        "The results showed that the misleading information due to the wrong choice of the local term senses causes the overall accuracy to decrease.",
        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) was thus applied beforehand by indexing the documents by means of disambiguated senses, i.e. synset codes (Smeaton, 1999;",
        "Sussna, 1993; Voorhees, 1993; Voorhees, 1994; Moschitti and Basili, 2004).",
        "However, even the state-of-the-art methods for WSD did not improve the accuracy because of the inherent noise introduced by the disambiguation mistakes.",
        "The above studies suggest that term clusters decrease the precision of the system as they force weakly related or unrelated (in case of disambiguation errors) terms to give a contribution in the similarity function.",
        "The successful introduction of prior external knowledge relies on the solution of the above problem.",
        "In this paper, a model to introduce the semantic lexical knowledge contained in the WN hierarchy in a supervised text classification task has been proposed.",
        "Intuitively, the main idea is that the documents d are represented through the set of all pairs in the vocabulary < t, t' > E V x V originating by the terms t E d and all the words t' E V, e.g. the WN nouns.",
        "When the similarity between two documents is evaluated, their matching pairs are used to account for the final score.",
        "The weight given to each term pair is proportional to the similarity that the two terms have in WN.",
        "Thus, the term t of the first document contributes to the document similarity according to its relatedness with any of the terms of the second document and the prior external knowledge, provided by WN, quantifies the single term to term relatedness.",
        "Such approach has two advantages: (a) we obtain a well defined space which supports the similarity between terms of different surface forms based on external knowledge and (b) we avoid to explicitly define term or sense clusters which inevitably introduce noise.",
        "The class of spaces which embeds the above pair information may be composed by O ( V 2) dimensions.",
        "If we consider only the WN nouns (about 105), our space contains about 1010 dimensions which is not manageable by most of the learning algorithms.",
        "Kernel methods, can solve this problem as they allow us to use an implicit space representation in the learning algorithms.",
        "Among them Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) are kernel based learners which achieve high accuracy in presence of many irrelevant features.",
        "This is another important property as selection of the informative pairs is left to the SVM learning.",
        "Moreover, as we believe that the prior knowledge in TC is not so useful when there is a sufficient amount of training documents, we experimented our model in poor training conditions (e.g. less equal than 20 documents for each category).",
        "The improvements in the accuracy, observed on the classification of the well known Reuters and 20 NewsGroups corpora, show that our document similarity model is very promising for general IR tasks: unlike previous attempts, it makes sense of the adoption of semantic external resources (i.e. WN) in IR.",

        "A term proximity function is used to design a kernel able to semantically smooth the similarity between two document terms.",
        "Such semantic kernel was designed as a combination of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with the term proximity matrix.",
        "Entries in this matrix are inversely proportional to the length of the WN hierarchy path linking the two terms.",
        "The performance, measured over the 20NewsGroups corpus, showed an improvement of 2% over the bag-of-words.",
        "Three main differences exist with respect to our approach.",
        "First, the term proximity does not fully capture the WN topological information.",
        "Equidistant terms receive the same similarity irrespectively from their generalization level.",
        "For example, Sky and Location (direct hyponyms of Entity) receive a similarity score equal to knife and gun (hyponyms of weapon).",
        "More accurate measures have been widely discussed in literature, e.g. (Resnik, 1997).",
        "Second, the kernel-based CD similarity is an elegant combination of lexicalized and semantic information.",
        "In (Siolas and d’Alch Buc, 2000) the combination of weighting schemes, the RBF kernel and the proximitry matrix has a much less clear interpretation.",
        "Finally, (Siolas and d’Alch Buc, 2000) selected only 200 features via Mutual Information statistics.",
        "In this way rare or non statistically significant terms are neglected while being source of often relevant contributions in the SK space modeled over WN.",
        "Other important work on semantic kernel for retrieval has been developed in (Cristianini et al.,",
        "2002; Kandola et al., 2002).",
        "Two methods for inferring semantic similarity from a corpus were proposed.",
        "In the first a system of equations were derived from the dual relation between word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa.",
        "The equilibrium point was used to derive the semantic similarity measure.",
        "The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information.",
        "The major difference with our approach is the use of a different source of prior knowledge.",
        "Similar techniques were also applied in (Hofmann, 2000) to derive a Fisher kernel based on a latent class decomposition of the term-document matrix."

        "The introduction of semantic prior knowledge in IR has always been an interesting subject as the examined literature suggests.",
        "In this paper, we used the conceptual density function on the WordNet (WN) hierarchy to define a document similarity metric.",
        "Accordingly, we defined a semantic kernel to train Support Vector Machine classifiers.",
        "Cross-validation experiments over 8 categories of 20NewsGroups and Reuters over multiple samples have shown that in poor training data conditions, the WN prior knowledge can be effectively used to improve (up to 4.5 absolute percent points, i.e. 10%) the TC accuracy.",
        "These promising results enable a number of future researches: (1) larger scale experiments with different measures and semantic similarity models (e.g. (Resnik, 1997)); (2) improvement of the overall efficiency by exploring feature selection methods over the SK, and (3) the extension of the semantic similarity by a general (i.e. non binary) application of the conceptual density model."
