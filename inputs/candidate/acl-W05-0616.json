        "Once this mapping is established, solutions for the new instance can be induced, based on one or several analogs.",
        "The implementation of this kind of inference process requires techniques for searching for, and reasoning with, structural mappings, hence the need to properly define the notion of analogical relationships and to efficiently implement their computation.",
        "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the typical dimensionality of databases, which are made up of hundreds of thousands of instances, makes the search for complex structural mappings a very challenging task.",
        "It is however possible to take advantage of the specific nature of linguistic data to work around this problem.",
        "Formal (surface) analogical relationships between linguistic representations are often a good sign of deeper analogies: a surface similarity between the word strings write and writer denotes a deeper (semantic) similarity between the related concepts.",
        "Surface similarities can of course be misleading.",
        "In order to minimize such confusions, one can take advantage of other specificities of linguistic data: (i) their systemic organization in (pseudo)-paradigms, and (ii) their high level of redundancy.",
        "In a large lexicon, we can indeed expect to find many instances of pairs like write-writer: for instance read-reader, review-reviewer...",
        "Complementing surface analogies with statistical information thus has the potential to make the search problem tractable, while still providing with many good analogs.",
        "Various attempts have been made to use surface analogies in various contexts: automatic word pronunciation (Yvon, 1999), morphological analysis (Lepage, 1999a; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999) and syntactical analysis (Lepage, 1999b).",
        "These experiments have mainly focused on linear represen",
        "tations of linguistic data, taking the form of finite sequences of symbols, using a restrictive and sometimes ad-hoc definition of the notion of an analogy.",
        "The first contribution of this paper is to propose a general definition of formal analogical proportions for algebraic structures commonly used in NLP: attribute-value vectors, words on finite alphabets and labeled trees.",
        "The second contribution is to show how these formal definitions can be used within an instance-based learning framework to learn morphological regularities.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",

        "The ability to identify analogical relationships between what looks like unrelated situations, and to use these relationships to solve complex problems, lies at the core of human cognition (Gentner et al., 2001).",
        "A number of models of this ability have been proposed, based on symbolic (e.g. (Falken-heimer and Gentner, 1986; Thagard et al., 1990; Hofstadter and the Fluid Analogies Research group, 1995)) or subsymbolic (e.g. (Plate, 2000; Holyoak and Hummel, 2001)) approaches.",
        "The main focus of these models is the dynamic process of analogy making, which involves the identification of a structural mappings between a memorized and a new situation.",
        "Structural mapping relates situations which, while being apparently very different, share a set of common high-level relationships.",
        "The building of a structural mapping between two situations utilizes several subparts of their descriptions and the relationships between them.",
        "Analogy-making seems to play a central role in our reasoning ability; it is also invoked to explain some human skills which do not involve any sort of conscious reasoning.",
        "This is the case for many tasks related to the perception and production of language: lexical access, morphological parsing, word pronunciation, etc.",
        "In this context, analogical models have been proposed as a viable alternative to rule-based models, and many implementation of these low-level analogical processes have been proposed such as decision trees, neural networks or instance-based learning methods (see e.g. (Skousen, 1989; Daele-mans et al., 1999)).",
        "These models share an acceptation of analogy which mainly relies on surface similarities between instances.",

        "Moreover, inputs and outputs are regarded in a symmetrical way: outputs are not restricted to a set of labels, and can also be structured objects such as sequences.",

        "In this paper, we have presented a generic analogical inference procedure, which applies to a wide range of actual learning tasks, and we have detailed its instantiation for common feature types.",
        "Preliminary experiments have been conducted on two morphological analysis tasks and have shown promising generalization performance.",
        "These results suggest that our main hypotheses are valid: (i) searching for triples is tractable even with databases containing several hundred of thousands instances; (ii) formal analogical proportions are a reliable sign of deeper analogies between lin",
        "guistic entities; they can thus be used to devise flexible and effective learners for NLP tasks.",
        "This work is currently being developed in various directions: first, we are gathering additional experimental results on several NLP tasks, to get a deeper understanding of the generalization capabilities of our analogical learner.",
        "One interesting issue, not addressed in this paper, is the integration of various forms of linguistic knowledge in the definition of analogical proportions, or in the specification of the search procedure.",
        "We are also considering alternative heuristic search procedures, which could improve or complement the approaches presented in this paper.",
        "A possible extension would be to define and take advantage of non-uniform distributions of training instances, which could be used both during the searching and ranking steps.",
        "We finally believe that this approach might also prove useful in other application domains involving structured data and are willing to experiment with other kinds of data."
