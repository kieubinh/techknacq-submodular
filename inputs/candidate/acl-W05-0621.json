        "In general, semantic role information is useful for sentence understanding.",
        "We submitted our system for closed challenge at CONLL-2005 shared task.",
        "This task encourages participants to use novel machine learning techniques suited to the task of semantic role labelling.",

        "Our approach has two stages; first, identification whether the argument is mandatory or optional and second, the classification or labelling of the arguments.",
        "In the first stage, the arguments of a verb are put into three classes, (1) mandatory, (2) optional or (3) null.",
        "Null stands for the fact that the constituent of the verb in the sentence is not an semantic argument of the verb.",
        "It is used to rule out the false argument of the verb which were obtained using the parser.",
        "The maximum entropy based classifier is used to classify the arguments into one of the above three labels.",
        "After obtaining information about the nature of the non-null arguments, we proceed in the second stage to classify the mandatory and optional arguments into their semantic roles.",
        "The propbank sub-categorization frames are used to assign roles to the mandatory arguments.",
        "For example, in the sentence ”John saw a tree”, the sub-categorization frame ”A0 v A1” would assign the roles A0 to John and A1 to tree respectively.",
        "After using all the sub-categorization frames of the verb irre",
        "spective of the verb sense, there could be ambiguity in the assignment of semantic roles to mandatory arguments.",
        "The unlabelled mandatory arguments and the optional arguments are assigned the most probable semantic role which is not one of the frame elements of the sub-categorization frame using the maximum entropy model.",
        "Now, among all the sequences of roles assigned to the non-null arguments, the sequence which has the maximum joint probability is chosen.",
        "We obtained an accuracy of 68.14% using our approach.",
