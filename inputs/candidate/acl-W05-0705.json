        "The first task for introducing a new language is to create the lexical resources for this language.",
        "Since Arabic presents agglutination of articles, prepositions and conjunctions at the beginning of words as well as pronouns at the end of words, and these phenomena were not treated in our existing Euro",
        "pean languages4, we had to decide how this feature would be handled in the lexicon.",
        "Solutions to this problem have been proposed, ranging from generation and storage of all agglutinated words forms (Debili and Zouari, 1985) to the compilation of valid sequences of proclitics, words and enclitics into finite-state machines (Beesley, 1996).",
        "Our system had already addressed the problem of compounds for German in the following way: if an input word is not present in the dictionary, a compound-searching module returns all complete sequences of dictionary words (a list of possible compound joining \"fogemorphemes\" is passed to this module) as valid decompositions of the input word.",
        "Though theoretically this method could be used to treat Arabic clitics, we decided against using this existing process for two reasons:",
        "1.",
        "Contrary to German, in which any noun may theoretically be the first element of a compound, Arabic clitics belong to a",
        "small closed set of articles, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns.",
        "Allowing any word to appear at the beginning or end of an agglutinated word would generate unnecessary noise.",

        "Storing all words with all possible clitics would multiply the size of lexicon proportionally to the number of legal possible combinations.",
        "We decided that this would take up too much space, though others have adopted this approach as mentioned above.",
        "We decided to create three lexicons: two additional (small) lists of proclitic and enclitic combinations, and one large lexicon of full form5 voweled words (with no clitics), the creation of the large lexicon from a set of lemmas using classic conjugation rules did not require any modification of the existing dictionary building and compilation component.",
        "Since our NLP system already possessed a mechanism for mapping unaccented words to accented entries, and we decided to use this existing 4 Spanish, of course, possesses enclitic pronouns for some verb forms but these were not adequately treated until the solution for Arabic was implemented in our system.",

        "If the word was not found, an existing orthographical alternative lookup (1c) was also used without change (except for the addition of the language specific correspondence table between accented and unaccented characters) in order to find lexical entries for unvoweled or partially voweled words.",
        "Using this existing mechanism for treating the vowelization problem does not allow us to exploit partial vowelization as we explain in a later section.",
        "At this point in the processing, a word that contains clitics will not have been found in the dictionary since we had decided not to include word forms including clitics.",
        "We introduced, here, a new processing step for Arabic: a clitic stemmer.",
        "This stemmer uses the following linguistic resources: • The full form dictionary, containing for each word form its possible part-of-speech tags and linguistic features (gender, number, etc.).",
        "We currently have 5.4 million entries in this dictionary6.",
        "• The proclitic dictionary and the enclitic",

        "performed (( ' . '",
        ", , are removed, � � T are replaced by 1 and final � is Ly or � are replaced by y9 �Ls Ls or e).",
        "6 If we generated all forms including appended clitics, we would generate an estimated 60 billion forms (Attia, 1999).",

        "clitics, is checked against the full form lexicon.",
        "If it does not exist in the full form lexicon, rewrite rules (such as those described in Darwish (2002)) are applied, and the altered form is checked against the full form dictionary.",
        "For example, consider the token ¢�1��9 and the included clitics (9, ¢�), the computed radical 1�� does not exist in the full form lexicon but after applying one of the dozen rewrite rules, the modified radical Lsjo is found the dictionary and the input token is segmented into root and clitics as: ¢� + Lsso + 9 = ¢�1��9.",
        "• The compatibility of the morpho-syntactic",
        "tags of the three components (proclitic, radical, enclitic) is then checked.",

        "Table 1 gives some examples of segmentations7 of words in",
        "Producing this new clitic stemmer for Arabic allowed us to correctly treat a similar (but previously ignored) phenomenon in Spanish in which verb forms can possess pronominal enclitics.",
        "For example, the imperative form of “give to me” is written as “dame”, which corresponds to the radical “da” followed the enclitic “me”.",
        "Once we implemented this clitic stemmer for Arabic, we created an en",
        "clitic dictionary for Spanish and then successfully used the same stemmer for this European language.",
        "At this point, the treatment resumes as with European languages.",
        "The detection of idiomatic8 expressions (step 1d) is performed after clitic separation using rules associated with trigger words for each expression.",
        "Once a trigger is found, its left and right lexical contexts in the rule are then tested.",
        "The trigger must be an entry in the full form lexicon, but can be represented as either a surface form or a lemma form combined with its morpho-syntactic tag.",
        "Here we came across another problem specific to Semitic languages.",
        "Since Arabic lexicon entries are voweled and since input texts may be partially voweled or unvoweled, we are forced to only use lemma forms to describe Arabic idiomatic expressions rules with the existing mechanism, or else enter all the possible partial vowelizations for each word in an idiomatic expression.",
        "Since, at this point after step 1c, each recognized word is represented with all its possible voweled lemmas in the analysis graph, we developed 482 contiguous idiomatic voweled expression rules.",
        "For example one of the developed rules recognizes in the text �:,L2� D--:,L� (January) as a whole and tags the expression as a being a month.",
        "After idiomatic expression recognition, any nodes not yet recognized are assigned (in step 1e) default linguistic values based on features recognized during tokenization (e.g. presence of uppercase or numbers or special characters).",
        "Nothing was changed for this step of default value assignment in order to treat Arabic, but since Semitic languages do not have the capitalization clues that English and French have for recognizing proper and since Arabic proper names can often be decomposed into simple words (much like Chinese names), the current implementation of this step with our current lexical resources poses some problems.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence: &�:,Lv2--o- -)��v!",
        "A��� j� ���t�� ,,1�., ;1;iL, ���iiv 2-)L��V �sl:,ly; :-ji1l A�-)Ltv Frank Lampard celebrates the score by Chelsea and his team mate Eidur Gudjohnsen shares his elation.",

        "(Eidur) is incorrectly tagged as a verb; and &�:,Lv2--o- (Gudjohnsen), which is not in the dictionary and for which the clitic stemmer does not produce any solutions receives the default tags adjective, noun, proper noun and verb, to be decided by the part-of-speech tagger.",
        "To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002)."

        "Beyond the problem mentioned above of distinguishing possible proper nouns, here we had an additional problem since our recognizer extracted the entity in its surface form.",
        "Since in Arabic, as in other Semitic languages, the input text is usually only partially voweled, this gave rise to many different forms (corresponding to different surface forms) for the same entity.",
        "This minor problem was solved by storing the fully voweled forms of the entities (for application such as information retrieval as shown below) rather than the surface form.",
        "After named entity recognition, our methods of verbal and nominal chain recognition and dependency extraction did not require any modifications for Arabic.",
        "But since the sentence graphs, as mentioned above, are currently large, we have restricted the chains recognized to simple noun and verb chunks (Abney, 1991) rather than the more complex chains (Marsh, 1984) we recognize for European languages.",
        "Likewise, the only dependency relations that we extract for the moment are relations between nominal elements.",
