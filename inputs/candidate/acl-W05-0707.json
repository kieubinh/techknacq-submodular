        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is often considered as the first phase of a more complex natural language processing application.",
        "The task is particularly amenable to automatic processing.",
        "Specifically, POS taggers that are trained on pre-annotated corpora achieve human-like performance, which is adequate for most applications.",
        "The road to such high performance levels is, however, filled with a hierarchy of sub-problems.",
        "Most techniques generally assume the availability of large POS annotated corpora.",
        "The development of annotated corpora in turn requires a standard POS tagset.",
        "None of these resources are available for Amharic.",
        "This is due mainly to the fact that data preparation, i.e., developing a comprehensive POS tagset and annotating a reasonably sized text, is an arduous task.",
        "Although the POS tagging task, taken as a whole, seems challenging, a lot can be gained by analyzing it into subproblems and dealing with each one step-by-step,",
        "and also bringing in the experience from other languages in solving these problems, since POS taggers have been developed for several languages resulting in a rich body of knowledge.",
        "Several attempts have been made in the past to develop algorithms for analyzing Amharic words.",
        "Among these is the stemming algorithm of Nega (1999), which reduces Amharic words into their common stem forms by removing affixes.",
        "Nega’s work focuses on investigating the effectiveness of the stemming algorithm in information retrieval for Amharic.",
        "Abyot (2000) developed a word parser for Amharic verbs that analyses verbs into their constituting morphemes and determines their morphosyntactic categories.",
        "Abyot’s work only covers verbs and their derivations.",
        "Mesfin (2001) developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based part of speech tagger for Amharic.",
        "Building on the work of Mesfin, Atelach (2002) developed a stochastic syntactic parser for Amharic.",
        "Sisay and Haller (2003a; 2003b) applied finite-state tools, and corpus-based methods for the Amharic morphological analysis.",
        "This work provided important insights into the issues surrounding the development of Amharic natural language processing applications, especially, in compiling a preliminary POS tagset for Amharic.",
        "In this paper, our aim is to explore recent developments in the morphological analysis of related languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and machine learning approaches, and apply them to the Amharic language.",
        "Amharic belongs to the Semitic family of languages, and hence shares a number of common morphological properties with Arabic and Hebrew for which active research is being carried out.",
        "Stud",
        "ies on these languages propose two alternative POS tagging approaches which differ on the unit of analysis chosen; morpheme-based and word-based (Bar-Haim et al., 2004).",
        "The former presupposes a segmentation phase in which words are analysed into constituting morphemes which are then passed to the POS tagging step, whereas the latter applies POS tagging directly on fully-inflected word forms.",
        "Due to scarce resources, it is impossible for us to fully carry out these tasks for Amharic.",
        "Therefore, the segmentation and POS tagging tasks are carried out independently.",
        "Furthermore, POS tagging is applied only on fully-inflected word forms.",
        "The motivation for doing the segmentation task comes from the need to provide some measure of the complexity of the task in the context of the Amharic language.",
        "As regards implementation, new models have been introduced recently for segmentation and sequence-labeling tasks.",
        "One such model is Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "In this paper, we describe important morphosyntactic characteristics of Amharic, and apply CRFs to Amharic word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides a brief description of Amharic morphology.",
        "Section 3 presents some of the work done in the area of Amharic morphological analysis, and examines one POS tagset proposed by previous studies.",
        "This tagset has been revised and applied on a sample Amharic newspaper text, which is discussed in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 describes the tasks in greater detail.",
        "Section 6 provides a brief description of CRFs, the machine learning algorithm that will be applied in this paper.",
        "Section 7 describes the experimental setup and Section 8 presents the result of the experiment.",

        "It has its own script that is borrowed from Ge’ez, another Ethiopian Semitic language (Leslau, 1995).",
        "The script is believed to have originated from the South Sabean script.",
        "It is a syllabary writing system where each character represents an open CV syllable, i.e., a combination of a consonant followed by a vowel (Daniels, 1997).",
        "Amharic has a complex morphology.",
        "Word formation involves prefixation, suffixation, infixa-tion, reduplication, and Semitic stem interdigitation, among others.",
        "Like other Semitic languages, e.g., Arabic, Amharic verbs and their derivations constitute a significant part of the lexicon.",
        "In Semitic languages, words, especially verbs, are best viewed as consisting of discontinuous morphemes that are combined in a non-concatenative manner.",
        "Put differently, verbs are commonly analyzed as consisting of root consonants, template patterns, and vowel patterns.",
        "With the exception of very few verb forms (such as the imperative), all derived verb forms take affixes in order to appear as independent words.",
        "Most function words in Amharic, such as Conjunction, Preposition, Article, Relative marker, Pronominal affixes, Negation markers, are bound morphemes, which are attached to content words, resulting in complex Amharic words composed of several morphemes.",
        "Nouns inflect for the morphosyntactic features number, gender, definiteness, and case.",
        "Amharic adjectives share some morphological properties with nouns, such as definiteness, case, and number.",
        "As compared to nouns and verbs, there are fewer primary adjectives.",
        "Most adjectives are derived from nouns or verbs.",
        "Amharic has very few lexical adverbs.",
        "Adverbial meaning is usually expressed morphologically on the verb or through prepositional phrases.",
        "While prepositions are mostly bound morphemes, postpositions are typically independent words.",
        "The segmentation task (cf.",
        "Section 7.1) considers the following bound morphemes as segments: Prepositions, Conjunctions, Relative Makers, Auxiliary verbs, Negation Marker and Coordinate Conjunction.",
        "Other bound morphemes such as definite article, agreement features (i.e., number, gender), case markers, etc are not considered as segments and will be treated as part of the word.",
        "These are chosen since they are commonly treated as separate units in most syntactic descriptions.",
        "Although the above description of Amharic is far from complete, it highlights some of the major characteristics of Amharic, which it shares with other Semitic languages such as Arabic.",

        "These tags capture important properties of the language at a higher level of description.",
        "For example, the fact that there is no category for Articles indicates that Amharic does not have independent lexical forms for articles.",
        "However, a close examination of the description of some of the tags reveals some miss-classification that we think will lead to tagging inconsistency.",
        "For example, the tag JPN is assigned to nouns with the “ye” prefix morpheme that function as an adjective, e.g. yetaywan sahn - A Taiwan made plate (Mesfin, 2001).",
        "This example shows that grammatical function takes precedence over morphological form in deciding the POS category of a word.",
        "In Amharic, the ye+NOUN construction can also be used to represent other kinds of relation such as Possession relation.",
        "On the other hand, the ye+NOUN construction is a simple morphological variant of the NOUN that can easily be recognized.",
        "Therefore, treating ye+NOUN construction as a subclass of a major noun class will result in a better tagging consistency than treating it as an adjective.",
        "Furthermore, a hierarchical tagset, organized into major classes and subclasses, seems to be a preferred design strategy (Wilson, 1996; Khoja et al., 2001).",

        "In Amharic, if a noun phrase contains only the head noun, most noun affixes, such as prepositions, definite article, and case marker appear on the head noun.",
        "If, on the other hand, a noun phrase contains prenominal constituents such as adjectives, numerals, and other nouns, then the above noun affixes appear on prenominal constituents, thereby blurring the morphological distinction between the nouns and other constituents.",
        "Furthermore, similar sets of morphemes are used for prepositions and subordinate conjunctions, which again obscures the distinction among the nouns and verbs.",
        "This, together with the fact that nouns are the dominant POS category in the data, resulted in most words being miss-classified as nouns.",
        "In general, we believe that the above problems can be alleviated by making more training data available to the system, which will enable us to determine improved parameters for both segmentation and POS tagging models."

        "In this paper, we provided preliminary results of the application of CRFs for Amharic word segmentation and POS tagging tasks.",
        "Several features were examined for these tasks.",
        "Character features were found to be useful for the segmentation task whereas morphological and lexical features significantly improve the results of the POS tagging task.",
        "Dictionary-based features contribute more to the segmentation task than to the POS tagging task.",
        "In both experiments, omition of previous label feature hurts performance.",
        "Although the size of the data limits the scope of the claims that can be made on the basis of the results, the results are good especially when we look at them from the perspective of the results achieved in unknown word recognition methods of POS tagging experiments.",
        "These results could be achieved since CRFs allow us to integrate several overlapping features thereby enabling optimum utilization of the available information.",
        "In general, the paper dealt with a restricted aspect of the morphological analysis of Amharic, i.e., Amharic word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "Furthermore, these tasks were carried out relatively independently.",
        "Future work should explore how these tasks could be integrated into a single system that",
        "allows for fine-grained POS tagging of Amharic words.",
        "Parallel to this, resource development needs to be given due attention.",
        "As mentioned, the lack of adequate resources such as a large POS annotated corpus imposes restrictions on the kind of methods that can be applied.",
        "Therefore, the development of a standard Amharic POS tagset and annotation of a reasonably sized corpus should be given priority."
