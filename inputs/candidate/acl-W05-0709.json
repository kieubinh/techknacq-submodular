        "Information extraction is a crucial step toward understanding and processing language.",
        "One goal of information extraction tasks is to identify important conceptual information in a discourse.",
        "These tasks have applications in summarization, information retrieval (one can get all hits for Washington/person and not the ones for Washington/state or Washington/city), data mining, question answering, language understanding, etc.",
        "In this paper we focus on the Entity Detection and Recognition task (EDR) for Arabic as described in ACE 2004 framework (ACE, 2004).",
        "The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of several recent investigations (Bikel et al., 1997; Miller et al., 1998; Borthwick, 1999; Mikheev et al., 1999; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Florian et al., 2004), and have been at the center of evaluations such as: MUC-6, MUC-7, and the CoNLL’02 and CoNLL’03 shared tasks.",
        "Usually, in computational linguistics literature, a named entity is an instance of a location, a person, or an organization, and the NER task consists of identifying each of these occurrences.",
        "Instead, we will adopt the nomenclature of the Automatic Content Extraction program (NIST, 2004): we will call the instances of textual references to objects/abstractions mentions, which can be either named (e.g. John Mayor), nominal (the president) or pronominal (she, it).",
        "An entity is the aggregate of all the mentions (of any level) which refer to one conceptual entity.",
        "For instance, in the sentence President John Smith said he has no comments there are two mentions (named and pronomial) but only one entity, formed by the set {John Smith, he}.",
        "We separate the EDR task into two parts: a mention detection step, which identifies and classifies all the mentions in a text – and a coreference resolution step, which combinines the detected mentions into groups that refer to the same object.",
        "In its entirety, the EDR task is arguably harder than traditional named entity recognition, because of the additional complexity involved in extracting non-named mentions (nominal and pronominal) and the requirement of grouping mentions into entities.",
        "This is particularly true for Arabic where nominals and pronouns are also attached to the word they modify.",
        "In fact, most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of base forms or stems, to which prefixes and suffixes can be attached to form Arabic surface forms (blank-delimited words).",
        "In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the",
        "derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.",
        "It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging (Xu et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2002).",
        "Both tasks are performed with a statistical framework: the mention detection system is similar to the one presented in (Florian et al., 2004) and the coreference resolution system is similar to the one described in (Luo et al., 2004).",
        "Both systems are built around from the maximum-entropy technique (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "We formulate the mention detection task as a sequence classification problem.",
        "While this approach is language independent, it must be modified to accomodate the particulars of the Arabic language.",
        "The Arabic words may be composed of zero or more prefixes, followed by a stem and zero or more suffixes.",
        "We begin with a segmentation of the written text before starting the classification.",
        "This segmentation process consists of separating the normal whitespace delimited words into (hypothesized) prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which become the subject of analysis (tokens).",
        "The resulting granularity of breaking words into prefixes and suffixes allows different mention type labels beyond the stem label (for instance, in the case of nominal and pronominal mentions).",
        "Additionally, because the prefixes and suffixes are quite frequent, directly processing unsegmented words results in significant data sparseness.",
        "We present in Section 2 the relevant particularities of the Arabic language for natural language processing, especially for the EDR task.",
        "We then describe the segmentation system we employed for this task in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 briefly describes our mention detection system, explaining the different feature types we use.",
        "We focus in particular on the stem n-gram, prefix n-gram, and suffix n-gram features that are specific to a morphologically rich language such as Arabic.",
        "We describe in Section 5 our coreference resolution system where we also describe the advantage of using stem based features.",
        "Section 6 shows and discusses the different experimental results and Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "The Arabic language, which is the mother tongue of more than 300 million people (Center, 2000), present significant challenges to many natural language processing applications.",
        "Arabic is a highly inflected and derived language.",
        "In Arabic morphology, most morphemes are comprised of a basic word form (the root or stem), to which many affixes can be attached to form Arabic words.",
        "The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters that can be extended to ninety by additional shapes, marks, and vowels (Tayli and Al-Salamah, 1990).",
        "Unlike Latin-based alphabets, the orientation of writing in Arabic is from right to left.",
        "In written Arabic, short vowels are often omitted.",
        "Also, because variety in expression is appreciated as part of a good writing style, the synonyms are widespread.",
        "Arabic nouns encode information about gender, number, and grammatical cases.",
        "There are two genders (masculine and feminine), three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), and three grammatical cases (nominative, genitive, and accusative).",
        "A noun has a nominative case when it is a subject, accusative case when it is the object of a verb, and genitive case when it is the object of a preposition.",
        "The form of an Arabic noun is consequently determined by its gender, number, and grammatical case.",
        "The definitive nouns are formed by attaching the � Arabic article JI to the immediate front of the nouns, such as in the word as1I (the company).",
        "Also, prepositions such as u.",
        "(by), and J (to) can be attached as a prefix as in asf 11 (to the company).",
        "A noun may carry a possessive pronoun as a suffix, such as in (&î DsQå� (their company).",
        "For the EDR task, in this previous example, the Arabic blank-delimited word should be split into two tokens: ash and (&A. he first token as'a is a mention that refers to an organization, whereas the second token (&A is also a mention, but one that may refer to a person.",
        "Also, the prepositions (i.e., u. and J) not be considered a part of the mention.",
        "Arabic has two kinds of plurals: broken plurals and sound plurals (Wightwick and Gaafar, 1998; Chen and Gey, 2002).",
        "The formation of broken plurals is common, more complex and often irregular.",
        "As an example, the plural form of the noun Ég.P (man) is JA�g.P (men), which is formed by inserting the infix I.",
        "The plural form of the noun u.A� Js (book) is I. Js (books), which is formed by deleting the infix I.",
        "The plural form and the singular form may also be completely different (e.g. 3I I for woman, but L;; for women).",
        "The sound plurals are formed by adding plural suffixes to singular nouns (e.g., wA�K.",
        "meaning researcher): the plural suffix is uI for feminine nouns in grammatical cases (e.g., u��), J' for masculine nouns in the nominative case (e.g., vñ�JkA�K.",
        "), and v» for masculine nouns in the genitive and accusative cases (e.g.,�á���JkA�K.).",
        "The dual suffix is vI for the nominative case (e.g., ul:��), and Lo for the genitive or accusative (e.g.,1�).",
        "Because we consider pronouns and nominals as mentions, it is essential to segment Arabic words into these subword tokens.",
        "We also believe that the in",
        "formation denoted by these affixes can help with the coreference resolution task'.",
        "Arabic verbs have perfect and imperfect tenses (Ab-bou and McCarus, 1983).",
        "Perfect tense denotes completed actions, while imperfect denotes ongoing actions.",
        "Arabic verbs in the perfect tense consist of a stem followed by a subject marker, denoted as a suffix.",
        "The subject marker indicates the person, gender, and number of the subject.",
        "As an example, the verb ÉK.A \"s(to meet) has a perfect tense \"Il;A \"s for the third � person feminine singular, and @ñÊ K.A \"s for the third person masculine plural.",
        "We notice also that a verb with a subject marker and a pronoun suffix can be by itself a complete sentence, such us in the wordM�.",
        "6: it has a third-person feminine singular subject-marker H\" (she) and a pronoun suffix ÑA (them).",
        "It is also a complete sentence meaning “she met them.” The subject markers are often suffixes, but we may find a subject marker as a combination of a prefix and a suffix as in �,bLLi (she meets them).",
        "In this example, the EDR system should be able to separate Ñ bÊK.A \"®\"K, to create two mentions (H\" and �,A).",
        "Because the two mentions belong to different entities, the EDR system should not chain them together.",
        "An Arabic word can potentially have a large number of variants, and some of the variants can be quite complex.",

        "The former framework has the advantage of being fast (making it more appropriate for deployment in commercial systems).",
        "The number of parameters to optimize in the MaxEnt framework we use when only lexical features are explored is around 280K parameters.",
        "This number increases to 443K approximately when all information is used except the stemming feature.",
        "The number of parameters introduced by the use of stemming is around 130K parameters.",

        "This is true for all types.",
        "It is interesting to note that the increase in performance in both cases (Tables 1 and 2) is obtained from increased recall, with little change in precision.",

        "As stated in Section 4.1, the mention detection system uses a cascade approach.",
