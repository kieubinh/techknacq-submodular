        "Even though the last years have seen an increasing trend in investigating applying language processing methods to other languages than English, most of the work is still done on very few and mainly European and East-Asian languages; for the vast number of languages of the African continent there still remains plenty of work to be done.",
        "The main obstacles to progress in language processing for these are twofold.",
        "Firstly, the peculiarities of the languages themselves might force new strategies to be developed.",
        "Secondly, the lack of already available resources and tools makes the creation and testing of new ones more difficult and time-consuming.",
        "Many of the languages of Africa have few speakers, and some lack a standardised written form, both creating problems for building language processing systems and reducing the need for such systems.",
        "However, this is not true for the major African languages and as example of one of those this paper takes Amharic, the Semitic language used for countrywide communication in Ethiopia.",
        "With more than 20 million speakers, Amharic is today probably one of the five largest on the continent (albeit difficult to determine, given the dramatic population size changes in many African countries in recent years).",
        "The Ethiopian culture is ancient, and so are the written languages of the area, with Amharic using its own script.",
        "Several computer fonts for the script have been developed, but for many years it had no standardised computer representation1 which was a deterrent to electronic publication.",
        "An exponentially increasing amount of digital information is now being produced in Ethiopia, but no deep-rooted culture of information exchange and dissemination has been established.",
        "Different factors are attributed to this, including lack of digital library facilities and central resource sites, inadequate resources for electronic publication of journals and books, and poor documentation and archive collections.",
        "The difficulties to access information have led to low expectations and underutilization of existing information resources, even though the need for accurate and fast information access is acknowledged as a major factor affecting the success and quality of research and development, trade and industry (Furzey, 1996).",
        "In recent years this has lead to an increasing awareness that Amharic language processing resources and digital information access and storage facilities must be created.",
        "To this end, some work has now been carried out, mainly by Ethiopian Telecom, the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission, Addis Ababa University, the Ge’ez Frontier Foundation, and Ethiopian students abroad.",
        "So have, for example, Sisay and Haller (2003) looked at Amharic word formation and lexicon building; Nega and Wil-lett (2002) at stemming; Atelach et al.",
        "(2003a) at treebank building; Daniel (Yacob, 2005) at the collection of an (untagged) corpus, tentatively to be hosted by Oxford University’s Open Archives Initiative; and Cowell and Hussain (2003) at character recognition.2 See Atelach et al.",
        "(2003b) for an overview of the efforts that have been made so far to develop language processing tools for Amharic.",
        "The need for investigating Amharic information access has been acknowledged by the European Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, which added an Amharic–English track in 2004.",
        "However, the task addressed was for accessing an English database in English, with only the original questions being posed in Amharic (and then translated into English).",
        "Three groups participated in this track, with Atelach et al.",
        "(2004) reporting the best results.",
        "In the present paper we look at the problem of mapping questions posed in Amharic onto a collection of Amharic news items.",
        "We use the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model of artificial neural networks for the task of retrieving the documents matching a specific query.",
        "The SOMs were implemented using the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox.",
        "The rest of the paper is laid out as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses artificial neural networks and in particular the SOM model and its application to information access.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the Amharic language and its writing system in more detail together with the news items corpora used for training and testing of the networks, while Sections 4 and 5 detail the actual experiments, on text retrieval and text classification, respectively.",
        "Finally, Section 6 sums up the main contents of the paper."

        "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a computational paradigm inspired by the neurological structure of the human brain, and ANN terminology borrows from neurology: the brain consists of millions of neurons connected to each other through long and thin strands called axons; the connecting points between neurons are called synapses.",
        "ANNs have proved themselves useful in deriving meaning from complicated or imprecise data; they can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computational and statistical techniques.",
        "Traditionally, the most common ANN setup has been the backpropagation architecture (Rumelhart et al., 1986), a supervised learning strategy where input data is fed forward in the network to the output nodes (normally with an intermediate hidden layer of nodes) while errors in matches are propagated backwards in the net during training."

        "It was originally developed to project multidimensional vectors on a reduced dimensional space.",
        "Self-organizing systems can have many kinds of structures, a common one consists of an input layer and an output layer, with feed-forward connections from input to output layers and full connectivity (connections between all neurons) in the output layer.",
        "A SOM is provided with a set of rules of a local nature (a signal affects neurons in the immediate vicinity of the current neuron), enabling it to learn to compute an input-output pairing with specific desirable properties.",
        "The learning process consists of repeatedly modifying the synaptic weights of the connections in the system in response to input (activation) patterns and in accordance to prescribed rules, until a final configuration develops.",
        "Commonly both the weights of the neuron closest matching the inputs and the weights of its neighbourhood nodes are increased.",
        "At the beginning of the training the neighbourhood (where input patterns cluster depending on their similarity) can be fairly large and then be allowed to decrease over time."

        "The radius of neighbouring nodes may be varied to include documents that are weaker related.",
        "The most elaborate experiments of using SOMs for document classification have been undertaken using the WEB-SOM architecture developed at Helsinki University of Technology (Honkela et al., 1997; Kohonen et al., 2000).",
        "WEBSOM is based on a hierarchical two-level SOM structure, with the first level forming histogram clusters of words.",
        "The second level is used to reduce the sensitivity of the histogram to small variations in document content and performs further clustering to display the document pattern space.",
        "A Self-Organizing Map is capable of simulating new data sets without the need of retraining itself when the database is updated; something which is not true for Latent Semantic Indexing, LSI (Deer-wester et al., 1990).",
        "Moreover, LSI consumes ample time in calculating similarities of new queries against all documents, but a SOM only needs to calculate similarities versus some representative subset of old input data and can then map new input straight onto the most similar models without having to recompute the whole mapping.",
        "The SOM model preparation passes through the processes undertaken by the LSI model and the classical vector space model (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "Hence those models can be taken as particular cases of the SOM, when the neighbourhood diameter is maximized.",
        "For instance, one can calculate the LSI model’s similarity measure of documents versus queries by varying the SOM’s neighbourhood diameter, if the training set is a singular value decomposition reduced vector space.",

        "There are 33 basic forms, giving 7*33 syllable patterns, or fidEls.",
        "Two of the base forms represent vowels in isolation (o and t,), but the rest are for consonants (or semivowels classed as consonants) and thus correspond to CV pairs, with the first order being the base symbol with no explicit vowel indicator (though a vowel is pronounced: C+/9/).",
        "The sixth order is ambiguous between being just the consonant or C+/i/.",

        "For more thorough discussions of the Ethiopian writing system, see, for example, Bender et al.",
        "(1976) and Bloor (1995).",
        "Amharic words have consonantal roots with vowel variation expressing difference in interpretation, making stemming a not-so-useful technique in information retrieval (no full morphological analyser for the language is available yet).",
        "There is no agreed upon spelling standard for compounds and the writing system uses multitudes of ways to denote compound words.",
        "In addition, not all the letters of the Amharic script are strictly necessary for the pronunciation patterns of the language; some were simply inherited from Ge’ez without having any semantic or phonetic distinction in modern Amharic: there are many cases where numerous symbols are used to denote a single phoneme, as well as words that have extremely different orthographic form and slightly distinct phonetics, but the same meaning.",
        "As a result of this, lexical variation and homophony is very common, and obviously deteriorates the effectiveness of Information Access systems based on strict term matching; hence the basic idea of this research: to use the approximative matching enabled by self-organizing map-based artificial neural networks."
