        "Conventional word-alignment methods have been successful at treating many language pairs, but may be limited in their ability to generalize beyond the Western European language pairs for which they were originally developed, to pairs which exhibit more complex divergences in word order, morphology and lexical granularity.",
        "Our approach to Inuktitut-English alignment was to carefully consider the data in identifying difficulties particular to Inuktitut-English as well as possible simplifying assumptions.",
        "We used these observations to construct a novel weighted finite-state transducer alignment model as well as a specialized transliteration model.",
        "We combined these customized systems with 3 systems based on IBM Model 4 alignments under several methods of classifier combination.",
        "These combination strategies allowed us to produce multiple submissions targeted at the distinct evaluation measures via a precision/recall trade-off."

        "Guided by the discussion of Inuktitut in Mallon (1999), we examined the Nunavut Hansards training and hand-labeled trial data sets in order to identify special challenges and exploitable characteristics of the Inuktitut-English word alignment problem.",
        "We were able to iden",
        "tify three: (1) Importance of sublexical Inuktitut units; (2) 1-to-N Inuktitut-to-English alignment cardinality; (3) Monotonicity of alignments."

      "text": [
        "Inuktitut has an extremely productive agglutinative morphology, and an orthographic word may combine very many individual morphemes.",
        "As a result, in Inuktitut-English bitext we observe Inuktitut sentences with many fewer word tokens than the corresponding English sentences; the ratio of English to Inuktitut tokens in the training corpus is 1.85.1 This suggests the importance of looking below the Inuktitut word level when computing lexical translation probabilities (or alignment affinities).",
        "To reinforce the point, consider that the ratio of training corpus types to tokens is 0.007 for English, and 0.194 for Inuktitut.",
        "In developing a customized word alignment solution for Inuktitut-English, a major goal was to handle the huge number of Inuktitut word types seen only once in the training corpus (337798 compared to 8792 for English), without demanding the development of a morphological analyzer."

        "Considering English words in English sentence order, 4.7% of their alignments to Inuktitut were found to be retrograde; that is, involving a decrease in Inuktitut word position with respect to the previous English word’s aligned Inuktitut position.",
        "Since this method of counting retrograde alignments would assign a low count to mass movements of large contiguous chunks, we also measured the number of inverted alignments over all pairs of English word positions.",
        "That is, the sum",
        "was computed over all Inuktitut alignment sets I(e, x), for e the English sentence and x the English word position.",
        "Dividing this sum by the obvious denominator (replacing (1 if i1 > i2) with (1) in the sum) yielded a value of 1.6% inverted alignments.",
        "Table 1 shows a histogram of alignment cardinalities for both English and Inuktitut.",
        "Ninety-four percent of English word tokens, and ninety-nine percent of those having a non-null alignment, align to exactly one Inuktitut word.",
        "In development of a specialized word aligner for this language pair (Section 3), we made use of the observed reliability of these two properties, monotonicity and 1-to-N cardinality."

        "Our weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) alignment model, illustrated in Figure 1, structurally enforces monotonicity and 1-to-N cardinality, and exploits sublexical information by incorporating association scores between English words and Inuktitut word substrings, based on co-occurrence in aligned sentences.",
        "For each English word, an association score was computed not only with each Inuktitut word, but also with each Inuktitut character string of length ranging from 2 to 10 characters.",
        "This is similar to the technique described in Martin et al.",
        "(2003) as part of their construction of a bilingual glossary from English-Inuktitut bitext.",
        "However, our goal is different and we keep all the English-Inuktitut associations, rather than selecting only the “best” ones using a greedy method, as do they.",
        "Additionally, before extracting all substrings from each Inuktitut word, we added a special character to the word’s beginning and end (e.g., makkuttut – > makkuttut ), in order to exploit any preferences for word-initial or final placement.",

        "The WFST aligner is a composition of 4 transducers.",
        "The structure of the entire WFST composition enforces monotonicity, Inuktitut-to-English 1-N cardinality, and Inuktitut word fertilities ranging between 1 and 7.",

        "Although in this corpus English and Inuktitut are both written in Roman characters, English names are significantly transformed when rendered in Inuktitut text.",
        "Consider the following English/Inuktitut pairs from the training corpus: Chartrand/saaturaan, Chretien/kurittian and the set of training corpus-attested Inuktitut renderings of Williams, Campbell, and McLean shown in Table 2(A) (which does not include variations containing the common -mut lexeme, meaning “to [a person]” (Mallon, 1999)).",
        "Clearly, not only does the English-to-Inuktitut transformation radically change the name string, it does so in a nondeterministic way which appears to be influenced not only by the phonological preferences of Inuktitut but also by differing pronunciations of the name in question and possibly by differing conventions of translators (note, for example, maklain versus mikliin for McLean).",
        "We trained a probabilistic finite-state transducer (FST) to identify English-Inuktitut transliterated pairs in aligned sentences.",
        "Training string pairs were acquired from the training bitext in the following manner.",
        "Whenever single instances of corresponding honorifics were found in a sentence pair – these included the correspondences (Ms , mis); (Mrs , missa/missis); (Mr ,",
        "mista/mistu) – the immediately following capitalized English words (up to 2) were extracted and the same number of Inuktitut words were extracted to be used as training pairs.",
        "Thus, given the appearance in aligned sentences of “Mr.",
        "Quirke” and “mista kuak”, the training pair (Quirke,kuak) would be extracted.",
        "Common distractions such as “Mr Speaker” were filtered out.",
        "In order to focus on the native English name problem (Inuktitut name rendering into English is much less noisy) the English extractions were required to have appeared in a large, news-corpus-derived English wordlist.",
        "This procedure resulted in a conservative, high-quality list of 434 unique name pairs.",
        "The probabilistic FST model we selected was that of a memoryless (single-state) transducer representing a joint distribution over character substitutions, English insertions, and Inuktitut insertions.",
        "This model is identical to that presented in Ristad and Yianilos (1997).",
        "Prior to training, common English digraphs (e.g., “th” and “sh”) were mapped to unique single characters, as were doubled consonants.",
        "Inuktitut “ng” and common two-vowel sequences were also mapped to unique single characters to elicit higher-quality results from the memoryless transduction model employed.",
        "Some results of the transducer training are displayed in Table 2(B).",
        "Probabilistic FST weight training was accomplished using the Dyna modeling language and DynaMITE parameter optimization toolkit (Eisner et al., 2004).",
        "The transliteration modeling described here differs from such previous transliteration work as Stalls and Knight (1998) in that there is no explicit modeling of pronunciation, only a direct transduction between written forms.",
        "In applying transliteration on trial/test data, the following criteria were used to select English words for transliteration: (1) Word is capitalized (2) Word is not in the exclusion list.4 For the top-ranked transliteration of the English word present in the Inuktitut sentence, all occurrences of that word in that sentence are marked as aligned to the English word.",
        "We have yet to evaluate English-Inuktitut transliteration in isolation on a large test set.",
        "However, accuracy on the workshop trial data was 4/4 hypotheses correct, and on test data 2/6 correct.",
        "Of the 4 incorrect test hypotheses, 2 were mistakes in identifying the correct transliteration, and 2 mistakes resulted from attempting to transliterate an English word such as “Councillors” which should not be transliterated.",
        "Even with a relatively low accuracy, the transliteration model, which is used only as an individual voter in combination systems, is unlikely to vote for the incorrect choice of another system.",
