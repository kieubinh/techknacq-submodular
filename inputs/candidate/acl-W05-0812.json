        "The most widely used alignment model is IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In empirical evaluations it has outperformed the other IBM Models and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "It was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems (Dejean et al., 2003; Mihal-cea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "Implementations are also freely available (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The IBM Model 4 search space cannot be efficiently enumerated; therefore it cannot be trained directly using Expectation Maximization (EM).",
        "In practice, a sequence of simpler models such as IBM Model 1 and an HMM Model are used to generate initial parameter estimates and to enumerate a partial search space which can be expanded using hill-climbing heuristics.",
        "IBM Model 4 parameters are then estimated over this partial search space as an approximation to EM (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "This approach yields good results, but it has been observed that the IBM Model 4 performance is only slightly better than that of the underlying HMM Model used in this bootstrapping process (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Based on this observation, we hypothesize that implementations of IBM Model 4 derive most of their performance benefits from the underlying HMM Model.",
        "Furthermore, owing to the simplicity of HMM Models, we believe that they are more conducive to study and improvement than more complex models such as IBM",
        "Model 4.",
        "We illustrate this point by introducing modifications to the HMM model which improve performance."
