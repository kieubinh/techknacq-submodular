        "Participants in the shared task were provided with common sets of training data, consisting of English-Inuktitut, Romanian-English, and English-Hindi parallel texts and the participating teams could choose to evaluate their system on one, two, or all three language pairs.",
        "Our system is for aligning English-Hindi parallel data at the word level.",
        "The word-alignment algorithm described here is based on a hybrid – multi-feature approach, which groups Hindi words locally within a Hindi sentence and uses dictionary lookup (DL) as the main method of aligning words along with other methods such as Transliteration Similarity (TS), Expected English Words (EEW) and Nearest Aligned Neighbors (NAN).",
        "We used the training data supplied to derive rules for local word grouping in Hindi sentences and to find Named Entities (NE) and cognates using our TS approach.",
        "In the following sections we briefly describe our approach."

        "For example: “Mr.",
        "Niraj Aswani”, “United Kingdom”, and “Microsoft” are examples of NEs.",

        "We calculate the similarity measure for each word in a Hindi sentence by comparing it with each and every word of an English sentence.",

        "From our experiments of comparing more than 100 NE and cognate pairs, we found that the word pairs should be considered valid matches only if the similarity is greater than 75%.",
        "Therefore, we consider only those pairs which have the highest similarity among the other pairs with similarity greater than 75%.",
        "The following example shows how TS is used to compare a pair of English-Hindi words.",
        "For example consider a pair “aswani 4 अ।सवानी” and the TS table entries as shown below:",
        "A4ar, S4-fr, SS4-fr, V4�, W4a and N4 7r We remove vowels from both words: “aswn 4 ar-fr� 7r”, and then convert the Hindi word into possible English words.",
        "This gives four different combinations: “asvn”, “assvn”, “aswn” and “asswn”.",
        "These words are then compared with the actual English word “aswn”.",

        "Once a list of NEs and cognates is ready, we switch to our next step: local word grouping, where all words in Hindi sentences, either those available in the gazetteer list or in the list derived using TS approach, are aligned using TS approach."
