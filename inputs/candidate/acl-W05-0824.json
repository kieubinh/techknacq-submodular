        "Machine translation is nowadays mature enough that it is possible without too much effort to devise automatically a statistical translation system from just a parallel corpus.",

        "The performance of such a system may however greatly vary from one pair of languages to another.",
        "Indeed, there is no free lunch for system developers, and if a black box approach can sometimes be good enough for some applications (we can surely accomplish translation gisting with the French-English and Spanish-English systems we developed during this exercice), making use of the output of such a system for, let’s say, quality translation is another kettle of fish (especially in our case with the Finnish-English system we ended-up with).",
        "We devoted two weeks to the SMT shared task, the aim of which was precisely to see how well systems can do across different language families.",
        "We began with a core system which is described in the next section and from which we obtained baseline performances that we tried to improve upon.",
        "Since the French and Spanish-English systems produced output that were comprehensible enough1, we focussed on the two languages whose translations were noticeably worse: German and Finnish.",
        "For German, we tried to move around words in order to mimic English word order; and we tried to split compound words.",
        "This is described in section 4.",
        "For the Finnish/English pair, we tried to decompose Finnish words into smaller substrings (see section 5).",
        "In parallel to that, we tried to smooth a phrase-based model (PBM) making use of WORDNET.",
        "We report on this experiment in section 3.",
        "We describe in section 6 the final setting of the systems we used for submitting translations and their official results as computed by the organizers.",
        "Finally, we conclude our two weeks of efforts in section 7."

        "Once the locus ev of a pattern has been identified, a rule is collected whenever the following conditions apply: for each word e in the locus, there is a target word f which is aligned to e in both alignment directions; these target words when moved can lead to a diagonal going from the target word (l) associated to eu_1 to the target word r which is aligned to e�+1.",
        "The rules we memorize are triplets (c, i, o) where c = (l, r) is the context of the locus and i and o are the input and output German word order (that is, the order in which the tokens are found, and the order in which they should be moved).",
        "For instance, in the example of Figure 1, the Verb Verb pattern match the locus could clarify and the following rule is acquired: (sie einen, k¨onnten erl¨autern, k¨onnten erl¨autern), a paraphrase of which is: ”whenever you find (in this order) the word k¨onnten and erl¨autern in a German sentence containing also (in this order) sie and einen, move k¨onnten and erl¨autern between sie and einen.",
        "A set of 124 271 rules have been acquired this way from the training corpus (for a total of 157 970 occurrences).",

        "In practice, since this acquisition process does not involve any generalization step, only a few rules learnt really fire when applied to the test material.",
