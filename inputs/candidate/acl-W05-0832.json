        "Translation Memory (TM) systems provide roughly concordanced results from an archive of previously translated materials.",
        "They are typically used by translators who want computer assistance for searching large archives for tricky translations, and also to help ensure a group of translators rapidly arrive at similar terminology (Macklovitch et al., 2000).",
        "Several companies provide commercial TMs and systems for using and sharing them.",
        "TMs can add value to computer assisted translation services (Drugan, 2004).",
        "Machine Translation (MT) developers make use of similar historical archives (parallel texts, bitexts), to produce systems that perform a task very similar to TMs.",
        "But while TM systems and MT systems can appear strikingly similar, (Marcu, 2001) key differences exist in how they are used.",
        "TMs often need to be fast because they are typically used interactively.",
        "They aim to produce highly readable, fluent output, usable in document production settings.",
        "In this setting, errors of omission are more easily forgiven than errors of commission so, just like MT, TM output must look good to users who have no access to the information in source texts.",
        "MT, on the other hand, is often used in assimilation settings, where a batch job can often be run on multiple processors.",
        "This permits variable rate output and allows slower systems that produce better translations to play a part.",
        "Batch MT serving a single user only needs to run at roughly the same rate the reader can consume its output.",
        "Simple TMs operate on an entire translation segment, roughly the size of a sentence or two, while more sophisticated TMs operate on units of varying size: a word, a phrase, or an entire segment (Callison-Burch et al., 2004).",
        "Modern approaches to MT, especially statistical MT, typically operate on more fine-grained units, words and phrases (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "The relationship between whole segment TM and MT can be viewed as a continuum of translation granularity:",
        "segments words simple TM hybrid TM MT Simple TM systems, focusing on segment-level granularity, lie at one extreme, and word-for-word, IBM-model MT systems on the other.",
        "Example-Based MT (EBMT), phrase-based, and commercial TM systems likely lie somewhere in between.",
        "This classification motivates our work here.",
        "MT systems have well-studied and popular evaluation techniques such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "In this paper we lay out a methodology for evaluating TMs along the lines of MT evaluation.",
        "This allows us to measure the raw relative value of TM and MT as translation tools, and to develop expectations for how TM performance increases as the size of the memory increases.",
        "There are many ways to perform TM segmentation and phrase extraction.",
        "In this study, we use the most obvious and simple condition – a full segment TM.",
        "This gives a lower bound on real TM performance, but a lower bound which is not trivial.",
        "Section 2 details the architecture of our simple TM.",
        "Section 3 describes experiments involving different strategies for IR, oracle upper bounds on TM performance as the memory grows, and techniques for rescoring the retrievals.",

We rely on the fact that the Chinese data in the translation memory is tokenized and indexed at the unigram level.",
        "Each Chinese character in the source sentence is tokenized individually, and we make use of the IR engine’s phrase query feature, which matches documents in which all terms in the phrase appear in consecutive order, to create the ngrams.",
        "For example, to produce a trigram + bigram + unigram query for a Chinese sentence of 10 characters, we would create a query consisting of eight three-character phrases, nine two-character phrases, and 10 single-character “phrases”.",
        "All phrases are weighted equally in the query.",
        "This approach allows us to perform lookups for arbitrary ngram sizes.",
        "Depending on the specifics of how idf is calculated, this may yield different results from indexing ngrams directly, but it is advantageous in terms of space consumed and scalability to different ngram sizes without reindexing.",
