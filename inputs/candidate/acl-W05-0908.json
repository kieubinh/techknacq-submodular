        "Rapid and accurate detection of result differences is crucial in system development and system benchmarking.",
        "In both situations a multitude of systems or system variants has to be evaluated, so it is highly desirable to employ automatic evaluation measures for detection of result differences, and statistical hypothesis tests to assess the significance of the detected differences.",
        "When evaluating subtle differences between system variants in development, or when benchmarking multiple systems, result differences may be very small in magnitude.",
        "This imposes strong requirements on both automatic evaluation measures and statistical significance tests: Evaluation measures are needed that have high discriminative power and yet are sensitive to the interesting aspects of the evaluation task.",
        "Significance tests are required to be powerful and yet accurate, i.e., if there are significant differences they should be able to assess them, but not if there are none.",
        "In the area of statistical machine translation (SMT), recently a combination of the BLEU evaluation metric (Papineni et al., 2001) and the bootstrap method for statistical significance testing (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) has become popular (Och, 2003; Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Koehn, 2004b; Zhang et al., 2004).",
        "Given the current practice of reporting result differences as small as .3% in BLEU score, assessed at confidence levels as low as 70%, questions arise concerning the sensitivity of the employed evaluation metrics and the accuracy of the employed significance tests, especially when result differences are small.",
        "We believe that is important to accurately detect such small-magnitude differences in order to understand how to improve systems and technologies, even though such differences may not matter in current applications.",
        "In this paper we will investigate some pitfalls that arise in automatic evaluation and statistical significance testing in MT research.",
        "The first pitfall concerns the discriminatory power of automatic evaluation measures.",
        "In the following, we compare the sensitivity of three intrinsic evaluation measures that differ with respect to their focus on different aspects",
        "of translation.",
        "We consider the well-known BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001) which emphasizes fluency by incorporating matches of high n-grams.",
        "Furthermore, we consider an F-score measure that is adapted from dependency-based parsing (Crouch et al., 2002) and sentence-condensation (Riezler et al., 2003).",
        "This measure matches grammatical dependency relations of parses for system output and reference translations, and thus emphasizes semantic aspects of translational adequacy.",
        "As a third measure we consider NIST (Doddington, 2002), which favors lexical choice over word order and does not take structural information into account.",
        "On an experimental evaluation on a reranking experiment we found that only NIST was sensitive enough to detect small result differences, whereas BLEU and F-score produced result differences that were statistically not significant.",
        "A second pitfall addressed in this paper concerns the relation of power and accuracy of significance tests.",
        "In situations where the employed evaluation measure produces small result differences, the most powerful significance test is demanded to assess statistical significance of the results.",
        "However, accuracy of the assessments of significance is seldom questioned.",
        "In the following, we will take a closer look at the bootstrap test and compare it with the related technique of approximate randomization (Noreen (1989)).",
        "In an experimental evaluation on our reranking data we found that approximate randomization estimated p-values more conservatively than the bootstrap, thus increasing the likelihood of type-I error for the latter test.",
        "Lastly, we point out a common mistake of randomly assessing significance in multiple pairwise comparisons (Cohen, 1995).",
        "This is especially relevant in k-fold pairwise comparisons of systems or system variants where k is high.",
        "Taking this multiplicity problem into account, we conclude with a recommendation of a combination of NIST for evaluation and the approximate randomization test for significance testing, at more stringent rejection levels than is currently standard in the MT literature.",
        "This is especially important in situations where multiple pairwise comparisons are conducted, and small result differences are expected."

        "The experimental setup we employed to compare evaluation measures and significance tests is a discriminative reranking experiment on 1000-best lists of a phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Our system is a reimplementation of the phrase-based system described in Koehn (2003), and uses publicly available components for word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003)1, decoding (Koehn, 2004a)2, language modeling (Stolcke, 2002)3 and finite-state processing (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1999)4.",

        "Phrase-extraction follows Och et al.",
        "(1999) and was implemented by the authors: First, the word aligner is applied in both translation directions, and the intersection of the alignment matrices is built.",
        "Then, the alignment is extended by adding immediately adjacent alignment points and alignment points that align previously unaligned words.",
        "From this many-to-many alignment matrix, phrases are extracted according to a contiguity requirement that states that words in the source phrase are aligned only with words in the target phrase, and vice versa.",
        "Discriminative reranking on a 1000-best list of translations of the SMT system uses an ii regularized log-linear model that combines a standard maximum-entropy estimator with an efficient, incremental feature selection technique for ii regularization (Riezler and Vasserman, 2004).",
        "Training data are defined as pairs { (sj , tj) ��j�1 of source sentences sj and gold-standard translations tj that are determined as the translations in the 1000-best list that best match a given reference translation.",
        "The objective function to be minimized is the conditional log-likelihood L(A) subject to a regularization term R(A), where T (s) is the set of 1000-best translations for sentence s, A is a vector or log-parameters, and",
        "f is a vector of feature functions:",
        "The features employed in our experiments consist of 8 features corresponding to system components (distortion model, language model, phrase-translations, lexical weights, phrase penalty, word penalty) as provided by PHARAOH, together with a multitude of overlapping phrase features.",
        "For example, for a phrase-table of phrases consisting of maximally 3 words, we allow all 3-word phrases and 2 word phrases as features.",
        "Since bigram features can overlap, information about trigrams can be gathered by composing bigram features even if the actual trigram is not seen in the training data.",
        "Feature selection makes it possible to employ and evaluate a large number of features, without concerns about redundant or irrelevant features hampering generalization performance.",
        "The �1 regularizer is defined by the weighted `1 norm of the parameters",
        "where y is a regularization coefficient, and n is number of parameters.",
        "This regularizer penalizes overly large parameter values in their absolute values, and tends to force a subset of the parameters to be exactly zero at the optimum.",
        "This fact leads to a natural integration of regularization into incremental feature selection as follows: Assuming a tendency of the �1 regularizer to produce a large number of zero-valued parameters at the function’s optimum, we start with all-zero weights, and incrementally add features to the model only if adjusting their parameters away from zero sufficiently decreases the optimization criterion.",
        "Since every non-zero weight added to the model incurs a regularizer penalty of y l Ail, it only makes sense to add a feature to the model if this penalty is outweighed by the reduction in negative log-likelihood.",
        "Thus features considered for selection have to pass the following test:",
        "This gradient test is applied to each feature and at each step the features that pass the test with maximum magnitude are added to the model.",
        "This provides both efficient and accurate estimation with large feature sets.",

        "The main purpose of our reranking experiments is to have a system that can easily be adjusted to yield system variants that differ at controllable amounts.",
