        "The PASCAL initiative on “textual entailment” had the excellent idea of proposing a competition testing NLP systems on their ability to understand language separate from the ability to cope with world knowledge.",
        "This is obviously a welcome endeavor: NLP systems cannot be held responsible for knowledge of what goes on in the world but no NLP system can claim to “understand” language if it can’t cope with textual inferences.",
        "The task also shies away from creative metaphorical or metonymic use of language and makes the assumption that referential assignments remain constant for entities that are described in the same way.",
        "These all seem good features of the proposal as it stands.",
        "Looking at the challenge as it was put before the community, however, we feel that it might be useful to try to circumscribe more precisely what exactly",
        "should count as linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this paper we make a stab at this in the hope of getting a discussion going.",
        "For reasons that will become clear, we prefer to talk about TEXTUAL INFERENCES rather than about textual entailments when referring to the general enterprise.",
        "We first explicitate what we think should be covered by the term textual inferences, we then look at the PASCAL development suite in the light of our discussion and we conclude with a short proposal for extensions to the test suite.",
        "Before even starting at this, a point of clarification needs to be made: the correspondence of a linguistic object to an object in the real world goes beyond what can be learned from the text itself.",
        "When somebody says or writes The earth is flat or The king of France is bald because (s)he is a liar or ill-informed, nothing in these linguistic expressions in themselves alerts us to the fact that they do not correspond to situations in the real world (we leave texts in which the author signals consciously or unconsiously that he is lying or fibbing out of consideration here.)",
        "What the text does is give us information about the stance its author takes vis-`a-vis the events or states described.",
        "It is thus useful to distinguish between two ingredients that go into determining the truth value of an utterance, one is the trustworthiness of the utterer and the other is the stance of the utterer vis-`a-vis the truth of the content.",
        "The latter we will call the veridicity of the content.",
        "When we talk about textual inferences we are only interested in veridicity not in the truth which lies beyond what can be inferred from texts.",
        "Or, maybe more realistically, we assume a trustworthy author so that veridical statements are also true."
