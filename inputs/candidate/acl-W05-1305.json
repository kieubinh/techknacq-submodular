        "We have recently updated the text corpora we use in our research with respect to these criteria.",
        "Three different corpora were combined.",
        "The AB-Gene corpus consists of over 4 000 sentences annotated with gene and protein named entities.",
        "It was originally used to train the ABGene tagger to recognize gene/protein names in MEDLINE records, and recall and precision rates in the lower 70 percentile range were achieved (Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002).",
        "The MedPost corpus consists of 6 700 sentences, and is annotated with parts of speech, and gerund arguments.",
        "The MedPost tagger was trained on 3 700 of these sentences and achieved an accuracy of 97.4% on the remaining sentences (Smith et.",
        "al., 2004).",
        "The GENETAG corpus for gene/protein named entity identification, consists of 20 000 sentences and was used in the BioCreative 2004 Workshop (Yeh et.",
        "al., 2005; Tanabe et.",
        "al., 2005) (only 15 000 sentences are currently released, the remaining 5 000 are being retained for possible use in a future workshop).",
        "Training on a portion of the data, the top performing systems achieved recall and precision rates in the lower 80 percentile range.",
        "Because of the scarcity of good annotated data in the realm of biomedicine, and because good performance has been obtained using this data, we feel there is utility in presenting it to a wider audience.",
