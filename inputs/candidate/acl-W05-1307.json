        "Proteins are often considered in terms of their networks of interactions, a view that has spurred considerable effort in mapping large-scale protein interaction networks.",
        "Thus far, the most complete protein networks are measured for yeast and derive from the synthesis of varied large scale experimental interaction data and in-silico interaction predictions (summarized in (von Mering et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004; Jansen et al., 2003)).",
        "Unlike the case of yeast, only minimal progress has been made with respect to the human proteome.",
        "While some moderate-scale interaction maps have been created, such as for the purified TNFa/NFKB protein complex (Bouwmeester et al., 2004) and the proteins involved in the human Smad signaling pathway (Col-land et al., 2004), the bulk of known human protein interaction data derives from individual, small-scale experiments reported in Medline.",
        "Many of these interactions have been collected in the Reac-tome (Joshi-Tope et al., 2005), BIND (Bader et al., 2003), DIP (Xenarios et al., 2002), and HPRD (Peri et al., 2004) databases, with Reactome contributing 11,000 interactions that have been manually entered from articles focusing on interactions in core cellular pathways, and HPRD contributing a set of 12,000 interactions recovered by manual curation of Medline articles using teams of readers.",
        "Additional interactions have been transferred from other organisms based on orthology (Lehner and Fraser, 2004).",
        "A comparison of these existing interaction data sets is enlightening.",
        "Although the interactions from these data sets are in principle derived from the same source (Medline), the sets are quite disjoint (Figure 1) implying either that the sets are biased for different classes of interactions, or that the actual number of interactions in Medline is quite large.",
        "We suspect both reasons.",
        "It is clear that each data set has a different explicit focus (Reactome towards core cellular machinery, HPRD towards disease-linked genes, and DIP and BIND more randomly",
        "distributed).",
        "Due to these biases, it is likely that many interactions from Medline are still excluded from these data sets.",
        "The maximal overlap between interaction data sets is seen for BIND: 25% of these interactions are also in HPRD or Reactome; only 1% of Reactome interactions are in HPRD or BIND.",
        "Medline now has records from more than 4,800 journals accounting for around 15 million articles.",
        "These citations contain thousands of experimentally recorded protein interactions, and even a cursory investigation of Medline reveals human protein interactions not present in the current databases.",
        "However, retrieving these data manually is made difficult by the large number of articles, all lacking formal structure.",
        "Automated extraction of information would be preferable, and therefore, mining data from Medline abstracts is a growing field (Jenssen et al., 2001; Rzhetsky et al., 2004; Liu and Wong, 2003; Hirschman et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper, we describe a framework for automatic extraction of protein interactions from biomedical literature.",
        "We focus in particular on the difficult and important problem of identifying interactions concerning human proteins.",
        "We describe a system for first accurately identifying the names of human proteins in the documents, then on identifying pairs of interacting human proteins, and demonstrate that the extracted protein interactions are comparable to those extracted manually.",

        "We previously gathered the existing human protein interaction data sets ((Ramani et al., 2005); summarized in Table 1), representing the current status of the publically-available human interactome.",
        "This required unification of the interactions under a shared naming and annotation convention.",
        "For this purpose, we mapped each interacting protein to LocusLink (now EntrezGene) identification numbers and retained only unique interactions (i.e., for two proteins A and B, we retain only A–B or B–A, not both).",
        "We have chosen to omit self-interactions, A–A or B –B, for technical reasons, as their quality cannot be assessed on the functional benchmark that we describe in Section 3.",
        "In most cases, a small loss of proteins occurred in the conversion between the different gene identifiers (e.g., converting from the NCBI ’gi’ codes in BIND to LocusLink identifiers).",
        "In the case of Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), this processing resulted in a significant reduction in the number of interactions from 12,013 total interactions to 6,054 unique, non-self interactions, largely due to the fact that HPRD often records both A-B and BA interactions, as well as a large number of self interactions, and indexes genes by their common names rather than conventional database entries, often resulting in multiple entries for different synonyms.",
        "An additional 9,283 (or 60,000 at lower confidence) interactions are available from orthologous transfer of interactions from large-scale screens in other organisms (orthology-core and orthology-all) (Lehner and Fraser, 2004)."

        "To measure the relative accuracy of each protein interaction data set, we established two benchmarks of interaction accuracy, one based on shared protein function and the other based on previously known interactions.",
        "First, we constructed a benchmark in which we tested the extent to which interaction partners in a data set shared annotation, a measure previously shown to correlate with the accuracy of functional genomics data sets (von Mering et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004; Lehner and Fraser, 2004).",
        "We used the functional annotations listed in the KEGG",
        "(Kanehisa et al., 2004) and Gene Ontology (Ash-burner et al., 2000) annotation databases.",
        "These databases provide specific pathway and biological process annotations for approximately 7,500 human genes, assigning human genes into 155 KEGG pathways (at the lowest level of KEGG) and 1,356 GO pathways (at level 8 of the GO biological process annotation).",
        "KEGG and GO annotations were combined into a single composite functional annotation set, which was then split into independent testing and training sets by randomly assigning annotated genes into the two categories (3,800 and 3,815 annotated genes respectively).",
        "For the second benchmark based on known physical interactions, we assembled the human protein interactions from Reactome and BIND, a set of 11,425 interactions between 1,710 proteins.",
        "Each benchmark therefore consists of a set of binary relations between proteins, either based on proteins sharing annotation or physically interacting.",
        "Generally speaking, we expect more accurate protein interaction data sets to be more enriched in these protein pairs.",
        "More specifically, we expect true physical interactions to score highly on both tests, while non-physical or indirect associations, such as genetic associations, should score highly on the functional, but not physical interaction, test.",
        "For both benchmarks, the scoring scheme for measuring interaction set accuracy is in the form of a log odds ratio of gene pairs either sharing annotations or physically interacting.",
        "To evaluate a data set, we calculate a log likelihood ratio (LLR) as:",
        "(obtained by applying Bayes theorem), P(IjD) and P(�IjD) are estimated using the frequencies of interactions observed in the given data set D between annotated genes sharing benchmark associations and not sharing associations, respectively, while the priors P(I) and P (� I) are estimated based on the total frequencies of all benchmark genes sharing the same associations and not sharing associations, respectively.",
        "A score of zero indicates interaction partners in the data set being tested are no more likely than random to belong to the same pathway or to interact; higher scores indicate a more accurate data set.",
        "Among the literature-derived interactions (Reactome, BIND, HPRD), a total of 17,098 unique interactions occur in the public data sets.",

        "Besides restricting the word subsequences to be anchored on the two protein tokens, we can further prune down the feature space by utilizing the following property of natural language statements: whenever a sentence asserts a relationship between two entity mentions, it generally does this using one of the following three patterns: .",
        "[FI] Fore–Inter: words before and between the two entity mentions are simultaneously used to express the relationship.",
