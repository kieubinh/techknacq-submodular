        "Genomic research in the last decade has resulted in the production of a large amount of data in the form of micro-array experiments, sequence information and publications discussing the discoveries.",
        "The data generated by these experiments is highly",
        "connected; the results from sequence analysis and micro-arrays depend on functional information and signal transduction pathways cited in peer-reviewed publications for evidence.",
        "Though scientists in the field are aided by many online databases of biochemical interactions, currently a majority of these are curated labor intensively by domain experts.",
        "Information extraction from text has therefore been pursued actively as an attempt to extract knowledge from published material and to speed up the curation process significantly.",
        "In the biomedical context, the first step towards information extraction is to recognize the names of proteins (Fukuda, Tsunoda et al.",
        "1998), genes, drugs and other molecules.",
        "The next step is to recognize interaction events between such entities (Blaschke, Andrade et al.",

        "1999; Hunter 2000; Thomas, Milward et al.",

        "2000; Ono, Hishigaki et al.",
        "2001; Hahn and Romacker 2002) and then to finally recognize the relationship between interaction events.",
        "However, several issues make extracting such interactions and relationships difficult since (Seymore, McCallum et al.",
        "1999) (i) the task involves free text – hence there are many ways of stating the same fact (ii) the genre of text is not grammatically simple (iii) the text includes a lot of technical terminology unfamiliar to existing natural language processing systems (iv) information may need to be combined across several sentences, and (v) there are many sentences from which nothing should be extracted.",

        "The novel aspects of our system are its ability to handle complex sentence structures using the Complex Sentence Processor (CSP) and to extract multiple and nested interactions specified in a sentence using the Interaction Extractor without the labor intensive pattern engineering requirement.",
        "Our approach is based on identification of syntactic roles, such as subject, objects, verb and modifiers, by using the word dependencies.",
        "We have used a dependency based English grammar parser, the Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1993), to identify the roles.",
        "Syntactic roles are utilized to transform complex sentences into their multiple clauses each containing a single event.",
