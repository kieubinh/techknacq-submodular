        "The most successful models are based on lexicalized probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) induced from constituency-based treebanks.",
        "The linear-precedence constraint of these grammars restricts the types of dependency structures that can be encoded in such trees.1 A shortcoming of the constituency-based paradigm for parsing is that it is inherently incapable of representing non-projective dependencies trees (we define non-projectivity in the following section).",
        "This is particularly problematic when parsing free word-order languages, such as Czech, due to the frequency of sentences with non-projective constructions.",
        "In this work, we explore a corrective model which recovers non-projective dependency structures by training a classifier to select correct dependency pairs from a set of candidates based on parses generated by a constituency-based parser.",
        "We chose to use this model due to the observations that the dependency errors made by the parsers are generally local errors.",
        "For the nodes with incorrect dependency links in the parser output, the correct governor of a node is often found within a local context of the proposed governor.",
        "By considering alternative dependencies based on local deviations of the parser output we constrain the set of candidate governors for each node during the corrective procedure.",
        "We examine two state-of-the-art constituency-based parsers in this work: the Collins Czech parser (1999) and a version of the Charniak parser (2001) that was modified to parse Czech.",
        "Alternative efforts to recover dependency structure from English are based on reconstructing the movement traces encoded in constituency trees (Collins, 2003; Levy and Manning, 2004; Johnson, 2002; Dubey and Keller, 2003).",
        "In fact, the fea",
        "tures we use in the current model are similar to those proposed by Levy and Manning (2004).",
        "However, the approach we propose discards the constituency structure prior to the modeling phase; we model corrective transformations of dependency trees.",
        "The technique proposed in this paper is similar to that of recent parser reranking approaches (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005); however, while reranking approaches allow a parser to generate a likely candidate set according to a generative model, we consider a set of candidates based on local perturbations of the single most likely tree generated.",
        "The primary reason for such an approach is that we allow dependency structures which would never be hypothesized by the parser.",
        "Specifically, we allow for non-projective dependencies.",
        "The corrective algorithm proposed in this paper shares the motivation of the transformation-based learning work (Brill, 1995).",
        "We do consider local transformations of the dependency trees; however, the technique presented here is based on a generative model that maximizes the likelihood of good dependents.",
        "We consider a finite set of local perturbations of the tree and use a fixed model to select the best tree by independently choosing optimal dependency links.",

        "The goal is to recover non-projective dependency structures that are lost when using state-of-the-art constituency-based parsers; we show that our technique recovers over 50% of these dependencies.",
        "Our algorithm provides a simple framework for corrective modeling of dependency trees, making no prior assumptions about the trees.",
        "However, in the current model, we focus on trees with local errors.",
        "Overall, our technique improves dependency parsing and provides the necessary mechanism to recover non-projective structures."
