        "In this paper we describe an approach for the generation of multimodal deixis referring to objects.",
        "These expressions integrate two different kinds of referring to objects, indicating the location of an object by pointing or describing its properties by a definite description.",
        "Following McNeill [McNeill, 1992], we distinguish between abstract pointings and pointings into concrete domains.",
        "Here, we focus on pointings into concrete domains co-occurring with verbal expressions, typically definite noun phrases.",
        "As we will see further on, the interrelation between gesture and verbal expression is of a complex nature.",
        "Both are often under-specified; only together they identify the referent unambiguously.",
        "In the growing number of applications which are characterised by an anthropomorphic human-computer interface there is an increasing need for robust mechanisms when referring to objects by speech and gesture.",
        "Emphasising the importance of deixis in the interaction with humanoid agents, [Lester et al., 1999] introduced the expression deictic believability.",
        "In contrast, the generation of multimodal reference is an open issue until now, while the generation of referring expressions, which identify objects by description, is well investigated (several computational models have been proposed over the last years).",
        "The approach proposed for the generation of multimodal deictic expressions is based on the incremental algorithm by [Dale and Reiter, 1995].",
        "This algorithm for the generation of verbal referring expressions was adapted in that the spatial property location, which can be expressed either absolutely by pointing or relationally by verbal expressions (e.g. ”the left object”), is evaluated besides other object properties in content-selection.",
        "Taking account of the inherent impreciseness of pointing gestures, two referential functions of pointing are distinguished, object pointing and region -pointing.",
        "While object-pointing refers on its own, region-pointing is used to narrow down the set of objects from which the referent has to be distinguished by a definite description.",
        "The described research is undertaken in the course of the development of human computer interfaces for natural interaction in Virtual Reality (VR).",
        "Conducting empirical investigations and developing computational models we focus on dialogues in a construction task domain, where a kit consisting of generic parts is used to construct models of mechanical objects such as a toy airplane.",

        "Our human-sized virtual agent called Maxis able to interpret simple multimodal (speech and gesture) input from the human instructor on the one hand and to produce synchronised output involving synthetic speech, facial display and gesture [Kopp and Wachsmuth, 2004] on the other hand.",

        "Speech and gesture are used by both interlocutors to specify tasks and select relevant objects.",
        "On the way towards dialogue generation a setting we call demonstration games has been established to get at the understanding and generation of complex deictic expressions.",

        "The setting consists of two interlocutors located at a table with some objects lying on it.",
        "One interlocutor has to indicate an object by speech and gesture, and the other interlocutor has to give feedback on which object was referred to.",
        "In a human-human realisation this setting is used to conduct empirical studies to investigate the referring behaviour of subjects [K¨uhnlein and Stegmann, 2003; L¨ucking et al., 2004].",

      "text": [
        "There is little doubt in the literature that pointing is tied up with reference as the following quotation from [Lyons, 1977, p. 654] shows: When we identify an object by pointing to it (and this notion, as we have seen, underlies the term ’deixis’ and Peirce’s term ’index’: cf. 1 5.1), we do so by drawing the attention of the addressee to some spatio-temporal region in which the object is located.",
        "Pointing, then, is related to objects indicated and regions occupied.",
        "Lyons also emphasises that certain kinds of expressions, especially definite descriptions, are closely linked to pointing or demonstration (op.",
        "cit., p. 657): [... ] definite referring noun -phrases, as they have been analysed in this section, always contain a deictic element.",
        "It follows that reference by means of definite descriptions depends ultimately upon deixis, just as much as does reference by means of demonstratives and (as we saw in the previous section) personal pronouns.",
        "Pointing and definite descriptions therefore represent on the one hand different kinds of referring to objects (indicating their location or describing their properties).",
        "On the other hand they appear to be intimately connected.",
        "Lyons does not discuss how exactly pointing and verbal expression are related.",
        "Following [Rieser, 2004], we pursue a line of thought associated with Peirce, who maintains the idea of gestures being part of more complex signs [Peirce, 1965].",
        "Transferring that to deixis we call such complex signs, which are composed of a pointing gesture and a definite description, complex demonstrations.",
        "In other words, complex demonstrations are definite descriptions to which pointings add content, either by specifying an object independently of the definite description (Lyons’ attention being drawn to some object) or by narrowing down the description’s restrictor (Lyons’ spatio-temporal region).",
        "Below, we refer to these two possibilities as the respective functions of demonstration, see [Rieser, 2004] for discussion.",
        "If a pointing gesture uniquely singles out an object, it is said to have object pointing function.",
        "If the gesture draws the attention of the addressee to a region making the objects inside it salient it is ascribed a region pointing function.",
        "The distinction between object-pointing and region-pointing is closely connected with the observation that pointing gestures are inherently ambiguous, varying with the distance between pointing agent and referent.",
        "In the empirical data collected in our demonstration games we found object-pointing only in demonstrations to objects near to the demonstrating subject, while pointings to objects farther are accompanied by definite descriptions [L¨ucking et al., 2004].",
        "Two phenomena can be recognised (even though they are blurred by over-specification which we observe very often in complex demonstrations).",
        "First, pointing saves words; definite descriptions accompanied by a pointing gesture are shorter and less complex than definite descriptions without gesture.",
        "Secondly, length and complexity of the definite description in complex demonstrations depend on the distance between demonstrating subject and referent pointed to.",
        "Similar results can be found in literature, e.g. [Beun and Cremers, 2001; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2004].",
        "These results indicate that the discriminative power of pointing gestures influences the construction of definite descriptions and that in order to determine the set of entities delimited by a pointing gesture the distance to the referent has to be accounted for.",
        "As a first approximation we model the topology of the region singled out by a pointing gesture as a cone anchored at the index finger tip and directed along the vector defined by the stretched index finger.",
        "It has to be stressed, however, that a cone is an idealisation of the pointing region.",
        "There are a lot of influencing parameters, which we can divide in perceivable parameters on the one hand (like spatial configuration of demonstrating agent, addressee, and referents as well as the clustering of the entities under demonstration) and dialogue parameters on the other hand.",
        "Determining the pointing cone in more detail is the issue of further empirical investigations currently undertaken.",
        "The concept of pointing cone we use is based on a set of parameters which guarantees that the cone’s form and size can be adjusted as further findings become available.",
        "Observations we made in our corpus suggest that we have to acknowledge that each of the two referential functions of pointing, i.e. object-pointing and region-pointing, comes with a cone on its own.",
        "Therefore, the concept of pointing cone can be divided into two topologically different types for object and for region-pointing respectively, with the former having a narrower angle than the latter.",
        "The cone of object-pointing represents the resolution of a pointing gesture visually perceivable to the dialogue participants, and therefore, defines the borderline up to which object-pointing can be conducted successfully.",
        "Preliminary findings [K¨uhnlein and Stegmann, 2003] indicate an apex angle of this cone of about 12 to 24 degrees.",
        "In contrast, region-pointing draws the attention of the addressee to a wider region making the objects inside this region salient.",
        "The cone representing this region has to be modelled with a wider apex angle than the cone for object-pointing to ensure robust reference and to fit empirical findings concerning over-specification."

      "heading": "7 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this paper an approach was presented which enables the generation of multimodal deictic expressions consisting of a pointing gesture indicating the location of an object and a definite noun phrase describing the object using its properties.",
        "Taking account of the inherent impreciseness of pointing gestures two referential functions of pointing are distinguished, object-pointing and region-pointing.",
        "With the increasing distance between demonstrating agent and referent the discriminatory power of the gesture decreases and more additional properties are needed to identify the referent.",
        "A pointing cone for each referring function of pointing gestures was defined to model the distance dependency of pointing.",
        "An algorithm was presented that integrates pointing and definite descriptions by using the objects highlighted by the gesture as distractor set for the construction of the definite description.",
        "Drawing the attention to a spatial region and the objects lying inside this region region-pointing ensures that these objects are in the focus of attention of the addressee ([Dale and Reiter, 1995] speak in this context about a navigational function of the expression).",
        "Dale and Reiter emphasise that their content-selection algorithm is defined domain independently while the property list P and the functions MORES PECIFICVALUE, BASICLEVELVALUE, and USERKNOWS define the interface to the domain of application, especially to the knowledge about this domain shared by the interlocutors.",
        "Analogously, the functions REACHABLE?, GENERATEPOINTINGRAY, and GETPOINTINGMAP in our approach can be seen as a link between the content-selection algorithm and the spatial context in which the interaction takes place.",
        "Implementing the concept of the pointing cone they provide an interface between the geometrical aspects of pointing gestures and their referential semantics.",
        "The quality of the generation results using the described approach depends on the precision of the topology of the pointing cones and the knowledge about the parameters influencing this topology.",
        "We have started to conduct empirical studies using tracking technology to collect analytical data concerning the pointing behaviour of human subjects in varying pointing domains [Kranstedt et al., 2005].",
        "Up to now, we do not have a comprehensive evaluation of our approach.",
        "But if we compare the generation results with the empirical data collected in the demonstration games mentioned in Sec. 1 and with other corpora about instructor-constructor dialogues in the Baufix-world [Sagerer et al., 1994] we notice a good correspondence with the empirical findings.",
        "A critical point we found in these comparisons is that the perceivable resolution of pointing in real world is not exactly the same as in VR.",
        "In the latter it depends massively on kind and quality of the display technology used.",
        "Therefore, mechanisms which adapt the pointing cone’s size and form to the constraints of the interaction environment seem to be useful."
