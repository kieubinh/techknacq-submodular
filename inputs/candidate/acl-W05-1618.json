        "Procedural texts often exhibit a quite complex rational and ’irrational’ structure, outlining different ways to realize something, with arguments, advices, conditions, hypothesis, preferences, evaluations, user stimulations, etc.",
        "They also often contain a number of recommendations, warnings, and comments of various sorts.",
        "Another feature is that procedural texts tend to minimize the distance between language and action.",
        "Plans to realize a goal are made as immediate and explicit as necessary, the objective being to reduce the inferences that the user will have to make before acting, and therefore potential errors or misunderstandings.",
        "In our perspective, procedural texts range from apparently simple cooking receipes to large maintenance manuals (whose paper versions are measured in tons e.g. for aircraft maintenance).",
        "They also include documents as diverse as teaching texts, medical notices, social behavior recommendations, directions for use, assembly notices, do-it-yourself notices, itinerary guides, advice texts, savoir-faire guides etc.",
        "Procedural texts obey more or less to a number of structural criteria, which may depend on the author’s writing abilities and on traditions associated with a given domain.",
        "There is obviously a big contrast between maintenance manuals and people magazines which both contains such texts.",
        "Procedural texts can be regulatory, procedural, programmatory, prescriptive, injunctive, or may introduce advices (for social of psychological behavior) [1].",
        "The study we present in this paper has three main goals: First, to be able to accurately respond in natural language to (procedural) questions.",
        "Procedural question answering systems are much of interest both to large public via the web, and to more technical staff for example to query large textual databases dedicated to various types of procedures [6].",

        "Integrating texts is obviouly a long-term challenge.",
        "This paper basically relates the structure ofprocedural texts as they are in French.",

        "We then give the most important structural elements, and the rhetorical structure that characterizes the relations between elements.",
