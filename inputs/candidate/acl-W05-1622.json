        "From a typological perspective, modality concerns the speaker’s estimation of the possible and necessary occurrence, respectively, of some state of affairs [van der Auwera and Plungian, 1998].",
        "In many languages, modality is linguistically realized by a whole bundle of different means, with modal verbs being the most prominent ones.",
        "In this paper, we will describe the realization of uses of the four German modal verbs müssen (must, have to, need to), können (can, to be able to), dürfen (may, could, to be allowed to do) and the subjunctive form of sollen, i.e. sollte (should).",
        "As the English translations indicate, there is no simple correspondence between the meaning of these German modal verbs and their counterparts in other languages.",
        "In particular, the pragmatic conditions for their use differ widely so that a straightforward adoption of the conditions we are giving in this paper to other languages will probably not be possible.",
        "In general, the problem of the choice of modal verbs is the fact that the use of modals is, among other things, determined by information that is usually only implicitly given in a discourse.",
        "This information must be made available during macroplanning for the entire text in a way that enables the choice of the contextually appropriate modal verbs.",
        "In what follows, we will first outline the semantics and pragmatics of modal verbs in general, and the four German modals plus sollen in particular.",
        "Based on this, we will delineate our choice model for modals and its application to the aforementioned four modal verbs.",
        "Finally, we will show how this model is integrated into the CAN-System that we are currently developing."

        "The meaning of modals is deeply rooted in information that is only implicitly given in a discourse, but plays a crucial role in the full understanding of the underlying speaker’s intention.",
        "This context-dependence results in different readings.",
        "A sentence like Peter must attend the lecture on semantics can be interpreted in numerous ways: It could express that according to the knowledge of the speaker it is necessary that Peter attends this lecture, or that Peter´s course of study requires his attendance in the lecture on semantics.",
        "Since Kratzer´s (1977) seminal work on a uniform and formal treatment of the semantics of modal verbs, the context-dependence of the meaning of modals is traced back to so-called conversational backgrounds (also called modal domains or modal bases) that provide that information against which the modalized sentence has to be interpreted.",
        "According to her widely accepted analysis in formal semantics, the meaning of modal verbs depends on the class of permitted conversational backgrounds and the so-called modal force, i.e. whether the modal verbs express possibility or necessity.",
        "Possibility and necessity are defined as consistency and entailment with respect to the respective conversational background: a proposition is possible if it is consistent with the relevant background, and it is necessary if it is entailed by the conversational background.",
        "Accordingly, modal verbs differ in their semantics with respect to these two parameters: their inherent modal force, and the classes of modal domains associated with them.1",
        "The classifications of relevant conversational backgrounds that have been postulated for an adequate analysis of the meaning of modal expressions differ widely in the literature.",
        "They range from two types – a basic distinction between epistemic and “root” modals - to more than twenty in von Stechow’s (2004) classification.",
        "Kratzer uses a modal logic to describe the meaning of modal verbs.",
        "However, she leaves open what conversational backgrounds really are (besides their characterization as sets of propositions), although this concept is the linchpin of a satisfying analysis of the meaning of modals.",
        "Also discourse-oriented approaches to the meaning of modals as, e.g., Roberts (1989), Frank (1996), or Stone (1999) do not say much about the structure and content of conversational backgrounds.",
        "These approaches analyze specific uses of modals as anaphoric expressions: in some discourse segments, modals pick up modal domains introduced by previous modal expressions, and must be interpreted against this already introduced hypothetical scenario.",
        "Stone (1999), for example, gives the following sentence pair:",
        "(1) A wolf might walk into the house.",
        "It would eat you.",
        "In order to interpret the second modalized sentence correctly, the anaphoric connection between the content of that sentence and the possible scenario of the first one must be made explicit."

        "We will outline what semanticians have to say about the meaning of these modal verbs, and characterize those pragmatic conditions for their use that are of importance for this paper.",
        "Müssen and sollen both express necessity as modal force.",
        "The semantic difference between these two verbs concerns the admissible conversational backgrounds: While müssen can be used with any conversational background, the use of sollen is restricted to specific ones, viz. those that express a specified ideal like laws or social norms.",
        "For example, while the sentence",
        "(2) Peter muss den Kurs besuchen (Peter must attend the lecture)",
        "can, in principle, be interpreted with respect to any kind of conversational background, some of these backgrounds are not possible for the sentence Peter soll den Kurs besuchen (Peter shall attend the lecture).",
        "The former sentence can be interpreted as:",
        "1.",
        "In view of what is known by the speaker/the listener/..., it is necessary that Peter attends the lecture (epistemic interpretation) modals in this paper, we will not go into the details.",

        "2.",
        "In view of what the conditions of study determines, it is necessary that Peter attends the lecture (deon-tic interpretation) 3. in view of someone´s will, it is necessary that Peter attends the lecture (volitional interpretation) 4. in view of achieving certain goals in is necessary that Peter attends the lecture (teleological interpretation) and so on.",
        "Sollen, however, cannot presuppose conversational backgrounds that are evoked by the subject (cf, von Stechow, 2004; Zifonun et al., 1997).",
        "For example, a deontic interpretation of Peter soll den Kurs besuchen is not possible with the respective obligations as conversational backgrounds determined by Peter himself.",
        "In addition to the modal verbs, mood is also a linguistic means to express modality.",
        "Often, mood weakens the modal force so that sollte does not express the necessity of the embedded proposition anymore, but a weaker modal force that comes close to possibility.",
        "Können and dürfen seem to be the counterparts of müssen and sollen.",
        "They express possibility as modal force.",
        "Können is not confined to specific conversational backgrounds, while dürfen can – similar to sollen - only be used with extra-subjective ideal backgrounds, preferably deontic ones.",
        "The sentence",
        "(3) Peter darf den Kurs besuchen (Peter may attend the lecture)",
        "means: his attendance of the lecture is compatible with his duties (imposed by someone else), the conditions of study, the will of a third person, some relevant facts, and so on.",
        "Although this semantic analysis shows convincingly the relevance of the modal force and the conversational backgrounds for a systematic treatment of the meaning of modals, it cannot be the whole story of the meaning of modals.",
        "If conversational backgrounds and modal forces would sufficiently explain the meaning of modals, every modal verb with a restricted set of admissible conversational backgrounds could be replaced by the modals können and müssen, respectively, without changing the meaning of the respective sentence.",
        "Although this might be true with respect to the truth conditions of the single sentences, replacing the specific modals by more general ones nevertheless results in sentences with different readings.",
        "For example, replacing the sentence",
        "(4) Du darfst den Semantik-Kurs besuchen und du solltest den Syntax -Kurs besuchen (You may attend the semantics lecture and you should visit the lecture on syntax) by the sentence (4´) Du kannst den Semantik -Kurs besuchen und du müsstest den Syntax-Kurs besuchen (You can attend",
        "the semantics lecture and you ought to attend the lecture on syntax) leads to different prominent meanings: while the first sentence clearly expresses a permission and a recommendation, the second one is more neutral with respect to the relevant pragmatic meaning.",
        "Additionally, the second clause expresses a weak deontically motivated entailment.",
        "Hence, the modal verbs are associated with specific pragmatic conditions for their use.",
        "We will refer to those pragmatics aspects only that are crucial for our treatment of the modals.",
        "We start from the assumption that the uses of mussen and können do not require specific pragmatic constraints.",
        "Sollte does not express necessity (as the indicative sollen does) but possibility, and shall be used if the goal of the system is to express the proposition as a strong advice.",
        "Durfen shall be used if the system expresses a permission that is based on the courses the user has completed successfully so far, or if the user has the permission to study at all."

        "While modal expressions appear in all kinds of text genres produced by humans, be it newspaper articles or dialogue contributions, their realization in NLG-systems did not receive much attention so far.2 This disregarding of modality might be due to the nature of the text types that typically describe entities as, e.g., animals (Peba-II; Milosavljevic 1997) or air–qualities (TEMSIS, Busemann and Horacek 1997).",
