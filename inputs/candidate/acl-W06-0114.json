        "In the utterance, compared with broken syllables, successive speech alters greatly, due to the influence of co-articulation, semantics and prosody.",

        "Prosodic annotation increases the utility of a speech corpus.",
        "An annotated speech corpus can not only offer us a database for the research and exploration of speech information but can also enlarge our knowledge of speech and prosodic features through a visual and scientific method.",
        "Prosodic annotation is a categorical description for the prosodic features with linguistic functions, in other words, annotation of the changes of tone, the patterns of stress, and the prosodic structure with linguistic functions.",
        "The prosodic labeling conventions are a set of machine-readable codes for transforming speech prosodies and rule conventions.",
        "Based on ToBI (Kim Silverman et al.",
        "1992, John F. Pitrelli et al.",
        "1994) and C-ToBI Conventions (Li Aijun 2002), according to the practical needs of broadcast speech language, the prosodic annotation mainly involves labeling the following parallel tiers: break index, stress index, and intonation construction tier (Chen Yudong 2004, Zou Yu 2004).",
        "3.2.1 Break indices tier Based on Cao Jianfen’s (1999, 2001) categories of prosodic hierarchy structure combined with the practical needs of broadcast speech, we identified five break levels (0-4): 0 indicates the silence or the boundary of default internal syllables amidst the prosodic words.",
        "1 stands for the boundaries of the prosodic words including the short breaks with silent pause and breaks with filled pause.",
        "The prosodic words are the fundamental prosodic units in broadcast speech.",
        "Simple prosodic words are composed of 1~3 syllables.",
        "Complex prosodic words normally contain 5~9 syllables, e.g., “Shang4hai3 he2zuo4 zu3zhi1” (i.e. the Shanghai Cooperation Organization).",
        "Break level 2 designates the boundaries of the prosodic phrases, most of which are apparent breaks with silent pause, and their patterns of pitch have also changed.",
        "Break level 3 represent the boundaries of intonational phrases, or the boundaries of sentences.",
        "Break level 4 stands for the boundaries of intonation groups, similar to the boundary of the entire piece of news in a news broadcast, or of a talker turn in dialogue.",
        "At indefinite boundaries, the code “-” is added after the numbers.",
        "The labels of the break tier occurring times are shown in table 2:",
        "Stress is a significant prosodic feature.",
        "In training materials for broadcast announcers, emphasis is laid on labeling the stress on the basis of the purpose of the utterance, the pattern and rhythm of stresses, and the changes of emotions.",
        "Zhang Song’s (1983) classification of nuclear stresses can be the guideline for broadcasting production and practice.",
        "However, there are some shortcomings in his classifications, for instances, the vague hierarchies between the sentences and discourses.",
        "This gets in the way of the formal description of the stresses by the computers.",
        "Nevertheless, his theories on the judgment of primary and minor stresses (i.e. non-stresses, minor stresses, primary stresses etc.)",
        "have some reference value for stress annotations, because distinguishing the hierarchies of stress is a crucial practical problem for annotation.",
        "As to the problems with the hierarchies of stress, most of the experimental phonetics and speech processing researchers adopt Lin Mao-can’s (2001, 2002) classifications of stress hierarchies or some similar classifications.",
        "That is to say, the levels of stress include prosodic word stress, prosodic phrase stress, and sentence stress (or nuclear stress) in Chinese.",
        "According to real life broadcasting productions, this paper identi",
        "fies four categories of stresses in broadcast speech: the rhythm unit, the cross rhythm unit, the clause, and the discourse.",
        "Among them, the discourse stress often occurs at the place of an accented syllable, but they are relatively more important than the other sentence stresses.",
        "The labeling methods of all the ranks are listed as follows (Chen Yudong 2004):",
        "Furthermore, Zhang Song's (1983) other criteria for stress annotation (utterance purpose and emotion change), while perceptually important, are metalinguistic or paralinguistic in character, and will therefore not be addressed in this paper.",
        "In line with Shen Jiong’s view about intonation (Shen Jiong 1994), we found that the intonation construction tier is an important component of the annotation of discourses (Chen Yudong 2004).",
        "It can display the changes of sentence intonation structures.",
        "The annotation of the intonation construction is mainly to label the relationship of other syllables to the nuclear stress apart from prehead, dissociation etc.",
        "For example: Table 5 the labels of the intonation construction tier occurring in 4 hours annotated corpora Labels Description Occurrence",
        "A sentence can have one nuclear stress, or multiple nuclear stresses.",
        "Single nuclear stress: representing the fore-and-aft places of the nuclear stress, the steepness of nuclear stress, and the length of nuclear stress.",
        "Examples are listed as follows: P-H-N-T; P-H-H-N; ... ...",
        "Among the above examples, long nuclear splitting type “H-N-T-H-N’-T”, with the features of multi-nuclear “H-N1-T-H-N2-T” is greatly similar to multi-nuclear.",
        "However, “H-N-T-H-N’-T” differs from multi-nuclear in its dependent grammar unit.",
        "Multi-nuclear stress: The two or more nuclear stresses in a multi-nuclear sentence take the patterns of like independent sentence intonation constructions, each with its own nucleus, preceded by a head and optional prehead, and followed by a tail.",
        "In other words, these relatively independent patterns already have the features of relatively independent intonation constructions, with the apparent features of “prehead, head, and nuclear ending”.",
        "This kind of nuclear stress often occurs in relatively longer and more complex constructions.",
        "Intonation constructions can be labeled separately.",
        "A case in point is the contrastive sentence “zai4 wen3 ding4 de0 ji1 chu3 shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 gao1 su4 de0 fa1 zhan3” (i.e.",
        "It got a comparative high-speed development on the stable conditions) that can be annotated as “H-N1-T, H-N2-T”.",
        "For example: Figure 3 the contrastive sentence “zai4 wen3 ding4 de0 ji1 chu3 shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 gao1 su4 de0 fa1 zhan3”(在稳定的基础上, 取得比较高速的发展)"
