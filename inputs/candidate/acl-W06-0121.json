        "Chinese word segmentation is one of the core techniques in Chinese language processing and attracts lots of research interests in recent years.",
        "Several promising methods are proposed by previous researchers, in which Maximum Entropy (ME) model has turned out to be a successful way for this task (Hwee Tou Ng et al., 2004; Jin Kiat Low et al., 2005).",
        "By employing Maximum Entropy (ME) model, the Chinese word segmentation task is regarded as a classification problem, where each character will be classified to one of the four classes, i.e., the beginning, middle, end of a multi-character word and a single-character word.",
        "However, in a high degree, ME model pays its emphasis on Chinese characters while debases the consideration on the relationship of the context words.",
        "Motivated by this view, several strategies used for reflecting the context words’ relationship and integrating more linguistics information, are employed in our systems.",
        "As known, an n-gram language model could express the relationship of the context words well, it therefore as a desirable choice is imported in our system to modify the scoring of the ME model.",
        "An analysis on our preliminary experiments shows the combination ambiguity is another issue that should be specially tackled, and a division and combination strategy is then adopted in our system.",
        "To handle the numeral words, we also introduce a number conjunction strategy.",
        "In addition, to deal with the long organization names problem in MSRA corpus, a post processing strategy for organization name is presented.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our system in detail.",
        "Section 3 presents the experiments and results.",
        "And in last section, we draw our conclusions."

        "Based on scores of all characters, a completely segmented semiangle matrix can be constructed.",
        "Each element wji in this matrix represents a word that starts at the ith character and ends at jth character, and its value ME(j, i), the score for these (j – i + 1) characters to form a word, is calculated as follow:",
        "As a consequence, the optimal segmentation results corresponding to the best path with the lowest overall score could be reached via a dynamic programming algorithm.",

        "To handle the combination ambiguity issue, we introduce a division and combination strategy which take in use of unigram and bigram.",
        "For each two words A and B, if their bigrams does not exist while there exists the unigram of word AB, then they can be conjoined as one word.",
        "For example, ”+)] (August)” and ” n (revolution)” are two segmented words, and in training set the bigram of”+ )]” and ” n” is absent, while the word ”+)] n (the August Revolution)” ap-peares, then the character string ”+ )] n” is conjoined as one word.",
        "On the other hand, for a word C which can be divided as AB, if its unigram does not exit in training set, while the bigram of its subwords A and B exits, then it will be re-segmented.",

        "$d(economic system)” and ”TW (reform)” exists, as a consequence, it will be segmented into two words”➨▲◆$d” and ”TW”.",
        "The ME model always segment a numeral word into several words.",
        "For instance, the word ”4.34j C(RMB Yuan 4.34)”, may be segmented into two words ”4.” and ”34j C”.",
        "To tackle this problem, a numeral word processing strategy is used.",
        "Under this strategy, those words that contain Arabic numerals are manually marked in the training set firstly, then a list of high frequency characters which always appear alone between the numbers in the training set can be extracted, based on which numeral word issue can be tackled as follows.",
        "When segmenting one sentence, if two conjoint words are numeral words, and the last character of the former word is in the list, then they are combined as one word.",
        "Strategy Since an organization name is usually an OOV, it always will be segmented as several words, especially for a long one, while in MSRA corpus, it is required to be recognized as one word.",
        "In our systems, a corresponding strategy is presented to deal with this problem.",
        "Firstly a list of organization names is manually selected from the training set and stored in the prefix-tree based on characters.",
        "Then a list of prefixes is extracted by scanning the prefix-tree, that is, for each node, if the frequencies of its child nodes are all lower than the predefined threshold k and half of the frequency of the current node, the string of the current node will be extracted as a prefix; otherwise, if there exists a child node whose frequency is higher than the threshold k, scan the corresponding subtree.",
        "In the same way, the suffixes can also be extracted.",
        "The only difference is that the order of characters is inverse in the lexical tree.",
        "During recognizing phase, to a successive words string that may include 2-5 words, will be combined as one word, if all of the following conditions are satisfied.",
