        "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental component for many NLP applications, such as Information extraction, text Summarization, machine translation and so forth.",
        "In recent years, much attention has been focused on the problem of recognition of Chinese named entities.",
        "The problem of Chinese named entity recognition is difficult and challenging, In addition to the challenging difficulties existing in the counterpart problem in English, this problem also exhibits the following more difficulties: (1) In a Chinese document, the names do not have “boundary to-kens' such as the capitalized initial letters for a person name in an English document.",
        "(2) There is no space between words in Chinese text, so we have to segment the text before NER is performed.",
        "In this paper, we report a Chinese named entity recognition system using a multiphase model which includes a basic segmentation phase and three named entity recognition phases.",
        "In our system, the implementations of basic segmentation components and named entity recognition component are both based on conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "At last, we apply the rule method to recognize some simple and short location names and organization names in the text.",
        "We will describe each of these phases in more details below."

        "After basic segmentation, a small number of named entities in the text, such as “山西队', “新华社', “福建省' and so on, which are segmented as a single word.",

        "2003), we apply three trained CRFs models with carefully designed and selected features to label person names, location names and organization names in the segmentation results, respectively.",

        "We implemented the basic segmentation component with linear chain structure CRFs.",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical models that encode a conditional probability distribution using a given set of features.",
        "In the special case in which the designated output nodes of the graphical model are linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFs make a first-order Markov independence assumption among output nodes, and thus correspond to finite state machines (FSMs).",
        "CRFs define the conditional probability of a state sequence given an input sequence as",
        "Where fk (st−1 , st ,o, t) is an arbitrary feature function over its arguments, and ),k is a learned weight for each feature function.",
        "Based on CRFs model, we cast the segmentation problem as a sequence tagging problem.",
        "Different from (Peng et al., 2004), we represent the positions of a hanzi (Chinese character) with four different tags: B for a hanzi that starts a word, I for a hanzi that continues the word, F for a hanzi that ends the word, S for a hanzi that occurs as a single-character word.",
        "The basic segmentation is a process of labeling each hanzi with a tag given the features derived from its surrounding context.",
        "The features used in our experiment can be broken into two categories: character features and word features.",
        "The character features are instantiations of the following templates, similar to those described in (Ng and Jin, 2004), C refers to a Chinese hanzi.",
        "In addition to the character features, we came up with another type word context feature which was found very useful in our experiments.",
        "The feature captures the relationship between the hanzi and the word which contains the hanzi.",
        "For a two-hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi “)V” within the word “)VI” will have the feature WC0=TWO_F set to 1, the second hanzi “I” within the same word “)VI” will have the feature WC0=TWO_L set to 1.",
        "For the three-hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi “r” within a word “r��” will have the feature WC0=TRI_F set to 1, the second hanzi “�” within the same word “r��” will have the feature WC0=TRI_M set to 1, and the last hanzi “�” within the same word “r��” will have the feature WC0=TRI_L set to 1.",
        "Similarly, the feature can be extended to a four-hanzi word."

        "By analyzing a large amount of entity name corpora, we find that the indicative intensity of different boundary words vary greatly.",
        "So we divide the left and right boundary words into two classes according to the indicative intensity.",

        "To this phenomenon, we adopted an unconditional rule, that if a word, except recognized name entity, was detected as a new word and its length was more than 6 (Chinese Characters), and it should be segmented as several in-vocabulary words based on the combination of FMM and BMM methods.",
