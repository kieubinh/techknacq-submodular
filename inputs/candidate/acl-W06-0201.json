      "text": [
        "We have studied the automatic extraction of trend information from text documents such as newspaper articles.",
        "Such extraction will be useful for exploring and examining trends.",
        "We used data sets provided by a workshop on multimodal summarization for trend information (the MuST Workshop) to construct our automatic trend exploration system.",
        "This system first extracts units, temporals, and item expressions from newspaper articles, then it extracts sets of expressions as trend information, and finally it arranges the sets and displays them in graphs.",
        "In our experiments, when we judged the extraction of a correct graph as the top output to be correct, the system accuracy was 0.2500 in evaluation",
        "A and 0.3334 in evaluation B.",
        "(In evaluation A, a graph where 75% or more of the points were correct was judged to be correct; in evaluation B, a graph where 50% or more of the points were correct was judged to be correct.)",
        "When we judged the extraction of a correct graph in the top five outputs to be correct, we obtained accuracy of 0.4167 in evaluation A and 0.6250 in evaluation B.",
        "Our system is convenient and effective because it can output a graph that includes trend information at these levels of accuracy when only a set of documents is provided as input.",
        "In the future, we plan to continue this line of study and improve our system.",
        "We also hope to apply the method of using term frequency in documents to extract trend information as reported by Murata et al.",
        "(Murata et al., 2005a)."
