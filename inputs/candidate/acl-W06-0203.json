        "Methods like ontology based knowledge management and information access through conceptual search have become active research topics in the general research community, with practical applications in many areas.",
        "However the use of IT in legal practice (at least in German speaking countries) is up to now mainly restricted to document preparation and management or Boolean keyword search on full-text collections.",
        "Legal ontologies have been proposed in various research projects, but they focus on an upper level of concepts and are, with only a few exceptions, small knowledge repositories that were handmade by experts (for a summary of existing legal ontologies, cf. (Valente 2004)).",
        "It is clear that realistically large knowledge-based applications in the legal domain will need more comprehensive ontologies incorporating e.g. up-to-date knowledge from court decisions.",
        "For this purpose an expert-based approach has to",
        "be supplemented by automatic acquisition methods.",
        "The same is true for large-scale advanced information access: Extensive conceptual indexation of even a fraction of all court decisions published in one year seems hardly possible without automatic support.",
        "However there has been relatively little research on the use of natural language processing for this purpose (exceptions are (Lame 2005) and (Saias and Quaresma 2005)).",
        "In this paper we look at the use of computational linguistic analysis techniques for information access and ontology learning within the legal domain.",
        "We present a rule-based method for extracting and analyzing definitions from parsed text, and evaluate this method on a corpus of about 6000 German court decisions within the field of environmental law.",
        "We then report on an experiment exploring the use of our extraction results to improve the quality of text-based ontology learning from noun-adjective bigrams.",
        "We will start however with a general discussion of the role that definitions play in legal language."

        "Two central kinds of knowledge contained in the statutes of a code law system are normative knowledge, connecting legal consequences to descriptions of certain facts and situations, and terminological knowledge, consisting in definitions of some of the concepts used in these descriptions (Valente and Breuker 1994).",
        "Normative content is exemplified by (1), parts of section 324a of the German criminal law.",
        "The legal consequence consisting in the specified punishment is connected to the precondition of soil pollution:",
        "1. in a manner that is capable of harming (...) property of significant value or a body of water (...) shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine.",
        "Terminological knowledge consists in definitions of concepts used to describe the sanctioned facts.",
        "E.g., soil is defined in article 2 of the German soil protection law as follows: (2) Soil within the meaning of this Act is the upper layer of the earth's crust (...) including its liquid components (soil solution) and gaseous components (soil air), except groundwater and beds of bodies of water.",
        "If the definitions contained in statutes would fully specify how the relevant concepts are to be applied, cases could be solved (once the relevant statutes have been identified) by mechanically checking which of some given concepts apply, and then deriving the appropriate legal consequences in a logical conclusion.",
        "However such a simple procedure is never possible in reality.",
        "Discussions in courts (and consequently in all legal texts that document court decisions) are in large parts devoted to pinning down whether certain concepts apply.",
        "Controversies often arise because not all relevant concepts are defined at all within statutes, and because the terms used in legal definitions are often in need of clarification themselves.",
        "For instance it may be unclear in some cases what exactly counts as the bed of a body of water mentioned in Example (2).",
        "Additionally, reality is complex and constantly changing, and these changes also pertain to the applicability of formerly clear-cut concepts.",
        "While this is especially true of social reality, rather physical concepts may also be affected.",
        "An often cited example is a case where the German Reichsgericht had to decide whether electricity was to be counted as a thing.",
        "At the heart of these difficulties lies the fact that statutes are written in natural language, not in a formalized or a strongly restricted specialized language.",
        "It is widely assumed in the philosophical literature that most natural language concepts do not lend themselves to definitions fixing all potential conditions of applicability a priori.",
        "From the point of view of legal theory this open-textured character of natural language concepts is often seen as essential for the functioning of any legal system (the term open texture was introduced into this discussion by (Hart 1961)).",
        "The use of natural language expressions allows for a continuous readjustment of the balance between precision and openness.",
        "This possibility is needed to provide regulations that are on the one hand reliable and on the other hand flexible enough to serve as a common ground for all kinds of social interaction.",
        "For the solution of concrete cases, the concepts made available within statute texts are supplemented by further definitions (in a wide sense, covering all kinds of modification and adaptation of concepts) given in the courts’ decisions (in particular within the reasons for judgement).",
        "Such definitions for instance fix whether a certain stretch of sand counts as the bed of a body of water or if something is of significant value in the case at hand.",
        "These definitions are generally open for later amendment or revision.",
        "Still they almost always remain binding beyond the case at hand.",
        "Easy access to definitions in decisions is therefore of great importance to the legal practitioner.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 show how computational linguistic analysis helps answering this need by enabling an accurate search for definitions in a large collection of court decisions.",
        "Accurate definition extraction is a prerequisite to building up an information system that allows for concept-centred access to the interpretational knowledge spread over tens of thousands of documents produced by courts every year.",
        "Definitions are however not only of direct value as a source of information in legal practice.",
        "They also provide contexts that contain particularly much relevant terminology, and are therefore a good place to search for concepts to be integrated in a domain ontology.",
        "Given the importance and frequency of definitions in legal text, such an approach seems particularly promising for this domain.",
        "Section 5 describes how automatically extracted definitions improve the results of a standard ontology learning method."

        "For instance certain adverbials or modal verbs modify the force, validity or degree of commitment to a definition (e.g. only for typical cases).",
        "The field of law within which the given definition applies is often specified as a PP containing a formal reference to sections of statutes or simply the name of a statute, document, or even a complete legal field (e.g. Umweltrecht - environmental law).",

        "The proportion of such problematic cases will obviously be much higher in free text annotation than in the evaluation of our extraction results, which were generated by looking for clear linguistic cues.",
        "Taking the ratio observed in our pilot study (130 definitions in 3500 sentences) as an orientation, the set of rules we are currently using is clearly far from optimal in terms of recall.",

        "For this purpose, we first extracted all noun-adjective bigrams occurring within any of the identified definienda, regardless of their frequency within the corpus.",
        "After completing the annotation on the 627 resulting bigrams they were combined with various top segments of our original unfiltered list.",
        "Figure 6 shows the distribution of the annotated categories among the 627 bigrams from definienda, as well as on two combined lists.",
        "Cutoff 200/750 is the result of cutting the original list at rank 200 and filling up with the next 550 items from the filtered list.",
        "For cutoff 500/1000 we cut the original list at rank 500 and filled up with the following 500 items from the filtered one.",
        "The distribution of categories among the original top 200 is repeated for comparison.",
        "Precision among the 627 filtering results is higher than among the original top 200 (almost 56% compared to 51%), and only slightly smaller even for the 1000 results in the cutoff 500/1000 setting.",
        "Using definition extraction as an additional knowledge source, the top 1000 results retrieved are thus of a quality that can otherwise only be achieved for the top 200 results."

        "In this paper we argued that definitions are an important element of legal texts and in particular of court decisions.",
        "We provided a structural segmentation scheme for definitions and discussed a method of applying computational linguistic analysis techniques for their text-based extraction and automatic segmentation.",
        "We showed that a large number of definitions can in fact be extracted at high precision using this method, but we also pointed out that there is still much room for improvement in terms of recall, e.g. through the inclusion of further definition patterns.",
        "Our future work in this area will focus on the integration of extraction results across documents (e.g. recognizing and collecting complementary definitions for the same concept) and on a user interface for structured access to this data.",
        "For this work we have access to a corpus of several million verdicts provided to us by the company juris GmbH, Saarbrücken.",
        "We also demonstrated how the identification of definitions can improve the results of text-driven ontology learning in the legal domain.",
        "When looking for noun-adjective bigrams encoding relevant concepts, it leads to a considerable increase in precision to restrict the search to definienda only.",
        "This method is more precise than selecting the top ranks of a log-likelihood ranking.",
        "Its great disadvantage is the very low total number of results, leading to poor recall.",
        "However by combining a log-likelihood ranking with definition-based concept extraction, recall can be improved while still achieving better precision than with a log-likelihood ranking alone.",
        "Moreover this combined method also retrieves concepts that are too infrequent to be included at all in a log-likelihood ranking.",
        "There is however another, maybe even more relevant reason to look for definitions in ontology learning.",
        "Definitions in legal text often very explicitly and precisely determine all kinds of relational knowledge about the defined concept.",
        "For instance they specify explicit subordinations (as in the classical definitio per genus et differen",
        "tiam), introduce restrictions on roles inherited from a superconcept, determine the constitutive parts of the definiendum, or contain information about its causal relations to other concepts.",
        "As one focus of our future work we plan to investigate how such rich ontological knowledge can be extracted automatically."
