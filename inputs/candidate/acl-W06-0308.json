        "We are investigating the subjective use of language in text and the automatic classification of texts according to their subjective characteristics, or ‘affect’.",
        "Our approach is to view affective states (such as ‘happy’, ‘angry’) as locations in Osgood’s Evaluation-Activation (EA) space (Osgood et al.",
        ", 1957), and draws on work in psychology which has a long history of work seeking to construct a typology of such affective states (Scherer, 1984).",
        "A similar approach has been used more recently to describe emotional states that are expressed in speech (Cowie and Cornelius, 2002; Schr¨oder and Cowie, 2005).",
        "Our overall aim is to determine the extent to which such a typology can be validated and applied to the task of text classification using automatic methods.",
        "In this paper we describe some initial experiments aimed at validating a basic two dimensional classification of weblog data, first with Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classifiers, then with Pointwise Mutual Information - Information Retrieval (PMI-IR).",
        "The domain of weblog posts is particularly well-suited for this task given its highly subjective nature and the availability of data, including data which has been author-annotated for ‘mood’, which is a reasonable approximation of ‘affect’.",
        "Recent attempts to classify weblog posts have shown modest, but consistent improvements over a 50% baseline, only slightly worse than human performance (Mishne, 2005).",
        "One important milestone is the elaboration of a typology of affective states.",
        "To devise such a typology, our starting point is Figure 1, which is based on a model of emotion as a multicomponent process (Scherer, 1984).",
        "In this model, the distribution of the affective states is the result of analysing similarity judgments by humans for 235 emotion termsl using cluster-analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques to map out the structure as a two-dimensional space.",
        "The positioning of words is not so much controversial as fuzzy; an affective state such as ‘angry’ to describe facial expression in speech may have a slightly different location than an ‘angry’ weblog post.",
        "In this model, the well-studied ‘sentiment’ classification is simply a specific case (left vs. right halves of the space).",
        "The experiments we describe here seek to go beyond this basic distinction.",
        "They involve an additional dimension of affect, the activity dimension, allowing textual data to be classified into four categories corresponding to each of the four quad",
        "rants in the space.",
        "Ultimately, once scores have been ‘promoted’ to real measures, classification can be more precise; for example, a text is not only negative and passive, it is more precisely ‘depressive’.",
        "With such a more precise classification one might, for example, be able to detect individuals at risk of suicide.",
        "In Experiment 1, we use binary classifiers to investigate how the four quadrants defined by the typology hold together, the assumption being that if the typology is correct, the classifiers should perform substantially better than a random baseline.",
        "In Experiment 2, we go a step closer towards a more fine-grained classification by evaluating the performance of an unsupervised automated technique for scoring texts on both axes.",
        "Both these experiments are preliminary – our long term goal is to be able to validate the whole typology in terms of computationally effective classification."

        "In order to do that we need a scoring system for each axis.",
        "In the following experiments we explore the use of such scores and give some insights into how to transform these scores of affect as measures of affect.",
        "Using binary classifiers, we have already established that if we look at the lexical contents of weblog posts tagged according to their mood by their author, these mood classes tend to cluster according to a two-dimensional typology defined by their semantic orientation: positive or negative (evaluation), active or passive (activity).",
        "Beyond academic importance, the typology really becomes of practical interest if we can classify the posts using predefined automated scores for both axis.",
        "One strategy of scoring is to extract phrases, including single words, which are good indicators of subjectivity in texts, and score them according to how they relate or ‘associate’ to one or the other extremity of each axis.",
        "This strategy, called Semantic Orientation (SO) from Association (A) has been used successfully (Turney and Littman, 2003) to classify texts or adjectives of all sorts according to their sentiments (in our typology this corresponds to the evaluation dimension).",

        "We will use this strategy to go further in the validation of our model of affective states by scoring also the activity dimension; to our knowledge, this is the first time this strategy is employed to get (text) scores for dimensions other than evaluation.",
