        "In recent years the automatic text summarization community has increased its focus on reliable evaluation.",
        "The much used evaluation methods based on sentence overlap with reference summaries have been called into question (Mani 2001) as they provide only a rough approximation of semantic similarity between summaries.",
        "A number of deeper, more semantically-motivated approaches have been proposed, such as the factoid method (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003 ) and the pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004).",
        "These methods measure similarity between reference and generated summaries more reliably but, unfortunately, have a disadvantage of being very labour-intensive.",
        "This paper describes experiments in evaluating automatically produced summaries of literary short stories.",
        "It presents an approach that evaluates summaries from two different perspectives: comparing computer-made summaries to those produced by humans based on sentence-overlap and measuring usefulness and informativeness of the summaries by themselves – a step critical when creating and evaluating summaries of a relatively unexplored genre.",
        "The paper also points out several challenges specific to evaluating summaries of fiction such as questionable suitability of traditional metrics (those based on sentence overlap), unavailability of clearly defined criteria to judge “goodness” of a summary and a higher degree of redundancy in such texts.",
        "We achieve these goals by performing a two-step evaluation of our summaries.",
        "Initially, for each story in the test set we compare sentence overlap between summaries which the system generates and those produced by three human subjects.",
        "These experiments reveal that inter-rater agreement measures tend to be pessimistic where fiction is concerned.",
        "This seems due to a higher degree of redundancy and paraphrasing in such texts.",
        "The second stage of the evaluation process seeks to measure usefulness of the summaries in a more tangible way.",
        "To this end, three subjects answered a number of questions, first after",
        "A MATTER OF MEAN ELEVATION.",
        "By O. Henry (1862-1910).",
        "On the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of Don Se–or Johnny Armstrong stood, patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero, Luis.",
        "These articles Don Johnny traded to the interior Indians for the gold dust that they washed from the Andean streams and stored in quills and bags against his coming.",
        "It was a profitable business, and Se–or Armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he coveted.",
        "Armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk, exchanging garbled Spanish with old Peralto, the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for half a gross of pot-metal hatchets, and abridged English with Rucker, the little German who was Consul for the United States.",
        "[ ... ] Armstrong, waved a goodbye and took his place at the tail of the procession.",
        "Armstrong concurred, and they turned again upward toward Tacuzama.",
        "[ ... ] Peering cautiously inside, he saw, within three feet of him, a woman of marvellous, imposing beauty, clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins.",
        "The hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of Indians.",

        "[...] look, Mr. Armstrong, there is the sea!",
        "reading only the summary and then after reading the complete story.",
        "The set included both factual questions (e.g. can you tell where this story takes place?)",
        "and subjective questions (e.g. how readable did you find this summary?).",
        "Finally, we compare the two types of results with a surprising discovery: overlap-based measures and human judgment do not correlate well in our case.",

        "Section 3.1 discusses experiments comparing generated summaries to reference ones based on sentence overlap.",

        "A detailed description of our summarizer of short stories is outside the scope of this paper.",
        "For completeness, this section gives an overview of the system’s inner workings.",
        "An interested reader is referred to our previous work (Kazantseva 2006) for more information.",
        "The system is designed to create a particular type of indicative generic summaries – namely, summaries that would help readers decide whether they would like to read a given story.",
        "Because of this, a summary, as defined here, is not meant to summarize the plot of a story.",
        "It is intended to raise adequate expectations and to enable a reader to make informed decisions based on a summary only.",
        "We achieve this goal by identifying the salient portions of the original texts that lay out the setting of a story, namely, location and main characters.",
        "The present prototype of our system creates summaries by extracting sentences from original documents.",
        "An example summary produced by the system appears in Figure 1.",
        "The system works in two stages.",
        "First it attempts to identify important entities in stories (locations and characters).",
        "Next, sentences that are descriptive and set out the background of a story are separated from those that relate events of the plot.",
        "Finally, the system selects summary-worthy sentences in a way that favours descriptive ones that focus on important entities and occur early in the text.",
        "The identification of important entities is achieved by processing the stories using a gazetteer.",
        "Pronominal and noun phrase anaphora are very common in fiction, so we resolve anaphoric expressions of these two types.",
        "The anaphora resolution module is restricted to resolving singular anaphoric expressions that denote animate entities (people and, sometimes, animals).",
        "The main characters are then identified using normalized frequency counts.",
        "The next stage of the process attempts to identify sentences that set out the background in each story.",
        "The stories are parsed using the Connexor Machinese Syntax Parser (Tapanainen and JŠrvinen 1997) and sentences are split into clauses.",
        "Each clause is represented as a vector of features that approximate its aspectual type.",
        "The features are designed to help identify state clauses (John was a tall man) and serial situations (John always drops things) (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, p. 123-124).",
        "Four groups of features represent each clause: character-related, location-related, aspect-related and others.",
        "Character-related features capture such information as the presence of a mention of one of the main characters in a clause, its syntactic function, how early in the text this mention occurs, etc.",
        "Location-related features state whether a clause contains a location name and whether this name is embedded in a prepositional phrase.",
        "Aspect-related features reflect a number of properties of a clause that influence its aspectual type.",
        "They include the main verb’s lexical aspect, the tense, the presence and the type of temporal expressions, voice, and the presence of modal verbs.",
        "In our experiments we create two separate representations for each clause: fine-grained and coarse-grained.",
        "Both contain features from all four feature groups.",
        "The difference between them is only in the number of features and in the cardinality of the set of possible values.",
        "Two different procedures achieve the actual selection process.",
        "The first procedure performs decision tree induction using C5.0 (Quinlan 1992) to select the most likely candidate sentences.",
        "The training data for this process consists of short stories annotated at the clause-level by the first author of this paper.",
        "The second procedure applies a set of manually created rules to select summary-worthy sentences.",
        "The corpus for the experiments contains 47 short stories from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org) divided into a training set (27 stories) and a test set (20 stories).",
        "These are classical works written in English or translated into English by authors including O.Henry, Jerome K. Jerome, Katherine Mansfield and Anton Chekhov.",
        "They have on average 3,333 tokens and 244 sentences (4.5 letter-sized pages).",
        "The target compression rate was set at 6% counted in sentences.",
        "This rate was selected because it corresponded to the compression rate achieved by the first author when creating initial training and test data."
