        "Over the past several years, question answering (QA) has emerged as a general framework for addressing users’ information needs.",
        "Instead of returning “hits”, as information retrieval systems do, QA systems respond to natural language questions with concise, targeted information.",
        "Recently, research focus has shifted away from so-called factoid questions such as “What are pennies made of?” and “What country is Aswan High Dam located in?” to more complex questions such as “How have South American drug cartels been using banks in Liechtenstein to launder money?” and “What was the Pentagon panel’s position with respect to the dispute over the US Navy training range on the island of Vieques?” – so-called “relationship” and “opinion” questions, respectively.",
        "These complex information needs differ from factoid questions in many important ways.",
        "Unlike factoids, they cannot be answered by named-entities and other short noun phrases.",
        "They do not occur in isolation, but are rather embedded within a broader context, i.e., a “scenario”.",
        "These complex questions set forth parameters of the desired knowledge, which may include additional facts about the motivation of the information seeker, her assumptions, her current state of knowledge, etc.",
        "Presently, most systems that attempt to tackle such complex questions are aimed at serving intelligence analysts, for activities such as counter-terrorism and war-fighting.",
        "Systems for addressing complex information needs are interesting because they provide an opportunity to explore the role of semantic structures in question answering, e.g., (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004).",
        "Opportunities include explicit semantic representations for capturing the content of questions and documents, deep inferential mechanisms (Moldovan et al., 2002), and attempts to model task-specific influences in information-seeking environments (Freund et al., 2005).",
        "Our own interest in question answering falls in line with these recent developments, but we focus on a different type of user – the primary care physician.",
        "The need to answer questions related to patient care at the point of service has been well studied and documented (Gorman et al., 1994; Ely et al., 1999; Ely et al., 2005).",
        "However, research has shown that existing search systems, e.g., PubMed, are often unable to supply clinically-relevant answers in a timely manner (Gorman et al., 1994; Chambliss and Conley, 1996).",
        "Clinical question answering represents a high-impact application that has the potential to improve the quality of medical care.",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics From a research perspective, the clinical domain is attractive because substantial medical knowledge has already been codified in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Lindberg et al., 1993).",
        "This large ontology enables us to explore knowledge-rich techniques and move beyond question answering methods primarily driven by keyword matching.",
        "In this work, we describe a paradigm of medical practice known as evidence-based medicine and explain how it can be computationally captured in a semantic domain model.",

        "EBM is a widely-accepted paradigm for medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature, to make decisions about patient care.",
        "As shown by previous work (De Groote and Dorsch, 2003), citations from the MEDLINE database maintained by the National Library of Medicine serve as a good source of evidence.",
        "Thus, we conceive of clinical question answering systems as fulfilling a decision-support role by retrieving highly-relevant MEDLINE abstracts in response to a clinical question.",
        "This represents a departure from previous systems, which focus on extracting short text segments from larger sources.",
        "The implications of making potentially life-altering decisions mean that all evidence must be carefully examined in context.",
        "For example, the efficacy of a drug in treating a disease is always framed in the context of a specific study on a sample population, over a set duration, at some fixed dosage, etc.",
        "The physician simply cannot recommend a particular course of action without considering all these complex factors.",
        "Thus, an “answer” without adequate support is not useful.",
        "Given that a MEDLINE abstract – on the order of 250 words, equivalent to a long paragraph – generally encapsulates the context of a clinical study, it serves as a logical answer unit and an entry point to the information necessary to answer the physician’s question (e.g., via drill-down to full text articles).",
        "In order for a clinical QA system to be successful, it must be suitably integrated into the daily activities of a physician.",
        "Within a clinic or a hospital setting, the traditional desktop application is not the most ideal interface for a retrieval system.",
        "In most cases, decisions about patient care must be made by the bedside.",
        "Thus, a PDA is an ideal vehicle for delivering question answering capabilities (Hauser et al., 2004).",
        "However, the form factor and small screen size of such devices places constraints on system design.",
        "In particular, since the physician is unable to view large amounts of text, precision is of utmost importance.",
        "In summary, this section outlines considerations for question answering in the clinical domain: the necessity of contextualized answers, the rationale for adopting MEDLINE abstract as the response unit, and the importance of high precision."
