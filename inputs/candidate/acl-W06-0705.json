We expect that the meaning of an information-seeking scenario S can be represented as a question under discussion (QUD) Qs, which denotes a partially-ordered set of subquestions (q E Qs) that represent the entire set of questions that could potentially be asked in order to gather information relevant to S. Taken together, we expect these subquestions to represent the widest possible con-strual of a user’s information need given S. ering information related to a scenario.",
        "Based on these assumptions, we expect that the set of text passages that are textually entailed by subquestions derived from a scenario represent information that is more likely to be relevant to the overall topic of the scenario as a whole.",
        "We expect that there are three types of contextual entailment relationships that could prove useful for automatic Q/A systems.",
        "First, as illustrated in Case 1 in 1, CE could exist between a scenario and one of the set of answers returned by a Q/A system in response to a user’s question.",

        "Finally, as in Case 3, CE could be established both between a scenario and a user’s question as well as between a scenario and one of the answers returned by the Q/A system for that question.",
        "Figure 2 provides examples of each of these three types of contextual entailment using the scenario presented in Figure 1.",
        "We believe the set of subquestions implied by Qs can be used to test whether a text passage is relevant to S. Since the formal answerhood relation between a question and its answer(s) can be cast in terms of (logical) entailment (Groe-nendijk, 1999; Lewis, 1988), we believe that systems for recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2005) could be used in order to identify those text passages that should be considered when gath-In Case 1, the scenario textually entails the meaning of the answer passage, as earnings growth from outsourcing necessarily represents one of the types of economic advantages that can be derived from outsourcing.",

        "scenario-relevant information that is encountered – even when the user asks questions that are not entailed by the scenario itself.",
        "We expect that this type of contextual entailment would allow systems to identify scenario-relevant knowledge throughout a user’s interaction with a system, regardless of topic of a user’s last query.",
        "In Case 2, the user’s question is entailed by the scenario, but no corresponding entailment relationship can be established between the scenario and the answer passage identified by the Q/A system as an answer to the question.",
        "While political support may be interpretable as one of the benefits realized by companies that outsource, it cannot be understood as one of the economic advantages of outsourcing.",
        "Here, recognizing that contextual entailment could not be established between the scenario and the answer – but could be established between the scenario and the question – could be used to signal the Q/A system to consider additional answers before moving on to the user’s next question.",
        "By identifying contextual entailment relationships between answers and elements in a scenario, systems could perform valuable forms of answer validation that could be used to select only the most relevant answers for a user’s consideration.",
        "Finally, in Case 3, entailment relationships exist between the scenario and both the user’s question and the returned answer, as saving $25 million can be considered to be both an economic advantage and one of the ways that companies profit from outsourcing.",
        "In this case, the establishment of contextual entailment could be used to inform topic models that could be used to identify and extract other similarly relevant passages for the user.",
        "In order to capture these three types of CE relationships, we developed the architecture for recognizing contextual entailment illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "This architecture includes three basic types of modules: (1) a Context Discovery module, which identifies passages relevant to the concepts mentioned in a scenario, (2) a Textual Entailment module, which recognizes implicational relationships between passages, and (3) a Entailment Merging module, which ranks relevant passages according to their relevance to the scenario itself.",

        "Here, logistic regression is used to find a set of coefficients bj (where 0 < j < p) in order to fit a variable x to a logistic transformation of a probability q.",
