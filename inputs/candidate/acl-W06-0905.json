        "In recent years, inspired by the success of MUC evaluations, a growing number of initiatives (e.g. TREC1, CLEF2, CoNLL3, Senseval4) have been developed to boost research towards the automatic understanding of textual data.",
        "Since 1999, the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program5 has been contributing to broaden the varied scenario of evaluation campaigns by proposing three main",

        "In 2004, the Timex2 Detection and Recognition task6 (also known as TERN, for Time Expression Recognition and Normalization) has been added to the ACE program, making the whole evaluation exercise more complete.",
        "The main goal of the task was to foster research on systems capable of automatically detecting temporal expressions (TEs) present in an English text, and normalizing them with respect to a specifically defined annotation standard.",
        "Within the above mentioned evaluation exercises, the research activity on monolingual tasks has gradually been complemented by a considerable interest towards multilingual and cross-language capabilities of NLP systems.",
        "This trend confirms how portability across languages has now become one of the key challenges for Natural Language Processing research, in the effort of breaking the language barrier hampering systems’ application in many real use scenarios.",
        "In this direction, machine learning techniques have become the standard approach in many NLP areas.",
        "This is motivated by several reasons, including i) the fact that considerable amounts of annotated data, indispensable to train ML-based algorithms, are now available for many tasks, and ii) the difficulty, inherent to rule-based approaches, of porting language models from one language to new ones.",
        "In fact, while supervised ML algorithms can be easily extended to new languages given an annotated training corpus, rule-based approaches require to redefine the set of rules, adapting them to each new language.",
        "This is a time consuming and costly work, as it usually consists in manually rewriting from scratch huge amounts of rules.",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics In spite of their effectiveness for some tasks, ML techniques still fall short from providing effective solutions for others.",
        "This is confirmed by the outcomes of the TERN 2004 evaluation, which provide a clear picture of the situation.",
        "In spite of the good results obtained in the TE recognition task (Hacioglu et al., 2005), the normalization by means of ML techniques has not been tackled yet, and still remains an unresolved problem.",
        "Considering the inadequacy of ML techniques to deal with the normalization problem, and focusing on portability across languages, this paper extends and completes the previous work presented in (Saquete et al., 2006b) and (Saquete et al., 2006a).",
        "More specifically, we address the following crucial issue: how to minimize the costs of building a rule-based TE recognition system for a new language, given an already existing system for another language.",
        "Our goal is to experiment with different automatic porting procedures to build temporal models for new languages, starting from previously defined ones.",
        "Still adhering to the rule-based paradigm, we analyse different porting methodologies that automatically learn the TE recognition model used by the system in one language, adjusting the set of normalization rules for the new target language.",

        "Basically (see Figure 1), the TE recognition and normalization process is carried out in two phases.",

        "On the one hand, absolute TEs directly provide and fully describe a date.",
        "On the other hand, relative TEs require some degree of reasoning (as in the case of anaphora resolution).",
        "In the second phase of the process, in order to translate these expressions into their normalized form, the lexical context in which they occur is considered.",
        "At this stage, a normalization unit is in charge of determining the appropriate reference date (anchor) associated to each anaphoric TE, calculating its value, and finally generating the corresponding TIMEX2 tag.",
