        "In this paper we present an application fostering the integration and interoperability of computational lexicons, focusing on the particular case of mutual linking and cross-lingual enrichment of two wordnets.",
        "The development of this application is intended as a case-study and a test-bed for trying out needs and requirements posed by the challenge of semi-automatic integration and enrichment of practical, large-scale multilingual lexicons for use in computer applications.",
        "While a number of lexicons already exist, few of them are practically useful, either since they are not sufficiently broad or because they don’t cover the necessary level of detailed information.",
        "Moreover, multilingual language resources are not as widely available and are very costly to construct: the work process for manual development of new lexical resources or for tailoring existing ones is too expensive in terms of effort and time to be practically attractive.",
        "The need of ever growing lexical resources for effective multilingual content processing has urged the language resource community to call for a radical change in the perspective of language resource creation and maintenance and the design of a “new generation” of LRs: from static, closed and locally developed resources to shared and distributed language services, based on open content interoperability standards.",
        "This has often been called a “change in paradigm” (in the sense of Kuhn, see Calzolari and Soria, 2005; Calzolari 2006).",
        "Leaving aside the tantalizing task of building on-site resources, the new paradigm depicts a scenario where lexical resources are cooperatively built as the result of controlled cooperation of different agents, adopting the paradigm of accumulation of knowledge so successful in more mature disciplines, such as biology and physics (Calzolari, 2006).",
        "According to this view (or, better, this vision), different lexical resources reside over distributed places and can not only be accessed but choreographed by agents presiding the actions that can be executed over them.",
        "This implies the ability to build on each other achievements, to merge results, and to have them accessible to various systems and applications.",
        "At the same time, there is another argument in favor of distributed lexical resources: language resources, lexicons included, are inherently distributed because of the diversity of languages distributed over the world.",
        "It is not only natural that language resources to be developed and maintained in their native environment.",
        "Since language evolves and changes over time, it is not possible to describe the current state of the lan",
        "guage away from where the language is spoken.",
        "Lastly, the vast range of diversity of languages also makes it impossible to have one single universal centralized resource, or even a centralized repository of resources.",
        "Although the paradigm of distributed and interoperable lexical resources has largely been discussed and invoked, very little has been made in comparison for the development of new methods and techniques for its practical realization.",
        "Some initial steps are made to design frameworks enabling inter-lexica access, search, integration and operability.",
        "An example is the Lexus tool (Kemps-Snijders et al., 2006), based on the Lexical Markup Framework (Romary et al., 2006), that goes in the direction of managing the exchange of data among large-scale lexical resources.",
        "A similar tool, but more tailored to the collaborative creation of lexicons for endangered language, is SHAWEL (Gulrajani and Harrison, 2002).",
        "However, the general impression is that little has been made towards the development of new methods and techniques for attaining a concrete interoperability among lexical resources.",
        "Admittedly, this is a long-term scenario requiring the contribution of many different actors and initiatives (among which we only mention standardisation, distribution and international cooperation).",
        "Nevertheless, the intent of our project is to contribute to fill in this gap, by exploring in a controlled way the requirement and implications posed by new generation multilingual lexical resources.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the general architectural design of our project; section 3 describes the module taking care of cross-lingual integration of lexical resources, by also presenting a case-study involving an Italian and Chinese lexicons.",
        "Finally, section 4 presents our considerations and lessons learned on the basis of this exploratory testing."

        "LeXFlow (Soria et al., 2006) was developed having in mind the long-term goal of lexical resource interoperability.",
        "In a sense, LeXFlow is intended as a proof of concept attempting to make the vision of an infrastructure for access and sharing of linguistic resources more tangible.",
        "LeXFlow is an adaptation to computational lexicons of XFlow, a cooperative web application for the management of document workflows (DW, Marchetti et al., 2005).",
        "A DW can be seen as a process of cooperative authoring where a document can be the goal of the process or just a side effect of the cooperation.",
        "Through a DW, a document life-cycle is tracked and supervised, continually providing control over the actions leading to document compilation.",
        "In this environment a document travels among agents who essentially carry out the pipeline receive-process-send activity.",
        "There are two types of agents: external agents are human or software actors performing activities dependent from the particular Document Workflow Type; internal agents are software actors providing general-purpose activities useful for many DWTs and, for this reason, implemented directly into the system.",
        "Internal agents perform general functionalities such as creating/converting a document belonging to a particular DW, populating it with some initial data, duplicating a document to be sent to multiple agents, splitting a document and sending portions of information to different agents, merging duplicated documents coming from multiple agents, aggregating fragments, and finally terminating operations over the document.",
        "External agents basically execute some processing using the document content and possibly other data; for instance, accessing an external database or launching an application.",
        "LeXFlow was born by tailoring XFlow to management of lexical entries; in doing so, we have assumed that each lexical entry can be modelled as a document instance, whose behaviour can be formally specified by means of a lexical workflow type (LWT).",
        "A LWT describes the life-cycle of a lexical entry, the agents allowed to act over it, the actions to be performed by the agents, and the order in which the actions are to be executed.",
        "Embracing the view of cooperative workflows, agents can have different rights or views over the same entry: this nicely suits the needs of lexicographic work, where we can define different roles (such as encoder, annotator, validator) that can be played by either human or software agents.",
        "Other software modules can be inserted in the flow, such as an automatic acquirer of information from corpora or from the web.",
        "Moreover, deriving from a tool designed for the cooperation of agents, LeXFlow allows to manage workflows where the different agents can reside over distributed places.",
        "LeXFlow thus inherits from XFlow the general design and architecture, and can be considered as a specialized version of it through design",
        "of specific Lexical Workflow Types and plug-in of dedicated external software agents.",
        "In the next section we briefly illustrate a particular Lexical Workflow Type and the external software agents developed for the purpose of integrating different lexicons belonging to the same language.",
        "Since it allows the independent and coordinated sharing of actions over portions of lexicons, LeXFlow naturally lends itself as a tool for the management of distributed lexical resources.",
        "Due to its versatility, LeXFlow is both a general framework where ideas on automatic lexical resource integration can be tested and an infrastructure for proving new methods for cooperation among lexicon experts."

        "In particular, a Lexical Workflow Type was designed where the two different monolingual semantic lexicons interact by reciprocally enriching themselves and moreover integrate information coming from corpora.",
        "This LWT, called “lexicon augmentation”, explicitly addresses dynamic augmentation of semantic lexicons.",
        "In this scenario, an entry of a lexicon A becomes enriched via basically two steps.",
        "First, by virtue of being mapped onto a corresponding entry belonging to a lexicon B, the entryA inherits the semantic relations available in the mapped en-tryB.",
        "Second, by resorting to an automatic application that acquires information about semantic relations from corpora, the acquired relations are integrated into the entry and proposed to the human encoder.",
        "An overall picture of the flow is shown in Figure 1, illustrating the different agents participating in the flow.",
        "Rectangles represent human actors over the entries, while the other figures symbolize software agents: ovals are internal agents and octagons external ones.",
        "The two external agents involved in this flow are the “relation calculator” and the “corpora extractor”.",
        "The first is responsible for the mapping between the sets of semantic relations used by the different lexicons.",
        "The “corpora extractor” module invokes an application that acquires information",
        "about part-of relations by identifying syntactic constructions in a vast Italian corpus.",
        "It then takes care of creating the appropriate candidate semantic relations for each lemma that is proposed by the application.",

        "In the Multilingual WN Service, only equivalence relations of type EQ_SYNONYM and EQ_NEAR_SYNONYM have been taken into account, being them the ones used to represent a translation of concepts and also because they are the most exploited (for example, in IWN, they cover about the 60% of the encoded equivalence relations).",
        "The EQ_SYNONYM relation is used to realize the one-to-one mapping between the language-specific synset and the ILI, while multiple EQ_NEAR_SYNONYM relations (because of their nature) might be encoded to link a single language-specific synset to more than one ILI record.",
        "In Figure 4 we represented the possible relevant combinations of equivalence relations that can realize the mapping between synsets belonging to two languages.",

        "Our proposal to make distributed wordnets interoperable has the following applications in processing of lexical resources: • Enriching existing resources: information is often not complete in any given wordnet: by making two wordnets interoperable, we can bootstrap semantic relations and other information from other wordnets.",
        "• Creation of new resources: multilingual",
        "lexicons can be bootstrapped by linking different language wordnets through ILI.",
        "• Validation of existing resources: seman",
        "tic relation information and other synset assignments can be validated when it is reinforced by data from a different wordnet.",
        "In particular, our work can be proposed as a prototype of a web application that would support the Global WordNet Grid initiative (www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/gwa_grid.htm).",
        "Any multilingual process, such as cross-lingual information retrieval, must involve both resources and tools in a specific language and language pairs.",
        "For instance, a multilingual query given in Italian but intended for querying English, Chinese, French, German, and Russian texts, can be send to five different nodes on the Grid for query expansion, as well as performing the query itself.",
        "In this way, language specific query techniques can be applied in parallel to achieve best results that can be integrated in the future.",
        "As multilingualism clearly becomes one of the major challenges of the future of web-based knowledge engineering, WordNet emerges as one leading candidate for a shared platform for representing a lexical knowledge model for different languages of the world.",
        "This is true even if it has to be recognized that the wordnet model is lacking in some important semantic information (like, for instance, a way to represent the semantic predicate).",
        "However, such knowledge and resources are distributed.",
        "In order to create a shared multilingual knowledge base for cross-lingual processing based on these distributed resources, an initiative to create a grid-like structure has been recently proposed and promoted by the Global WordNet Association, but until now has remained a wishful thinking.",
        "The success of this initiative will depend on whether there will be tools to access and manipulate the rich internal semantic structure of distributed multilingual WordNets.",
        "We believe that our work on LeXFlow offers such a tool to provide interoperable web-services to access distributed multilingual WordNets on the grid.",
        "This allows us to exploit in a cross-lingual framework the wealth of monolingual lexical information built in the last decade."
