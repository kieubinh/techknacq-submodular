        "The member states speak four different languages, namely French, German, Italian, and Slovene and have different legal systems and traditions.",
        "Hence arises the need for a systematization and uniformation of terminology and clear translation equivalence in all four languages.",
        "For this reason, the project intends to provide all",
        "stakeholders and the wider public with an information system which combines three main co m-ponents, a terminology data base, a multilingual corpus and the relative bibliographic data base.",
        "In this way the manually revised, elaborated and validated (harmonised) quadrilingual information on the legal terminology (i.e. complete terminological entries) will be closely interacting with a facility to dynamically search for additional contexts in a relevant set of legal texts in all languages and for all main legal systems involved."

        "Again by means of pull-down menus the terminologist will be able to signal to the users which terms are already processed (i.e. checked by legal experts), harmonised or rejected and - most important - to which legal system they belong (the menu geographical usage allows to specify this information).",
        "Furthermore it is possible to specify synonyms, short forms, abbreviations etc.",
        "in the terminological entry and, if nece ssary, link them to the relative full information already present in the term bank (however, no direct access to these linked data is possible, this must be done via the search interface).",
        "Finally, the terminologist is given the possibility of writing general comments to the entry.",
        "At the very end of one language entry the terminologist can decide whether to release the data to the public (by clicking on the button ‘finish’) or keep it for further fine-tuning (button ‘update’).",
        "Each term is created in its ‘language volume’ and described by means of all necessary information.",
        "As soon as one or all equivalents in the other languages are available too, the single entries can be linked to each other with the help of an axie (see detailed description below).",
        "Searches can be done for all languages or on a user-defined selection of source and target languages.",

        "Results can be displayed in full form, as a short list of terms only or in XML.",
        "Some export/import functions are granted.",
        "As the term bank serves mainly the scope of diffusing harmonised terminology, the four translation equivalents (validated by a group of experts) are displayed together, whereas rejected synonyms are displayed separately for each search language.",

        "Finally, building bilingual volumes between the French and Italian legal systems is far beyond the objectives of the LexALP project.",
        "Another solution would be to use an “Eu-rowordnet like” approach (Vossen, 1998) where a specific language/legal system is used as a pivot and elements of the other systems are linked by equivalent or near-equivalent links.",
        "As such an approach artificially puts a language in the pivot position, it generally leads to an “ethnocentric” view of the other languages.",
        "The advantage being that the architecture uses the bilingual competence of lexicographers to achieve multilingualism.",
        "In this project, we chose to use ‘interlingual acceptions’ (a.k.a.",
        "axies) as defined in (S6rasset, 1994) to represent such complex contrastive phenomena as generally described in general lexicography work.",
        "In this approach, each ‘term meaning’ is associated to an interlingual acception (or axie).",
        "These axies are used to achieve interoperability as a pivot linking terms of different languages bearing the same meaning.",
        "However, as we are dealing with legal terms (bound to different legal systems), it is generally not possible to find terms in different languages that bear the same meaning.",
        "In fact such terms can only be found in the Alpine Convention (which is considered as a legal system expressed in all the considered languages).",
        "Hence, we use these terms to achieve interoperability between languages.",
        "In this aspect, we are close to Eu-rowordnet’s approach as we use a specific legal system as a pivot, but in our case the pivot itself is generally a quadrilingual set of entries.",
