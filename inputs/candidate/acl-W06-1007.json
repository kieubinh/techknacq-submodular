        "Our demonstration of the value of lexical systems is centered around an experiment of lexical system generation that was performed using data tables extracted from the DiCo database of French paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical links.",
        "This experiment has allowed us to produce a lexical system that is a richer structure than the original database it has been derived from.",

        "Section 3 illustrates the functioning of lexical systems with data borrowed from the French DiCo database; this will show that lexical systems – that are basically net-like – are interoperable structures in respect to the information they can easily encode and the wide range of applications for which they can function as lexical resources.",
        "Section 4 describes how the generation of a lexical system from the French DiCo database has been implemented.",
        "Finally, in section 5, we address the problem of using lexical systems for feeding multilingual databases."

        "Dictionary-like databases as texts The most straightforward way of building lexical databases is to use standard dictionaries (i.e. books) and turn them into electronic entities.",
        "It is the approach taken by most publishing companies (e.g. American Heritage (2000)), with various degrees of sophistication.",
        "Resulting products",
        "can be termed dictionary-like databases.",
        "They are mainly characterized by two features.",
        "• They are made up of word (word sense) descriptions, called dictionary entries.",
        "• Dictionary entries can be seen as “texts,” in the most general sense.",
        "Consequently, dictionary-like databases are before all huge texts, consisting of a collection of much smaller texts (i.e. entries).",
        "It seems natural to consider electronic versions of standard dictionaries as texts.",
        "However, formal lexical databases such as the multilingual XML-based JMDict (Breen, 2004) are also textual in nature.",
        "There are collections of entries, each entry consisting of a structured text that “tells us something” about a word.",
        "Even databases encoding relational models of the lexicon can be 100% textual, and therefore dictionary-like.",
        "Such is the case of the French DiCo database (Polguère, 2000), that we have used for compiling our lexical system.",
        "As we will see later, the original DiCo database is nothing but a collection of lexicographic records, each record being subdivided into fields that are basically small texts.",
        "Although the DiCo is built within the framework of Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’čuk et al., 1995) and concentrates on the description of lexical links, it is clearly not designed as a “-Net” database, in the sense of WordNet or FrameNet.",
        "Net-like databases as graphs Most lexical models, even standard dictionaries, are relational in nature.",
        "For instance, all dictionaries define words in terms of other words, use pointers such as ‘Synonym’ and ‘Antonym.’ However, their structure does not reflect their relational nature.",
        "The situation is totally different with true net-like databases.",
        "They can be characterized as follows.",
        "• They are graphs – huge sets of connected entities – rather than collections of small texts (entries).",
        "• They are not necessarily centered around words, or word senses.",
        "They use as nodes a potentially heterogeneous set of lexical or, more generally, linguistic entities.",
        "Net-like databases are, for many, the most suitable knowledge structures for modeling lexica.",
        "Nevertheless, databases such as WordNet pose one major problem: they are inherently structured according to a couple of hierarchizing and/or classifying principles.",
        "WordNet, for instance, is semantically-oriented and imposes a hierarchical organization of lexical entities based, first of all, on two specific semantic relations: synonymy – through the grouping of lexical meanings within synsets – and hypernymy.",
        "Additionally, the part of speech classification of lexical units creates a strict partition of the database: WordNet is made up of four separate synset hierarchies (for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs).",
        "We do not believe lexical models should be designed following a few rigid principles that impose a hierarchization or classification of data.",
        "Such structuring is of course extremely useful, even necessary, but should be projected “on demand” onto lexical models.",
        "Furthermore, there should not be a predefined, finite set of potential structuring principles; data structures should welcome any of them, and this is precisely one of the main characteristics of lexical systems, that will be presented shortly (section 2.2).",
        "Texts vs. graphs: pros and cons It is essential to stress the fact that any dictionary-like database can be turned into a net-like database and vice versa.",
        "Of course, dictionary-like databases that rely on relational models are more compatible with graph encoding.",
        "However, there are always relational data in dictionaries, and such data can be extracted and “reformatted” in the form of nodes and connecting links.",
        "The important issue is therefore not one of exclusive choice between the two types of structures; it concerns what each structure is better at.",
        "In our opinion, the specialization of each type of structure is as follows.",
        "Dictionary-like structures are tools for editing (writing) and consulting lexical information.",
        "Linguistic intuition of lexicographers or users of lexical models performs best on texts.",
        "Both lexicographers and users need to be able to see the whole picture about words, and need the entry format at a certain stage – although other ways of displaying lexical information, such as tables, are extremely useful too!",
        "1 Net-like structures are tools for implementing dynamic aspects of lexica: wading through lexical knowledge, adding to it, revising it or infer",
        "ring information from it.",
        "Consequently, net-like databases are believed by some (and we share this opinion) to have some form of cognitive validity.",
        "They are compatible with observations made, for instance, in Aitchison (2003) on the network nature of the mental lexicon.",
        "Last but not least, net-like databases can more easily integrate other lexical structures or be integrated by them.",
        "In conclusion, although both forms of structures are compatible at a certain level and have their own advantages in specific contexts of use, we are particularly interested by the fact that net-like databases are more prone to live an “organic life” in terms of evolution (addition, subtraction, replacement) and interaction with other data structures (connection with models of other languages, with grammars, etc.",

      "text": [
        "As mentioned above, most net-like lexical databases seem to focus on the description of just a few properties of natural language lexica (quasi-synonymy, hypernymic organization of word senses, predicative structures and their syntactic expression, etc.).",
        "Consequently, developers of these databases often have to gradually “stretch” their models in order to add the description of new types of phenomena, that were not of primary concern at the onset.",
        "It is legitimate to expect that such graft of new components will leave scars on the initial design of lexical models.",
        "The lexical structures we propose, lexical systems (hereafter LS), do not pose this type of problem for two reasons.",
        "First, they are not oriented towards the modeling of just a few specific lexical phenomena, but originate from a global vision of the lexicon as central component of linguistic knowledge.",
        "Second, they have a very simple, flat organization, that does not impose any hierarchical or classifying structure on the lexicon.",
        "Let us explain how it works.",
        "The design of any given LS has to follow four basic principles, that cannot be tampered with: LSs are 1) pure directed graphs, 2) non-hierarchical, 3) heterogeneous and 4) equipped for modeling fuzziness of lexical knowledge.",
        "We will briefly examine each of these principles.",
        "Pure directed graph.",
        "An LS is a directed graph, and just that.",
        "This means that, from a formal point of view, it is uniquely made up of nodes and oriented links connecting these nodes.",
        "Non hierarchical.",
        "An LS is a non-hierarchical structure, although it can contain sets of nodes that are hierarchically connected.",
        "For instance, we will see later that the DiCo LS contains nodes that correspond to a hierarchically organized set of semantic labels.",
        "The hierarchy of DiCo semantic labels can be used to project a structured perspective on the LS; but the LS itself is by no means organized according to one or more specific hierarchies.",
        "Heterogeneous.",
        "An LS is a potentially heterogeneous collection of nodes.",
        "Three main families of nodes can be found:",
        "• genuine lexical entities such as lexemes, idioms, wordforms, etc.",
        "; • quasi-lexical entities, such as collocations, lexical functions,2 free expressions worth storing in the lexicon (e.g. “canned” linguistic examples), etc.",
        "; • lexico-grammatical entities, such as syntactic patterns of expression of semantic actants, grammatical features, etc.",
        "Prototypical LS nodes are first of all lexical entities, but we have to expect LSs to contain as nodes entities that do not strictly belong to the lexicon: they can belong to the interface between the lexicon and the grammar of the language.",
        "Such is the case of subcategorization frames, called government patterns in Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology.",
        "As rules specifying patterns of syntactic structures, they belong to the grammar of the language.",
        "However, as preassem-bled constructs on which lexemes “sit” in sentences, they are clearly closer to the lexical realm of the language than rules for building passive sentences or handling agreements, for instance.",
        "With fuzziness.",
        "Each component of an LS, whether node or link, carries a trust value, i.e. a measure of its validity.",
        "Clearly, there are many ways of attributing and handling trust values in order to implement fuzziness in knowledge structures.",
        "For instance, in our experiments with the DiCo LS, we have adopted a simplistic approach, that was satisfactory for our present needs but should become more elaborate as we proceed with developing and using LSs.",
        "In our present implementation, we make use of only three possible trust values: “1” means that as far as we can tell – i.e.",
        "trusting what is explicitly asserted in the DiCo – the information is correct; “0.5” means 2 On collocations and lexical functions, see section 3 below.",
        "that the corresponding information is the result of an inference made from the input data and was not explicitly asserted by lexicographers; “0” means that the information ought to be incorrect – for instance, in case we identified a bogus lexical pointer in data imported from the DiCo.",
        "Fuzziness encoding is an essential feature of LSs, as structures on which inference can take place or as structures that are, at least partially, inferred from others (in case of generation of LSs from existing lexical databases).",
        "Of course, any trust value is not absolute.",
        "“1” does not mean the information is valid no matter what, and “0” that it is necessarily false.",
        "Information in LSs, and the rating of this information, is no more absolute than any information that may be stored in some-one’s mental lexicon.",
        "However, if we want to compute on LSs’ content, it is essential to be able to distinguish between data we have all reasons to believe to be true and data we have all reasons to believe to be false.",
        "As a matter of fact, this feature of LSs has helped us in two ways while compiling the DiCo LS: (i) we were able to infer new descriptions from data contained in the original DiCo while keeping track of the inferred nature of this new information (that ought to be validated); (ii) we kept record of incoherences found in the DiCo by attributing a trust value of 0 to the corresponding elements in the LS.",
        "It is now high time to give concrete examples of LS data.",
        "But before we proceed, let us emphasize the fact that no other formal devices than those that have just been introduced are allowed in LSs.",
        "Anything else we may want to add must be relevant to other components of the linguistic model, to the grammar for instance.",
        "Notice, however, that we do not exclude the need to add a measure of the relative “weight” of nodes and links.",
        "This measure, different from the trust value, would reflect the degree of activation of each LS element.",
        "For instance, the DiCo entry for DÉFAITE ‘defeat’ lists quite a few support verbs that take this noun as complement, among which CONNAÎTRE ‘to know’ and SUBIR ‘to suffer.’ Weight values could indicate that the former verb is much less commonly used than the second in this context.",
        "Another advantage of weight is that it could help optimize navigation through the LS graph, when several paths can be taken."

        "The DiCo is a French lexical database that focuses on the modeling of paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical links controlled by lexical units.",

        "Syntagmatic links corresponds to collocations controlled by lexical units (intensifiers, support verbs, etc.).",
        "These lexical properties are encoded by means of a system of metalexical entities known as lexical functions.",
        "(For a presentation of the system of lexical functions, see Mel’čuk (1996) and Kahane and Polguère (2001).)",
        "Although it does not contain actual definitions, the DiCo partially describes the semantic content of each lexical unit with two formal tools: (i) a semantic label, that corresponds to the genus (core component) of the lexical unit’s definition and (ii) a “propositional formula,” which states the predicative nature of the unit (non-predicative meaning or predicate with one, two or more arguments).",
        "Each entry also gives the government pattern (roughly, the subcategorization frame) of the unit and lists idioms (phrasal lexical units) that contain the unit under description.",
        "Finally, each entry contains a set of examples retrieved from corpora or the Internet.",
        "As one can see, the DiCo covers a fairly large range of lexical properties; for more information on the DiCo, one can refer to Polguère (2000) and Lareau (2002).",
        "Presently, the DiCo is developed as a File-Maker® database.",
        "Each DiCo entry corresponds to a record in the database, and the core of each record is the field that contains lexical function links controlled by the headword (i.e. the lexical unit described in the entry).",

        "the Ope r 12 lexical function to its argument (the headword of the entry).",
        "• The preceding formula – between the two /* ... */ symbols – is a gloss for Oper12(RANCUNE).",

        "• Following the name of the lexical function is the list of values of the lexical function application, each of which is a specific lexical entity.",
        "In this case, they are all collocates of the headword, due to the syntagmatic nature of Oper12.",
        "• Finally, the expression between square brackets is the description of the syntactic structure controlled by the collocates.",
        "It corresponds to a special case of lexico-grammatical entities mentioned earlier in section 2.2.",
        "These entities have not been processed yet in our LS and they will be ignored in the discussion below.",
        "This graph shows how DiCo data given in (1) have been modeled in terms of lexical entities and links.",
        "We see that lexical function applications are lexical entities: something to be communicated, that is pointing to actual means of expressing it.",
        "The argument (arg link) of the lexical function application, the lexical unit RANCUNE, is of course also a lexical entity (although of a different nature).",
        "The same holds for the values (value links).",
        "None of these values, however, has been diagnosed as possessing a corresponding entry in the DiCo.",

        "5, visualized here by boxes with hashed borders.",
        "(Continuous lines for links or boxes indicate a trust value of 1.)",
        "Ultimately, it will be the task of lexicographers to add to the DiCo entries for the corresponding senses of AVOIR, ÉPROUVER, NOURRIR and RESSENTIR.",
        "One may be surprised to see lexical functions (such as Oper1) appear as lexical entities in our LS, because of their very “abstract” nature.",
        "Two facts justify this approach.",
        "First, lexical units too are rather abstract entities.",
        "While wordforms horse and horses could be considered as more “concrete,” their grouping under a label HORSE lexical unit is not a trivial abstraction.",
        "Second, lexical functions are not only descriptive tools in Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology.",
        "They are also conceptualized as generalization of lexical units that play an important role text production, in general rules of paraphrase for instance.",
        "This first illustration demonstrates how the LS version of the DiCo reflects its true relational nature, contrary to its original dictionary-like format as a FileMaker database.",
        "It also shows how varied lexical entities can be and how trust values can help keep track of the distinction between what has been explicitly stated by lexicographers and what can be inferred from what they stated.",
        "The next illustration will build on the first one and show how so-called non-standard lexical functions are integrated into the LS.",
        "Until now, we have been referring only to standard lexical functions, i.e. lexical functions that belong to the small universal core of lexical relations identified in Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (or, more generally, in Meaning-Text theory).",
        "However, all paradigmatic and syntagmatic links are not necessarily standard.",
        "Here is an illustration, borrowed from the DiCo entry for CHAT ‘cat’.",

        "The LS interpretation of (2) is therefore a simpler structure than the",
        "Our last illustration will show how it is possible to project a hierarchical structuring on the DiCo LS when, and only when, it is needed.",
        "The hierarchy of semantic labels used to semantically characterize lexical units in the DiCo has been compiled into the DiCo LS together with the lexical database proper.",
        "Each semantic label is connected to its more generic label or labels (as this hierarchy allows for multiple inheritance) with an i s_a link.",
        "Additionally, it is connected to the lexical units it labels by label links.",
        "It is thus possible to simply pull the hierarchy of semantic labels out of the LS and it will “fish out” all lexical units of the LS, hierarchically organized through hypernymy.",
        "Notice that this is different from extracting from the DiCo all lexical units that possess a specific semantic label: we extract all units whose semantic label belongs to a given subhierarchy in the system of semantic labels.",
        "Figure 3 below is the graphical result of pulling the acces-soire (‘accessory’) subhierarchy.",
        "To avoid using labels on links, we have programmed the generation of this class of GraphML structures with links encoded as follows: i s_a links (between semantic labels) appear as thick continuous arrows and label links (between semantic labels and lexical units they label) as thin dotted arrows.",
        "The “beauty” of LSs’ structuring does not lie in the fact that it allows us to automatically generate fancy graphical representations.",
        "Such representations are just a convenient way to make explicit the internal structure of LSs.",
        "What really interests us is what can be done with LSs once we consider them from a functional perspective.",
        "The main functional advantage of LSs lies in the fact that these structures are both cannibal and prone to be cannibalized.",
        "Let us explain the two facets of this somehow gruesome metaphor.",
        "First, directed graphs are powerful structures that can encode virtually any kind of information and are particularly suited for lexical knowledge.",
        "If one believes that a lexicon is before all a relational entity, we can postulate that all information present in any form of dictionary and database can eventually be compiled into LS structures.",
        "The experiment we did in compiling the DiCo (see details in section 4) demonstrates well enough this property of LS structures.",
        "Second, because of their extreme simplicity, LS structures can conversely always be “digested” by other, more specific types of structures, such as XML versions of dictionary or net-like databases.",
        "For instance, we have regenerated from our LS a DiCo in HTML format, with hyperlinks for entry cross-references and color-coding for trust values of linguistic information.",
        "Interestingly, this HTML by-product of the LS",
        "contains entries that do not exist in the original DiCo.",
        "They are produced for each value of lexical function applications that does not correspond to an entry in the DiCo.",
        "The content of these entries is made up of “inverse” lexical function relations: pointers to lexical function applications for which the lexical entity is a value.",
        "These new entries can be seen as rough drafts, that can be used by lexicographers to write new entries.",

        "with the DiCo a hierarchy of semantic labels used by the DiCo lexicographers, which allows us to establish hypernymic links between lexical units, as shown in Figure 3 above.6 Codewise, the DiCo LS is just a flat Prolog database with clauses for only two predicates:",
        "Let us make a few comments on these numbers in order to illustrate how the generation of the LS from the original DiCo database works.",
        "The FileMaker (or SQL) DiCo database that has been used contained only 775 lexical unit records (word senses).",

        "So where do the 915 (1,690 – 775) extra units come from?",
        "They all have been extrapolated from the so-called phraseology (ph) field of DiCo records, where lexicographers list idioms that are formally built from the record headword.",

        "As explained earlier, it is possible to regenerate from the LS lexical descriptions for any lexical entity that is either a lexical unit or a wordform targeted by a lexical function application, filling wordform descriptions with inverse lexical function links.",
        "To test this, we have regenerated an entire DiCo in HTML format from the LS, with a total of 8,154 (1,690 + 6,464) lexical entries, stored as individual HTML pages.",
        "Pages for original DiCo headwords contain the hypertext specification of the original lexical function links, together with all inverse lexical links that have been found in the LS; pages for wordforms contain only inverse links.",
        "For instance, the page for METTRE ‘to put’ (which is not a headword in the original DiCo) contains 71 inverse links, such as:7",
        "Of course, most of the entries that were not in the original DiCo are fairly poor and will require significant editing to be turned into bona fide DiCo descriptions.",
        "They are, however, a useful point of departure for lexicographers; additionally, the richer the DiCo will become, the more productive the LS will be in terms of automatic generation of draft descriptions."

        "We have two strong objections to this.",
        "First, this complex entity will not be a proper translation in most contexts: one cannot translate He killed all his siblings by Il a tué tous ses frères ou sceurs – the conjunction et ‘and’ is required in this specific context, as well as in many others.",
        "Second, and this is more problematic, this approach would force us to enter in the French LS entities for translation purposes, which would transgress the original monolingual integrity of the system.8 We must admit that we do not have a ready-to-use solution to this problem, specially if we insist on ruling out the introduction of ad hoc periphrastic translations as lexical entities in target LSs.",
        "It may very well be the case that a cluster of interrelated LSs cannot be completely connected for translation purposes without the addition of “buffer” LSs that ensure full interlingual connectivity.",
        "For instance, the buffer French LS for English to French LS connection could contain phrasal lexical entities such as frères et sceurs (‘siblings’), être de mêmes parents and être frère(s) et sceur(s) (‘to be siblings’).",
        "This strategy can actually be very productive and can lead us to realize that what appeared first as an ad hoc solution may be fully justified from a linguistic perspective.",
        "Dealing with the sibling case, for instance, forced us to realized 8 It is worth noticing that good English-French dictionaries, such as the Collins-Robert, offer several different translations in this particular case.",
        "Additionally, their translations do not apply to sibling as such, but rather to siblings or to expressions such as someone’s siblings, to be siblings, etc.",

        "For standard lexical functions, this can be done automatically using the following strategy for two languages A and B.",
        "If the lexical entity LA is connected to LB by means of a “translation” link, all lexical entities linked to the lexical function application f(LA) by the “value” link should be connected by a “value translation” link, with a trust value of “0.5,” to all lexical entities linked to f(LB) by a “value” link.",
        "The distinction between “translation” and “value translation” links allow for contextual interlingual connections: a lexical entity L’B could happen to be a proper translation of L’A only if it occurs as collocate in a specific collocation.",
