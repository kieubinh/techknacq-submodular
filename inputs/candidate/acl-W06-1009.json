        "Ideas are, of course, expressed in words; or, to put it another way, a document's vocabulary is likely to reveal something about the author's ideology (Lakoff, 2002).",
        "In view of this, and since ultimately we are interested in clustering the documents harvested from the internet by their ideology (and we understand'ideology' in the broadest possible sense), we approach the problem as a textual information retrieval (IR) task.",
        "There is another level of complexity to the problem, however.",
        "The language of the internet is not, of course, confined to English; on the contrary, the representation of other languages is probably increasing (Hill and Hughes, 1998; Nunberg, 2000).",
        "Thus, for our results to be representative, we require a way to compare documents in one language to those in potentially any other language.",
        "Essentially, we would like to answer the question of how ideologically aligned two documents are, regardless of their respective languages.",
        "In cross-language IR, this must be approached by the use of a parallel multilingual corpus, or at least some kind of appropriate training material available in multiple languages."

        "This collection, and its most recent revision (at the CLEF website, www.clef-campaign.org), are based on news documents or governmental communications.",
        "Use of such corpora is widespread in much recent CLIR work; one such example is Nie, Simard, Isabelle and Durand (1999), which uses the Hansard corpus, parallel French-English texts of eight years of the Canadian parliamentary proceedings, to train a CLIR model.",
        "It should be noted that the stated objective of CLEF is to 'develop and maintain an infrastructure for the testing and evaluation of information retrieval systems operating on European lan-guages' (Peters 2001:1).",
        "Indeed, there is good reason for this: CLEF is an activity under the auspices of the European Commission.",
        "Likewise, the Canadian Hansard corpus covers only English and French, the most widespread languages of Canada.",
        "It is to be expected that governmental institutions would have most interest in promoting resources and research in the languages falling most within their respective domains.",
        "But in many ways, not least for the computational linguistics community, nor for anyone interested in understanding trends in global opinion, this represents an inherent limitation.",
        "Since many of the languages of interest for our project are not European – Arabic is a good example – resources such as the CLEF collection will be insufficient by themselves.",
        "The output of global news organizations is a more promising avenue, because many such organizations make an effort to provide translations in a wide variety of languages.",
        "For example, the BBC news website (http://news.bbc.co.uk/) provides translations in 34 languages, as follows:",
        "However, there is usually no assurance that a news article in one language will be translated into any, let alone all, of the other languages.",
        "In view of this, even more promising still as a parallel corpus for our purposes is the Bible.",
        "Res-nik, Olsen and Diab (1999) elaborate on some of the reasons for this: it is the world's most translated book, with translations in over 2,100 languages (often, multiple translations per language) and easy availability, often in electronic form and in the public domain; it covers a variety of literary styles including narrative, poetry, and correspondence; great care is taken over the translations; it has a standard structure which allows parallel alignment on a verse-by-verse basis; and, perhaps surprisingly, its vocabulary appears to have a high rate of coverage (as much as 85%) of modern-day language.",
        "Resnik, Olsen and Diab note that the Bible is small compared to many corpora currently used in computational linguistics research, but still falls within the range of acceptability based on the fact that other corpora of similar size are used; and as previously noted, the breadth of languages covered is simply not available elsewhere.",
        "This in itself makes the Bible attractive to us as a resource for our CLIR task.",
        "It is an open question whether, because of the Bible's content, relatively small size, or some other attribute, it can successfully be used for the type of CLIR we envisage.",

        "All of the work described in this section was implemented using the Sandia Text Analysis Extensible Library (STANLEY).",
        "STANLEY allows for information retrieval based on a standard vector model (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro -Neto, 1999: 27-30) with term weighting based on log entropy.",
        "Previous work (Bauer et al. 2005) has shown that the precision-recall curve for STANLEY is better than many other published algorithms; Dumais (1991) finds specifically that the precision-recall curve for information retrieval based on log-entropy weighting compares favorably to that for other weighting schemes.",
        "Two distinct methods for cross-language comparison are described in this section, and these are as follows.",
        "The first method (Method 1) involves creating a separate textual model for each 'minimal unit' of each translation of the Bible.",
        "A 'minimal unit' could be as small as a verse (e.g. Genesis 1:1), but it could be a group of verses (e.g. Genesis 1:1-10); the key is that alignment is possible because of the chapter-and-verse structure of the Bible, and that whatever grouping is used should be the same in each translation.",
        "Thus, for each",
        "language ) we end up with a set of models (m1,), m2,), ... mn,)).",
        "If the Bible is used as the parallel corpus and the 'minimal unit' is the verse, then n = 31,102 (the number of verses in the Bible).",
        "Let us suppose now that we wish to compare document di with document dj, and that we happen to know that di is in English and dj is in Russian.",
        "In order to assess to what extent di and dj are 'about' the same thing, we treat the text of each document as a query against all of the models in its respective language.",
        "So, di is evaluated against m1,English, m2,English, ..., mn,English to give simi,1, simi,2, ..., simi,n, where simx,y (a value between 0 and 1) represents the similarity of document dx in language) to model mn in language ), based on the cosine of the angle between the vector for dx and the vector for mn.",
        "Similar evaluations are performed for dj against the set of models in Russian.",
        "Now, each set of n results for a particular document can itself be thought of an n-dimensional vector.",
        "Thus, di is associated with (simi,1, simi,2, ..., simi,n) and dj with (simj,1, simj,2, ..., simj,n).",
        "To quantify the similarity between di and dj, we now compute the cosine between these two vectors to yield a single measure, also a value between 0 and 1.",
        "In effect, we have used the multilingual corpus – the Bible, in this case – in 'Rosetta-Stone' fashion to bridge the language gap between di and dj.",
        "Method 1 is summarized graphically in Figure 1, for two hypothetical documents.",
        "The second method of comparison (Method 2) is quite similar.",
        "This time, however, instead of building one set of textual models for each translation in language) (m1,), m2,), ... mn,)), we build a single set of textual models for all translations, with each language represented at least once (m1, m2, ... mn).",
        "Thus, m1 might represent a model based on the concatenation of Genesis 1:1 in English, Russian, Arabic, and so on.",
        "In a fashion similar to that of Method 1, each incoming document di is evaluated as a query against m1, m2, ..., mn, to give an n-dimensional vector where each cell is a value between 0 and 1.",
        "Method 2 is summarized graphically in Figure 2, for just English and Russian.",
        "There are at least two features of Method 2 which make it attractive, from a linguist's point of view, for CLIR.",
        "The first is that it allows for the possibility that a single input document may be multilingual.",
        "In Figure 2, document dj is represented by an symbol with a mainly light-colored background, but with a small dark-colored section.",
        "This is intended to represent a document with mainly English content, but some small subsection in Russian.",
        "Under Method 1, in which dj is compared to an English-language model, the Russian content would have been effectively ignored, but under Method 2 this is no longer the case.",
        "Accordingly, the hypothetical similarity measure for the first 'minimal unit' has changed very slightly, as has the overall measure of similarity between document di and dj.",
        "The second linguistic attraction of Method 2 is that it is not necessary to know a priori the language of di or dj, providing that the language is one of those for which we have textual data in the model set.",
        "Since, as already stated, the Bible covers over 2,100 languages, this should not be a significant theoretical impediment.",
        "The theoretical advantages of Method 1 have principally to do with the ease of technical implementation.",
        "New model sets for additional languages can be easily added as they become available, whereas under Method 2 the entire model set must be rebuilt (statistics recomputed, etc.)",
        "each time a new language is added."

        "In order to obtain a preliminary idea of whether this method was likely to work, we populated the entire matrix of similarity measures, verse by verse, for each language pair.",
        "There are 31,102 verses in the Bible (allowing for some variation in versification between different translations, which we carefully controlled for by adopting a common versification schema).",
        "Thus, this step involved building a 31,102 by 31,102 matrix for each language pair, in which the cell in row m and column n contains a number between 0 and 1 representing the similarity of verse m in one language to verse n in the other language.",
        "If use of the Bible for CLIR is a sound approach, we would expect to see the highest similarity measures in what we will call the matrix's diagonal values – the values occurring down the diagonal of the matrix from top-left to bottom-right – meaning that verse n in one language is most similar to verse n in the other, for all n. Here, we would simply like to note an incidental finding.",
        "We found that for certain language pairs, the diagonal values were significantly higher than for other language pairs, as shown in Table 1.",
        "One hypothesis we have is that the lower overall similarity for English-Russian is at least partly due to the fact that Russian is a much more highly inflected language then any of English, French, or Spanish.",
        "That many verses containing non-dictionary forms are the ones that score the highest for similarity, and many of those that do not score lowest, appears to confirm this.",
        "However, there appear to be other factors at play as well, since many of the highest-scoring verses contain proper names or other infrequently occurring lexical items (examples are Esther 9:9: 'and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vai-zatha', and Exodus 37:19: 'three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the lamp-stand').",
        "A third possibility, consistent with the first, is that Table 1 actually reflects more general measures of similarity between languages, the Western European languages (for example) all being more closely related to Latin than their Slavic counterparts.",
        "At any rate, if our hypothesis about inflection being an important factor is correct, then this would seem to underline the importance of stemming for highly-inflected languages."

        "It is perhaps surprising that the Bible has not been more widely used as a multilingual corpus by the computational linguistics and information retrieval community.",

        "The reason for the Bible being ignored may be the often unspoken assumption that the domain of the Bible is too limited (being a religious document) or that its content is too archaic.",

        "), and if the language is archaic, that may have more a matter of translation style than of content.",
        "There are a number of future research directions in computational linguistics we would like to pursue, besides those which may be of interest in other disciplines.",
        "The first is to use this framework to evaluate the relative faithfulness of different translations.",

        "Such an analysis could be of theological, as well as linguistic, interest.",
