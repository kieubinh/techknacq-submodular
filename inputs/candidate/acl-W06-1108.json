        "We compare string distance measures for their value in modeling dialect distances.",
        "Traditional dialectology relies on identifying language features which are common to one dialect area while distinguishing it from others.",
        "It has difficulty in dealing with partial matches of linguistic features and with non-overlapping language patterns.",
        "Therefore Seguy (1973) and Goebl (1982; 1984) advocate using aggregates of linguistic features to analyze dialectal patterns, effectively introducing the perspective of DIALECTOMETRY.",
        "Kessler (1995) introduced the use of string edit distance measure as a means of calculating the distance between the pronunciations of corresponding words in different dialects.",
        "Following Seguy’s and Goebl’s lead, he calculated this distance for pairs of pronunciations of many words in many Irish-speaking towns.",
        "String edit distance is sensitive to the degrees of overlap of strings and allows one to process large amounts of pronunciation data, including that which does not follow other isoglosses neatly.",
        "Heeringa (2004) examines several variants of edit distance applied to Norwegian and Dutch data, focusing on measures which involve a length normalization, and which ignore phonological context, and demonstrating that measures using binary segment differences are no worse than those using feature-based measures of segment difference.",
        "This paper inspects a range of further refinements in measuring pronunciation differences.",
        "First, we inspect the role of normalization by length, showing that it actually worsens non-normalized measures.",
        "Second, we compare edit distance measures to simpler measures which ignore linear order, and show that order-sensitivity is important.",
        "Third, we inspect measures which are sensitive to phonetic context, and show that these, too, tend to be superior.",
        "Fourth, we compare versions of string edit distance which are constrained to respect syllable structure (always matching vowels with vowels, etc.",
        "), and conclude that this is mildly advantageous.",
        "Finally we compare binary (i.e., same/different) treatments of the segments in edit distance to gradual treatments of segment differentiation, and find no indication of the superiority of the gradual measures.",
        "The quality of the measures is assayed primarily through their agreement with the judgments of dialect speakers about which varieties are perceived as more similar (or dissimilar) to their own.",
        "In addition we inspect a validation technique which purports to show how successfully a dialect measure uncovers the geographic structure in the data (Nerbonne and Kleiweg, 2006), but this technique yields unstable results when applied to our data.",
        "We have perception data only for Norwegian, so",
        "that data figures prominently in our argument, and we evaluate both Norwegian and German data geographically.",
        "The results differ, and the perceptual results (concerning Norwegian) are most easily interpretable.",
        "There we find, as noted above, that non-normalized measures are superior to normalized ones, that both order and context sensitivity are worthwhile, as is the vowel/consonant distinction.",
        "The (geographic) results for German are more complicated, but also less stable.",
        "We include them for the sake of completeness.",
        "In addition we note two minor contributions.",
        "First, although some literature ends up evaluating both distance and similarity measures, because these are not consistently each others’ inverses under some normalizations (Kondrak, 2005; Inkpen et al., 2005), we suggest a normalization based on alignment length which guarantees that similarity is exactly the inverse of distance, allowing us to concentrate on distance.",
        "Second, we note that there is no great problem in applying edit distance to bigrams and trigrams, even though recent literature has been sceptical about the feasibility of this step.",
        "For example Kessler (2005) writes: [ ... ] one major shortcoming [in applying edit distance to linguistic data, WH et al] that is rarely discussed is that the phonetic environment of the sounds in question cannot be taken into account, while still making use of the efficient dynamic programming algorithm (p. 253).",
        "Somewhat further Kessler writes: “Currently, the predominant solution to this problem is to ignore context entirely.” In fact Kondrak (2005) applies edit distance straightforwardly using n-gram as basic elements.",
        "Our findings accord with Kon-drak’s, who also found no problem in applying edit distance using n-grams, but we evaluate the technique in its application to dialectology."

        "Heeringa (2004) demonstrates that edit distance applied to comparable words (see below for examples) is a superior measure of dialect distance when compared to unigram corpus frequency and also that it is superior to both the frequency of phonetic features in corpora (a technique which Hop-penbrouwers & Hoppenbrouwers (2001) had advocated) and to the frequency of phonetic features taken one word at a time.",
        "Heeringa compares these techniques using the results of a perception experiment we also employ below.",
        "Heeringa shows that word-based techniques are superior to corpus-based techniques, and moreover, that most word-based techniques perform about the same.",
        "We therefore ignore measures which view corpora as undifferentiated collections below and study only word-based techniques.",
        "A further question was whether to compare words based on a binary difference between segments or whether to use instead phonetic features to derive a more sensitive measure of segment distance.",
        "It turned out that measures using binary segment distinctions outperform the feature-based methods (see Heeringa, pp.",
        "184– 186), even though a number of feature systems and comparisons of feature vectors were experimented with.",

        "The larger German data likewise is unfortunately more recalcitrant (as are other data sets we have examined, but in which we have less confidence).",
