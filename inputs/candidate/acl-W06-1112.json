        "This experience shows that the lexical similarity is less important than syntactic similarity.",

        "Although the similarity of natural languages is in principal a very vague notion, the linguistic literature seems to be full of claims classifying two natural languages as being more or less similar.",
        "These claims are in some cases a result of a detailed comparative examination of lexical and/or syntactic properties of languages under question, in some cases they are based on a very subjective opinion of the author, in many other cases they reflect the application of some mathematical formula on textual data (a very nice example of such mathematical approach can be found at (Scannell, 2004)).",
        "Especially in the last case the notion of language similarity is very often confused with the notion of text similarity.",
        "Even the well known paper (Lebart and Rajman, 2000) deals more with the text similarity than language similarity.",
        "This general trend is quite understandable, the mathematical methods for measuring text similarity are of a prominent importance especially for information retrieval and similar fields.",
        "On the other hand, they concentrate too much on the surface similarity of word forms and thus may not reflect the similarity of languages properly.",
        "This paper tries to advocate different approach, based on the experience gained in MT experiments with closely related (and similar) languages, where it is possible to “measure” the similarity indirectly by a complexity of modules we have to use in order to achieve a reasonable translation quality.",
        "This experience led us to formulating an evaluation measure trying to capture not only textual, but also syntactic similarities between natural languages.",
        "2 Imperfections of measures based on string similarity There are many application areas in the NLP in which it is useful to apply the measures exploiting the similarity of word forms (strings).",
        "They serve very well for example for tasks like spellchecking (where the choice of the best candidates for correction of a spelling error is typically based upon the Levenshtein metrics) or estimating the similarity of a new source sentence to those stored in the translation memory of a Machine Aided Translation system.",
        "They are a bit controversial in a “proper” machine translation, where the popular BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), although widely accepted as a measure of translation accuracy, seems to favor stochastic approaches based on",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics an n-gram model over other MT methods (see the results in (Nist, 2001)).",
        "The controversies the BLEU score seems to provoke arise due to the fact that the evaluation of MT systems can be, in general, performed from two different viewpoints.",
        "The first one is that of a developer of such a system, who needs to get a reliable feedback in the process of development and debugging of the system.",
        "The primary interest of such a person is the grammar or dictionary coverage and system performance and he needs a cheap, fast and simple evaluation method in order to allow frequent routine tests indicating the improvements of the system during the development of the system.",
        "The second viewpoint is that of a user, who is primarily concerned with the capability of the system to provide fast and reliable translation requiring as few post-editing efforts as possible.",
        "The simplicity, speed and low costs are not of such importance here.",
        "If the evaluation is performed only once, in the moment when the system is considered to be ready, the evaluation method may even be relatively complicated, expensive and slow.",
        "A good example of such a complex measure is the FEMTI framework (Framework for the Evaluation of Machine Translation).",
        "The most complete description of the FEMTI framework can be found in (Hovy et al., 2002).",
        "Such measures are much more popular among translators than among language engineers and MT systems developers.",
        "If we aim at measuring the similarity of languages or language distances, our point of view should be much more similar to that of a human translator than of a system developer, if we’ll stick to our MT analogy.",
        "When looking for clues concerning the desirable properties of a language similarity (or distance) measure, we can first try to formulate the reasons why we consider the simple string-based (or word-form-based) measures inadequate.",
        "If we take into account a number of languages existing in the world, the number of word forms existing in each of those languages and a simple fact that a huge percentage of those word forms is not longer than five or six characters, it is quite clear that there is a huge number of overlapping word forms which have completely different meaning in all languages containing that particular word form.",
        "Let us take for illustration some language pairs of non-related languages.",
        "For example for Czech and English (the languages very different with regard both to the lexicon and syntax) we can find several examples of overlapping word forms.",
        "The English word house means a duckling in Czech, the English indefinite article a is in Czech also very frequent, because it represents a coordinating conjunction and, while an is an archaic form of a pronoun in Czech.",
        "On the other hand, if we look at the identical (or nearly identical) word forms in similar languages, we can find many examples of totally different meaning.",
        "For example, the word form zivot means life in Czech and belly in Russian; godina means year in Serbo-Croatian while hodina is an hour in Czech (by the way, an hour in Russian is �cas – and the same word means time in Czech).",
        "The overlapping word forms between relatively distant languages are so frequent that it is even possible to create (more or less) syntactically correct sentences in one language containing only word forms from the other language.",
        "Again, let us look at the Czech-English language pair.",
        "The English sentences Let my pal to pile a lumpy paste on a metal pan.",
        "or I had to let a house to a nosy patron.",
        "consist entirely of word forms existing also in Czech, while the Czech sentence Adept demise metal hole pod led.",
        " – [A resignation candidate was throwing sticks under the ice.]",
        "consists of English word forms.",
        "Creating such a Czech sentence is more complicated – as a highly inflected language it uses a wide variety of endings, which make it more difficult to create a syntactically correct sentence from word forms of a language which has incomparably smaller repertoire of endings.",
        "This fact directly leads to another argument against the string similarity based measures – even though two languages may have very similar syntactic properties and their basic word forms may also be very similar, then if the languages are highly inflective and the only difference between those languages are different endings used for expressing identical morphosyntactic properties, the string similarity based methods will probably show a substan",
        "tial difference between these languages.",
        "This is highly probable especially for shorter words – the words with a basic form only four or five characters long may have endings longer or equal to the length of the basic form, for example: nov�a/novata “new” (Cze/Mac), viden�y/vidimyj “seen” (Cze/Rus), fotografujici/fotografuojantysis “photographing” (Cze/Lit).",
        "The last but not least indirect argument against the use of string-based metrics can be found in (Kubo�n and B�emov�a, 1990).",
        "The paper describes so called transducing dictionary, a set of rules designed for a direct transcription of a certain category of source language words into a target language.",
        "The system has been tested on two language pairs (English-to-Czech and Czech-to-Russian) and although there was a natural original assumption that such a system will cover substantially more expressions when applied to a pair of related languages (which are not only related, but also quite similar), this assumption turned to be wrong.",
        "The system covered almost identical set of words for both language pairs – namely the words with Greek or Latin origin.",
        "The similarity of coverage even allowed to build an English-to-Russian transducing dictionary using Czech as a pivot language with a negligible loss of the coverage."

        "5 An outline of a structural similarity measure In this section, we propose a comparatively simple measure of syntactic (structural) similarity.",
        "There are generally two levels which may serve as a basis for such a structural measure, the surface or deep syntactic level.",
        "Let us first explain the reasons supporting our choice of surface syntactic level.",
        "Compared to deep syntactic representation, the surface syntactic trees are much more 3 Although some Balticists argue that illative forms are adverbs, it is a fact that this case is productive and used quite often (Erika Rimkut_e, personal communication), though it has been widely replaced by prepositional phrases.",
        "Allative and adessive are used only in some Lithuanian dialects, except of a few xed allative forms (e.g., vakarop(i) “in the evening”, velniop(i) “to the hell”.)",
        "closely related to the actual surface form of a sentence.",
        "It is quite common that every word form or punctuation sign is directly related to a single node of a surface syntactic tree.",
        "The deep syntactic trees, on the other hand, usually represent autosemantic words only, they may even actually contain more nodes than there are words in the input sentence (for example, when the input sentence contains ellipsis).",
        "It is also quite clear that the deep syntactic trees are much more closely related to the meaning of the sentence than its original surface form, therefore they may hide certain differences between the languages concerned, it is a generally accepted hypothesis that transfer performed on the deep syntactic level is easier than the transfer at the surface syntactic level, especially for syntactically and typologically less similar languages.",
        "The second important decision we had to make was to select the best type of surface syntactic trees between the dependency and phrase structure trees.",
        "For practical reasons we have decided to use dependency trees.",
        "The main motivation for this decision is the enormous structural ambiguity of phrase structure trees that represent sentences with identical surface form.",
        "Let us have a look at the following Polish sentence:",
        "“Pawe l is reading a/the book.” The syntactic structure of this sentence can be expressed by two phrase structure trees representing different order of attaching nominal phrases to a verb.4",
        "• • The structural measure we are suggesting is i i based on the analogy to the Levenshtein measure.",
        "It is therefore pretty simple – the distance of two trees is the minimal amount of elementary operations that transform one tree to the other.",
        "We consider the following elementary operations:",
        "Pawe l czyta ksi�aik�e",
        "1. adding a node, 2. removing a node, 3. changing the order of a node, 4. changing the father of a node.",
        "•",
        "There is no linguistically relevant difference between these two trees.",
        "Although generally useful, the information hidden in both trees is purely superfluous for our goal of designing a simple structural metrics.",
        "The dependency tree obtained from the phrase structure ones by contraction of all head edges seem to be much more appropriate for our purpose.",
        "In our example, we therefore get the following form of the dependency tree:",
        "The nodes of the dependency trees representing surface syntactic level directly correspond to word forms present in the sentence.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, the punctuation marks are not represented in our trees.",
        "They would probably cause a lot of technical problems and might distort the whole similarity measure.",
        "The node of a tree are ordered and reflect the surface word-order of the sentence.",
        "Different labels of nodes in both languages (see the example below) don’t influence the value of the measure, however they are important for the identification of corresponding nodes (a bilingual dictionary is used here).",
        "The similarity of languages can be obtained as an average distance of individual sentences in a parallel corpus.",
        "The following examples show the use of the measure on individual trees.",
        "The correspondence between individual nodes of both trees can be handled by exploiting the bilingual dictionary wherever necessary:",
        "The distance between (7) and (8) is equal 1, since one node has been removed (the dotted line gives the removed node).",
        "The distance between (9) and (10) is equal 1, since one node has been removed (the dotted line gives the removed node).",
        "The Czech-English example (11) shows two sentences which have a mutual distance equal to 3 – if we start changing the Czech tree into an English one, then the first elementary operation is the deletion of the node r�ad, the second operation adds the new node corresponding to the English word likes and the third and last operation is the change of the father of the node corresponding to the personal pronoun on [he] from swimming to likes.",
        "As mentioned above, the node labels are not taken into account, the fact that the Czech finite verbal form plave changes into an English gerund has no effect on the distance.",
        "A similar case are sentences with a dative agent, for example:",
        "In this sentence, the Czech mi does not match to I since it is no subject.",
        "Similarly, the substantive zima does not match to cold, since it is a different part of speech.",
        "Hence two nodes are removed and two new nodes are added, which gives us a distance of 4.",
        "This example demonstrates that the measure tends to behave naturally - even short sentences containing syntactically different constructions get a relatively high score.",
        "To formalize the process described above, let us introduce a notion of lexical and analytical equality of nodes in analytical trees:",
        "• Two nodes equal lexically if and only if they share the same meaning in the given context.",
        "Nevertheless to simplify automatic processing, we treat two nodes as lexically equal if they share a particular meaning (defined e.g. as a non-empty intersection of Wordnet classes).",
        "• Two nodes equal analytically if and only",
        "if they have the same analytical label (e.g. subject, spacial adverbial etc.).",
        "As for the measure, two nodes match to each other if they 1) occur at the same position in the subtree of their parent and 2) equal lexically and analytically.",
        "If a subtree (greater than 1) is added or removed, the operation contributes to the measure with the size of the subtree (the amount of its nodes), for example in the following idiomatic phrase:",
