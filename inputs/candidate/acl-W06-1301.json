        "In Addition to the visual-haptic interface, iDrive includes a speech dialogue system (SDS) as well.",
        "The SDS allows the driver to use a large number of functions via speech commands (Hagen et al., 2004).",
        "The system offers a context specific help function that can be activated by uttering the keyword ’options’.",
        "The options provide help in the form of a list, containing speech commands available in the current context (see dialogue 1).",
        "Currently neither the driver’s preferences nor his knowledge is taken into consideration.",
        "We present a strategy to op",
        "timize the options by adaption that takes preferences and knowledge into account.",
        "Our basic concern was to reduce the driver’s memory load by reducing irrelevant information.",
        "An adaptive help system based upon an individual user model could overcome this disadvantage.",
        "In (Komatani et al., 2003) and (Libuda and Kraiss, 2003), several adaptive components can be included to improve dialogue systems, e.g. user and content adaption, situation adaption and task adaption.",
        "Hassel (2006) uses adaption to apply different dialogue strategies according to the user’s experience with the SDS.",
        "In our system we concentrate on user modeling and content adaption.",
