        "Bridging anaphora represents a special part of the general problem of anaphor resolution.",
        "As a special case of anaphora, it has been studied and discussed by different authors and for various languages.",
        "There are many problems in developing such studies.",
        "First, bridging is not a regular class, it seldom contains cases of associative and indirect anaphora (defined in the sequence); lexical resources such as Wordnet are not available for every language, and even when available such resources have proven to be insufficient for the problem.",
        "In fact, different sources of lexical knowledge have been evaluated for anaphora resolution (Poesio et al., 2002; Markert and Nis-sim, 2005; Bunescu, 2003).",
        "At last, corpus studies of bridging anaphora usually report results on a reduced number of examples, because this kind of data is scarce.",
        "Usually bridging anaphora considers two types: Associative anaphors are NPs that have an antecedent that is necessary to their interpretation (the relation between the anaphor and its antecedent is different from identity); and Indirect anaphor are those that have an identity relation with their antecedents but the anaphor and its antecedent have different head-nouns.",
        "In both associative and indirect anaphora, the semantic relation holding between the anaphor and its antecedent play an essential role for resolution.",
        "However, here we present an evaluation of the semantic tagging provided by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000) (http://visl.sdu.dk/visl/pt/parsing/automatic) as a lexical resource for indirect anaphora resolution.",
        "We focus on indirect anaphors for two reasons, they are greater in number and they present better agreement features concerning human annotation."

      "heading": "2 Semantic Annotation with Prototype Tags",
      "text": [
        "As a Constraint Grammar system, PALAVRAS encodes all annotational information as word based tags.",
        "A distinction is made between morphological, syntactic, valency and semantic tags, and for a given rule module (or level of analysis), one tag type will be regarded as primary (= flagged for disambiguation), while tags from lower levels provide unambiguous context, and tags from higher levels ambiguous lexical potentialities.",
        "Thus, semantic tags are regarded as secondary help tags at the syntactic level, but will have undergone some disambiguation at the anaphora resolution level.",
        "The semantic noun classes were conceived as distinctors rather than semantic definitions, the goal being on the one hand to capture semantically motivated regularities and relations in syntax, on the other hand to allow to distinguish between different senses, or to chose different translation equivalents in MT applications.",
        "A limited set of semantic prototype classes was deamed ideal for both purposes, since it allows at the same time similarity-based lumping of words (useful in structural analysis, IR, anaphora resolution) and context based polysemy resolution for an individual word (useful in MT, lexicography, alignment).",
        "Though we define class hypernyms as prototypes in the Roschian sense (Rosch, 1978)",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics as an (idealized) best instance of a given class of entities, we avoided low level prototypes, using <Azo> for four-legged land-animals rather than <dog> and <cat> for dog and cat races etc.).",
        "Where possible, systematic subclasses were established.",
        "Semiotic artifacts <sem>, for instance are subdivided into “readables” <sem-r> (book-prototype: book, paper, magazine), “watchables” <sem-w> (film, show, spectacle), “listenables” etc.",
        "The final category inventory, though developed independently, resembles the ontology used in the multilingual European SIMPLE project (http://www.ub.es/ gilcub/SIMPLE/simple.html).",
        "For the sake of rule based inheritance reasoning, semantic prototype classes were bundled using a matrix of 16 atomic semantic features.",
        "Thus, the atomic feature +MOVE is shared by the different human and animal prototypes as well as the vehicle prototype, but the vehicle prototype lacks the +ANIM feature, and only the bundle on human prototypes (<Hprof>, <Hfam>, <Hideo> ,... ) shares the +HUM feature (human professional, human family, human follower of a theory/belief/conviction/ideology).",
        "In the parser, a rule selecting the +MOVE feature (e.g. for subjects of movement verbs) will help discard competing senses from lemmas with the above prototypes, since they will all inherit choices based on the shared atomic feature.",
        "Furthermore, atomic features can themselves be subjected to inheritance rules, e.g. +HUM – > +ANIM – > +CONCRETE, or+MOVE – > +MOVABLE.",
        "In Table 1, which contains examples of polysemic institution nouns, positive features are marked with capital letters, negative features with small letters1.",
        "The words in the Table 1 are ambiguous with regard to the feature H, and since it is only the <inst> prototype that contributes the +HUM feature potential, it can be singled out by a rule selecting ’H’ or by discarding ’h’.",
        "The parser’s about 140 prototypes have been manually implemented for a lexicon of about 35.000 nouns.",
        "In addition, the ±HUM category was also introduced as a selection restriction for 2.000 verb senses (subject restriction) and 1.300 adjective senses (head restriction).",
        "While the semantic annotation of common nouns is carried out by disambiguating a given lemma’s lexicon-listed prototype potential, this strategy is not sufficient for proper nouns, due",
        "to the productive nature of this word class.",
        "In two recent NER projects, the parser was augmented with a pattern recognition module and a rule-based module for identifying and classifying names.",
        "In the first project (Bick, 2003), 6 main classes with about 15 subclasses were used in a lexeme-based approach, while the second adopted the 41 largely functional categories of Linguateca’s joint HAREM evaluation in 2005 (http://www.linguateca.com).",
        "A lexicon-registered name like Berlin would have a stable tag (<civ> = civitas) in the first version, while it would be tagged as either <hum>, <top> or <org> in the second, dependent on context.",
        "At the time of writing, we have not yet tagged our anaphora corpus with name type tags, and it is unclear which approach, lexematic or functional, will work best for the resolution of indirect and associative anaphora."

        "Our work was based on a corpus formed by 31 newspaper articles, from Folha de S˜ao Paulo, written in Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "The corpus was automatically parsed using the parser PALAVRAS, and manually annotated for anaphoricity using the MMAX tool(http://mmax.eml-research.de/) .",
        "Four subjects annotated the corpus.",
        "All annotators agreed on the antecedent in 73% of the cases, in other 22% of the cases there was agreement between three annotators and in 5% of the cases only two annotators agreed.",
        "There were 133 cases of",
        "definite Indirect anaphors (NPs starting with definite articles) from the total of 1454 definite descriptions (near to 10%) and 2267 NPs.",
        "The parser gives to each noun of the text (or to most of them) a semantic tag.",
        "For instance, the noun japonˆes [japanese] has the following semantic tags ling and Hnat, representing the features: human nationality and language respectively.",
        "The approach consists in finding relationships with previous nouns through the semantic tags.",
        "The chosen antecedent will be the nearest expression with the largest number of equal semantic tags.",

        "The Eurocenter offers Japanese courses in Kanazawa.",
        "After one month, a student can modestly speak the language.",
        "As both expressions (japanese and language) hold the semantic tag “ling” the anaphor is resolved.",
        "For the experiments, we considered as correct the cases where the antecedent found automatically was the same as in the manual annotation (same), and also the cases in which the antecedent of the manual annotation was found further up in the chain identified automatically (in-chain).",
        "We also counted those cases in which the antecedent of the manual annotation was among the group of candidates sharing the same tags (in-candidates), but was not the chosen one (the chosen being the nearest with greater number of equal tags).",
        "Table 2 shows the results of the indirect anaphor resolution.",
        "In 19% of the cases, the system found the same antecedent as marked in the manual annotation.",
        "Considering the chain identified by the system the correct cases go up to 30%.",
        "The great number of unsolved cases were related to the fact that proper names were not tagged.",
        "Considering mainly the tagged nouns (about 93 cases), the correct cases amount to 43%).",
        "This gives us an idea of the quality of the tags for the task.",
        "We further tested if increasing the weight of more specific features in opposition to the more general ones would help in the antecedent decision process.",
        "A semantic tag that is more specific receives a higher weight The semantic tag set has three levels, level 1, which is more general receives weight 1, level 2 receives 5, and level 3 receives 10.",
        "See the example below.",
        "In this experiment the chosen candidate is the nearest one whose sum of equal tag values has higher weight.",
        "Table 3 shows just a small improvement in the correct cases.",
        "If we do not consider unsolved cases, mostly related to proper names, indirect anaphors were correctly identified in 46% of the cases (43/96).",
        "Since there is no semantic tagging for proper names as yet, the relationship between pairs such as S˜ao Carlos - a cidade [S˜ao Carlos - the city] could not be found.",
        "Regarding wrong antecedents, we have seen that some semantic relationships are weaker, having no semantic tags in common, for instance: a proposta - o aumento [the proposal - the rise].",
        "In some cases the antecedent is not a previous noun phrase but a whole sentence, paragraph or disjoint parts of the text.",
        "As we consider only relations holding between noun phrases, these cases could not be resolved.",
        "Finally, there are cases of plain heuristic failure.",
        "For instance, establishing a relationship between os professores",
        "[the teachers], with the semantic tags H and Hprof, and os politicos [the politicians], with the semantic tags H and Hprof, when the correct antecedent was os docentes [the docents], with the semantic tags HH (group of humans) and Hprof."

        "Our study was based on 133 examples, which is not much but surpasses some of the previous related work.",
        "Mainly, our results indicate that the semantic tagging provided by the parser is a good resource for dealing with the problem, if compared to other lexical resources such as WordNet and acquired similarity lists.",
        "We believe that the results will improve significantly once semantic tags for proper names are provided by the parser.",
        "This evaluation is planned as future work."
