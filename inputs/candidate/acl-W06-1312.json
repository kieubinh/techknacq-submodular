        "In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying natural language processing technologies to scientific literature.",
        "The overwhelmingly large number of papers published in fields like biology, genetics and chemistry each year means that researchers need tools for information access (extraction, retrieval, sum-marization, question answering etc).",
        "There is also increased interest in automatic citation indexing, e.g., the highly successful search tools Google Scholar and CiteSeer (Giles et al., 1998).1 This general interest in improving access to scientific articles fits well with research on discourse structure, as knowledge about the overall structure and goal of papers can guide better information access.",
        "Shum (1998) argues that experienced researchers are often interested in relations between articles.",
        "They need to know if a certain article criticises another and what the criticism is, or if the current work is based on that prior work.",

        "Neither the author’s abstract, nor raw citation counts help users in assessing the relation between articles.",
        "And even though CiteSeer shows a text snippet around the physical location for searchers to peruse, there is no guarantee that the text snippet provides enough information for the searcher to infer the relation.",
        "In fact, studies from our annotated corpus (Teufel, 1999), show that 69% of the 600 sentences stating contrast with other work and 21% of the 246 sentences stating research continuation with other work do not contain the corresponding citation; the citation is found in preceding 'CiteSeer automatically citation-indexes all scientific articles reached by a web-crawler, making them available to searchers via authors or keywords in the title.",

        "Citations play a central role in the process of writing a paper.",
        "Swales (1990) argues that scientific writing follows a general rhetorical argumentation structure: researchers must justify that their paper makes a contribution to the knowledge in their discipline.",
        "Several argumentation steps are required to make this justification work, e.g., the statement of their specific goal in the paper (Myers, 1992).",
        "Importantly, the authors also must relate their current work to previous research, and acknowledge previous knowledge claims; this is done with a formal citation, and with language connecting the citation to the argument, e.g., statements of usage of other people’s approaches (often near textual segments in the paper where these approaches are described), and statements of contrast with them (particularly in the discussion or related work sections).",
        "We argue that the automatic recognition of citation function is interesting for two reasons: a) it serves to build better citation indexers and b) in the long run, it will help constrain interpretations of the overall argumentative structure of a scientific paper.",
        "Being able to interpret the rhetorical status of a citation at a glance would add considerable value to citation indexes, as shown in Fig. 1.",

        "For example, in O’Connor’s (1982) experiment, citing statements (one or more sentences referring to other researchers’ work) were identified manually.",
        "The main problem encountered in that work is the fact that many instances of citation context are linguistically unmarked.",
        "Our data confirms this: articles often contain large segments, particularly in the central parts, which describe other people’s research in a fairly neutral way.",
        "We would thus expect many citations to be neutral (i.e., not to carry any function relating to the argumentation per se).",
        "Many of the distinctions typically made in content citation analysis are immaterial to the task considered here as they are too sociologically orientated, and can thus be difficult to operationalise without deep knowledge of the field and its participants (Swales, 1986).",
        "In particular, citations for general reference (background material, homage to pioneers) are not part of our analytic interest here, and so are citations “in passing”, which are only marginally related to the argumentation of the overall paper (Ziman, 1968).",

        "We tried to redefine the categories such that they should be reasonably reliably annotatable; at the same time, they should be informative for the application we have in mind.",
        "A third criterion is that they should have some (theoretical) relation to the particular discourse structure we work with (Teufel, 1999).",
        "Our categories are as follows: One category (Weak) is reserved for weakness of previous research, if it is addressed by the authors (cf. Spiegel-R¨using’s categories 10, 12, possibly 13).",
        "The next three categories describe comparisons or contrasts between own and other work (cf. Spiegel-R¨using’s category 5).",
        "The difference between them concerns whether the comparison is between methods/goals (CoCoGM) or results (CoCoR0).",
        "These two categories are for comparisons without explicit value judgements.",
        "We use a different category (CoCo-) when the authors claim their approach is better than the cited work.",
        "Our interest in differences and similarities between approaches stems from one possible application we have in mind (the rhetorical citation search tool).",
        "We do not only consider differences stated between the current work and other work, but we also mark citations if they are explicitly compared and contrasted with other work (not the current paper).",
        "This is expressed in category CoCoxY.",
        "It is a category not typically considered in the literature, but it is related to the other contrastive categories, and useful to us because we think it can be exploited for search of differences and rival approaches.",
        "The next set of categories we propose concerns positive sentiment expressed towards a citation, or a statement that the other work is actively used in the current work (which is the ultimate praise).",
        "Like Spiegel-R¨using, we are interested in use of data and methods (her categories 4, 5, 6, 7), but we cluster different usages together and instead differentiate unchanged use (PUse) from use with adaptations (PModi).",
        "Work which is stated as the explicit starting point or intellectual ancestry is marked with our category PBas (her category 2).",
        "If a claim in the literature is used to strengthen the authors’ argument, this is expressed in her category 8, and vice versa, category 11.",
        "We collapse these two in our category PSup.",
        "We use two categories she does not have definitions for, namely similarity of (aspect of) approach to other approach (PSim), and motivation of approach used or problem addressed (PMot).",
        "We found evidence for prototypical use of these citation functions in our texts.",
        "However, we found little evidence for her categories 12 or 13 (disproval or new interpretation of claims in cited literature), and we decided against a “state-of-the-art” category (her category 1), which would have been in conflict with our PMo t definition in many cases.",
        "Our fourteenth category, Neut, bundles truly neutral descriptions of other researchers’ approaches with all those cases where the textual evidence for a citation function was not enough to warrant annotation of that category, and all other functions for which our scheme did not provide a specific category.",
        "As stated above, we do in fact expect many of our citations to be neutral.",
        "Citation function is hard to annotate because it in principle requires interpretation of author intentions (what could the author’s intention have been in choosing a certain citation?).",
        "Typical results of earlier citation function studies are that the sociological aspect of citing is not to be underestimated.",
        "One of our most fundamental ideas for annotation is to only mark explicitly signalled citation functions.",
        "Our guidelines explicitly state that a general linguistic phrase such as “better” or “used by us” must be present, in order to increase objectivity in finding citation function.",
        "Annotators are encouraged to point to textual evidence they have for assigning a particular function (and are asked to type the source of this evidence into the annotation tool for each citation).",
        "Categories are defined in terms of certain objective types of statements (e.g., there are 7 cases for PMot).",
        "Annotators can use general text interpretation principles when assigning the categories, but are not allowed to use in-depth knowledge of the field or of the authors.",
        "There are other problematic aspects of the annotation.",
        "Some concern the fact that authors do not always state their purpose clearly.",
        "For instance, several earlier studies found that negational citations are rare (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975; Spiegel-R¨using, 1977); MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1984) argue that the reason for this is that they are potentially politically dangerous, and that the authors go through lengths to diffuse the impact of negative references, hiding a negative point behind insincere praise, or diffusing the thrust of criticism with perfunctory remarks.",
        "In our data we found ample evidence of this effect, illustrated by the following example: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Huang et al.",
        "1990) offer a powerful statistical approach to this problem, though it is unclear how they could be used to recognise the units of interest to phonologists.",
        "(9410022, S-24)2 It is also sometimes extremely hard to distinguish usage of a method from statements of similarity between a method and the own method.",
        "This happens in cases where authors do not want to admit they are using somebody else’s method: The same test was used in Abney and Light (1999).",
        "(0008020, S-151) Unification of indices proceeds in the same manner as unification of all other typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992).",
        "(0008023,S-87) In this case, our annotators had to choose between categories PSim and PUse.",
        "It can also be hard to distinguish between continuation of somebody’s research (i.e., taking somebody’s 2 n all corpus examples, numbers in brackets correspond to the official Cmp lg archive number, “S-” numbers to sentence numbers according to our preprocessing.",
        "research as starting point, as intellectual ancestry, i.e. PBas) and simply using it (PUse).",
        "In principle, one would hope that annotation of all usage/positive categories (starting with P), if clustered together, should result in higher agreement (as they are similar, and as the resulting scheme has fewer distinctions).",
        "We would expect this to be the case in general, but as always, cases exist where a conflict between a contrast (CoCo) and a change to a method (PModi) occur: In contrast to McCarthy, Kay and Kiraz, we combine the three components into a single projection.",
        "(0006044,S-182) The markable units in our scheme are a) all full citations (as recognized by our automatic citation processor on our corpus), and b) all names of authors of cited papers anywhere in running text outside of a formal citation context (i.e., without date).",
        "Our citation processor recognizes these latter names after parsing the citation list an marks them up.",
        "This is unusual in comparison to other citation indexers, but we believe these names function as important referents comparable in importance to formal citations.",
        "In principle, one could go even further as there are many other linguistic expressions by which the authors could refer to other people’s work: pronouns, abbreviations such as “Mueller and Sag (1990), henceforth M & S”, and names of approaches or theories which are associated with particular authors.",
        "If we could mark all of these up automatically (which is not technically possible), annotation would become less difficult to decide, but technical difficulty prevent us from recognizing these other cases automatically.",
        "As a result, in these contexts it is impossible to annotate citation function directly on the referent, which sometimes causes problems.",
        "Because this means that annotators have to consider non-local context, one markable may have different competing contexts with different potential citation functions, and problems about which context is “stronger” may occur.",
        "We have rules that context is to be constrained to the paragraph boundary, but for some categories paper-wide information is required (e.g., for PMot, we need to know that a praised approach is used by the authors, information which may not be local in the paragraph).",
        "Appendix A gives unambiguous example cases where the citation function can be decided on the basis of the sentence alone, but Fig. 4 shows a more typical example where more context is required to interpret the function.",
        "The evaluation of the citation Hindle (1990) is contrastive; the evaluative statement is found 4 sentences after the sentence containing the citation3.",
        "It consists of a positive statement (agreement with authors’ view), followed by a weakness, underlined, which is the chosen category.",
        "This is marked on the nearest markable (Hindle, 3 sentences after the citation).",
        "S-5 Hindle (1990)/Neut proposed dealing with the sparseness problem by estimating the likelihood of unseen events from that of “similar” events that have been seen.",
        "S-6 For instance, one may estimate the likelihood of a particular direct object for a verb from the likelihoods of that direct object for similar verbs.",
        "S-7 This requires a reasonable definition of verb similarity and a similarity estimation method.",
        "A naive view on this annotation scheme could consider the first two sets of categories in our scheme as “negative” and the third set of categories “positive”.",
        "There is indeed a sentiment aspect to the interpretation of citations, due to the fact that authors need to make a point in their paper and thus have a stance towards their citations.",
        "But this is not the whole story: many of our “positive” categories are more concerned with different ways in which the cited work is useful to the current work (which aspect of it is used, e.g., just a definition or the entire solution?",
        "), and many of the contrastive statements have no negative connotation at all and simply state a (value-free) difference between approaches.",
        "However, if one looks at the distribution of positive and negative adjectives around citations, one notices a (non-trivial) connection between our task and sentiment classification.",
        "There are written guidelines of 25 pages, which instruct the annotators to only assign one category per citation, and to skim-read the paper before annotation.",
        "The guidelines provide a decision tree and give decision aids in systematically ambiguous cases, but subjective judgement of the annotators is nevertheless necessary to assign a single tag in an unseen context.",
        "We implemented an annotation tool based on XML/XSLT technology, which allows us to use any web browser to interactively assign one of the 12 tags (presented as a pull-down list) to each citation."

        "However, the semantics of some categories are less well-understood by our annotators: in particular P S up (where the difficulty lies in what an annotator understands as “mutual support” of two theories), and (unfortunately) PBas.",
        "The problem with PBas is that its distinction from PUse is based on subjective judgement of whether the authors use a part of somebody’s previous work, or base themselves entirely on this previous work (i.e., see themselves as following in the same intellectual framework).",
        "Another problem concerns the low distinctivity for the clearly negative categories CoCo- and Weak.",
        "This is in line with MacRoberts and MacRoberts’ hypothesis that criticism is often hedged and not clearly lexically signalled, which makes it more difficult to reliably annotate such citations."

        "We have described a new task: human annotation of citation function, a phenomenon which we believe to be closely related to the overall discourse structure of scientific articles.",
        "Our annotation scheme concentrates on contrast, weaknesses of other work, similarities between work and usage of other work.",
        "One of its principles is the fact that relations are only to be marked if they are explicitly signalled.",
        "Here, we report positive results in terms of interannotator agreement.",
        "Future work on the annotation scheme will concentrate on improving guidelines for currently suboptimal categories, and on measuring intra-annotator agreement and inter-annotator agreement with naive annotators.",
        "We are also currently investigating how well our scheme will work on text from a different discipline, namely chemistry.",
        "Work on applying machine learning techniques for automatic citation classification is currently underway (Teufel et al., 2006); the agreement of one annotator and the system is currently K=.57, leaving plenty of room for improvement in comparison with the human annotation results presented here."
