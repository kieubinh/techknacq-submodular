        "Meetings are a ubiquitous feature of workplace environments, and recordings of meetings provide obvious benefit in that they can be replayed or searched through at a later date.",
        "As recording technology becomes more easily available and storage space becomes less costly, the feasibility of producing and storing these recordings increases.",
        "This is particularly true for audio recordings, which are cheaper to produce and store than full audio-video recordings.",
        "However, audio recordings are notoriously difficult to search or to summarize.",
        "This is doubly true of multi-party recordings, which, in addition to the difficulties presented by single-party recordings, typically contain backchannels, elaborations, and side topics, all of which further confound search and summarization processes.",
        "Making efficient use of large meeting corpora thus requires intelligent summary and review techniques.",
        "One possible user goal given a corpus of meeting recordings is to discover the action items decided within the meetings.",
        "Action items are decisions made within the meeting that require post-meeting attention or labor.",
        "Rapid identification of action items can provide immediate access to salient portions of the meetings.",
        "A review of action items can also function as (part of) a summary of the meeting content.",
        "To this end, we explore the task of applying maximum entropy classifiers to the task of automatically detecting action item utterances in audio recordings of multi-party meetings.",
        "Although available corpora for action items are not ideal, it is hoped that the feature analysis presented here will be of use to later work on other corpora."

        "Addition of features such as speaker change and “hot spots” (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003) may also aid classification.",

        "Future work may focus on the effects that automatic generation of the former has on overall system performance (although this may require higher-quality annotations to be useful.)",
