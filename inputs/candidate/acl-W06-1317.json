        "The area of modeling discourse has arguably seen less success than other areas in NLP.",
        "Contributing to this is the fact that no consensus has been reached on the inventory of discourse relations nor on the types of formal restrictions placed on discourse structure.",
        "Furthermore, modeling discourse structure requires access to considerable prior linguistic analysis including syntax, lexical and compositional semantics, as well as the resolution of entity and event-level anaphora, all of which are non-trivial problems themselves.",
        "Discourse processing has been used in many text processing applications, most notably text summarization and compression, text generation, and dialogue understanding.",
        "However, it is also important for general text understanding, including applications such as information extraction and question answering.",
        "Recently, Wolf and Gibson (2005) have proposed a graph-based approach to representing informational discourse relations.",
        "They demonstrate that tree representations are inadequate for",
        "modeling coherence relations, and show that many discourse segments have multiple parents (incoming directed relations) and many of the relations introduce crossing dependencies â€“ both of which preclude tree representations.",
        "Their annotation of 135 articles has been released as the GraphBank corpus.",
        "In this paper, we provide initial results for the following tasks: (1) automatically classifying the type of discourse coherence relation; and (2) identifying whether any discourse relation exists on two text segments.",
        "The experiments we report are based on the annotated data in the Discourse GraphBank, where we assume that the discourse units have already been identified.",
        "In contrast to a highly structured, compositional approach to discourse parsing, we explore a simple, flat, feature-based methodology.",
        "Such an approach has the advantage of easily accommodating many knowledge sources.",
        "This type of detailed feature analysis can serve to inform or augment more structured, compositional approaches to discourse such as those based on Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Lascarides, 2003) or the approach taken with the D-LTAG system (Forbes et al., 2001).",
        "Using a comprehensive set of linguistic features as input to a Maximum Entropy classifier, we achieve 81% accuracy on classifying the correct type of discourse coherence relation between two segments."

        "probabilistic models for identifying clausal elementary discourse units and generating discourse trees at the sentence level.",
        "These are built using lexical and syntactic information obtained from mapping the discourse-annotated sentences in the RST Corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) to their corresponding syntactic trees in the Penn Treebank.",

        "The rationale clause is annotated as the cause, and the matrix sentence as the effect.",

        "This would have the following annotation in GraphBank:",
        "(7) cause: to open it effect: John pushed the door.",
        "The guideline reflects the appropriate intuition that the intention expressed in the purpose or rationale clause must precede the implementation of the action carried out in the matrix sentence.",
        "In effect, this would be something like (8) [INTENTION TO SEG1] CAUSES SEG2 The problem here is that the cause-effect relation conflates real event-causation with telosdirected explanations, that is, action directed towards a goal by virtue of an intention.",
        "Given that these are semantically disjoint relations, which are furthermore triggered by distinct grammatical constructions, we believe this conflation should be undone and characterized as two separate coherence relations.",
        "If the relations just discussed were annotated as telic-causation, the features encoded for subsequent training of a machine learning algorithm could benefit from distinct syntactic environments.",
        "We would like to automatically generate temporal orderings from cause-effect relations from the events directly annotated in the text.",
