        "The source-channel approach has been often used for word-based language tasks, such as speech recognition and machine translation (Epstein, 1996; Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "According to this approach, an addressee receives a noisy channel (language or speech wave), and decodes this channel to derive the source (idea).",
        "The selected source is that with the maximum posterior probability.",
        "In this paper, we apply the source-channel approach to the interpretation of arguments.",
        "This approach enables us to cast argument interpretation as a trade-off between conflicting factors, viz model complexity against data fit, and structure complexity against belief reasonableness.",
        "This trade-off is inspired by the Minimum Message Length (MML) Criterion – a model selection method that is the basis for several machine learning techniques (Wallace, 2005).",
        "According to this trade-off, a more complex model might fit the data better, but the plausibility (priors) of the model must be taken into account to avoid over-fitting.1 Our argument interpretation mechanism has been implemented in a system called BIAS (Bayesian Interactive Argumentation System).",
        "BIAS presents to a user a set of facts about the world (evidence), and the user constructs an argument about a particular goal proposition in light of this evidence.",
        "BIAS then generates an interpretation of the user’s argument, i.e., it tries to understand the argument.",
        "When people try to understand an interlocutor’s discourse, their interpretation is in terms of their own beliefs and inference patterns.",
        "Likewise, our system’s interpretations are in terms of its underlying knowledge representation – a Bayesian network (BN).",
        "The interpretations generated by BIAS include inferences that connect the propositions in a user’s argument, suppositions that postulate a user’s beliefs that are necessary to make sense of the argument, and explanatory extensions that justify the inferences in the interpretation (and in the argument).",
        "BIAS does not generate its own arguments, rather, it integrates these components to make sense of the user’s argument.",
        "In this paper, we first describe our basic formalism, which is used to calculate the probability of interpretations that include only inferences, and then show how progressive enhancements of this formalism are used for more informative interpretations.",
        "In Section 2, we explain what is an argument interpretation, and describe briefly the interpretation process.",
        "Next, we discuss our probabilistic formalism for selecting an interpretation, which is the focus of this paper.",
        "In Section 4, we present 'Other model selection criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) (Box et al., 1994) also argue for model parsimony, but they do so by penalizing models with more free parameters.",

        "Interpretation graphs fill in details in the argument’s inferences, supposition configurations make sense of the beliefs in the argument, and explanatory extensions overcome belief discontinuities.",
        "Our approach resembles the work of Hobbs et al.",
        "(1993) in several respects.",
        "They employed an abductive approach where a model (interpretation) is inferred from evidence (sentence); they made assumptions as necessary; and used guiding criteria pertaining to the model and the data for choosing between candidate models.",
        "There are also significant differences between our work and theirs.",
        "Their interpretation focused on problems of reference and disambiguation in single sentences, while ours focuses on a longer discourse and the relations between the propositions therein.",
        "This distinction also determines the nature of the task, as they try to find a concise model that explains as much of the data as possible (e.g., one referent that fits many clues), while we try to find a representation for a user’s argument.",
        "Additionally, their domain knowledge is logic-based, while ours is Bayesian; and they used weights to apply their hypothesis selection criteria, while our criteria are embodied in a probabilistic framework.",
        "Plan recognition systems also generate one or more interpretations of a user’s utterances, employing different resources to fill in information omitted by the user, e.g., (Allen and Perrault, 1980; Litman and Allen, 1987; Carberry and Lambert, 1999; Raskutti and Zukerman, 1991).",
        "These plan recognition systems used a plan-based approach to propose interpretations.",
        "The first three systems applied different types of heuristics to select an interpretation, while the fourth system used a probabilistic approach moderated by heuristics to select the interpretation with the highest probability.",
        "We use a probabilistic domain representation in the form of a BN (rather than plan libraries), and apply a probabilistic mechanism that represents explicitly the contribution of background knowledge, model complexity and data fit to the generation of an interpretation.",
        "Our mechanism, which can be applied to other domain representations, balances different types of complexities and discrepancies to select the interpretation with the highest posterior probability.",
        "Several researchers used maximum posterior",
        "probability as the criterion for selecting an interpretation (Charniak and Goldman, 1993; Gertner et al., 1998; Horvitz and Paek, 1999).",
        "They used BNs to represent a probability distribution over the set of possible explanations for the observed facts, and selected the explanation (a node in the BN or a value of a node) with the highest probability.",
        "We also use BNs as our domain representation, but our “explanation” of the facts (the user’s argument) is a Bayesian subnet (rather than a single node) supplemented by suppositions.",
        "Additionally, we calculate the probability of an interpretation on the basis of the fit between the argument and the interpretation, and the complexity of the interpretation in light of the background knowledge.",
        "Our work on positing suppositions is related to research on presuppositions (Kaplan, 1982; Gurney et al., 1997) – a type of supposition implied by the wording of a statement.",
        "Like our suppositions, presuppositions are necessary to make sense of what is being said, but they operate at a different knowledge level than our suppositions.",
        "This aspect of our work is also related to research on the recognition of flawed plans (Quilici, 1989; Pollack, 1990; Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 2000).",
        "These researchers used a plan-based approach to identify erroneous beliefs that account for a user’s statements or plan, while we use a probabilistic approach.",

        "Finally, the research reported in (Joshi et al., 1984; van Beek, 1987; Zukerman and Mc-Conachy, 2001) considers the addition of information to planned discourse to prevent a user’s erroneous inferences from this discourse.",
        "Our mechanism adds explanatory extensions to an interpretation to prevent inferences that are objectionable due to discontinuities in belief.",
