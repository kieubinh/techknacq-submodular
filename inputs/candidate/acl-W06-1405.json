        "A computer agent should be individual.",

        "Similarly, characters in virtual environments should be distinctive (Ball and Breese, 2000; Rist et al., 2003).",
        "But an aspect of personality is how well you adjust to other people (and their language use): alignment.",
        "Pickering and Garrod’s Interactive Alignment Model suggests that people tend to automatically converge on lexical and syntactic choices, via a low-level mechanism of interpersonal priming (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), and Brennan has shown that people will align their language towards that of computer agents (Brennan, 1996).",
        "But it is an open issue as to whether some people are better ‘aligners’ than others.",
        "Conversely, alignment is only visible and interesting (among computer agents) if they start out being individual.",
        "We therefore set out to simulate both individuality and alignment.",
        "The paper briefly surveys the evidence for linguistic personality, for interpersonal alignment, and for interaction between them.",
        "It then sketches the current version of CRAG.",
        "CRAG-2 makes use of OPENCCG and an over-generation and ranking approach, guided by a set of language models for personality and alignment.",

        "Our current system takes a much coarser-grained approach to semantics and discourse goals than the recent projects described above, in order to take advantage of empirically-derived relations between language and personality.",
        "It should be feasible in principle to move to a more sophisticated semantics, but still retain the massive over-generation and ranking method.",
        "However, to support more perceptible variation, we need to exploit much larger personality-corpus resources than have been available up to now, and our current priority is to obtain a corpus at least an order of magnitude larger than what is currently available.",
        "This interest in individual differences and what corpora can (and cannot) tell us about them is one we share with Reiter and colleagues (Reiter and Sripada, 2004).",
        "We also plan to integrate techniques from CRAG-1 and CRAG-2, by passing the ranked output of CRAG-2 through further processing and ranking stages.",
        "Furthermore, we intend to investigate longer-ranging alignment processes, taking into account more than one previous utterance, with reduced weight by distance, to emulate memory effects.",
        "With these enhancements, we will take further steps towards our goal of simulating both individuality and alignment in believable computer agents."
