        "The present paper follows in the footsteps of Paraboni and van Deemter (2002) by focussing on hierarchically structured domains and asking whether any benefits are obtained when an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions (GRE) builds logical redundancy into the descriptions that it generates.",
        "Where Paraboni and van Deemter (2002) reported on the results of a simple experiment in which subjects were asked to say which description they preferred in a given context, the present paper describes a much more elaborate experiment, measuring how difficult it is for subjects to find the referent of a description."

        "Let us distinguish between two aspects of the ‘understanding’ of a referring expression, which we shall denote by the terms interpretation and resolution.",
        "We take interpretation to be the process whereby a hearer/reader determines the meaning or logical form of the referring expression; we take resolution to be the identification of the referent of the expression once its meaning has been determined.",
        "It is resolution that will take centerstage in our investigation.",
        "Difficulty of resolution and interpretation do not always go hand in hand.",
        "Consider sentences (1a) and (1b), uttered somewhere in Brighton but not on Lewes Road.",
        "(1a) 968 Lewes Road (1b) number 968",
        "Assume that (1a) refers uniquely.",
        "If other streets in Brighton do not have numbers above 900, then even (1b) is a unique description – but a pretty useless one, since it does not help you to find the house unless your knowledge of Brighton is exceptional.",
        "The description in (1a) is longer (and might therefore take more time to read and interpret) than (1b), but the additional material in (1a) makes resolution easier once interpretation is successfully completed.",
        "We explore how an GRE program should make use of logically redundant properties so as to simplify resolution (i.e., the identification of the referent).",
        "In corpus-based studies, it has been shown that logically redundant properties tend to be included when they fulfill one of a number of pragmatic functions, such as to indicate that a property is of particular importance to the speaker, or to highlight the speaker’s awareness that the referent has the property in question (Jordan 2000).",
        "However, redundancy has been built into GRE algorithms",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics only to a very limited extent.",
        "Perhaps the most interesting account of overspecification so far is the one proposed by Horacek (2005), where logically redundant properties enter the descriptions generated when the combined certainty of other properties falls short of what is contextually required.",
        "Uncertainty can arise, for example, if the hearer does not know about a property, or if she does not know whether it applies to the target referent.",
        "Our own work explores the need for overspecifi-cation in situations where each of the properties in question is unproblematic (i.e., certain) in principle, but where the reader has to make an effort to discover their extension (i.e., what objects are truthfully described by the property).",
        "We ask how a generator can use logically redundant information to reduce the search space within which a reader has to ‘find’ a referent.",
        "(Cf., Edmonds 1994 for a related set of problems.)",
        "A crucial question, in all such cases, is what knowledge is shared between speaker and hearer at utterance time.",
        "It will be convenient to start by focussing on the extreme case where, before the start of resolution, knows nothing about the domain.",
        "When the utterance is made, the hearer’s blindfold is removed, so to speak, and resolution can start.",
        "No similar assumption about the speaker is made: we assume that the speaker knows everything about the domain, and that he knows that the hearer can achieve the same knowledge.",
        "Many of our examples will be drawn from a simple model of a University campus, structured into buildings and rooms; the intended referent will often be a library located in one of the rooms.",

        "Each domain entity r will be",
        "Existing work on GRE tends to focus on fairly simple domains, dominated by one-place properties.",
        "When relations (i.e., two-place properties) are taken into account at all (e.g., Dale and Haddock 1991, Krahmer and Theune 2002), the motivating examples are kept so small that it is reasonable to assume that speaker and hearer know all the relevant facts in advance.",
        "Consequently, search is not much of an issue (i.e., resolution is easy): the hearer can identify the referent by simply intersecting the denotations of the properties in the description.",
        "While such simplifications permit the study of many aspects of reference, other aspects come to the fore when larger domains are considered.",
        "Interesting questions arise, for example, when a large domain is hierarchically ordered.",
        "We consider a domain to be hierarchically ordered if its inhabitants can be structured like a tree in which everything that belongs to a given node n belong to at most one of n’s children, while everything that belongs to one of n’s children belongs to n. Examples include countries divided into provinces which, in turn, may be divided into regions, etc.",

        "But, intuitively speaking, the expression creates an expectation that the referent may be found nearby, within the Watts building whereas, in fact, a match can only be found in another building.",

        "Even more confusion might occur if another library was added to our example, e.g., in Watts 110, while the intended referent was kept constant.",
        "In this case, (2c) would fail to identify the referent, of course.",
        "The expression (2b), however, would succeed, by mutually using two parts of the description (‘the library’ and ‘room 120’) to identify another: there are two libraries, and two rooms numbered 120, but there is only one pair (a, b) such that a is a library and b is a room numbered 120, while a is located in b.",
        "Such cases of mutual identification are unproblematic in small, transparent, domains where search is not an issue, but in large hierarchical domains, they are not.",
        "For, like (2d), (2b) would force a reader to search through an unnecessarily large part of the domain; worse even, the search ‘path’ that the reader is likely to follow leads via an obstacle, namely room 120 Watts, that matches a part of the description, while not being the intended referent of the relevant part of the description (i.e., room 120 Cockcroft).",
        "Confusion could easily result.",

        "What kinds of expression would existing GRE algorithms produce in the situations of interest?",
        "Since hierarchies involve relations, the first algorithm that comes to mind is the one proposed by Dale and Haddock (1991).",
        "Essentially, this algorithm combines one and two-place predicates, until a combination is found that pins down the target referent.",
        "A standard example involves a domain containing two tables and two bowls, while only one of the two tables has a bowl on it.",
        "In this situation, the combination {bowl(x), on(x, y), table(y)} identifies x (and, incidentally, also y) uniquely, since only one value of x can be used to verify the three predicates; this justifies the description ‘the bowl on the table’.",
        "This situation can be ‘translated’ directly into our university domain.",
        "Consider Figure 2, with one additional library in room 110 of the Watts building.",
        "In this situation, the com",
        "bination {library(x), in(x, y), room(y), room – number(y) = 21 identifies x (and, incidentally, also y) uniquely, because no other library is located in a room with number 120 (and no other room numbered 120 contains a library).",
        "Thus, the standard approach to relational descriptions allows precisely the kinds of situation that we have described as DE.",
        "Henceforth, we shall describe this",
        "as the Minimal Description (MD) approach to reference because, in the situations of interest, it uses the minimum number of properties by which the referent can be distinguished.",
        "Paraboni and van Deemter (2002) have sketched two GRE algorithms, both of which are guaranteed to prevent DE and LO by including logically redundant information into the generated descriptions so as to reduce the reader’s search space.",
        "These algorithms, called Full Inclusion (FI) and Scope-Limited (SL), are not the only ways in which resolution may be aided, but we will see that they represent two natural options.",
        "Both take as input a hierarchical domain D, a location d where the referring expression will materialise, and an intended referent r. Briefly, the FI algorithm represents a straightforward way of reducing the length of search paths, without particular attention to DE or LO.",
        "It lines up properties that identify the referent uniquely within its parent node, then moves up to identify this parent node within its parent node, and so on until reaching a subtree that includes the starting point d 2.",
        "Applied to our earlier example of a reference to room 120, FI first builds up the list",
        "Now that Parent(X) includes d, r has been identified uniquely within D and we reach STOP.",
        "L might be realised as e.g., ‘room 120 in Cockcroft’.",
        "FI gives maximal weight to ease of resolution.",
        "But something has to give, and that is brevity: By conveying logical redundancy, descriptions are lengthened, and this can have drawbacks.",
        "The second algorithm in Paraboni and van Deemter (2002), called SCOPE-LIMITED (SL), constitutes a compromise between brevity and ease of resolution.",
        "SL prevents DE and LO but opts for brevity when DE and LO do not occur.",
        "This is done by making use of the notion of SCOPE, hence the name of the algorithm.",
        "The difference between FI and SL becomes evident when we consider a case in which the minimally distinguishing description does not lead to DE or LO.",
        "For example, a reference to r = library would be realised by FI as ‘the library in room 120 in Cockcroft’.",
        "By using SL, however, the same description would be realised by the SL algorithm simply as ‘the library’, since there is no risk of DE or LO.",
        "With the addition of a second library in the Watts building, the behaviour of the SL algorithm would change accordingly, producing ‘the library in Cockcroft’.",
        "Similarly, had we instead included the second library under another room of Cockcroft, SL would describe r as ‘the library in room 120 of Cockcroft’, just like FI.",

        "The results suggested that human authors often prefer logically redundant references, particularly when DE and LO can arise.",

        "But in a huge room, where it is not obvious to the hearer what is on each table, search is required.",
        "It is this type of situation that there is a need for the kind of ‘studied’ redundancy embodied in FI and SL, because the minimally ‘the bowl on the table’ would not be very helpful.",
        "The new algorithms are designed for situations where the hearer may have to make an effort to uncover the relevant facts.",
        "By focussing on the benefits for the reader (in terms of the effort required for identifying the referent), we have not only substantiated the claims in Paraboni and van Deemter (2002), to the effect that it can be good to add logically redundant information to a referring expression; we have also been able to shed light on the reason why redundant descriptions are sometimes preferred (compared with the experiment in Paraboni and van Deemter (2002), which did not shed light on the reason for this preference): we can now say with some confidence that, in the circumstances specified, the generated redundant descriptions are resolved with particular ease.",
        "By counting the number of clicks that subjects need to find the referent, we believe that we may have achieved a degree of insight into the ‘resolution’ processes in the head of the reader, not unlike the insights coming out of the kind of eye-tracking experiments that have been popular in psycholinguistics for a number of years now.",
        "It would be interesting to see whether our ideas can be confirmed using such a more entrenched experimental paradigm."
