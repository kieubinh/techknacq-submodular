        "Although Multiple-Choice Test Items (MCTIs) are used daily for assessment, authoring them is a laborious task.",
        "This gave rise to a relatively new research area within the emerging field of Text-to-Text Generation (TTG) called Multiple-Choice Test Item Generation (MCTIG).1 Mitkov et al.",
        "(2006) developed a system which detects the important concepts in a text automatically and produces MCTIs testing explicitly conveyed factual knowledge.2 This differs from most related work in MCTIG such as Brown et al.",
        "(2005) and the papers in BEAUNLP-II (2005) which deploy various NLP techniques to produce MCTIs for vocabulary assessment, often using preselected words as the input (see Mitkov et al.",
        "for more extensive comparisons).",
        "The approach of Mitkov et al.",
        "is semi-automatic since the MCTIs have to be reviewed by domain experts to assess their usability.",
        "They report that semi-automatic MCTIG can be more than 3 times quicker than authoring of MCTIs without the aid of their system.",
        "1TTG, in which surface text is used as the input to algorithms for text production, contrasts with Concept-to-Text Generation (better known as Natural Language Generation) which is concerned with the automatic production of text from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Moreover, analysis of MCTIs produced semi-automatically and used in the classroom reveals that their educational value is not compromised in exchange for time and labour savings.",
        "In fact, the semi-automatically produced MCTIs turn out to fare better than MCTIs produced without the aid of the system in certain aspects of item quality.",
        "This paper reports the results of a pilot study on generating MCTIs from medical text which builds on the work of Mitkov et al."

        "a) chronic hepatitis b) hepatic failure c) hepatic encephalopathy d) hypersplenism",

        "One of our main premises is that an appropriate MCTI should have a key-term as its anchor rather than irrelevant concepts.",
        "For instance, the concepts “chronic hepatitis” and “cirrhosis” are quite prominent in the source text that example (2) comes from, which in turn means that MCTIs containing these terms should be generated using appropriate sentences from that text.",
        "RIG uses the UMLS thesaurus3 as a domain specific resource to compute an initial set of potential key terms such as “hepatitis” from the source text.",
        "Similarly to Mitkov et al., the initial set is enlarged with NPs featuring potential key terms as their heads and satisfying certain regular expressions.",
        "This step adds terms such as “acute hepatitis” (which was not included in the version of UMLS utilised by our system) to the set.",
        "The t f .",

        "did not find particularly effective) is used to promote the 30 most prominent potential key terms within the source text for subsequent processing, ruling out generic terms such as “patient” or “therapy” which are very frequent within a larger collection of medical texts (our reference corpus)."

        "They acknowledge, however, that this strategy gives rise to a lot of inappropriate source clauses, which was the case in our domain too.",
        "To address this problem, we implemented a module which filters out inappropriate structures for MCTIG (see Table 1 for examples).",
        "This explains why the number of key terms and MCTIs varies among texts (Table 2).",
        "A finite main clause which contains an NP headed by a key term and functioning as a subject or object with all the subordinate clauses which depend on it is a source clause eligible for MCTIG provided that it satisfies our filters.",

        "Once an appropriate source clause is identified, it has to be turned to the stem of a MCTI.",

        "The filtering module discussed in the previous section disregards the clauses in which the key term functions as a modifier or adjunct.",
        "Additionally, most of the key terms in the eligible source clauses appear in subject position which in turn means that wh-fronting and inversion is performed in just a handful of cases.",

        "Then, we apply a simple measure of distributional similarity derived from our reference corpus to select the best scoring distractors.",

        "Three experts in producing MCTIs for medical assessment jointly reviewed 279 MCTIs (each featuring four distractors) generated by the system.",
        "Three chapters from a medical textbook served as the source texts while a much larger collection of MEDLINE texts was used as the reference corpus.",
        "The domain experts regarded a MCTI as unusable if it could not be used in a test or required too much revision to do so.",
        "The remaining items were considered to be usable and could be post-edited by the experts to improve their content and readability or replace inappropriate distractors.",
        "As Table 2 shows, more than half of the items in total were judged to be usable.",
        "Additionally, about one fifth of the usable items did not require any editing.",
        "The Table also shows the total number of key-terms identified in each chapter as well as the average number of distractors replaced per term.",
        "The last column of Table 2 reports on the efficiency of MCTIG in our domain.",
        "This variable is calculated by dividing the total time it took the experts to review all MCTIs by the amount of usable items which represent the actual end-product.",
        "This is a bit longer than 3 minutes per usable item across all chapters.",
        "Anecdotal evidence and the experts’ own estimations suggest that it normally takes them at least 10 minutes to produce an MCTI manually.",
        "Given the distinct domains in which our system and the one of Mitkov et al.",
        "were deployed (as well as the differences between them), a direct comparison between them could be misleading.",
        "We note, however, that our usability scores are always higher than their worst score (30%) and quite close to their best score (57%).",
        "The amount of directly usable items in Mitkov et al.",
        "was between just 3.5% and 5%, much lower than what we achieved.",
        "They also report an almost 3-fold improvement in efficiency for computer-aided MCTIG, which is very similar to our estimate.",
        "These results indicate what our work has contributed to the state of the art in MCTIG.",
        "In our future work, we aim to address the following issues: (a) As in Mitkov et al., the anchor of a MCTI produced by RIG always corresponds to a key-term.",
        "However, the domain experts pointed out several cases in which it is better for the key-term to stay in the stem and for another less prominent concept to serve as the answer.",
        "(b) Students who simply memorise the input chapter might be able to answer the MCTI if its surface form is too close to the source clause so another interesting suggestion was to paraphrase the stem during MCTIG.",
        "(c) We also intend to introduce greater variability in our process for distractor selection by investigating several other measures of semantic similarity."
