        "Resolution of gaps, therefore, cannot be done as part of unification, since it depends on the disambiguated interpretation.",

        "Specifically, we propose that Interpretation of a gap (or elided VP) is the semantic interpretation of a non-lexicalized S tree.",
        "The semantic representations of lexicalized S trees under this new approach are derived compositionally, given the meaning of a nonlexicalized S tree and the meaning of a verb.",
        "Non-lexicalized trees introduce a propositional label and a propositional variable, illustrated by l2 and C above.",
        "If a tree is a transitive S-tree, there are two lambda bound variables, which correspond to the Agent and Patient features of the verb.",
        "Performing feature unifications (v3=v, v4=u,C1=C) and scope constraint disambiguations (C->l0), the proposition l2 will be reduced to: ?'u.?'v.date(v, u)(v2)(v1)= date(v1, v2).",
        "Given this proposal, we suggest that the semantics of gaps, VPE and other types of elided material is introduced by non-lexicalized trees.",
        "For example, the analysis of the sentence in (2) is shown in (7).",
        "Performing feature unifications (l2=P1, l3=P2, v=v1=v2, u=u1=u2, C=C1=C2) yields the final representation, where l2 and l3 are underspecified.",
        "There is only one disambiguation of the variable C in this sentence: C -> l0, which gives us the desired interpretation of the sentence:",
        "Resolution of the gap in this sentence is enforced by the feature structure of ‘and’, which unifies MaxS as well as Agent and Patient features.",
        "This analysis therefore accounts for the fact that gapping “is intimately entangled with the syntax of coordination (as opposed to VP ellipsis)” (Johnson 2003).",
        "On the other hand, as the next example illustrates, it is crucial that propositional variables introduced by non-lexicalized trees are not unified during semantic composition, but rather are identified with their antecedents as part of the disambiguation procedure.",
        "The sentence in (8), shown below, differs from the previous one in the presence of a negated modal.",
        "The interpretation of this modal introduces a proposition l9: can’t(N9) and a constraint P3 <_ N9 .",
        "After P3 is unified with the proposition l0, the final representation has two constraints on the variable l0: l0<_ C and l0<_ N9, and therefore two possible disambiguations.",
        "In the disambiguation 1, C is mapped to l0, introduced by the verb ‘eat’, and propositions l2 and l3 are reduced to eat(x, y) and eat(z, w).",
        "In the disambiguation 2, the variable C is mapped to l9, introduced by the modal, and l2 and l3 are reduced to can’t(eat(x, y)) and can’t(eat(z, w)).",
        "These disambiguations yield the desired interpretations of this sentence.",
        "Resolution of gaps under this analysis is done as part of the scope resolution procedure on underspecified representations.",
        "A crucial feature of this analysis is that the propositions l2 and l3 are ‘underspecified’ in the final representation and the variable C is computed during the disambiguation, i.e. when all scope ambiguities are being resolved.",
