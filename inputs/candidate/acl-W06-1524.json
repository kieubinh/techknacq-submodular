        "Before embarking upon a discussion of the consequences of Frank’s ternary branching structure, a more straightforward solution must be considered.",
        "Instead of treating it as a part of the seem-headed tree, one could attempt to formulate an argument that the prepositional phrase bearing the experiencer is introduced as a syntactic adjunct.",
        "This could be conceivably be accomplished through the use of one of the two trees of Figure 4.",
        "These are adjunct auxiliary trees, recursive on VP, which would introduce an experiencer prepositional phrase at either the left or right periphery of the VP, respectively.",
        "This tree would adjoin into the T node of an infinitival clause tree, as in Figure 1, yielding the correct string order (after substitution of the frontier DP-experiencer), for a raising sentence with a medial experiencer (2a).",
        "Frank’s discussion of this ternary structure is essentially limited to the well-formedness of its functional architecture, and the fact that a stipulation will need to be put in place to obviate the satisfaction of the T head’s EPP feature by the experiencer.",
        "While a valid point, there are still two key unanswered questions with regards to to",
        "While an anonymous reviewer points out that considering the experiencer to be an argument of seem is quite uncontroversial, there does appear to be some evidence that a prepositional phrase of this form, serving to introduce something akin to an experiencer, can exist independent of the predicate seem:",

        "b. John likes coffee to me.",
        "While the first example here sounds quite marginal to the ears of most native speakers, the second sentence is perfectly acceptable, and is a likely paraphrase of a sentence such as John seems/appears to like coffee to me.",
        "This suggests at least the possibility that the prepositional phrase bearing the experiencer might be considered an adjunct'.",
        "However, in the case of a sentence such as (2a), it can be easily demonstrated that adjunction of the prepositional phrase as an independent auxiliary tree is not an option.",
        "Adjunction of the right-recursive VP tree of Figure 4 into the VP node of either tree of Figure 1 would, after all the trees were composed, yield one of the following string orders:",

        "This provides clear evidence that the mechanics of TAG derivation force an analysis where at least the medial experiencer must enter the derivation as a part of the seem auxiliary, giving further thrust to the contention that the experiencer here is indeed an argument of seem.",
        "In turning to the experiencer in final position, matters are less clear-cut, as there is a viable structure in which the prepositional phrase can adjoin to the seem auxiliary and appear at the end of the sentence, using the left-recursive tree of Figure 4.",
        "Recalling the examples of (3), it is possibly even more important to establish the argumenthood of this position, as there are strikingly similar sentences in which the equivalent prepositional phrase appears to be a bona fide adjunct.",
        "For the final experiencers of seem, evidence can be provided to show that the prepositional phrase is not opaque to extraction, and therefore not an adjunct:",

        "In (5a), it is quite clear that the experiencer can be relativised out of the final position with no difficulty at all.",
        "Similarly, the stripping case in (5b), where it also seems to Mary’s boss that John likes coffee, indicates that the experiencer her boss can be extraposed from the sentence final position, and the rest of the sentence stripped away.",
        "Finally, the use of a resumptive pronoun to repair the complex noun phrase constraint violation in (5c) provides further proof that the final-position prepositional phrase is not opaque to extraction.",
        "This is thus an argument position, part of the seem-headed auxiliary.",

        "At first glance, Frank’s ternary branching structure is reminiscent of early accounts of ditransitive verbs.",
        "Such structures were famously argued against in Larson (1988), and subsequently re-examined in Harley (2002).",
        "In these treatments, a ternary structure is replaced with a VP-shell structure, as schematised in Figure 5.",
        "In the lower VP, the goal and theme of a ditransitive verb are projected as the specifier and complement, respectively.",
        "The verb itself then raises to an upper VP, which supports the agent of the ditransitive predicate.",
        "The motivation for adopting this structure lay in the observation of c-command phenomena between the goal and theme",
        "positions.",
        "In a flat ternary structure, mutual c-command between these two positions would be expected, however Larson gives considerable data to argue that mutual c-command does not exist between these two positions.",
        "In looking at the tree from Figure 3, it is clear that straightforward considerations of mutual c-command will not be informative, as one of the ternary branches of the seem-headed tree will contain the remainder of the embedded clause material which exists below the T adjunction site.",
        "However, what can be observed is whether or not a c-command relation exists between the experiencer of seem and the embedded clause theme.",
        "This will speak to the matter of the possible transposition of the VP complements: if they do indeed exist in a flat structure, then the experiencer should c-command the embedded clause theme from both the medial and final positions2.",
        "In Storoshenko (2006), it is argued that a seem auxiliary with an experiencer should be analysed with a similar VP-shell analysis.",
        "Among the evidence provided, three of Larson’s c-command tests are employed to illustrate that the experiencer of seem does c-command the embedded clause object when in the medial position:",
        "(6) a. John seems to nobody to like anything.",
        "(NPI Licensing) b. John seems to every boy to like him .",

        "(Superiority)",
        "For negative polarity licensing and bound variable readings to obtain in these cases, the experiencer must c-command the direct object.",
        "Similarly, the fact that extraction of the embedded clause theme (which would not in itself be the product of an ill-formed elementary tree), is ungrammatical here.",
        "This is a straightforward superiority violation, again illustrating that the experiencer c-commands the embedded theme.",
        "The opposite is demonstrated to be the case where the experiencer is in the final position:",
        "(7) a.",
        "* John seems to like anything to nobody.",
        "b. John seems to like him to every boy .",
        "c. What does John seem to like t to whom?",
        "Here, the negative polarity item is not licensed, and a bound variable reading does not obtain.",
        "However, the embedded theme can be extracted in the case where the experiencer is in the final position.",
        "These results demonstrate that in the final position, the experiencer does not c-command the embedded object, contrary to what would be expected of a flat ternary structure like that of Figure 4.",
        "The experiencer must not be in a position where it c-commands the embedded clause material beneath T .",
        "The elementary trees for seem with an experiencer in medial and final position, respectively, are given in Figure 6.",
        "As in the case of the ditransitive structure of Figure 5, there is verb movement here.",
        "The lower VP supports the experiencer and the T foot node, essential if recursivity is to be maintained, while seem itself raises to an upper VP projection.",
        "Unlike the ditransitive case, seem projects no position for an agent argument, which retains Frank’s argumentation for having an elementary tree rooted in",
        "T .",
        "Crucially, this movement is licensed within TAG, as it remains local to this one elementary tree, and has no impact upon the recursive nature of the tree.",
        "In terms of the relationship between the two experiencer positions, there are two possibilities, both of which have been explored in the parallel literature on ditransitives.",
        "In the pattern of Larson (1988), the two trees of Figure 6 would be derivationally related, one having been derived from the other.",
        "Countering this is the approach of Harley (2002), in which similar alternations are argued to be the result of lexically distinct (yet phonetically indistinguishable) predicates projecting different syntactic structures.",
        "The second argument is taken in Storoshenko (2006): there is no derivational relationship between the two trees Figure 6.",
        "Each is headed by a seem predicate which specifies whether the experiencer appears in the medial or final position.",
        "Beyond c-command facts, there is additional evidence that such an articulated structure for seem may be required.",
        "An anonymous reviewer comments that the opening of potential adjunction sites is a common motivation for binarism over ternary structures in TAG-based syntax.",
        "In this case, neither the seem-headed tree of Figure 1 or 3 will account for the position of a VP-adjoined manner or temporal adjunct modifying the raising predicate:",

        "b. John seemed for as long as we knew him to like coffee.",
        "Assuming these adjuncts to be introduced through elementary trees recursive on VP, only the presence of the lower VP node in the shell structure allows for an adjunction into the seem auxiliary which yields the correct string order.",
