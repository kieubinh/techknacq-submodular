        "Over recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of precision grammars in NLP tasks, due to advances in parsing algorithm development, grammar development tools and raw computational power (Oepen et al., 2002b).",
        "Precision grammars are defined as implemented grammars of natural language which capture fine-grained linguistic distinctions, and are generative in the sense of distinguishing between grammatical and ungrammatical inputs (or at least have some inbuilt notion of linguistic “markedness”).",
        "Additional characteristics of precision grammars are that they are frequently bidirectional, and output a rich semantic abstraction for each spanning parse of the input string.",
        "Examples include DELPH-IN grammars such as the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2002; Uszkoreit, 2002), the various PARGRAM grammars (Butt et al., 1999), and the Edinburgh CCG parser (Bos et al., 2004).",
        "Due to their linguistic complexity, precision grammars are generally hand-constructed and thus restricted in size and coverage.",
        "Attempts to (semi-)automate the process of expanding the coverage of precision grammars have focused on either: (a) constructional coverage, e.g. in the form of error mining for constructional expansion (van Noord, 2004; Zhang and Kordoni, 2006), or relaxation of lexico-grammatical constraints to support partial and/or robust parsing (Riezler et al., 2002); or (b) lexical coverage, e.g. in bootstrapping from a preexisting grammar and lexicon to learn new lexical items (Baldwin, 2005a).",
        "Our particular interest in this paper is in the latter of these two, that is the development of methods for automatically expanding the lexical coverage of an existing precision grammar, or more broadly deep lexical acquisition (DLA hereafter).",
        "In this, we follow Baldwin (2005a) in assuming a semi-mature precision grammar with a fixed inventory of lexical types, based on which we learn new lexical items.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we focus specifically on supertagging as the mechanism for hypothesising new lexical items.",
        "Supertagging can be defined as the process of applying a sequential tagger to the task of predicting the lexical type(s) associated with each word in an input string, relative to a given grammar.",
        "It was first introduced as a means of reducing parser ambiguity by Bangalore and Joshi (1999) in the context of the LTAG formalism, and has since been applied in a similar context within the CCG formalism (Clark and Curran, 2004).",
        "In both of these cases, supertagging provides the means to perform a beam search over the plausible lexical items for a given string context, and ideally reduces parsing complexity without sacrificing parser accuracy.",
        "An alternate application of supertagging is in DLA, in postulating novel lexical items with which to populate the lexicon of a given grammar to boost parser coverage.",
        "This can take place",
        "either: (a) off-line for the purposes of rounding out the coverage of a static lexicon, in which case we are generally interested in globally maximising precision over a given corpus and hence predicting the single most plausible lexical type for each word token (off-line DLA: Baldwin (2005b)); or (b) on the fly for a given input string to temporarily expand lexical coverage and achieve a spanning parse, in which case we are interested in maximising recall by producing a (possibly weighted) list of lexical item hypotheses to run past the grammar (on-line DLA: Zhang and Kordoni (2005)).",
        "Our immediate interest in this paper is in the first of these tasks, although we would ideally like to develop an off-line method which is trivially portable to the second task of on-line DLA.",
        "In this research, we focus particularly on the Grammar Matrix-based DELPH-IN family of grammars (Bender et al., 2002), which includes grammars of English, Japanese, Norwegian, Modern Greek, Portuguese and Korean.",
        "The Grammar Matrix is a framework for streamlining and standardising HPSG-based multilingual grammar development.",
        "One property of Grammar Matrix-based grammars is that they are strongly lexical-ist and adhere to a highly constrained lexicon-grammar interface via a unique (terminal) lexical type for each lexical item.",
        "As such, lexical item creation in any of the Grammar Matrix-based grammars, irrespective of language, consists predominantly of predicting the appropriate lexical type for each lexical item, relative to the lexical hierarchy for the corresponding grammar.",
        "In this same spirit of standardisation and multilingual-ity, the aim of this research is to develop maximally language-independent supertagging methods which can be applied to any Grammar Matrix-based grammar with the minimum of effort.",
        "Essentially, we hope to provide the grammar engineer with the means to semi-automatically populate the lexicon of a semi-mature grammar, hence accelerating the pace of lexicon development and producing a resource of sufficient coverage to be practically useful in NLP tasks.",
        "The contributions of this paper are the development of a pseudo-likelihood conditional random field-based method of supertagging, which we then apply to the task of off-line DLA for grammars of both English and Japanese with only minor language-specific adaptation.",
        "We show the supertagger to outperform previously-proposed supertagger-based DLA methods.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 outlines past work relative to this research, and Section 3 reviews the resources used in our supertagging experiments.",
        "Section 4 outlines the proposed supertagger model and reviews previous research on supertagger-based DLA.",
        "Section 5 then outlines the set-up and results of our evaluation."

        "According to Baldwin (2005b), research on DLA falls into the two categories of in vitro methods, where we leverage a secondary language resource to generate an abstraction of the words we hope to learn lexical items for, and in vivo methods, where the target resource that we are hoping to perform DLA relative to is used directly to perform DLA.",
        "Supertagging is an instance of in vivo DLA, as it operates directly over data tagged with the lexical type system for the precision grammar of interest.",
        "Research on supertagging which is relevant to this paper includes the work of Baldwin (2005b) in training a transformation-based learner over data tagged with ERG lexical types.",
        "We discuss this method in detail in Section 5.2 and replicate this method over our English data set for direct comparability with this previous research.",
        "As mentioned above, other work on supertagging has tended to view it as a means of driving a beam search to prune the parser search space (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark and Curran, 2004).",
        "In supertagging, token-level annotations (gold-standard, automatically-generated or otherwise) for a given DLR are used to train a sequential tagger, akin to training a POS tagger over POS-tagged data taken from the Penn Treebank.",
        "One related in vivo approach to DLA targeted specifically at precision grammars is that of Fou-vry (2003).",
        "Fouvry uses the grammar to guide the process of learning lexical items for unknown words, by generating underspecified lexical items for all unknown words and parsing with them.",
        "Syntactico-semantic interaction between unknown words and preexisting lexical items during parsing provides insight into the nature of each unknown word.",
        "By combining such fragments of information, it is possible to incrementally arrive at a consolidated lexical entry for that word.",
        "That is, the precision grammar itself drives the incremental learning process within a parsing context.",
        "An alternate approach is to compile out a set of word templates for each lexical type (with the important qualification that they do not rely on preprocessing of any form), and check for corpus occurrences of an unknown word in such contexts.",
        "That is, the morphological, syntactic and/or semantic predictions implicit in each lexical type are made explicit in the form of templates which represent distinguishing lexical contexts of that lexical type.",
        "This approach has been shown to be particularly effective over web data, where the sheer size of the data precludes the possibility of linguistic preprocessing but at the same time ameliorates the effects of data sparseness inherent in any lexi-calised DLA approach (Lapata and Keller, 2004).",
        "Other work on DLA (e.g. Korhonen (2002), Joanis and Stevenson (2003), Baldwin (2005a)) has tended to take an in vitro DLA approach, in extrapolating away from a DLR to corpus or web data, and analysing occurrences of words through the conduit of an external resource (e.g. a secondary parser or POS tagger).",
        "In vitro DLA can also take the form of resource translation, in mapping one DLR onto another to arrive at the lexical information in the desired format."

        "In this section, we outline the resources targeted in this research, namely the English Resource Grammar (ERG: Flickinger (2002), Copestake and Flickinger (2000)) and the JACY grammar of Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002).",
        "Note that our choice of the ERG and JACY as testbeds for experimentation in this paper is somewhat arbitrary, and that we could equally run experiments over any Grammar Matrix-based grammar for which there is treebank data.",
        "Both the ERG and JACY are implemented open-source broad-coverage precision Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammars (HPSGs: Pollard and Sag (1994)).",
        "A lexical item in each of the grammars consists of a unique identifier, a lexical type (a leaf type of a type hierarchy), an orthography, and a semantic relation.",
        "For example, in the English grammar, the lexical item for the noun dog is simply:",
        "in which the lexical type of n - c le encodes the fact that dog is a noun which does not sub-categorise for any other constituents and which is countable, \"dog\" specifies the lexical stem, and \" dog n 1 rel\" introduces an ad hoc predicate name for the lexical item to use in constructing a semantic representation.",
        "In the context of the ERG and JACY, DLA equates to learning the range of lexical types a given lexeme occurs with, and generating a single lexical item for each.",
        "Recent development of the ERG and JACY has been tightly coupled with treebank annotation, and all major versions of both grammars are deployed over a common set of dynamically-updateable treebank data to help empirically trace the evolution of the grammar and retrain parse selection models (Oepen et al., 2002a; Bond et al., 2004).",
        "This serves as a source of training and test data for building our supertaggers, as detailed in Table 1.",
        "In translating our treebank data into a form that can be understood by a supertagger, multiword expressions (MWEs) pose a slight problem.",
        "Both the ERG and JACY include multiword lexical items, which can either be strictly continuous (e.g. hot line) or optionally discontinuous (e.g. transitive English verb particle constructions, such as pick up as in Kim picked the book up).",
        "Strictly continuous lexical items are described by way of a single whitespace-delimited lexical stem (e.g.",
        "STEM < \"hot line\" >).",
        "When faced with instances of this lexical item, the supertagger must perform two roles: (1) predict that the words hot and line combine together to form a single lexeme, and (2) predict the lexical type associated with the lexeme.",
        "This is performed in a single step through the introduction of the ditto lexical type, which indicates that the current word combines (possibly recursively) with the left-adjacent word to form a single lexeme, and shares the same lexical type.",
        "This tagging convention is based on that used, e.g., in the CLAWS7 part-of-speech tagset.",
        "Optionally discontinuous lexical items are less of a concern, as selection of each of the discontinuous “components” is done via lexical types.",
        "E.g. in the case of pick up, the lexical entry looks as follows:",
        "in which \"pick\" selects for the up p s e l re l predicate, which in turn is associated with the stem \"up\" and lexical type p prtcl le.",
        "In terms of lexical tag mark-up, we can treat these as separate",
        "tags and leave the supertagger to model the mutual interdependence between these lexical types.",
        "For detailed statistics of the composition of the two grammars, see Table 1.",
        "For morphological processing (including to-kenisation and lemmatisation), we use the preexisting machinery provided with each of the grammars.",
        "In the case of the ERG, this consists of a finite state machine which feeds into lexical rules; in the case of JACY, segmentation and lem-matisation is based on a combination of ChaSen (Matsumoto et al., 2003) and lexical rules.",
        "That is, we are able to assume that the Japanese data has been pre-segmented in a form compatible with JACY, as we are able to replicate the automatic preprocessing that it uses."

        "It is encouraging to note that type precision is higher than type recall in all cases (a phenomenon that is especially noticeable for the ERG), as this means that while we are not producing the full inventory of lexical items for a given lexeme, over half of the lexical items that we produce are genuine (with CRF ).",
