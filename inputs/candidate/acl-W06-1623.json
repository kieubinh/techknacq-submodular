        "Understanding the temporal flow of discourse is a significant aspect of text comprehension.",
        "Consequently, temporal analysis has been a focus of linguistic research for quite some time.",
        "Temporal interpretation encompasses levels ranging from the syntactic to the lexico-semantic (Re-ichenbach, 1947; Moens and Steedman, 1987) and includes the characterization of temporal discourse in terms of rhetorical structure and pragmatic relations (Dowty, 1986; Webber, 1987; Pas-sonneau, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993).",
        "Besides its linguistic significance, temporal analysis has important practical implications.",
        "In multidocument summarization, knowledge about the temporal order of events can enhance both the content selection and the summary generation processes (Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "In question answering, temporal analysis is needed to determine when a particular event occurs and how events relate to each other.",
        "Some of these needs can be addressed by emerging technologies for temporal analysis (Wilson et al., 2001; Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Boguraev and Ando, 2005).",
        "This paper characterizes the temporal flow of discourse in terms of temporal segments and their ordering.",
        "We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988).",
        "A segment may contain more than one event or state, but the key requirement is that its elements maintain temporal coherence.",
        "For instance, a medical case summary may contain segments describing a patient’s admission, his previous hospital visit, and the onset of his original symptoms.",
        "Each of these segments corresponds to a different time frame, and is clearly delineated as such in a text.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to automatically construct a graph that encodes ordering between temporal segments.",
        "The key premise is that in a coherent document, temporal progression is reflected in a wide range of linguistic features and contextual dependencies.",
        "In some cases, clues to segment ordering are embedded in the segments themselves.",
        "For instance, given a pair of adjacent segments, the temporal adverb next day in the second segment is a strong predictor of a precedence relation.",
        "In other cases, we can predict the right order between a pair of segments by analyzing their relation to other segments in the text.",
        "The interaction between pairwise ordering decisions can easily be formalized in terms of constraints on the graph topology.",
        "An obvious example of such a constraint is prohibiting cycles in the ordering graph.",
        "We show how these complementary sources of information can be incorporated in a model using global inference.",
        "We evaluate our temporal ordering algorithm on a corpus of medical case summaries.",
        "Temporal",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics analysis in this domain is challenging in several respects: a typical summary exhibits no significant tense or aspect variations and contains few absolute time markers.",
        "We demonstrate that humans can reliably mark temporal segments and determine segment ordering in this domain.",
        "Our learning method achieves 83% F-measure in temporal segmentation and 84% accuracy in inferring temporal relations between two segments.",
        "Our contributions are twofold: Temporal Segmentation We propose a fully automatic, linguistically rich model for temporal segmentation.",
        "Most work on temporal analysis is done on a finer granularity than proposed here.",
        "Our results show that the coarse granularity of our representation facilitates temporal analysis and is especially suitable for domains with sparse temporal anchors.",
        "Segment Ordering We introduce a new method for learning temporal ordering.",
        "In contrast to existing methods that focus on pairwise ordering, we explore strategies for global temporal inference.",
        "The strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to simultaneously optimize pairwise ordering preferences and global constraints on graph topology.",
        "While the algorithm has been applied at the segment level, it can be used with other temporal annotation schemes."

        "Typical tasks include identification of temporal anchors, linking events to times, and temporal ordering of events.",
        "Since this paper addresses temporal ordering, we focus our discussion on this task.",
        "Existing ordering approaches vary both in terms of the ordering unit – it can be a clause, a sentence or an event – and in terms of the set of ordering relations considered by the algorithm.",
        "Despite these differences, most existing methods have the same basic design: each pair of ordering units (i.e., clauses) is abstracted into a feature vector and a supervised classifier is employed to learn the mapping between feature vectors and their labels.",
        "Features used in classification include aspect, modality, event class, and lexical representation.",
        "It is important to note that the classification for each pair is performed independently and is not guaranteed to yield a globally consistent order.",

        "To evaluate segment ordering, we employ leave-one-out cross-validation on 30 annotated TDAGs that overall contain 13,088 edges in their transitive closure.",
        "In addition to the three global inference algorithms, we include a majority baseline that classifies all edges as forward, yielding a chronological order.",
        "Our results for ordering the manually annotated temporal segments are shown in Table 1.",
        "All inference methods outperform the baseline, and their performance is consistent with the complexity of the inference mechanism.",
        "As expected, the ILP strategy, which supports exact global inference, achieves the best performance – 84.3%.",
        "An additional point of comparison is the accuracy of the pairwise classification, prior to the application of global inference.",
        "The accuracy of the local ordering is 81.6%, which is lower than that of ILP.",
        "The superior performance of ILP demonstrates that accurate global inference can further refine local predictions.",
        "Surprisingly, the local classifier yields a higher accuracy than the two other inference strategies.",
        "Note, however, the local ordering procedure is not guaranteed to produce a consistent TDAG, and thus the local classifier cannot be used on its own to produce a valid TDAG.",
        "Table 2 shows the ordering results at the clausal level.",
        "The four-way classification is computed using both manually and automatically generated segments.",
        "Pairs of clauses that belong to the same segment stand in the equal relation, otherwise they have the same ordering relation as the segments to which they belong.",
        "On the clausal level, the difference between the performance of ILP and BF is blurred.",
        "When evaluated on manually-constructed segments, ILP outperforms BF by less than 1%.",
        "This unexpected result can be explained by the skewed distribution of edge types – the two hardest edge types to classify (see Table 3), backward and null, account only for 7.4% of all edges at the clause level.",
        "When evaluated on automatically segmented text, ILP performs slightly worse than BF.",
        "We hypothesize that this result can be explained by the difference between training and testing conditions for the pairwise classifier: the classifier is trained on manually-computed segments and is tested on automatically-computed ones, which negatively affects the accuracy on the test set.",
        "While all the strategies are negatively influenced by this discrepancy, ILP is particularly vulnerable as it relies",
        "on the score values for inference.",
        "In contrast, BF only considers the rank between the scores, which may be less affected by noise.",
        "We advocate a two-stage approach for temporal analysis: we first identify segments and then order them.",
        "A simpler alternative is to directly perform a four-way classification at the clausal level using the union of features employed in our two-stage process.",
        "The accuracy of this approach, however, is low – it achieves only 74%, most likely due to the sparsity of clause-level representation for four-way classification.",
        "This result demonstrates the benefits of a coarse representation and a two-stage approach for temporal analysis."
