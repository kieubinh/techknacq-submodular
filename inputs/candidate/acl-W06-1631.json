        "Arabic words are derived from roots having three, four, or, in rare instances, five characters.",

        "Each root word matches a base pattern.",
        "Characters are added at the beginning, the middle, or end of the root, but the base characters that match the pattern remain unchanged.",
        "The pronunciation of Arabic characters is associated with short vowels; these are represented by diacritics, and attached to other characters to show how the characters should be pronounced.",
        "An Arabic character can be pronounced in several different ways.",
        "For example, the letter u� with the",
        "diacritic Fatha u is pronounced /ba/, with the diacritic Kasra u is pronounced /bi/, and with having the diacritic Damma u is pronounced /bo/.",
        "Diacritics are not shown in general written Arabic, and the reader must rely on the context to determine the implicit diacritics and therefore the pronunciation of each word.",
        "For example, the word `,Aa can represent (/Oahaba/ = went),",
        "Pure Arabic words follow restricted rules in their construction to keep them short and easy to pronounce.",
        "Their sounds usually follow the CVCV pattern, where C stands for a consonant and V stands for a Vowel.",
        "An Arabic word never has two consecutive consonants nor four consecutive vowels (Al-Shanti, 1996).",
        "Foreign words are words that are borrowed from other languages.",
        "Some are remodelled to conform with Arabic word paradigms, and become part of the Arabic lexicon; others are transliterated into Arabic as they are pronounced by different Arabic speakers, with some segmental and vowel changes.",
        "The latter are called Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words as they are not found in a standard Arabic lexicon.",
        "Such OOV words are increasingly common due to the inflow of information from foreign sources, and include terms that are either new and have yet to be translated into native equivalents, or proper nouns that have had their phonemes replaced by Arabic ones.",
        "Examples include words such as �uf�h /margr�t/ (Margaret) or `�����/links/ (Linux).",
        "This process often results in different Arabic spellings for the same word.",

        "One solution to this problem has been used in cross-lingual information retrieval, where OOV words in the query are transliterated into their possible equivalents.",
        "Transliterating terms in English queries into multiple Arabic equivalents using an English-Arabic dictionary has been shown to have a positive impact on retrieval results (Abduljaleel and Larkey, 2003).",
        "However, we are aware of no work on handling OOV terms in Arabic queries.",
        "For this, proper identification of foreign words is essential.",
        "Otherwise, query expansion for such words is not likely to be effective: many Arabic words could be wrongly expanded, resulting in long queries with many false transliterations of Arabic words.",
        "Furthermore, proper identification of foreign words would be helpful because such words could then be treated differently using techniques such as approximate string matching (Zobel and Dart, 1995).",
        "In this paper, we examine possible techniques to identify foreign words in Arabic text.",
        "In the following sections we categorise and define foreign words in Arabic, and follow in section 2 with a discussion of possible different approaches that can identify them in Arabic text.",
        "In section 3 we present an initial evaluation of these approaches, and describe improvements in section 4 that we then explore in a second experiment in section 5.",

        "Those that have no such letters are considered foreign (Al-Shanti, 1996).",
        "However, while such rules could be useful for linguistic purposes, they have limited application in Information Retrieval (IR); based on rules, many foreign words that have long been absorbed into the language and are spelled consistently would be considered to be OOV.",
        "From the IR perspective, foreign words can be split into two",

        "This often involves the use of a bilingual dictionary to translate queries and transliterate OOV words into their equivalents in Arabic.",
        "Expanding a foreign word to its possible variants in a query has been shown to increase the precision of search results (Abduljaleel and Larkey, 2003).",

        "In contrast, we aim to identify foreign words as a within Arabic text which is made difficult by the absence of such easily perceptible difference.",

        "Of these, only 900 names were successfully transliterated to their source names.",
        "While this approach can be used to identify transliterated foreign words, its effectiveness is not known on normal Arabic words as only names were used to test the algorithm.",

        "However, current lexicons are relatively small, and the variety of Arabic inflection makes it very difficult to include all correct word forms.",
        "Furthermore, current lexicons include many foreign words; for example when using OLA approach, 1017 foreign words out of 1218 are OOV, indicating that about 200 foreign words are present in that lexicon.",
        "The pattern approach is more efficient but the lack of diacritics in general written Arabic makes it very difficult to precisely match a pattern with a",
        "word, resulting in many foreign words being incorrectly identified as Arabic.",
        "Passing the list of all 3 046 manually judged foreign words to the pattern approach, some 2 017 words of this list were correctly judged as foreign, and about one third (1029) were incorrectly judged to be Arabic.",
        "The n-gram method produced reasonable precision compared to the lexicon-based methods.",
        "In contrast, TRG had the worst results.",
        "This could be due to the limited size of the training corpus.",
        "However, we expect that improvements to this approach will remain limited due to the fact that many Arabic and foreign words share the same trigrams.",
        "It is clear that all the approaches are improved dramatically when applying the enhancement rules.",
        "The improvements of the NGR wasn’t as equal as other approaches.",
        "This is because some of the rules are implicitly applied within the n-gram approach.",
        "The lack of diacritics also makes it very difficult to distinguish between certain foreign and Arabic words.",
        "For example, without diacritics, the word .rcould be (/klIn ton/ = Clinton), or l� � (/kalinatin/ = as two date trees).",
        "The pronunciation is different in the two cases, but only context or diacritics can make it clear which word is being used."

        "Identifying foreign words in Arabic text is an important problem for cross-lingual information retrieval, since commonly-used techniques such as stemming should not be applied indiscriminately to all words in a collection.",
        "We have presented three approaches for identifying foreign words in Arabic text: lexicons, patterns, and n-grams.",
        "We have presented results that show that the lexicon approach outperforms the other approaches, and have described improvements to minimise the false identification of foreign words.",
        "These rules result in improved precision, but have a small negative impact on recall.",
        "Overall, the results are relatively low for practical applications, and more work is needed to deal with this problem.",
        "As foreign words are characterised by having different versions, an algorithm that collapse those versions to one form could be useful in identifying foreign words.",
        "We are presently exploring algorithms to normalise foreign words in Arabic text.",
        "This will allow us to identify normalised forms for foreign words and use a single consistent version for indexing and retrieval."
