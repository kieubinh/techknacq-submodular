        "The structure into which a particular protein folds has a lower energy than all other possible structures.",
        "In protein structure prediction, the task is thus to find the lowest-energy physical structure for an input sequence of amino acids, given a representation of possible structures and a function that assigns an energy score to these structures.",
        "There is therefore a natural analogy between these two seemingly unrelated computational problems.",
        "Based on this analogy, we propose an adaptation of the CKY chart parsing algorithm to protein structure prediction, using a well-known simplified model of proteins as proof of concept.",
        "Models of protein folding additionally aim to explain the process by which this structure formation takes place, and their validity depends not only on the accuracy of the predicted structures, but also on their physical plausibility.",
        "One common proposal in the biophysical literature is that the folding process is hierarchical, and that folding routes are tree-shaped.",
        "CKY provides an explicit computational recipe to efficiently search (and return) all possible folding routes.",
        "This sets it apart from existing folding algorithms, which are typically based on Monte Carlo simulations, and can only sample one possible trajectory.",
        "Since we believe that there is much scope for future work in applying statistical parsing techniques to more detailed models of proteins, a secondary aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to the research questions that arise in protein folding to the NLP community.",
        "Proteins are essential components of the cells of any living organism, and their biological function (eg.",
        "as enzymes that catalyze certain reactions) depends on their three-dimensional structure.",
        "However, genes only specify the linear, sequence of the amino acids, and the ribosome (the cell’s “protein factory”) uses this information to assemble the polypeptide chain.",
        "Under “natural” conditions, these polypeptide chains then fold rapidly and spontaneously into their unique final structures, or native states.",
        "Therefore, protein folding is often referred to as the second half of the genetic code, and the ability to predict the native state for a primary sequence is great practical importance, eg.",
        "in drug design, or in our understanding of the genome.",
        "Levinthal (1968), who was the first to frame the folding process as a search problem, showed that folding cannot be guided by a random, exhaustive search: he argued that a chain of 150 amino acids has on the order of 10300 possible structures, but since folding takes only a few seconds, not more 108 of these structures can be searched.",
        "Under the assumption that a better understanding of the physical folding process will ultimately be required to design accurate structure prediction techniques, this observation has lead researchers to try to identify sequence-specific pathways along which folding may proceed or a general mechanism that makes this process so fast and reliable.",

        "Thus, all the information that is necessary to determine the folded structure has to be encoded in the primary sequence.",

        "in terms of the coordinates of its atoms) to the free energies of the corresponding structures.",
        "The native state is assumed to be the global minimum of this function.",
        "This is again analogous to statistical parsing, where the correct analysis is assumed to be the structure with the highest probability.",
        "In the case of proteins, we can use the laws of physics to determine the energy function, whereas in language, the “energies” have to be estimated from corpora.l The energy H of a single protein structure depends essentially on the interactions (contacts) between side-chains and on the bond angles along the backbone, whereas the entropy S also depends on the surrounding solvent (water).",
        "It is this impact on S which creates the hydrophobic effect.",
        "For simplicity’s sake most computational models use an implicit solvent energy function, which captures the hydrophobic effect by assuming that the contact energies between hydrophobic side-chains are particularly favorable.",

        "It is this similarity between inter-residue contacts and word-word dependencies that grammar-based approaches (Searls, 2002) exploit.",
        "The set of contacts for a given structure can be represented as a polymer graph, although often only the edges of this graph are given in the form of a contact map (a triangular matrix whose entry Cy corresponds to the contact between the ith and jth residue).",

        "the surface of the energy function for all possible structures of a given chain).",
        "Folding is fastest if the landscape is funnel-shaped (ie.",

        "has many local minima) or golf-course shaped (ie.",
        "all structures except for the native state have the same, high, energy), folding is slow.",
        "In the first case, energetic barriers slow down the folding process: the chain gets stuck in local minima, or kinetic traps.",
        "Such traps correspond to structures that contain “incorrect” (non-native) contacts which have to be broken (thus increasing the energy) before the native state can be reached.",
        "In the case of a plateau in the landscape, the search for the native state is slowed down by entropic barriers, i.e. a situation where a large number of equivalent structures with the same energy are accessible.",

        "the assumption that folding is a greedy search – that local moves in the landscape can successfully identify the global minimum.",

Our assumption also implies that in a sequence uvw, contacts between v and w or between v and u have to be formed before or at the same time as contacts between u and w. Trees provide a unified representation of the growth and assembly process assumed by hierarchical folding theories: A growth step corresponds to a local tree in which a non-terminal node and a leaf node are combined, whereas an assembly step corresponds to a local tree in which two non-terminal nodes are combined.",

        "This paper has demonstrated that an adaptation of the CKY chart parsing algorithm can be suc-ccessfully applied to protein folding in the 2D HP model, a commonly used simplified lattice model which captures essential physical and computational properties of the real folding process.",
        "Both syntactic parsing and protein folding algorithms search for the globally optimal structure for a given input string.",
        "And any given sentence has a large number of possible interpretations, just as any amino acid sequence has an astronomical number of possible spatial conformations.",
        "Therefore it is not surprising if similar techniques can be applied to both tasks.",
        "In both cases, it seems to be possible to exploit locally available information with a greedy, hierarchical search strategy, which starts with local, independent searches for small substrings (to first determine which small phrases might make sense, or to find partially stable peptide structures) and then either: (a) ‘grows’ one substring into a larger substring, or (b) ‘assembles’ two substrings together into a larger substring.",
        "More interestingly, in the protein folding case, such recursive hierarchical search strategies, which imply tree-shaped folding routes, have been postulated independently for biological and biophysical reasons.",
        "This may indicate a deeper, natural connection between these two processes.",
        "Given that hierarchical search strategies for protein folding have been proposed in the biological literature, our primary interest here has been the question of whether a greedy, hierarchical search as implemented in CKY is able to identify the native state of proteins in the HP model.",
        "The research presented here aims to verify these predictions with an explicit computational model.",
        "Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) or A search (Klein and Manning, 2003) may well be able to improve.",
        "We also plan to adapt this technique to other, more realistic, representations of proteins, and to longer sequences.",
        "For longer sequences, we will take advantage of the fact that CKY is easily paral-lelizable, since any operation which combines the entries of two cells chart i k and chart k 1 j is completely independent of other parts of the chart.",
        "If the routes by which proteins fold really are trees, a dynamic programming technique such as CKY is inherently suited to model this process, since it is the most efficient way to search all possible trees.",
        "This distinguishes it from more established techniques such as Monte Carlo, which can only follow one trajectory at a time, and require multiple runs to sample the underlying landscape to a sufficient degree.",
        "What CKY by itself does",
        "not give us is an accurate prediction of the rates that govern the folding process, including misfold-ing and unfolding events.",
        "However, we believe that it is possible to obtain this information from the chart by extracting all tree cuts (which cor-resond to the states of the chain at different stages during the folding process) and calculating folding rates between them.",
        "Our work is only the beginning of a larger research program: eventually we would like to be able to model the folding process of real proteins.",
        "One aim of this paper was therefore to point out the fundamental similarities between statistical parsing and protein folding.",
        "We believe that this is a fertile area for future work where other natural language processing techniques may also prove to be useful."
