        "With the rapid growth of audiovisual materials available over the web, effective language modeling of the diverse content, both in style and topic, becomes essential for efficient access and management of this information.",
        "As a prime example, successful language modeling for academic lectures not only enables the initial transcription via automatic speech recognition, but also assists educators and students in the creation and navigation of these materials through annotation, retrieval, summarization, and even translation of the embedded content.",
        "Compared with other types of audio content, lecture speech often exhibits a high degree of spontaneity and focuses on narrow topics with specific terminology (Furui, 2003; Glass et al., 2004).",
        "Unfortunately, training corpora available for language modeling rarely match the target lecture in both style and topic.",
        "While transcripts from other lectures better match the style of the target lecture than written text, it is often difficult to find transcripts on the target topic.",
        "On the other hand, although topic-specific vocabulary can be gleaned from related text materials, such as the textbook and lecture slides, written language is a poor predictor of how words are actually spoken.",
        "Furthermore, given that the precise topic of a target lecture is often unknown a priori and may even shift over time, it is generally difficult to identify topically related documents.",
        "Thus, an effective language model (LM) need to not only account for the casual speaking style of lectures, but also accommodate the topic-specific vocabulary of the subject matter.",
        "Moreover, the ability of the language model to dynamically adapt over the course of the lecture could prove extremely useful for both increasing transcription accuracy, as well as providing evidence for lecture segmentation and information retrieval.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the application of the syntactic state and semantic topic assignments from the Hidden Markov Model with Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to the problem of language modeling.",
        "We explore the use of these context-dependent labels to identify style and learn topics from both a large number of spoken lectures as well as written text.",
        "By dynamically interpolating lecture style models with topic-specific models, we obtain language models that better describe the subtopic structure within a lecture.",
        "Initial experiments demonstrate a 16.1% perplexity reduction and a 2.4% WER reduction over an adapted trigram baseline.",
        "In the following sections, we first summarize related research on adaptive and topic-mixture language models, and describe previous work on the HMM-LDA model.",
        "We then examine the ability of the model to learn syntactic classes as well as topics from textbook materials and lecture transcripts.",
        "Next, we describe a variety of language model experiments we performed to combine style and topic models constructed from the state and topic labels with conventional trigram models trained from both spoken and written materials.",
        "We also demonstrate the use of the combined model in an on-line adaptive mode.",

        "By interpolating with a conditional trigram cache model, Goodman (2001) demonstrated up to 34% decrease in perplexity over a trigram baseline for small training sets.",
        "The cache intuition has been extended by attempting to increase the probability of unobserved but topically related words.",
        "Specifically, given a mixture model with topic-specific components, we can increase the mixture weights of the topics corresponding to previously observed words to better predict the next word.",
        "Some of the early work in this area used a maximum entropy language model framework to trigger increases in likelihood of related words (Lau et al., 1993; Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "A variety of methods has been used to explore topic-mixture models.",
        "To model a mixture of topics within a document, the sentence mixture model (Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999) builds multiple topic models from clusters of training sentences and defines the probability of a target sentence as a weighted combination of its probability under each topic model.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has been used to cluster topically related words and has demonstrated significant reduction in perplexity and word error rate (Belle-garda, 2000).",

        "Gildea and Hofmann (1999) demonstrated noticeable perplexity reduction via dynamic combination of these unigram topic models with a generic trigram model.",
        "To identify topics from an unlabeled corpus, (Blei et al., 2003) extends PLSA with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that describes each document in a corpus as generated from a mixture of topics, each characterized by a word unigram distribution.",
        "Hidden Markov Model with LDA (HMM-LDA) (Griffiths et al., 2004) further extends this topic mixture model to separate syntactic words from content words whose distributions depend primarily on local context and document topic, respectively.",
        "In the specific area of lecture processing, previous work in language model adaptation has primarily focused on customizing a fixed n-gram language model for each lecture by combining n-gram statistics from general conversational speech, other lectures, textbooks, and other resources related to the target lecture (Nanjo and Kawahara, 2002, 2004; Leeuwis et al., 2003; Park et al., 2005).",
        "Most of the previous work on topic-mixture models focuses on in-domain adaptation using large amounts of matched training data.",
        "However, most, if not all, of the data available to train a lecture language model are either cross-domain or cross-style.",

        "Unfortunately, since different lectures cover different topics, we generally cannot tune the topic mixture weights ahead of time.",
        "One approach, without any a priori knowledge of the target lecture, is to adaptively estimate the optimal mixture weights as we process the lecture (Gildea and Hofmann, 1999).",
        "However, since the topic distribution shifts over a long lecture, modeling a lecture as an interpolation of components with fixed weights may not be the most optimal.",
        "Instead, we employ an exponential decay strategy where we update the current mixture distribution by linearly interpolating it with the posterior topic distribution given the current word.",
        "Specifically, applying Bayes’ rule, the probability of topic t generating the current word w is given by:",
        "To achieve the exponential decay, we update the topic distribution after each word according to Pi+1(t) = (1 – )•Pi(t) + •P(t |wi), where is the adaptation rate.",
        "We evaluated this approach of dynamic mixture weight adaptation on the (L+T+S+D+Topic 100) model, with the same set of components as the cheating experiment with static weights.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the dynamic model actually outperforms the static model by more than 1% in perplexity, by better modeling the dynamic topic substructure within the lecture.",
        "To run the recognizer with a dynamic LM, we rescored the top 100 hypotheses generated with the (L+T+S+D) model using the dynamic LM.",
        "The WER obtained through such n-best rescoring yielded noticeable improvements over the (L+T+S+D) model without a priori knowledge of the topic distribution, but did not beat the optimal static model on the test set.",
        "To further gain an intuition for mixture weight adaptation, we plotted the normalized adapted weights of the topic models across the first lecture of the test set in Figure 9.",
        "Note that the topic mixture varies greatly across the lecture.",
        "In this particular lecture, the lecturer starts out with a review of the previous lecture.",
        "Subsequently, he shows an example of computation using accumulators.",
        "Finally, he focuses the lecture on stream as a data structure, with an intervening example that finds pairs of i and j that sum up to a prime.",
        "By comparing the topic labels in Figure 9 with the top words from the corresponding topics in Figure 10, we observe that the topic weights obtained via dynamic adaptation match the subject matter of the lecture fairly closely.",
        "Finally, to assess the effect that word error rate has on adaptation performance, we applied the adaptation algorithm to the corresponding transcript from the automatic speech recognizer (ASR).",
        "Traditional cache language models tend to be vulnerable to recognition errors since incorrect words in the history negatively bias the prediction of the current word.",
        "However, by adapting at a topic level, which reduces the number of dynamic parameters, the dynamic topic model is less sensitive to recognition errors.",
        "As seen in Figure 9, even with a word error rate around 40%, the normalized topic mixture weights from the ASR transcript still show a strong resemblance to the original weights from the manual reference transcript."

        "In this paper, we have shown how to leverage context-dependent state and topic labels, such as the ones generated by the HMM-LDA model, to construct better language models for lecture transcription and extend topic models beyond traditional unigrams.",
        "Although the WER of the top recognizer hypotheses exceeds 45%, by dynamically updating the mixture weights to model the topic substructure within individual lectures, we are able to reduce the test set perplexity and WER by over 16% and 2.4%, respectively, relative to the combined Lectures and Textbook (L+T) baseline.",
        "Although we primarily focused on lecture transcription in this work, the techniques extend to language modeling scenarios where exactly matched training data are often limited or nonexistent.",
        "Instead, we have to rely on appropriate combination of models derived from partially matched data.",
        "HMM-LDA and related techniques show great promise for finding structure in unlabeled data, from which we can build more sophisticated models.",
        "The experiments in this paper combine models primarily through simple linear interpolation.",
        "As motivated in section 5.2, allowing for context-dependent interpolation weights based on topic",
        "labels may yield significant improvement for both perplexity and WER.",
        "Thus, in future work, we would like to study algorithms for automatically learning appropriate context-dependent interpolation weights.",
        "Furthermore, we hope to improve the convergence properties of the dynamic adaptation scheme at the start of lectures and across topic transitions.",
        "Lastly, we would like to extend the LDA framework to support speaker-specific adaptation and apply the resulting topic distributions to lecture segmentation."
