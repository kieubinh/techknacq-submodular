        "Most attempts to monitor the campaign performance of presidential candidates focus on public opinion, which is influenced by the consumption of media products.",
        "Analyzing patterns of political communication, however, should include the consumption as well as the production of content (Howard 2003).",
        "Monitoring candidates' coverage on the Web provides a complementary source of empirical data and window into the evolving concept of electronic democracy (Dutton, El-berse et al.",
        "1999).",
        "A recent Pew/Internet survey (Horrigan, Garrett et al.",
        "2004) found that four out of ten US Internet users aged 18 or older accessed political material during the 2004 presidential campaign, up 50 percent from the 2000 campaign.",
        "For political news in general, more than two thirds of American broadband users and over half the dial-up users seek Web sites of national news organizations.",
        "International news sites are the second most popular category at 24 and 14 percent, respectively.",
        "As traditional media extend their dominant position to the online world, analyzing their Web sites should therefore reflect the majority of political content accessed by the average user."

        "Representative democracy offers significant possibilities for exploiting information networks (Holmes 2002), but there is little agreement on their specific impact.",
        "Proponents praise the networks’ potential to increase the accessibility of information, encourage participatory decision-making, and facilitate communication with policy officials and like-minded citizens.",
        "From an advocate’s perspective, disseminating environmental information via the Internet, directly or through news media, creates awareness by emphasizing the interdependency of ecological, economic, and social issues (Scharl 2004).",
        "Critics portray McLuhan’s global village as a “neofeudal manor with highly fortified and opulent castles (centers of industrial, financial, and media power) surrounded by vast hinterlands of working peasants clamoring for survival and recognition” (Tehranian 1999, p55f.).",
        "They argue that information networks polarize society by linking groups with similar political views.",
        "Low-overhead forms of personal publishing (Gruhl, Guha et al.",
        "2004) such as Web logs and online discussion forums, for example, might reinforce a group’s world view and shun opposing opinions.",
        "This reinforcement, amplified by biased media coverage, polarizes groups (Sunstein 2004) and degrades the climate of public discourse (Horrigan, Garrett et al.",
        "2004).",
        "The communication strategies of news media, corporations and advocacy organizations affect democratic processes.",
        "Yet they only condition, rather than determine these processes.",
        "Assuming",
        "deterministic effects of information networks neglects the world’s ambivalence, and results in conflicting claims regarding the networks’ political impact.",
        "News media are free to choose which candidate to emphasize, and how to interpret current events (Wayne 2001).",
        "Most Americans prefer unbiased news sources (Horrigan, Garrett et al.",
        "2004), but Web sites tend to reflect their owners’ political agenda, and thus contribute to a polarized electorate.",
        "While a narrow margin decided the last two US presidential elections, differences in the candidates’ positions became more pronounced in 2004, and the political deliberation more partisan.",
        "Partisans tend to perceive mass media content as biased against their point of view.",
        "Explanations for this hostile media effect range from selective recall (preferentially remembering hostile content), selective categorization (perceiving the same content differently) and conflicting standards (considering hostile content as invalid or irrelevant).",

        "Given an increasingly polarized electorate and hostile media effects that impair partisans’ judg-ment, analyzing political Web content requires objective measures of organizational bias.",
        "Yet the volume and dynamic nature of Web documents complicate testing the assumption of organizational bias.",
        "To address this challenge, the US Election 2004 Web Monitor sampled 1,153 Web sites in weekly intervals.",
        "The project drew upon the Newslink.org, Kidon.com and ABYZ-NewsLinks.com directories to compile a list of 42 US news organizations and 72 international sites from four other English-speaking countries: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.",
        "To extend the study, the sample included the Web sites of the Fortune 1000 (the largest US corporations ranked by revenue) and 39 environmental organizations.",
        "Considering the dynamics of Web content in general and presidential campaigns in particular (Howard 2003), a crawling agent mirrored these Web sites by following their hierarchical structure until reaching 50 megabytes of textual data for news media, and 10 megabytes for commercial and advocacy sites.",
        "These limits help compare sites of heterogeneous size, and reduce the dilution of top-level information by content in lower hierarchical levels (Scharl 2000).",
        "Such a collection of recorded content used for descriptive analysis is often referred to as corpus.",
        "This research investigated and visualized regularities in three groups of Web sites by applying methods from corpus linguistics and textual statistics (Biber, Conrad et al.",
        "1998; Lebart, Salem et al.",
        "1998; McEnery and Wilson 2001).",
        "Quantitative textual analysis of Web documents necessitates three steps in order to yield a useful machine-readable representation (Lebart, Salem et al.",
        "1998):",
        "• The first step converts hypertext documents into plain text – i.e., processing the gathered data and eliminating markup code and scripting elements.",
        "• The second step segments the textual chain",
        "into minimal units by removing coding ambiguities such as punctuation marks, the case of letters, hyphens, or points in abbreviations.",
        "In the case of the Election Monitor, this process yielded about half a million documents each week, comprising about 125 million words in 10 million sentences.",
        "The system then identified and removed redundant segments such as headlines and news summaries, whose appearance on multiple pages distorts frequency counts.",
        "• The third step, identification, groups identical units and counts their occurrences – i.e., creating an inventory of words, or multi-word units of meaning (Danielsson 2004).",
        "The frequency of candidate references presented in the following section is based on such an exhaustive index, which often uses decreasing frequency of occurrence as the primary sorting criterion and lexicographic order as the secondary criterion."

        "Compared to the news media, the other two samples showed more bias.",

Bush – particularly abandoning the Kyoto Treaty ratification, and reducing air pollution controls through the Clear Skies Act.",

        "In terms of energy policy, for example, one such analysis investigated Web coverage of renewable energy, fossil fuels and nuclear power – a crucial aspect in light of recent geopolitical events and the global environmental impact of US energy policy decisions.",
        "On a micro level, the Election Monitor’s Web site allowed users to list sentences containing both candidate references and energy-related terms, and sort these sentences by semantic orientation.",
