        "In an Information Retrieval engine the answers are very often less justified by the context than it is the case with Question Answering systems.",

        "This evaluation, made almost automatically with the corpus EQueR, focuses mainly on factual or definition types of requests which defines the majority of the requests concerned in the QA system evaluation campaigns.",
        "On more complex questions, like those beginning by \"comment\" (\"how...\"), the QA systems obtained less satisfying results than for factual questions but, on this type of questions, the search engines like Google proved to be also less accurate.",
        "A more exhaustive and thorough study on these types of requests or on questions beginning by \"pourquoi\" (\"why\") would possibly confirm these results, although here only a few questions were of these types.",
        "At last, a similar metrics and applied evaluation remain to be endeavoured on a web-based corpus despite the entailing difficulties."
