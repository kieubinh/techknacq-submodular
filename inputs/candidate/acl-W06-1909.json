        "The semantic' QA system that was turned into a web QA system is InSicht.",
        "It relies on complete sentence parsing, inferences, and semantic representation matching and comprises six main steps.",
        "In the document processing step, all documents from a given collection are transformed into a standard XML format (CES, corpus encoding standard, see http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/) with word, sentence, and paragraph borders marked up by XML elements w, s, and p, respectively.",
        "Then, all preprocessed documents are parsed by WOCADI (Hartrumpf, 2003) yielding a syntactic dependency structure and, more importantly, a semantic representation, a semantic network of the MultiNet formalism (Helbig, 2006) for each document sentence.",
        "The parser can produce intersentential coreference links for a document.",
        "In the second step (query processing), the user’s question is parsed by WOCADI.",
        "Determining the sentence type (here, often a subtype of question) is especially important because it controls some parts of two later steps: query expansion and answer generation.",
        "Next comes query expansion: Equivalent and similar semantic networks are derived from the original query network by means of lexico-'Semantic in the sense that formal semantic representations of documents and questions are automatically produced by a parser and form the system center.",
        "semantic relations from HaGenLex (Hagen German Lexicon, (Hartrumpf et al., 2003)) and a lexical database (GermaNet), equivalence rules, and inferential rules like entailments for situations (applied in backward chaining).",
        "The result is a set of disjunctively connected semantic networks that try to cover many possible kinds of representations of sentences possibly containing an explicit or implicit answer to the user’s question.",
        "In the fourth step (semantic network matching), all document sentences matching at least one of the semantic networks from query expansion are collected.",
        "A two-level approach is chosen for efficiency reasons.",
        "First, an index of concepts (disambiguated words with IDs from the lexicon) is consulted with the relevant concepts from the query networks.",
        "Second, the retrieved documents are compared sentence network by sentence network to find a match with a query network.",
        "Answer generation is next: Natural language (NL) generation rules are applied to semantic networks that match a query network in order to generate an NL answer string from the deep semantic representations.",
        "The sentence type and the semantic network control the selection of generation rules.",
        "The rules also act as a filter for uninformative or bad answers.",
        "The results are tuples of generated answer string, numerical score, supporting document ID, and supporting sentence ID.",
        "To deal with different answer candidates, an answer selection step is required.",
        "It realizes a quite simple but successful strategy that combines a preference for more frequent answers and a preference for more elaborate answers.",
        "The best answers (by default only the single best answer) and the supporting sentences are presented to the user that posed the question.",
        "The first step, document processing, is run off-line in InSicht; it is run online in InSicht-W3 to avoid unacceptable parsing costs before the system can be used.",
        "The remaining five steps will be left mostly unchanged for InSicht-W3, in parts just differently parameterized."

      "text": [
        "As in other applications, a web search engine can be used (as a first level) to preselect possibly relevant documents for the task at hand (here, answering a question posed by a user).",
        "In InSicht-W3, the web is accessed when similar and equivalent semantic networks have been generated during query expansion.",
        "Clearly, one cannot directly use this semantic representation for retrieving document URLs from any service out there on the web – at least till the arrival of a web annotated with formal NL semantics.",
        "One must transform the semantic networks to an adequate level; in many web search engines, this is the level of search terms connected in a Boolean formula using and and or.",
        "To derive a search engine query from a semantic network, all lexical concepts from the semantic network are collected.",
        "For example, question qa04 068 from QA @ CLEF 2004 in example (1) leads to the semantic network depicted in Fig. 1 (and related semantic networks; for a QA@CLEF 2004 question, 4.8 additional semantic networks on average).",
        "The lexical concepts are roughly speaking those concepts (represented as nodes in graphical form) whose names are not of the form c1, c2, etc.",
        "The lexical concepts are named after the lemma of the",
        "corresponding word plus a numerical homograph identifier and a numerical reading identifier.",
        "As current web search engines provide no (or only rough) lemmatization for German, one must go one step further away from the semantic network by generating full forms for each word belonging to a lexical concept.",
        "(Others have tried a similar approach; for example, Neumann and Sacaleanu (2005) construct IR queries which can be easily adapted to different IR engines.)",
        "In the example, the node sitzen.1.1 (to sit) leads to 26 different full forms (shown below in example (2)).",
        "These forms can be used as search terms; as alternatives, they are connected disjunctively.",
        "Thus for each semantic network from query expansion, a conjunction of disjunctions of word forms is constructed.",
        "Word forms can belong to words not occurring in the question because query expansion can introduce new concepts (and thereby new words), e.g. by inferential rules.",
        "The Boolean formulae for several semantic networks are connected disjunctively and the resulting formula is simplified by applying logical equivalences.",
        "What one can pass to a web search engine as a prese-lection query for question (1) is shown in prefix notation in example (2):",

        "There are several problems related to breaking down a semantic network representation into a Boolean formula over word forms.",
        "For example, lexical concepts that do not stem from a surface form in the question should be excluded from the query.",

        "1 (‘last name’) which the named entity subparser of WOCADI installs in the semantic network when constructing the semantic representation of a human being whose last name is specified in the text (see Fig. 1).",

        "(plus proximity information3) vs. concepts within (possibly normalized) semantic representations of sentences (or texts).",
        "This level mismatch deteriorates the precision of the first level and thereby the recall of the second level.",
        "The latter might be surprising.",
        "The precision of the first level (viewed in isolation) is not problematic because the second level achieves the same precision no matter how low the precision of the first level is.",
        "But precision does matter because the limited number of documents that the first level can return and that the second level can efficiently process might lead to not seeing relevant documents (i.e. lower recall) or at least to seeing them much later (which can imply unacceptable answer times).",
        "Or to put it differently: Very low precision in the first level can lead to lower recall of the whole multilevel system if there are any retrieval set limits for the first level.",
        "At the end of the first level, the retrieved web documents are simplified by a script that uses the text dump function of the lynx web browser to extract the textual content.",
        "The resulting document representations can be processed by InSicht.",
        "3.3 Deficiencies of Web Search Engines Web search engines typically restrict the length of queries, e.g. to 1000 bytes, 1500 bytes, or 10 terms.",
        "But the rich morphology of languages like German can lead to long and complex preselection queries so that one needs to reduce preselection queries as far as possible (e.g. by dropping rare word forms).",
        "An additional strategy is to split the query into several independent subqueries.",
        "The QA system is currently based on matching semantic representations with the granularity of a sentence only.",
        "Thus one would achieve much better precision if the web search engine allowed a same-sentence operator or at least a proximity operator (often named NEAR) of say 50 words which ignores linguistic units like sentences and paragraphs but suffices for our goals.",
        "Although some web search engines once had some kind of proximity operator, currently none of the search engines with large indices and Boolean queries seems to offer this facility."

        "InSicht-W3’s approach needs more time, especially if the web pages are not in the local cache that InSicht-W3 maintains in order to reduce its bandwidth requirements."

        "In this paper, an existent textual QA system was extended and modified to work successfully on the German web as a virtual document collection.",
        "The main results are: precision-oriented extensions and experimentally derived parameter settings are needed to achieve similar performance on the vast web as on small-sized document collections that show higher homogeneity and quality of the contained texts; taking a semantic QA system to the web is feasible as demonstrated in this paper, but answering a question is still expensive in terms of bandwidth and CPU time.",
        "There are several interesting directions for future work.",
        "The first level of InSicht-W3 can be improved by finding a better suited search engine or by building and running a new one in a distributed manner.",
        "Ideally, it should support arbitrarily complex Boolean queries, parameterized proximity operators like NEAR/N (N E {1, 2,..., 100}), or even linguistically informed operators like same-sentence and same -paragraph.",
        "The second level (the textual QA system) can be improved by acquiring more inferential knowledge to allow better query expansion.",
        "The matching approach can be extended from the unit sentence to a larger linguistic unit like paragraph, text, and even text collection.",
        "Distributed architectures and algorithms can reduce answer times."
