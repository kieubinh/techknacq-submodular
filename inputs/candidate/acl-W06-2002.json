        "Much of the current research into probabilistic parsing is founded on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001).",
        "For instance, consider the parse tree in Figure 1.",
        "One way to decompose this parse tree is to view it as a sequence of applications of CFG rules.",
        "For this particular tree, we could view it as the application of rule “NP → NP PP,” followed by rule “NP → DT NN,” followed by rule “DT → that,” and so forth.",
        "Hence instead of analyzing P(tree), we deal with the more modular: P(NP → NP PP, NP → DT NN, DT → that, NN → money, PP → IN NP, IN → in, NP → DT NN, DT → the, NN → market) Obviously this joint distribution is just as difficult to assess and compute with as P(tree).",
        "However there exist cubic time algorithms to find the most likely parse if we assume that all CFG rule applications are marginally independent of one another.",
        "In other words, we need to assume that the above expression is equivalent to the following:",
        "It is straightforward to assess the probability of the factors of this expression from a corpus using relative frequency.",
        "Then using these learned probabilities, we can find the most likely parse of a given sentence using the aforementioned cubic algorithms.",
        "The problem, of course, with this simplification is that although it is computationally attractive, it is usually too strong of an independence assumption.",
        "To mitigate this loss of context, without sacrificing algorithmic tractability, typically researchers annotate the nodes of the parse tree with contextual information.",
        "For instance, it has been found to be useful to annotate nodes with their parent labels (Johnson, 1998), as shown in Figure 2.",
        "In this case, we would be learning probabilities like: P(PP-NP → IN-PP NP-PP).",
        "The choice of which annotations to use is one of the main features that distinguish parsers based on this approach.",
        "Generally, this approach has proven quite effective in producing English phrase-structure grammar parsers that perform well on the Penn Treebank.",
        "One drawback of this approach is that it is somewhat inflexible.",
        "Because we are adding probabilistic context by changing the data itself, we make our data increasingly sparse as we add features.",
        "Thus we are constrained from adding too",
        "many features, because at some point we will not have enough data to sustain them.",
        "Hence in this approach, feature selection is not merely a matter of including good features.",
        "Rather, we must strike a delicate balance between how much context we want to include versus how much we dare to partition our data set.",
        "This poses a problem when we have spent time and energy to find a good set of features that work well for a given parsing task on a given domain.",
        "For a different parsing task or domain, our parser may work poorly out-of-the-box, and it is no trivial matter to evaluate how we might adapt our feature set for this new task.",
        "Furthermore, if we gain access to a new source of feature information, then it is unclear how to incorporate such information into such a parser.",
        "Namely, in this paper, we are interested in seeing how the cross-lingual information contained by sentence alignments can help the performance of a parser.",
        "We have a small gold-standard corpus of shallow-parsed parallel sentences (in English, French, and German) from the Europarl corpus.",
        "Because of the difficulty of testing new features using PCFG-based parsers, we propose a new probabilistic parsing framework that allows us to flexibly add features.",
        "The closest relative",
        "of our framework is the maximum-entropy parser of Ratnaparkhi(Ratnaparkhi, 1997).",
        "Both frameworks are bottom-up, but while Ratnaparkhi’s views parse trees as the sequence of applications of four different types of tree construction rules, our framework strives to be somewhat simpler and more general."

        "The example parse tree in Figure 1 can also be decomposed in the following manner.",
        "First, we can represent the unlabeled tree with a boolean-valued chart (which we will call the span chart) that assigns the value of true to a span if it is a constituent in the tree, and false otherwise.",
        "The span chart for Figure 1 is shown in Figure 3.",
        "To represent the labels, we simply add similar charts for each labeling scheme present in the tree.",
        "For a parse tree, there are typically three types of labels: words, preterminal tags, and nonterminals.",
        "Thus we need three labeling charts.",
        "Labeling charts for our example parse tree are depicted in Figure 4.",
        "Note that for words and preterminals, it is not really necessary to have a two-dimensional chart, but we do so here to motivate the general model.",
        "The general model is as follows.",
        "Define a labeling scheme as a set of symbols including a special symbol null (this will designate that a given span is unlabeled).",

        "Define a model variable of L as a symbol of the form Sij or Lkij, for positive integers i, j, k, such that j ≥ i and k ≤ m. The domain of model variable Sij is {true, false} (these variables indicate whether a given span is a tree constituent).",
        "The domain of model variable Lk ij is Lk (these variables indicate which label from Lk is assigned to span",

        "null denotes an unlabeled span.",
        "i, j).",
        "Define a model order of L as a total ordering Ω of the model variables of L such that for all i, j, k: Ω(Sij) < Ω(Lk ij) (i.e. we decide whether a span is a constituent before attempting to label it).",
        "Let Ωn denote the finite subset of Ω that includes precisely the model variables of the form Sij or Lkij, where j ≤ n. Given a set L of labeling schemes and a model order Ω of L, a preliminary generative story might look like the following:",
        "1.",
        "Choose a positive integer n. 2.",
        "In the order defined by Ωn, assign a value to every model variable of Ωn from its domain, conditioned on any previous assignments made.",
        "Thus some model order Ω for our example might instruct us to first choose whether span (4, 5) is a constituent, for which we might say “true,” then instruct us to choose a label for that constituent, for which we might say “NP,” and so forth.",
        "There are a couple of problems with this generative story.",
        "One problem is that it allows us to make structural decisions that do not result in a well-formed tree.",
        "For instance, we should not be permitted to assign the value true to both variable S13 and S24.",
        "Generally, we cannot allow two model variables Sij and Skl to both be assigned true if they properly overlap, i.e. their spans overlap and one is not a subspan of the other.",
        "We should also ensure that the leaves and the root are considered constituents.",
        "Another problem is that it allows us to make labeling decisions that do not correspond with our chosen structure.",
        "It should not be possible to label a span which is not a constituent.",
        "With this in mind, we revise our generative story.",
        "1.",

        "2.",

        "Automatically assign the value false if there exists a properly overlapping model variable Skl such that Skl has already been assigned the value true.",
        "ii.",

        "(b) If x = Lkij, then: i.",

        "other model variables, given n, the Lword ijvari-ables, and the LPG variables.",
        "These assumptions allow us to express P(tree |n, L �ord, LPG) as the following:",
        "where PS and Pk obey the constraints given in the generative story above (e.g. PS(Sii = true) = 1, etc.)",
        "Obviously it is impractical to learn conditional distributions over every conceivable history, so instead we choose a small set F of feature variables, and provide a set of functions Fn that map every partial history of Ωn to some feature vector f ∈ F (later we will see examples of such feature functions).",
