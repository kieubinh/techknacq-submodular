        "Advanced NLP applications such as question answering require deep semantic interpretation.",
        "In this context, prepositions play an important role since they encode relational information.",
        "The proper semantic analysis of prepositional phrases is faced with various problems: (1) There is the well-known problem of attachment ambiguities.",
        "(2) Prepositions are highly polysemous, i.e. their interpretation is typically context dependent.",
        "(3) Prepositions often occur in collocations, where their interpretation is irregular.",
        "Although a large amount of work in the NLP community has focused on resolving attachment ambiguities, there are only first steps towards a systematic description of preposition semantics which has sufficient coverage for NLP applications (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005; Saint-Dizier, 2005).",
        "The automatic interpretation of prepositions in English has been tackled, for example, by Litkowski (2002), who presents hand-crafted disambiguation rules, and O’Hara and Wiebe (2003), who propose a statistical approach based on collocations.",
        "However, in order to be applicable for semantic inference, the representation of preposition semantics should ideally be integrated within a full-fledged knowledge representation formalism.",
        "In spite of the broad linguistic investigations on preposition semantics,1 the corresponding results have seldom found their way into real NLP applications.",
        "Information retrieval systems, on the other hand, which claim to use NLP techniques often do not cope with the semantic content of prepositions at all (even if they bear the term semantic in their title, as with Latent Semantic Analysis (Letsche and Berry, 1997)).",
        "In many cases prepositions are even dropped as stop words in such systems.",
        "If one really wants to syntactico- semantically analyze texts and derive formal semantic representations, the interpretation of prepositions and especially the disambiguation of their different readings is a central problem in Indoeuropean languages like English, French, Russian, and German.",
        "In this paper we describe the semantic treatment of this problem for German, using the knowledge representation formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet) (Helbig, 2006).",
        "The advantage of this approach is its applicability to different languages and different processes of automatic natural language understanding.",
        "Since MultiNet complies with the criteria of universality, homogeneity, and interoperability (Helbig, 2006, Chapter 1), it can be used to formalize the semantics of lexemes (Hartrumpf et al.,",

      "heading": "2 General Classes of PP Interpretation",
      "text": [
        "The semantic interpretation of prepositions in NLP has to deal with the following two orthogonal phenomena: regular (or compositional or productive) vs. irregular (or non-compositional or col-locative) uses of prepositions and uses in complements vs. uses in adjuncts (putting aside the well-known issue of borderline cases).2 There are thus the four cases indicated in Table 1.",
        "In German, PPs can occur also as invariant syntagmas in light verb constructions ( ‘Funktionsverbgef¨uge’) such as in Beschlag nehmen (‘to occupy’), to which the complement-adjunct distinction does not apply.",
        "In the following, we keep aside the interpretation of prepositions in fixed phrases, which is the case for the light verb constructions just mentioned and also for the irregular adjunct interpretation shown at the lower right of Table 1.",
        "This leaves us with three types of PP interpretation: (regular) adjunct interpretation, regular complement interpretation, and irregular complement interpretation.",
        "The standard examples for regular adjunct interpretation are local (or directional) and temporal PPs, which can be attached to verbs, nouns, and adjectives:",
        "(1) a.",

        "They met in August.",
        "(2) a. the building on the hill b. the debate on Wednesday 2See also (Rauh, 1993).",
        "Notice that German, unlike English, allows adjectives with PP adjuncts (or complements) as attributes of nouns, witness (3).",
        "It is characteristic of regular adjunct interpretation that the preposition has a meaning of its own and expresses some sort of relationship.",
        "Besides local and temporal specifications, there are of course many other relationships expressed by regular PP adjuncts such as instrumental (4-a), comitative (4-b), and part-whole (4-c) interpretations.3 (4) a. John cleaned the floor with his shirt.",
        "b. Mary visited London with her sister.",
        "c. a building with large windows",
        "The examples in (4) furthermore illustrate the well known fact that prepositions are highly polysemous in general.",
        "Within our approach described in Sect.",
        "4, prepositions currently have up to sixteen readings.4 We speak of a regular complement interpretation if the PP is subcategorized and its interpretation is identical to the (correct) interpretation of the PP when analyzed as an adjunct.",
        "These adjunct interpretations of PPs are defined by the set of PP rules, which are explained in Sect.",
        "4.2.",
        "Examples of regular complements are wohnen in/auf/.. .",
        "(‘to live in/on/... ’), schicken nach/in/... (‘to send to/into/.",
        ".. ’), mitkommen mit (‘to come along with’), and Einstieg in (‘getting in’).",
        "Here, the choice of the preposition in the PP complement of the lexeme is determined by the semantic characterization of the complement.",
        "In the case of irregular complement interpretation, in contrast, the selection of the preposition is an idiosyncratic property of the subcategorizing lexical entry.",
        "The preposition alone can be viewed as semantically empty; only the combination of",
        "the lexeme and the preposition bears semantics.",
        "Examples for verbs, adjectives, and nouns of this sort are glauben an (‘to belief in’), sich verlassen auf (‘to depend on’), gut in (‘good at’), and Wut auf (‘anger at’).",
        "It should be noted, however, that there is a whole spectrum of subregular phenomena within what we called “irregular” complement semantics.5 Consider, for instance, the verbs ernennen zu, bestimmen zu (‘appoint’, ‘designate’), k¨uren zu (‘elect’), and weihen zu (‘ordain’).",
        "Even if the preposition zu (‘to’) could be said to semantically express some sort of abstract goal in these cases, an adequate interpretation rule associated with that preposition would have to make reference to a rather restricted semantic class of verbs.",
        "We regard it therefore as a matter of lexical semantic organization to capture such subregularities within the interpretation of prepositional complements by means of appropriate semantic verb templates in the lexicon; see (Osswald et al., 2006) for details.",
        "In the context of the present paper, an interpretation of a prepositional complement is called irregular if the interpretation is not covered by one of our PP interpretation rules.",
        "Table 2 show the frequency of adjunct and complement interpretations in different corpora.",
        "The numbers in the token rows are derived from automatic corpus parses (see below), so there is some noise to be expected, but the trends should be valid."
