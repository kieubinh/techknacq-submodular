(Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), (Curran and Moens, 2002)) are the essential distinguishing features of the approaches.",

        "The angle between the vectorial representations of two terms is used in calculation of thematic closeness (Lafourcade and Prince, 2001).",
        "The approach is more closely related to our approach since it offers a quantitative metric to measure the degree of synonymy between two lexical items.",
        "In contrast, Turney (Turney, 2001) tries to solve a quite simpler “TOEFL-like” task of selecting a synonym to a given word from a set of words.",

        "The advantage of the graph model is its transitivity: not only terms in the immediate context but also semantically related terms that have a short path to the examined term (but perhaps have never occurred in its immediate context) can contribute to identification of related terms.",
        "The similarity metric can be intuitively derived from the distance between the lexical vertices in the graph.",

        "Another syntactic rearrangement takes place when detachable prefixes are attached to the corresponding main verb.",
        "In German some prefixes of verbs are detached and located at the end of the main clause.",

        "After all sentences from the text corpus have been added to the lexical graph, vertices (words) with a low frequency (< 0) are removed from the graph to primarily accelerate the distance calculation.",
        "Such rarely occurring words are usually proper nouns, abbreviations, typos etc.",

        "Experimental results feature even a slightly better performance on filtered graphs.",
        "To preserve semantic consistency of the graph and compensate removal of existing paths the connections between the predecessors and successors of removed vertices have to be taken into account: the edge length e(p, s) between the predecessor p to the successor s of the removed vertex r can incorporate the length of the path length(p, r, s) from p to s through r by calculating the halved harmonic mean:",
        "duced the smaller length(p, r, s) is and if they are equal, e(p, s) is half as long after merging.",

        "Distances are calculated by the Dijkstra algorithm with an upper threshold O.",
        "Once the distances from a certain vertex reach the threshold, the calculation for this vertex is aborted and the not calculated distances are considered infinite.",

        "In both cases the top-ranked word has the maximum likelihood of 1 to be a synonym of vi.",
        "The normalized ranked lists are used for the comparison of different metrics and the evaluation of the approach (see sec. 5).",
        "A similarity metric is supposed to assess the semantic similarity between two vertices of the lexical graph.",
        "Since the distance metric Dis-tanceM used for calculation of distances between the vertices in the graph indicates how semantically related two vertices are, it can be used as a similarity metric.",
        "As the graph is directed, the distance metric is asymmetric, i.e. the distance from vj to vi does not have to be equal to the distance from vi to vj.",
        "The major drawback of the DistanceM is that it takes into account only one path between the examined vertices.",
        "Even though the shortest path indicates a strong semantic relation between the vertices, it is not sufficient to conclude synonymy that presupposes similar word senses.",
        "Therefore more evidence for strong semantic relation with the particular aspect of similar word senses should be incorporated in the similarity metric.",
        "The property neighbors of a vertex vi (adjacent vertices connected with vi by the property edge) play significant role in characterizing similar senses.",
        "If two terms share many characteristic properties, there is a strong evidence of their synonymy.",
        "A shared property can be regarded as a witness of the similarity of two word senses.",
        "There are other potential witnesses, e.g. transitive verbs shared by their direct objects; however, we restricted this investigation to the property neighbors as the most reliable witnesses.",
        "The simple method to incorporate the concept of the witnesses into the metric is to determine the number of common property neighbors:",
        "where prop(vi) = {vk l e(i, k) is a property edge} This method disregards, however, the different degree of correlation between the vertices and their property neighbors that is reflected by the length of property edges.",
        "A property is the more significant, the stronger the correlation between the property and the vertex is, that is the shorter the property edge is.",
        "The degree of synonymy of two terms depends therefore on the number of common properties and the lengths of paths between these terms leading through the properties.",
        "Analogously to the electric circuit one can see the single paths through different shared properties as channels in a parallel connection and path lengths as ”synonymy resistances”.",
        "Since a bigger number of channels and smaller single resistances contribute to the decreasing of the total resistance (i.e. the evidence of synonymy increases), the idea of WeiPropM metric is to determine the similarity value analogously to the total resistance in a parallel connection:",
        "where length (vi, pk, vj) = e(vi, pk) + e(pk, vj) is the length of the path from vi to vj through pk and pk E prop(vi) n prop(vj).",

        "There are very general properties that are shared by many different terms and",
        "some properties that are characteristic only for certain word senses.",

        "Therefore to compensate this deficiency (i.e. to eliminate the bias discussed in (Weeds et al., 2004)) an edge length from a property to a ranked term e(pk, vj) is weighted by the square root of its absolute frequency qfreq(vj).",
        "Using the weighted edge length between the property and the ranked term we cannot any longer calculate the path length between viand vj as the sum length(vi,pk, vj) = e(vi, pk) + e(pk, vj) * qf req(vj) because the multiplied second component significantly outweighs the first summand.",
