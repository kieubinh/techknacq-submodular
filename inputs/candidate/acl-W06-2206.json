        "Over the last decades, more and more information has become available in digital form; a major part of this information is textual.",
        "While some textual information is stored in raw or typeset form (i.e., as more or less flat text), a lot is semistructured in databases.",
        "A popular example of a textual database is Amazon’s book database,1 which contains fields for “author”, “title”, “publisher”, “summary” etc.",
        "Information about collections in the cultural heritage domain is also frequently stored in (semi-)textual databases.",
        "Examples of publicly accessible databases of this type are the University of St. Andrews’s photographic",
        "collection2 or the Nederlands Soortenregister.3 Such databases are an important resource for researchers in the field, especially if the contents can be systematically searched and queried.",
        "However, information retrieval from databases can be adversely affected by errors and inconsistencies in the data.",
        "For example, a zoologist interested in finding out about the different biotopes (i.e., habitats) in which a given species was found, might query a zoological specimens database for the content of the BIOTOPE column for all specimens of that species.",
        "Whenever information about the biotope was entered in the wrong column, that particular record will not be retrieved by such a query.",
        "Similarly, if an entry erroneously lists the wrong species, it will also not be retrieved.",
        "Usually it is impossible to avoid errors completely, even in well maintained databases.",
        "Errors can arise for a variety of reasons, ranging from technical limitations (e.g., copy-and-paste errors) to different interpretations of what type of information should be entered into different database fields.",
        "The latter situation is especially prevalent if the database is maintained by several people.",
        "Manual identification and correction of errors is frequently infeasible due to the size of the database.",
        "A more realistic approach would be to use automatic means to identify potential errors; these could then be flagged and presented to a human expert, and subsequently corrected manually or semi-automatically.",
        "Error detection and correction can be performed as a preprocessing step for information extraction from databases, or it can be interleaved with it.",
        "In this paper, we explore whether it is possi",
        "ble to detect and correct potential errors in textual databases by applying data-driven clean-up methods which are able to work in the absence of background knowledge (e.g., knowledge about the domain or the structure of the database) and instead rely on the data itself to discover inconsistencies and errors.",
        "Ideally, error detection should also be language independent, i.e., require no or few language specific tools, such as part-of-speech taggers or chunkers.",
        "Aiming for language independence is motivated by the observation that many databases, especially in the cultural heritage domain, are multilingual and contain strings of text in various languages.",
        "If textual data-cleaning methods are to be useful for such databases, they should ideally be able to process all text strings, not only those in the majority language.",
        "While there has been a significant amount of previous research on identifying and correcting errors in data sets, most methods are not particularly suitable for textual databases (see Section 2).",
        "We present two methods which are.",
        "Both methods are data-driven and knowledge-lean; errors are identified through comparisons with other database fields.",
        "We utilise supervised machine learning, but the training data is derived directly from the database, i.e., no manual annotation of data is necessary.",
        "In the first method, the database fields of individual entries are compared, and improbable combinations are flagged as potential errors.",
        "Because the focus is on individual entries, i.e., rows in the database, we call this horizontal error correction.",
        "The second method aims at a different type of error, namely values which were entered in the wrong column of the database.",
        "Potential errors of this type are determined by comparing the content of a database cell to (the cells of) all database columns and determining which column it fits best.",
        "Because the focus is on columns, we refer to this method as vertical error correction."

        "There is a considerable body of previous work on the generic issue of data cleaning.",
        "Much of the research directed specifically at databases focuses on identifying identical records when two databases are merged (Hern´andez and Stolfo, 1998; Galhardas et al., 1999).",
        "This is a non-trivial problem as records of the same objects coming from different sources typically differ in their primary keys.",
        "There may also be subtle differences in other database fields.",
        "For example, names may be entered in different formats (e.g., John Smith vs. Smith, J.)",
        "or there may be typos which make it difficult to match fields (e.g., John Smith vs. Jon Smith) .4 In a wider context, a lot of research has been dedicated to the identification of outliers in datasets.",
        "Various strategies have been proposed.",
        "The earliest work uses probability distributions to model the data; all instances which deviate too much from the distributions are flagged as outliers (Hawkins, 1980).",
        "This approach is called distribution-based.",
        "In clustering-based methods, a clustering algorithm is applied to the data and instances which cannot be grouped under any cluster, or clusters which only contain very few instances are assumed to be outliers (e.g., Jiang et al.",
        "(2001)).",
        "Depth-based methods (e.g., Ruts and Rousseeuw (1996)) use some definition of depth to organise instances in layers in the data space; outliers are assumed to occupy shallow layers.",
        "Distance-based methods (Knorr and Ng, 1998) utilise a k-nearest neighbour approach where outliers are defined, for example, as those instances whose distance to their nearest neighbour exceeds a certain threshold.",
        "Finally, Marcus and Maletic (2000) propose a method which learns association rules for the data; records that do not conform to any rules are then assumed to be potential outliers.",
        "In principle, techniques developed to detect outliers can be applied to databases as well, for instance to identify cell values that are exceptional in the context of other values in a given column, or to identify database entries that seem unlikely compared to other entries.",
        "However, most methods are not particularly suited for textual databases.",
        "Some approaches only work with numeric data (e.g., distribution-based methods), others can deal with categorical data (e.g., distance-based methods) but treat all database fields as atoms.",
        "For databases with free text fields it can be fruitful to look at individual tokens within a text string.",
        "For instance, units of measurement (m, ft, etc.)",
        "may be very common in one column (such as ALTITUDE) but may indicate an error when they occur in another column (such as COLLECTOR)."

        "Each entry provides information about one or several specimens, for example, who collected it, where and when it was found, its position in the zoological taxonomy, the publication which first described and classified the specimen, and so on.",
        "Some columns contain fairly free text (e.g., SPECIAL REMARKS), others contain textual content6 of a specific type and in a relatively fixed format, such as proper names (e.g., COLLECTOR or LOCATION), bibliographical information (PUBLICATION), dates (e.g., COLLECTION DATE) or numbers (e.g., REGISTRATION NUMBER).",
        "Some database cells are left unfilled; just under 40% of all cells are filled (i.e., 229,430 cells).",
        "There is a relatively large variance in the number of different values in each column, ranging from three for CLASS (i.e., Reptilia, Amphibia, and a remark pointing to a taxonomic inconsistency in the entry) to over 2,000 for SPECIAL REMARKS, which is only filled for a minority of the entries.",
        "On the other hand there is also some repetition of cell contents, even for the free text columns, which often contain formulaic expressions.",
        "For example, the strings no further data available or (found) dead on road occur repeatedly in the special remarks field.",
        "A certain amount of repetition is characteristic for many textual databases, and we exploit this in our error correction methods.",
        "While most of the entries are in Dutch or English, the database also contains text strings in several other languages, such as Portuguese or French (and Latin for the taxonomic names).",
        "In principle, there is no limit to which languages can occur in the database.",

        "The different fields in a database are often not statistically independent; i.e., for a given entry,",
        "the likelihood of a particular value in one field may be dependent on the values in (some of) the other fields.",
        "In our database, for example, there is an interdependency between the LOCATION and the COUNTRY columns: the probability that the COUNTRY column contains the value South Africa increases if the LOCATION column contains the string Tafel Mountain (and vice versa).",
        "Similar interdependencies hold between other columns, such as LOCATION and ALTITUDE, or COUNTRY and BIOTOPE, or between the columns encoding a specimen’s position in the zoological taxonomy (e.g., SPECIES and FAMILY).",
        "Given enough data, many of these interdependencies can be determined automatically and exploited to identify field values that are likely to be erroneous.",
        "This idea bears some similarity to the approach by Marcus and Maletic (2000) who infer association rules for a data set and then look for outliers relative to these rules.",
        "However, we do not explicitly infer rules.",
        "Instead, we trained TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2004), a memory-based learner, to predict the value of a field given the values of other fields for the entry.",
        "If the predicted value differs from the original value, it is signalled as a potential error to a human annotator.",
        "We applied the method to the taxonomic fields (CLASS, ORDER, FAMILY, GENUS, SPECIES and SUB-SPECIES), because it is possible, albeit somewhat time-consuming, for a non-expert to check the values of these fields against a published zoological taxonomy.",
        "We split the data into 80% training set, 10% development set and 10% test set.",
        "As not all taxonomic fields are filled for all entries, the exact sizes for each data set differ, depending on which field is to be predicted (see Table 1).",
        "We used the development data to set TiMBL’s parameters, such as the number of nearest neighbours to be taken into account or the similarity metric (van den Bosch, 2004).",
        "Ideally, one would want to choose the setting which optimised the error detection accuracy.",
        "However, this would require manual annotation of the errors in the development set.",
        "As this is fairly time consuming, we abstained from it.",
        "Instead we chose the parameter setting which maximised the value prediction accuracy for each taxonomic field, i.e. the setting for which the disagreement between the values predicted by TiMBL and the values in the database was smallest.",
        "The motivation for this was that a high prediction accuracy will minimise the number",
        "of potential errors that get flagged (i.e., disagreements between TiMBL and the database) and thus, hopefully, lead to a higher error detection precision, i.e., less work for the human annotator who has to check the potential errors.",

        "The reduced feature set was found to lead to better or equal performance for all taxonomic fields and was thus used in the experiments reported below.",
        "For each taxonomic field, we then trained TiMBL on the training set and applied it to the test set, using the optimised parameter settings.",
        "Table 2 shows the value prediction accuracies for each taxonomic field and the accuracies achieved by two baseline classifiers: (i) randomly selecting a value from the values found in the training set (random) and (ii) always predicting the (training set) majority value (majority).",
        "The prediction accuracies are relatively high, even for the lowest fields in the taxonomy, SPECIES and SUBSPECIES, which should be the most difficult to predict.",
        "Hence it is in principle possible to predict the value of a taxonomic field from the values of other fields in the database.",
        "To determine whether the taxonomic fields are exceptional in this respect, we also tested how well non-taxonomic fields can be predicted.",
        "We found that all fields can be predicted with a relatively high accuracy.",
        "The lowest accuracy (63%) is obtained for the BIOTOPE field.",
        "For most fields, accuracies of around 70%",
        "To determine whether this method is suitable for semi-automatic error correction, we looked at the cases in which the value predicted by TiMBL differed from the original value.",
        "There are three potential reasons for such a disagreement: (i) the value predicted by TiMBL is wrong, (ii) the value predicted by TiMBL is correct and the original value in the database is wrong, and (iii) both values are correct and the two terms are (zoological) synonyms.",
        "For the fields CLASS, ORDER, FAMILY and GENUS, we checked the values predicted by TiMBL against two published zoological taxonomies8 and counted how many times the predicted value was the correct value.",
        "We did not check the two lowest fields (SUB SPECIES and SPECIES), as the correct values for these fields can only be determined reliably by looking at the specimens themselves, not by looking at the other taxonomic values for an entry.",
        "For the evaluation, we focused on error correction rather than error detection, hence cases where both the value predicted by TiMBL and the original value in the database were wrong, were counted as TiMBL errors.",
        "Table 3 shows the results (the absolute numbers of database errors, synonyms and TiMBL errors are shown in brackets).",
        "It can be seen that TiMBL detects several errors in the database and predicts the correct values for them.",
        "It also finds several synonyms.",
        "For GENUS, however, the vast majority of disagreements between TiMBL and the database is due to TiMBL errors.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that GENUS is relatively low in the taxonomy (directly above SPECIES).",
        "As the values of higher fields only provide limited cues",
        "for the value of a lower field, the lower a field is in the taxonomy the more difficult it is to predict its value accurately.",
        "So far we have only looked at the precision of our error detection method (i.e., what proportion of flagged errors are real errors).",
        "Error detection recall (i.e., the proportion of real errors that is flagged) is often difficult to determine precisely because this would involve manually checking the dataset (or a significant subset) for errors, which is typically quite time-consuming.",
        "However, if errors are identified and corrected semi-automatically, recall is more important than precision; a low precision means more work for the human expert who is checking the potential errors, a low recall, however, means that many errors are not detected at all, which may severely limit the usefulness of the system.",
        "To estimate the recall obtained by the horizontal error detection method, we introduced errors artificially and determined what percentage of these artificial errors was detected.",
        "For each taxonomic field, we changed the value of 10% of the entries, which were randomly selected.",
        "In these entries, the original values were replaced by one of the other attested values for this field.",
        "The new value was selected randomly and with uniform probability for all values.",
        "Of course, this method can only provide an estimate of the true recall, as it is possible that real errors are distributed differently, e.g., some values may be more easily confused by humans than others.",
        "Table 4 shows the results.",
        "The estimated recall is fairly high; in all cases above 90%.",

        "Some of these errors may also stem from changes in the database structure itself, e.g., maybe the BIOTOPE column was only added after the data was entered.9 Identifying this type of error can be recast as a text classification task: given the content of a cell, i.e., a string of text, the aim is to determine which column the string most likely belongs to.",

        "While the error detection precision was fairly low for both methods (up to 55% for the horizontal method and up to 25.57% for the vertical method), the number of potential errors flagged was still sufficiently small to check manually.",
        "Furthermore, the automatically predicted correction for an error was often the right one.",
        "Hence, it would be feasible to employ the two methods in a semi-automatic error correction set-up where potential errors together with a suggested correction are flagged and presented to a user.",
        "As the two error correction methods are to some extent complementary, it would be worthwhile to investigate whether they can be combined.",
        "Some errors flagged by the horizontal method will not be detected by the vertical method, for instance, values which are valid in a given column, but inconsistent with the values of other fields.",
        "On the other hand, values which were entered in the wrong column should, in theory, also be detected by the horizontal method.",
        "For example, if the correct FAMILY for Rana aurora is Ranidae, it should make no difference whether the (incorrect) value in the FAMILY field is Bufonidae, which is a valid value for FAMILY but the wrong family for Rana aurora, or Amphibia, which is not a valid value for FAMILY but the correct CLASS value for Rana aurora; in both cases the error should be detected.",
        "Hence, if both methods predict an error in a given field this should increase the likelihood that there is indeed an error.",
        "This could be exploited to obtain a higher precision.",
        "We plan to experiment with this idea in future research.",
