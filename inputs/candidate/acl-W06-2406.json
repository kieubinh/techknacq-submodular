        "Since Firth first described collocations as habitual word combinations in the 1950ies (cf. Firth, 1968), a number of papers focusing on collocation extraction have been published (see the overviews in (Evert, 2004; Bartsch, 2004)).",
        "Most studies concentrate on the extraction from English.",
        "However, the procedures proposed in these studies cannot necessarily be applied to other languages as English stands out, e.g. with respect to configu-rationality.",
        "They rely on the fact that the syntax of English (and of all configurational languages) provides positional clues to the grammatical function of noun phrases, and they exploit this concept by means of window-based, adjacency-based or pattern-based extraction, combined with association measures to identify co-occurrences that are more frequent than statistically expectable.",
        "What these procedures do not cover is semantic-oriented definitions like (a) and (b).",
        "a.",
        "A collocation is a combination of a free (’ au-tosematic’) element (the base) and a lexically determined (’synsemantic’) element (the collocate, which may lose (some of) its meaning in a collocation) (adapted from (Hausmann, 1979; Hausmann, 1989; Hausmann, 2003)).",
        "b.",
        "A collocation is a word combination whose semantic and/or syntactic properties cannot be fully predicted from those of its components, and which therefore has to be listed in a lexicon (Evert, 2004).",
        "We argue that linguistic knowledge could not only improve results (Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993) but is essential when extracting collocations from certain languages: this knowledge provides other applications (or a lexicon user, respectively) with a fine-grained description of how the extracted collocations are to be used in context.",
        "Additional requirements resulting from the needs of dictionary users are described in (Hausmann, 2003; Heid and Gouws, 2005) and are of interest not only in lexicography but can also be transferred to the field of natural language generation.",
        "These requirements influence the development of collocation extraction systems, which motivates this paper.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: In chapter 2, the requirements, depending on factors like the targeted language, are presented.",
        "We then discuss and suggest methods to meet the given needs.",
        "A documentation of ongoing work on the extraction of noun + verb collocations from German texts is given in chapter 3.",
        "Chapter 4 gives a conclusion and an outlook on work still to be done."

        "Whereas issues 1 to 3 deal with the collocation itself, issue 4 is focused at the collocation in context, i.e. its behaviour (from a syntagmatic analysis point of view) or, respectively, its use (from a generation perspective)."

        "One of the most important factors is, of course, the targeted language and its main characteristics with respect to word formation and word order.",
        "Depending on word and constituent order, the pros and cons of positional vs. relational extraction patterns need to be considered.",
        "Positional patterns (based on adjacency or a ’window’) are adequate for configurational languages, but in languages with rather free word order, words belonging to a phrase or collocation do not necessarily occur within a predefined span1.",
        "Extracting word combinations using relational patterns (represented by part of speech (PoS) tags or dependency rules) offers a higher level of abstraction and improves the results (cf. (Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993)).",
        "However, this requires part of speech tagging and possibly partial parsing.",
        "A system extracting word combinations by applying relational patterns, obviously profits from language specific knowledge about phrase and sentence structure and word formation.",
        "One example is the order of adjective + noun pairs: in English and German, the adjective occurs left of the noun, whereas in French, the adjective can occur left or right of the noun.",
        "Another example is compounding, handled differently in different languages: noun + noun in English, typically separated by a white space (e.g. death penalty) vs. noun + prepositional phrase in French (e.g. peine de mort) vs. compound noun in German (e.g. Todesstrafe).",
        "Consequently, language specific word formation rules need to be considered when designing extraction patterns.",
        "For languages with a rich inflectional morphology where the individual word forms are rather rare, frequency counts and results",
        "of statistical analyses are little reliable.",
        "To allow a grouping of words sharing the same lemma, lem-matisation is crucial."

        "In order to get more data, the extraction from verb first and verb second constructions is also possible.",
