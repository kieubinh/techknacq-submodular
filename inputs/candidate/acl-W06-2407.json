        "Many applications in natural language processing rely on the relationships between words in a document.",
        "Verbs play a central role in many such tasks; for example, the assignment of semantic roles to noun phrases in a sentence heavily depends on the verb that link the noun phrases together (as in “Pierre Vinken/SUBJ, will join/PRED, the board/OBJ”).",
        "However, verb processing is difficult because of many phenomena, such as normalization of actions, verb particle constructions and light verb constructions.",
        "Applications that process verbs must handle these cases effectively.",
        "We focus on the identification of light verb constructions (also known as support verb constructions) in English, as such constructions play a prominent and productive role in many other languages (Butt and Geuder, 2001; Miyamoto, 2000).",
        "Although the exact definition of a LVC varies in the literature, we use the following operational definition: A light verb construction (LVC) is a verb-complement pair in which the verb has little lexical meaning (is “light”) and much of the semantic content of the construction is obtained from the complement.",
        "Examples of LVCs in English include “give a speech”, “make good (on)” and “take (NP) into account”.",
        "In the case in which the complement is a noun, it is often a deverbal noun and, as such, can usually be paraphrased using the object’s root verb form without (much) loss in its meaning (e.g., take a walk walk, make a decision decide, give a speech speak).",
        "We propose a corpus-based approach to determine whether a verb-object pair is a LVC.",
        "Note that we limit the scope of LVC detection to LVCs consisting of verbs with noun complements.",
        "Specifically, we extend previous work done by others by examining how the local context of the candidate construction and the corpus-wide frequency of related words to the construction play an influence on the lightness of the verb.",
        "A second contribution is to integrate our new features with previously reported ones under a machine learning framework.",
        "This framework optimizes the weights for these measures automatically against a training corpus in supervised learning, and attests to the significant modeling im",
        "provements of our features on our corpus.",
        "Our corpus-based evaluation shows that the combination of previous work and our new features improves LVC detection significantly over previous work.",
        "An advantage gained by adopting a machine learning framework is that it can be easily adapted to other languages that also exhibit light verbs.",
        "While we perform evaluations on English, light verbs exist in most other languages.",
        "In some of these languages, such as Persian, most actions are expressed as LVCs rather than single-word verbs (Butt, 2003).",
        "As such, there is currently a unmet demand for developing an adaptable framework for LVC detection that applies across languages.",
        "We believe the features proposed in this paper would also be effective in identifying light verbs in other languages.",
        "We first review previous corpus-based approaches to LVC detection in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we show how we extend the use of mutual information and employ context modeling as features for improved LVC detection.",
        "We next describe our corpus processing and how we compiled our gold standard judgments used for supervised machine learning.",
        "In Section 4, we evaluate several feature combinations before concluding the paper."

        "With the recent availability of large corpora, statistical methods that leverage syntactic features are a current trend.",
        "This is the case for LVC detection as well.",
        "Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) considered a similar task of identifying the most probable light verb for a given deverbal noun.",
        "Their approach focused on the deverbal noun and occurrences of the noun’s verbal form, arguing that the deverbal noun retains much of the verbal characteristics in the LVCs.",
        "To distinguish the LVC from other verb-object pairs, the deverbal noun must share similar argument/adjunct structures with its verbal counterpart.",
        "Verbs that appear often with these characteristic deverbal noun forms are deemed light verbs.",
        "They approximate the identification of argument/adjunct structures by using the preposition head of prepositional phrases that occur after the verb or object of interest.",
        "Let n be a deverbal noun whose most likely light verb is to be found.",
        "Denote its verbal form by v', and let P be the set containing the three most frequently occurring prepositions that occur after v'.",
        "The verb-object pairs that are not followed by a preposition in P are filtered out.",
        "For any verb v, let g(v, n) be the count of verb-object pairs v-n that remain after the filtering step above.",
        "Grefenstette and Teufel proposed that the light verb for n be returned by the following equation:",
        "Interestingly, Grefenstette and Teufel indicated that their subsequent experiments suggested that the filtering step may not be necessary.",
        "Whereas the GT95 measure centers on the deverbal object, Dras and Johnson (1996) also consider the verb’s corpus frequency.",
        "The use of this complementary information improves LVC identification, as it models the inherent bias of some verbs to be used more often as light verbs than others.",
        "Let f (v, n) be the count of verb-object pairs occurring in the corpus, such that v is the verb, n is a deverbal noun.",

        "Examples of such constructions are “give a speech” and “take a walk”.",
        "They employ mutual information which measures the frequency of co-occurrences of two variables, corrected for random agreement.",
        "Let I (x, y) be the mutual information between x and y.",
        "Then the following measure can be used: SFN04(v, n) = 2 x I(v, a-n) – I(v, det-n), (3) where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of van being a light verb construction.",
        "Also, they suggested that the determiner “the” be excluded from the development data since it frequently occurred in their data.",
        "Recently, Fazly et al.",
        "(2005) have proposed a statistical measure for the detection of LVCs.",
        "The probability that a verb-object pair v-n (where v is a light verb) is a LVC can be expressed as a product of three probabilities: (1) probability of the object",
        "n occurring in the corpus, (2) the probability that n is part of any LVC given n, and (3) the probability of v occurring given n and that v-n is a LVC.",
        "Each of these three probabilities can then be estimated by the frequency of occurrence in the corpus, using the assumption that all instances of v'-a-n is a LVC, where v' is any light verb and a is an indefinite determiner.",
        "To summarize, research in LVC detection started by developing single measures that utilized simple frequency counts of verbs and their complements.",
        "From this starting point, research has developed in two different directions: using more informed measures for word association (specifically, mutual information) and modeling the context of the verb-complement pair.",
        "Both the GT95 and DJ96 measures suffer from using frequency counts directly.",
        "Verbs that are not light but occur very frequently (such as “buy” and “sell” in the Wall Street Journal) will be marked by these measures.",
        "As such, given a deverbal noun, they sometimes suggest verbs that are not light.",
        "We hypothesize that substituting MI for frequency count can alleviate this problem.",
        "The SFN04 metric adds in the context provided by determiners to augment LVC detection.",
        "This measure may work well for LVCs that are marked by determiners, but excludes a large portion of LVCs that are composed without determiners.",
        "To design a robust LVC detector requires integrating such specific contextual evidence with other general evidence.",
        "Building on this, Fazly et al.",
        "(2005) incorporate an estimation of the probability that a certain noun is part of a LVC.",

        "Such a framework can integrate the various measures and enable us to test their combinations in a generic manner.",

        "Most of these new features we propose are not good measures for LVC detection by themselves.",
        "However, the additional evidence that they give can be combined with the base features to create a better composite classification system.",
        "Mutual information: We observe that a verb v and a deverbal noun n are more likely to appear in verb-object pairs if they can form a LVC.",
        "To capture this evidence, we employ mutual information to measure the co-occurrences of a verb and a noun in verb-object pairs.",
        "Formally, the mutual information between a verb v and a deverbal noun n is defined as",
        "where P(v, n) denotes the probability of v and n constructing verb-object pairs.",
        "P(v) is the probability of occurrence of v and P(n) represents the probability of occurrence of n. Let f (v, n) be the frequency of occurrence of the verb-object pair v-n and N be the number of all verb-object pairs in the corpus.",
        "We can estimate the above probabilities using their maximum likelihood esti",
        "However, I(v, n) only measures the local information of co-occurrences between v and n. It does not capture the global frequency of verb-object pair v-n, which is demonstrated as effective by Dras and Johnson (1996).",
        "As such, we need to combine the local mutual information with the global frequency of the verb-object pair.",

        "This is corroborated by Grefenstette and Teufel claim that if a verb-object pair v-n is a LVC, then n should share similar properties with v'.",

        "Such characteristics have been shown to be cross-language and include verbs that indicate (change of) possession (Danish give, to give, direction (Chinese guan diao to switch off), aspect and causation, or are thematically incomplete (Japanese suru, to do).",
        "As such, it makes sense to have a list of verbs that are often used lightly.",
        "In our work, we have predefined a light verb list for our English experiment as exactly the following seven verbs: “do”, “get”, “give”, “have”, “make”, “put” and “take”, all of which have been studied as light verbs in the literature.",

        "When applying the combination of all base features, the F1-measures on both 2 For the strict data set, the base feature set has a precision and recall of 0.674 and 0.446 respectively, while the full feature set has a precision and recall of 0.642 and 0.523 respectively.",
        "For the lenient data set, the base feature set has a precision and recall of 0.778 and 0.598 respectively, while the full feature set has a precision and recall of 0.768 and 0.624 respectively.",
        "data sets increased to 0.537 and 0.676 respectively.",
        "Previous work has mainly studied individual statistics in identifying LVCs while ignoring the integration of various statistics.",
        "The results demonstrate that integrating different statistics (i.e. features) boosts the performance of LVC identification.",
        "More importantly, we employ an off-the-shelf classifier without special parameter tuning.",
        "This shows that generic machine learning methods can be applied to the problem of LVC detection.",
        "It provides a sound way to integrate various features to improve the overall performance.",
        "• Our new features boost the overall performance.",
        "Applying the newly proposed features on top of the base feature set, i.e., using the full feature set, gives F1-measures of 0.576 and 0.689 respectively (shown in bold) in our experiments.",
        "These yield a significant increase (p < 0.1) over using the base features only.",
        "Further, when we remove each of the new features individually from the full feature set, we see a corresponding drop in the F1-measures, of 0.011 (deverbal counts) to 0.044 (light verb classes) for the strict data set, and 0.013 (deverbal counts) to 0.049 (light verb classes) for the lenient data set.",
        "It shows that these new features boost the overall performance of the classifier.",
        "We think that these new features are more task-specific and examine intrinsic features of LVCs.",
        "As such, integrated with the statistical base features, these features can be used to identify LVCs more accurately.",
        "It is worth noting that light verb class is a simple but important feature, providing the highest F1-measure improvement compared to other new features.",
        "This is in accordance with the observation that different light verbs have different properties (Stevenson et al., 2004)."

        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are a major obstacle that hinder precise natural language processing (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "As part of MWEs, LVCs remain least explored in the literature of computational linguistics.",
        "Past work addressed the problem of automatically detecting LVCs by employing single statistical measures.",
        "In this paper, we experiment",
        "with identifying LVCs using a machine learning framework that integrates the use of various statistics.",
        "Moreover, we have extended the existing statistical measures and established new features to detect LVCs.",
        "Our experimental results show that the integrated use of different features in a machine learning framework performs much better than using any of the features individually.",
        "In addition, we experimentally show that our newly-proposed features greatly boost the performance of classifiers that use base statistical features.",
        "Thus, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance over previous approaches for identifying LVCs.",
        "As such, we suggest that future work on automatic detection of LVCs employ a machine learning framework that combines complementary features, and examine intrinsic features that characterize the local context of LVCs to achieve better performance.",
        "While we have experimentally showed the effectiveness of the proposed framework incorporating existing and new features for LVC detection on an English corpus, we believe that the features we have introduced are generic and apply to LVC detection in other languages.",
        "The reason is threefold: 1.",
        "Mutual information is a generic metric for measuring co-occurrences of light verbs and their complements.",
        "Such co-occurrences are often an obvious indicator for determining light verbs because light verbs are often coupled with a limited set of complements.",
        "For instance, in Chinese, directional verbs, such as xia (descend) and dao (reach), which are often used lightly, are often co-located with a certain class of verbs that are related to people’s behaviors.",
        "2.",
        "For LVCs with noun complements, most of the semantic meaning of a LVC is expressed by the object.",
        "This also holds for other languages, such as Chinese.",
        "For example, in Chinese, zuo xuanze (make a choice) and zuo jueding (make a decision) has the word zuo (make) acting as a light verb and xuanze (choice) or jueding (decision) acting as a deverbal noun (Wang, 2004).",
        "Therefore, the feature of deverbal count should also be applicable for other languages.",
        "3.",
        "It has been observed that in many languages, light verbs tend to be a set of closed class verbs.",
        "This allows us to use a list of predefined verbs that are often used lightly as a feature which helps distinguish between light and non-light verbs when used with the same noun complement.",
        "The identity of such verbs has been shown to be largely independent of language, and corresponds to verbs that transmit information about possession, direction, aspect and causation."
