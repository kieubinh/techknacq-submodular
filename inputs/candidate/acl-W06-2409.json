        "The paper addresses the advantages of using OWL DL for the design of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries and proposes a generalized architecture for that purpose.",
        "Moreover, mechanisms for querying and checking the consistency of such models are presented, and it is concluded that DL provides means which are capable of adequately meeting the requirements on the design of multilingual dictionaries."

        "We discuss the modeling of linguistic knowledge about collocations, for monolingual and bilingual electronic dictionaries, for multiple uses in NLP and for humans.",
        "Our notion of collocation is a lexicographic one, inspired by (Bartsch, 2004); we start from her working definition: “collocations are lexically and/or pragmatically constrained recurrent cooc-currences of at least two lexical items which are in a direct relation with each other.” The fact of being lexically and/or pragmatically constrained leads to translation problems, as such constraints are language specific.",
        "With Hausmann (2004), we assume that collocations have a base and a collocate, where the base is autosemantic and thus translatable without reference to the collocation, whereas the collocate is synsemantic, i.e. its reading is selected within a given collocation.",
        "Examples of collocations according to this definition include adjective+noun-combinations (heavy smoker, strong tea, etc.",
        "), verb+subject- (question arises, question comes up) and verb+complementgroups (give+talk, take+walk) etc.",
        "The definition excludes however named entities (Rio de Janeiro) and frequent compositional groups (e.g. the police said...).",
        "Our data have been semi-automatically extracted from 200 million words of German newspaper text of the 1990s (cf. Ritz (2005)).",
        "We claim that a detailed monolingual description of the linguistic properties of collocations provides a solid basis for bilingual collocation dictionaries.",
        "The types of linguistic information needed for NLP and those required for human use, e.g. in text production or translation into a foreign language, overlap to a large extent.",
        "Thus it is reasonable to define comprehensive monolingual data models and to relate these with a view to translation.",
        "In section 2, we briefly list the most important phenomena to be captured (see also Heid and Gouws (2006)); section 3 introduces OWL DL, motivates its choice as a representation format and describes our monolingual modeling.",
        "In section 4, we discuss and illustrate the bilingual dictionary architecture."

        "A mere list of word pairs or sequences (give a talk, lose one’s patience) is not a collocation dictionary.",
        "For use in NLP, linguistic properties of the collocations and of their components must be provided: these include the category of the components (giveV + talkN), the",
        "distribution of base (talk) and collocate (give), as well as morphosyntactic preferences, e.g. with respect to the number of an element (e.g. have high hopes), the use of a determiner (lose one’sposs|{ } patience, cf. Evert et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "For collocations to be identifiable in the context of a sentence (e.g. to avoid attachment ambiguity in parsing) and, conversely, in generation, to be correctly inserted into a sentence, the syntagmatic behavior of collocations must be described.",
        "This includes their function within a sentence (e.g in the case of adverbial NPs) and the subcategorization of their components, e.g. with support verb constructions (make the proposal to + INF).",
        "As subcategorization is not fully predictable from the subcategorization of the noun (how to explain the preposition choice in Unterst¨utzung linden bei jmdm, ‘find support in so.’, be supported?",
        "), we prefer to encode the respective data in the monolingual dictionary.",

        "Relations involving collocations.",
        "For language generation, paraphrasing or for summarization, paradigmatic relations of collocations must also be modeled.",
        "These include synonymy, antonymy and taxonomic relations, but also morphological ones (word formation) and combinations of collocations.",
        "Synonymy and antonymy should relate collocations with other collocations, but also with single words and with idioms: all three types should have the same status.",
        "Next to strict synonymy, there may be ‘quasi-synonymy’.",
        "Transparent noun compounds tend to share collocates with their heads (Pause einlegen, Rauchpause einlegen, Kaffeepause einlegen): if the relation between compound and head (Kaffeepause – Pause) and between the respective collocations is made explicit, this knowledge can be exploited in translation, when a compositional equivalent is chosen (have a (smoking/coffee) break).",
        "Paraphrasing and its applications also profit from an explicit representation of morphological relations",
        "between collocates: submit + proposal, submission of + proposal and submitter of + proposal all refer to the same collocational pattern.",
        "A formal model for a collocation dictionary, monolingual and/or bilingual, has to keep track of the above mentioned properties and relations of collocations; both should be queriable, alone and in arbitrary combinations.",
        "Other collocation dictionaries and dictionary architectures.",
        "Most of the above mentioned properties and relations have been discussed in the descriptive literature, but to our knowledge, they have never been modeled all in an electronic dictionary.",
        "The Danish STO dictionary (Braasch and Olsen, 2000) and Krenn’s (2000) database of German support verb+PP-constructions both emphasize morphosyntactic preferences, but do not include relations.",
        "The electronic learners’ dictionaries DAFLES and DICE2 focus on semantic explanations of collocations, but do not contain details about most of the properties and relations mentioned above.",
        "The implementation of Mel’ˇcuk’s MeaninggText-Theory in the DiCo/LAF model3 comes closest to our requirements, insofar as it is highly relational and includes some though not all of the morphological relations we described above.",
        "The Papillon project (S´erasset and Mangeot-Lerebours, 2001) proposes a general architecture for the interlingual linking of monolingual dictionaries; as it is inspired by the DiCo formalizarion, it foresees links between readings, e.g. to account for morphological relations.",
        "This mechanism could in principle be extended to syntagmatic phenomena; we are, however, not aware of a Papillon-based collocation dictionary."

        "OWL DL is the description logic sublanguage of the OWL Web Ontology Language (Bech",
        "hofer et al., 2004), combining the expressivity of OWL with the computational completeness and decidability of Description Logics (Baader et al., 2003)4.",
        "Properties of OWL DL relevant for lexical modeling are listed and discussed in the following.",
        "Classes.",
        "An OWL DL data model consists of a subsumption hierarchy of classes, i.e. a class X subsumes all its subclasses X1 to Xn.",
        "While classes represent concepts, their instances (called OWL individuals) represent concrete manifestations in the model.",
        "Classes and their instances can be constrained by stating assertions in the model definition, e.g. a class can be defined as being disjoint with other classes, which means that instances of a certain class cannot at the same time be instances of the disjoints of this particular class.",
        "Properties.",
        "Classes are described by properties.",
        "These can be used either to specify XML Schema Datatypes (datatype properties) or to relate instances of one class to instances of (probably) other classes (object properties).",
        "These classes are then defined as the domain and range of a property, i.e. a particular property may only relate instances of classes in its domain to instances of classes in its range.",
        "In addition to this, a property may be assigned several distinct formal attributes, such as symmetric, transitive or functional, and can be defined as the inverse of another property.",
        "Similar to classes, properties can be structured hierarchically as well, which, among others, facilitates the use of underspecified information in queries (see section 3.2).",
        "Inferences.",
        "The possibility to infer explicit knowledge from implicit statements is a core feature of OWL DL and can be performed by using DL reasoners (such as FaCT5, Pellet6 or Racer-Pro7).",
        "The most basic inference is achieved via the subsumption relation among classes or properties in the respective hierarchy (see above), but also more sophisticated inferences are possible.",
        "Among others, these may involve the formal attributes of properties just mentioned.",
        "For example,",
        "stating that instance A is linked to B via a symmetric property P leads a reasoner to infer that B is also linked to A via P. In conjunction with transitivity, a relatively small set of explicit statements may suffice to interrelate several instances implicitly (i.e. all instances in a particular equivalence class created by P).",
        "Consistency.",
        "In addition to inferences, DL reasoners can further be used to check the consistency of an OWL DL model.",
        "One of the primary objectives is to check whether the assertions made about classes and their instances (see above) are logically consistent or whether there are contradictions.",
        "This consistency checking is based on the open-world assumption, which states that “what cannot be proven to be true is not believed to be false” (Haarslev and M¨oller, 2005).",
        "Since lexical data occasionally demand a closed world, other checking formalisms are required, which are mentioned in section 3.2 below."

        "Lexical vs. descriptive entities.",
        "On the class level, the model distinguishes between lexical entities (e.g. single-word and multi-word entities, such as collocations or idioms) and descriptive entities (e.g. gender, part-of-speech, or subcategorisation frames), with lexical entities being linked to descriptive entities via properties.",
        "More than 40 of these descriptive properties have been modeled.",
        "In order to reflect the distinction between metalanguage vocabulary and object language vocabulary, the two types of entities can be separated such that they are part of different models.",
        "In other words, the classes and instances of descriptive entities constitute a model of descriptions, which is imported by a lexicon model containing classes and instances of lexical entities (see also section 4.1 below).",
        "Lexical relations.",
        "In addition to descriptive properties, the data model also contains a number of lexical relations linking lexical entities, such as morphological or semantic relations.",
        "These relations have been structured",
        "hierarchically and contain several subproperties, such as hasCompound or isSynonymOf, which use the formal attributes mentioned in section 3.1.",
        "For instance, isSynonymOf has been defined as a symmetric and transitive property (as opposed to the non-transitive isQuasiSynonymOf; see section 2), while hasCompound has been defined as the inverse of a property isCompoundOf.",

        "Semantic relations link lexical entities on the conceptual (i.e. word sense) level.",

        "model have been structured hierarchically, it is possible to state underspecified queries.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates an underspecified query for semantically related entities, regardless of the precise nature of this relation.",
        "Hence, the first two rows in the result table below contain synonym pairs, while the last two rows contain antonym pairs.",
        "As is indicated in Figure 3, the results appear twice, i.e. they contain every combination of those entities between which the relation holds.",
        "This is due to the fact that the respective semantic relations have been defined as symmetric properties (see above).",
        "Consistency and data integrity.",
        "Section 3.1 mentioned the distinction between the open-world assumption and the closed-world assumption.",
        "While the consistency checking performed by DL reasoners is generally based on an open world, it is vital especially for lexical data to simulate a closed world in order to check data integrity.",
        "Consider, for instance, the assertion that every collocation has to have a base and a collocate.",
        "Due to the open-world assumption, a DL reasoner would never render a collocation violating this constraint inconsistent, simply because it cannot prove that this collocation has either no base or no collocate.",
        "In order for this to happen, the simulation of a closed world is needed.",
        "In our approach, this is achieved by stating consistency constraints in SeRQL.",

        "This query retrieves all collocations and subtracts those who have a path to both a base and a collocate.",

        "The advantages are most obvious in the context of the mapping between monolingual dictionary models (see section 4.2).",

        "This model of descriptions will be larger for related languages (e.g. the indo-european ones), and smaller for typologically very diverse languages; it is however by no means meant to have any interlingual, let alone universal function, but is rather understood in the sense of PARGRAM’s shared inventory of descriptive devices9.",
        "We have modelled so far about 1000 collocations, their components, preferences and relations (also with single words); we intend to considerably enlarge the collocation dictionary, using the possibilities to combine OWL DL models with databases, offered by the Sesame framework.",
        "The formalism also supports experiments with credulous inferencing at the level of translation equivalence, e.g. by following not only explicit equivalence relations, but also synonymy relations: in line with the query discussed in section 4.3 above (cf.",
        "Figure 7), one could also start from the English express criticism and retrieve the equivalent collocation Kritik ¨uben as well as its (quasi-)synonyms kritisieren (single word) and in der Luft zerreiBen (idiom), which may thus be proposed as equivalent candidates for express criticism.",
