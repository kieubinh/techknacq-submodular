        "In fact, MW units will be shown to form a continuum between completely frozen expression where the lexical elements are specified at the level of particular word forms and those which are produced by syntactic rules defined in terms of general part of speech categories.",

        "The robustness of MT systems crucially depend on the size and quality of their lexical compo-nenets.",
        "It is commonly recognized that word-to-word equivalents are fraught with ambiguities.",
        "MW units on the other hand carry, as it were, the disambiguating context with them.",
        "Hence, the more MW units in the lexicon and the longer they are, the less noisy and more robust the MT lexicon is likely to be.",
        "However, not all kinds of MW units are amenable to inclusion by itemized listing in the lexicon.",
        "The paper will focus on MW units whose structure contains slots that can be filled by more or less open ended lexical units.",
        "They are treated in paper dictionaries with the usual method of exemplification and implication, which, even if the intended extension of the set of expression is clear, is obviously not a viable option in a machine system that cannot rely on the linguistic competence and world knowledge that human readers of dictionaries are expected to bring to the job of interpreting lexical entries."

        "The phrases *speaking students, English-speaking, or English population are either not well-formed or does not mean the same as the full expression.",

        "Some of these open-choice slots in the expressions may be filled with items from sets that are either infinite (like numbers) or numerous enough to render them hopeless or wasteful for listing in a dictionary.",

        "Bol-inger (Bolinger 1965) elegantly sums up this approach as Dictionaries do not exist to define, but to help people grasp meaning, and for this purpose their main task is to supply a series of hints and associations that will relate the unknown to something known.",

        "In the mid-nineties a very efficient tool, INTEX was developed at LADL, Paris VII, (Silberztein 1999) which has two components that are of primary importance to us: it contains a complex lexical component (Silberztein 1993) and a graphical interface which supports the development of finite state transducers in the form of graphs (Silberztein 1999).",
        "Local grammars are typically defined in graphs which are compiled into efficient finite state automata or transducers.",
        "Both the lexicon and the grammar are implemented in finite state transducers.",
        "This fact gives us the ideal tool to implement the very kind of lexicon we have been arguing for, one that includes both static entries and lexical grammars.",
        "The set of expressions discussed in 1) can be captured with the graph in Figure 1.",
        "It shows a simple finite state automaton of a single with through three nodes along the way from the initial symbol on the left to the end symbol on the right.",
        "It represents all the expressions that match as the graph is traversed between the two points.",
        "Words in angle brackets stand for the lemma form, the shaded box represent a subgraph that can freely be embedded in graphs.",
        "The facility of",
        "graph embedding has the practical convenience that it allows the reuse of the subgraph in other contexts.",
        "At a more theoretical level, it introduces the power of recursion into grammars.",
        "Subgraphs may also be used to represent a semantic class, such as language name in the present case, and can be encoded in the dictionary with a semantic feature like +LANGNAME.",
        "INTEX/NOOJ dictionaries allow an arbitrary number of semantic features to be represented in the lexical entries and they can be used in the definition of local grammars as well.",
        "An alternative grammar using semantic features is displayed in",
        "Note that to render expressions like in 2) we use local grammars containing nodes that range from specific word forms through lemmas, lists of words, words defined by a semantic class in an ontology to syntactic class or even the completely general placeholder for any word.",
        "Such flexibility allows us to apply the constraint defined at the right level of generality required to cover exactly the set of expressions without overgeneration.",
        "The local grammars defining the kind of partially productive multi-word units that the present paper focuses on can typically be defined with the nodes being defined in terms of some natural semantic class such as the language names of examples 2) or names of colours or body parts illustrated in 6)",
        "The use of semantic features is merely the first step in building an efficient lexicon.",
        "At a more advanced level, the lexicon would include a system of semantic features arranged into typed hierarchy, which would allow use of multiple in-heritence."

        "It is suitably done in traditional dictionaries through a single example, but in an MT system such reliance on the active contribution of the human user is not an option.",
        "Nor is exhaustive listing, as proved by this simple but extremely common example.",
