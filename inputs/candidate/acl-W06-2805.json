        "In recent years, weblogs (online journals in which the owner posts entries on a regular basis) have not only rapidly become popular as a new and easily accessible publishing tool for the masses, but its content is becoming ever more valuable as a “window to the world,” an extensive medium brimming with subjective content that can be mined and analysed to discover what people are talking about and why.",
        "In recent years the volume of blogs is estimated to have doubled approximately every six months.",
        "Technorati1 report that about 11% of internet users are blog readers and that about 70 thousand new blogs are created daily.",
        "Popular blogosphere (the complete collection of all blogs) analysis tools estimate the blogosphere to contain anywhere between 201 and 24 million2 blogs at time of writing.",
        "Given this growing popularity and size, research on blogs and the blogosphere is also increasing.",
        "A large amount of this research is being done on the content provided by the blogosphere and the nature of this content, like for example (Mishne and de Rijke, 2005), or the structure of the blogosphere (Adar et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper, however, we address the task of binary blog classification: given a (web) document, is this a blog or not?",
        "Our aim is to base this classification mostly on blog characteristics rather than content.",
        "We will by no means ignore content but it should not become a crucial part of the classification process.",
        "Reliable blog classification is an important task in the blogosphere as it allows researchers, ping feeds (used to broadcast blog updates), trend analysis tools and many others to separate real blog content from blog-like content such as bulletin boards, newsgroups or trade markets.",
        "It is a task that so far has proved difficult as can be witnessed by checking any of the major blog update feeds such as weblogs.com3 or blo.gs .4 Both will at any given time list content that clearly is not a blog.",
        "In this paper we will explore blog classification using machine learning to improve blog detection and experiment with several methods to try and further improve the percentage of instances classified correctly.",
        "The main research question we address in this paper is exploratory in nature: - How hard is binary blog classification?",
        "Put more specifically,",
        "- What is the performance of basic off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms on this task?",
        "and - Can the performance of these methods be improved using resampling methods such as bootstrapping and co-training?",
        "An important complicating factor is the lack of labeled data.",
        "It is widely accepted that given a sufficient amount of training data, most machine learning algorithms will achieve similar performance levels.",
        "For our experiments, we will have a very limited amount of training material available.",

        "A very much comparable system was developed and used for these experiments.",
        "Members of the BlogPulse team also describe blog crawling and corpus creation in some detail (Glance et al., 2004), but their system is aimed more at gathering updates and following active blogs rather than gathering as many blogs in their entirety, as our system is set up to do.",
        "As to the resampling methods used in this paper – bootstrapping and co-training – , Jones et al.",
        "(1999) describe the application of bootstrapping to text learning tasks and report very good results applying this method to these tasks.",
        "Even though text learning is a very different genre, their results provide hope that the application of this method may also prove useful for our blog classification problem.",
        "Blum and Mitchell (1998) describe the use of separate weak indicators to label unlabeled instances as “probably positive” to further train a learning algorithm and gathered results that suggested that their method has the potential for improving results on many practical learning problems.",
        "Indeed their example of web-page classification is in many ways very similar to our binary blog classification problem.",

        "The “frequent terms”-lists for these attributes were generated using a manually verified list gathered from a general purpose dataset used for earlier experiments.",
        "A “host”-attribute is also used, which we binarised into a large number of binary host name attributes as most machine learning algorithms cannot cope with string attributes.",
        "For this purpose we took the 30 most common hosts in our dataset, which included Livejournal,5 Xanga,6 20six,7 etc., but also a number of hosts that are obviously not blog sites (but host many pages that resemble blogs).",
        "Negative indicators on common hosts that don’t serve blogs are just as valuable to the machine learner as the positive indicators of common blog hosts.",

        "The performance of these algorithms can be improved by using resampling methods, but not all resampling methods achieve gains and those that do gain very little.",
        "The extremely high success rates of the plain algorithms means that there is very little room for improvement, especially as the classification errors are almost always caused by outliers that none of the algorithms manage to classify correctly.",
        "The results of later experiments with larger numbers of manually annotated instances show that a lot of work remains to be done and that although this paper shows that the application of machine learning to this problem offers substantial improvements over our baseline, this problem is still far from solved.",
