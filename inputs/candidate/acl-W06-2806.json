        "The study presented in this paper has been designed to explore the current state of genre evolution on the web through web users' perception.",
        "The web can be interpreted, among other things, as a genre repertoire in evolution because there are still many genre labels which have not been consolidated and many web pages that cannot be sorted into a recognized and acknowledged genre.",
        "The interpretation of the web as a genre repertoire in evolution has been developed within a research project on automatic identification of genre in web pages (Santini, 2006b).",
        "This interpretation is an attempt to explain the high level of hybridism and individualization of many web pages, which result in classification intractability.",
        "The study reported in this paper shows that humans have the same problems as classification algorithms when it comes to less standardized and conventionalized web pages.",
        "As it has often been pointed out (for example, cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005), it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a single perspective or to find an agreed definition of what genre is.",
        "This lack is also experienced in the more restricted world of non-literary or nonfictional genres, such as professional or instrumental genres, where the variation due to personal style is less pronounced than in literary genres.",
        "In particular, scholars working with practical genres focus upon a specific environment.",
        "For instance Swales (1990) develops his notion of genre in academic and research settings, Bathia (1993) and Trosborg (2000) in professional settings, Yates and Orlikowsky (1992) within organizational communication.",
        "Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical notion, genre is a well-established term (cf. Karlgren, 2004), intuitively understood in its vagueness.",
        "Classifying documents by genre is a common operation that humans perform with more or less effort.",
        "Genres can be seen as \"artifacts\", i.e. cultural objects created to meet and streamline communicative needs.",
        "These cultural objects represent the role that a certain type of documents plays in an environment.",
        "Each genre shows a set of standardized or conventional characteristics that makes it recognizable among",
        "others, and this kind of identity raises specific expectations in the recipients, despite the fuzziness of genre labels (cf. Santini, 2005).",
        "Being cultural objects, showing common conventions and raising similar expectations are unifying traits.",
        "Together with these, there is a number of separating traits, such as hybridism, individualization, and evolution.",
        "In fact, genres are not mutually exclusive and different genres can be merged in a single document, generating hybrid forms.",
        "Genres are based on conventions, but allow a certain freedom of variation and consequently can be individualized.",
        "Being artifacts, sharing conventions and expectations, showing hybridism and individualization, and undergoing evolution are important traits characterizing all sorts of genres.",
        "More precisely, genres can be defined as cultural artifacts, i.e. objects linked to a culture, a society or a community, bearing standardized features (conventions) but leaving space for creativity (individualization).",
        "On the one hand, standardized and recurrent features induce predictable expectations in the receivers.",
        "On the other hand, the freedom allowed by creativity allow genres to change, evolve, and be created to meet new needs (genre evolution), especially under the impulse of a new communication medium.",
        "While the change is still ongoing, i.e. before a modified genre is redefined, or a new genre is identified with a new name, documents show mixed forms and functions (genre hybridism).",
        "This view of genre is flexible enough to encompass not only paper genres (both literary and practical genres), but also digital genres and, more specifically, web genres, such as the personal home page.",
        "The personal home page has no evident antecedent in the paper world (cf. Dillon and Gushrowski, 2000).",
        "It sprang up on the web as a new cultural object servicing the community of web users.",
        "When browsing a personal home page, web users expect a blend of standardized information (self-narration, personal interests, contact details, and often pictures related to one's life) and personal touch.",
        "Another important thing to notice is that before genre conventions become fully standardized, genres do not have an official name.",
        "A genre name becomes acknowledged when the genre itself has a role and a communicative function in a community or society (Gorlach, 2004: 9).",
        "Before this acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or individualized forms, and undefined functions.",
        "For example, before 1998 web logs (or blogs) were already present on the Web, but they were not identified as a genre.",
        "They were just \"web pages\", with similar characteristics and functions.",
        "In 1999, suddenly a community sprang up using this new genre (Blood, 2000).",
        "Only at this point, the genre label \"web log\" or \"blog\" started spreading and being recognized.",
        "Genre hybridism and individualization are evident on the web, and play an important role in the change and the creation of new genres.",
        "In fact, web pages – which can be considered as a new kind of document, much more unpredictable and customized than paper documents (Santini, 2006a) – are often hybrid because of intra-genre and inter-genre variations.",
        "They are also highly individualized because of the creative freedom provided by HTML or XML tags (the building blocks of web pages) or programming languages such as Javascript.",
        "On the web, new genres are constantly added (blogs, clogs, eshops, wikis, etc.)",
        "and traditional genres are adapted or updated in order to include more or different functionalities (online front pages, ezines, net ads, etc.).",
        "Genres such as emails, newsletters, search pages, eshops, etc.",
        "were a futuristic prophecy only 10 or 15 years ago, while today they belong to the normal life of a web user.",
        "Presumably, other genres will soon be added to meet new communicative needs brought about by new technologies.",
        "As any other evolutions, also genre evolution proceeds along the axis of time.",
        "It is a diachronic process.",
        "There must be a `before' and an `after'.",
        "What often hallmarks a `before' and an `after' is the introduction of a new communication medium within a culture, a society, a community.",
        "The added value of studying genres on the web (a new medium) is represented by the possibility of following the development of genres and genres repertoires live, i.e. while it is taking place, and not a posteriori.",
        "That is, on the web we can capture synchronically a diachronic process.",
        "From a synchronic point of view, the genre repertoire is a continuum, where there are three forces interacting: what we bring from the past (reproduced genres), what is new or adapted to the new environment (novel genres and adapted genres), what is going to emerge and is not fully formed yet (emerging genres).",
        "This view of genre evolution complements previous studies on the same subject (cf. Crowston and Williams, 1997; Shepherd and Watters, 1998; Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005).",
        "The main contribution of the synchronic",
        "continuum is that an additional force has been acknowledged to take part in the evolution process, i.e. emerging genres.",
        "Emerging genres are those that are not fully standardized, that are still in formation and for which a genre label has not been created or have a label which is still opaque to the majority of users.",
        "Currently many web pages are in this phase of evolution, showing a high level of hybridism or individualization.",
        "We suggest that the subjects' perception of these web pages can be interpreted in term of genre evolution.",
        "The study reported in this paper provides a snapshot of the current state of the genre repertoire of web pages seen through the perception of web users.",
        "Although this view is partial (23 labels to be assigned to 25 web pages), it offers an interesting section of the genre repertoire on the web.",
        "This study can be also seen as a confirmatory study, because it confirms that a number of recent web genres, unprecedented in the paper world (such as home page, FAQs, blog) can be recognized by the subjects; others have not fully emerged and many web users are not familiar with their new genre labels; finally some web pages show a high level of ambiguity and web users largerly disagree on assigning labels to them.",

        "No studies have been carried out so far on users' perception of a genre repertoire in transition.",
        "Crowston and Williams (1997) were the first who reported on the genre repertoire on the web.",
        "They identified 48 reproduced and emergent genres in a sample of about 1,000 web pages.",
        "A few user studies were carried out with the more pragmatic approach of exploring the usefulness of genre to improve web searches and defining a genre palette appropriate for this purpose.",
        "The most comprehensive study related to genre effectiveness for web searching is recent.",
        "Rosso (2005) carried out a series of four linked experiments, all based on human subjects.",
        "Quite surprisingly, the conclusion drawn by the author was that genre-annotated search results produced no significant improvement in participants' ability to make more consistent or faster assessment on the relevance of search results (Rosso, 2005: 133-179).",
        "In fact, only 17 of 32 participants reported noticing the genre label (Rosso, 2005: 176).",
        "Most probably, as pointed out by the author, this outcome was influenced by the difficulty and complexity of the task, together with the limitations of the setting (Rosso, 2005: 170-172).",
        "Rosso's attempt to assess the relevance of search results including genre labels was almost unique.",
        "All other studies with web users, in contrast, did not provide any assessment of how well genres improved a web search.",
        "These studies are more like surveys on users' preferences in terms of useful non-topical categories that can help restrict web searches.",
        "Along this line, Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004) built a genre palette for the web using two criteria: usability and feasibility.",
        "Their user study was based on a questionnaire where they asked about search engine use, usefulness of genre classification, and usefulness of genre classes.",
        "Interestingly, the authors note that one of the inherent problems of genre classification is that \"even humans are not able to consistently specify the genre of a given page\" because web pages have different functions, i.e. they might be hybrid forms, as in the case of product information sites that are combined with a shopping interface.",
        "Roussinov et al.",
        "(2001) carried out a exploratory study of web users in order to identify what genres they most/least frequently come in contact with, and what genres most/least address their information needs.",
        "In their study, carried out in 2000, 116 different genres were identified, but not all web pages could be classified.",
        "Karlgren (2000: 99 ff.",
        "), a pioneer in building a genre palette, tried to collect genres that were both consistent with what users expect as well as conveniently computable.",
        "He sent around a questionnaire where the core question was: \"What genres do you feel you find on the WWW?\".",
        "He ended up with a palette of 11 genres.",
        "One frequent comment by the respondents was that the genres in the palette were not mutually exclusive, in other words they showed some level of hybridism.",
        "Very informative in many respects, these studies have in common the practical aim of improving web searches.",
        "This might explain why they overlook difficult issues such as the hybridism or the individualization of many web pages, which are nonetheless perceived by the subjects.",
        "The authors must necessarily focus on",
        "unambiguous exemplars, showing clear-cut conventions and expectations.",
        "The present study, on the other hand, explores the perception of genres when users are faced not only with prototypical genre exemplars but also with hybrid or individualized web pages, and interpret the subjects' perception in term of genre evolution."

        "These three ranges can be interpreted in terms of genre evolution: high perception for the most stable and acknowledge genres; medium perception for emerging genres, not fully acknowledged by the majority or still unstable, and finally low perception for the highly ambiguous genres (for different reasons).",
        "Some of the new web genres can be unambiguously perceived (for example, personal home page, eshop, corporate home page, FAQs and search page).",
        "Web users can also handle a certain degree of granularity, for example by distinguishing a personal home page from a corporate home page, but the boundary between academic home pages and organizational home pages is still too fuzzy for them.",
        "The approach to the web as a genre repertoire in evolution and these preliminary findings can turn out to be useful when building web genre palettes or when designing new genre identification experiments.",

        "), but their full interpretation is still under study.",
        "The challenging follow up of these preliminary results is to find an objective coefficient of agreement applicable for 135 raters that can choose among 23 categories to classify 25 objects."
