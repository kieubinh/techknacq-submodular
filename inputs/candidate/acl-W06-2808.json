        "Network Informal Language (NIL) refers to the special human language widely used in the community of network communication via platforms such as chat rooms/tools, mobile phone short message services (SMS), bulletin board systems (BBS), emails, blogs, etc.",
        "NIL is ubiquitous due in special to the rapid proliferation of Internet applications.",
        "As one important type of NIL text, chat text appears frequently within increasing volume of chat logs of online education (Heard-White, 2004) and customer relationship management (Gianforte, 2003) via chat rooms/tools.",
        "In wed-based chat rooms and BBS a large volume of NIL text is abused by (McCul-lagh, 2004).",
        "A survey by the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) showed that Germans send 200 million messages a year (German News, 2004).",
        "All the facts disclose the growing importance in processing NIL text.",
        "Chat text holds anomalous characteristics in forming non-alphabetical characters, words, and phrases.",
        "It uses ill-edited terms and anomalous writing styles.",
        "Typical examples of anomalous Chinese chat terms can be found in (Xia et.",
        "al., 2005a).",
        "Besides the anomalous characteristics, our observations reveal remarkable dynamic nature of the chat text.",
        "The anomaly is created and discarded very quickly.",
        "Although there is no idea how tomorrow’s chat text would look like, the changing will never stop.",
        "Instead, the changing gets faster and faster.",
        "The challenging issues originates from the dynamic nature are twofold.",
        "On the one hand, anomalous chat terms and writing styles are frequently found in chat text.",
        "Knowledge about chat text is urgently required to understand the anomaly.",
        "On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the chat text makes it nearly impossible to maintain a timely chat text knowledge base.",
        "This claim has been proved by (Xia et.",
        "al., 2005a) in which experiments are conducted with an SVM classifier.",
        "The classifier is trained on chat text created in an earlier period and tested on chat text created in a later period.",
        "In their experiments, performance of the SVM classifier becomes lower when the two periods are farther.",
        "This reveals that chat text is written in such a style that changes constantly along with time.",
        "A straightforward solution to this problem is to retrain the SVM classifier periodically with timely chat text collections.",
        "Unfortunately, this solution costs a lot of manpower in producing new chat text corpora.",

        "vised learning technique becomes ineffective in processing chat text.",
        "This paper proposes approaches to detecting anomaly in dynamic Chinese chat text by incorporating standard Chinese corpora and a static chat corpus.",
        "The idea is basically error-driven.",
        "That is, we first create standard language models using trigram on standard Chinese corpora.",
        "These corpora provide negative training samples.",
        "We then construct anomalous chat language model using one static chat text corpus which provides positive training samples.",
        "We incorporate the chat language model with the standard language models and calculate confidence and entropy to help make decisions whether input text is anomalous chat text.",
