        "Parallel corpora form the basis of much multilingual research in natural language processing, ranging from developing multilingual lexicons to statistical machine translation systems.",
        "As a consequence, collecting and aligning text corpora written in different languages constitutes an important prerequisite for these research activities.",
        "Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia.",
        "Currently, it has entries for more than 200 languages, the English Wikipedia being the largest one with 895,674 articles, and no fewer than eight language versions having upwards of 100,000 articles as of January 2006.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1, Wikipedia pages for major European languages have reached a level where they can support multilingual research.",
        "Despite these developments in its content, research on Wikipedia has largely focused on monolingual aspects so far; see e.g., (Voss, 2005) for an overview.",
        "In this paper, we focus on multilingual aspects of Wikipedia.",
        "Particularly, we investigate to what extent we can use properties of Wikipedia itself to generate similar sentences acrose different languages.",
        "As usual, we consider two sentences similar if they contain (some or a large amount of) overlapping information.",
        "This includes cases in which sentences may be exact translations of each other, one sentence may be contained within another, or both share some bits of information.",
        "The conceptually simple but fundamental task of identifying similar sentences across multiple languages has a number of motivations.",
        "For a start, and as mentioned earlier, sentence aligned corpora play an important role in corpus based language processing methods in general.",
        "Second, in the context of Wikipedia, being able to align similar sentences across multiple languages provides insight into Wikipedia as a knowledge source: to which extent does a given topic get different kinds of attention in different languages?",
        "And thirdly, the ability to find similar content in other languages while creating a page for a topic in one language constitutes a useful type of editing support.",
        "Furthermore, finding similar content acrose different languages can form the basis for multilingual summarization and question answering support for",
        "Wikipedia; at present the latter task is being developed into a pilot for CLEF 2006 (WiQA, 2006).",
        "There are different approaches for finding similar sentences across multiple languages in nonparallel but comparable corpora.",
        "Most methods for finding similar sentences assume the availability of a clean parallel corpus.",
        "In Wikipedia, two versions of a Wikipedia topic in two different languages are a good starting point for searching similar sentences.",
        "However, these pages may not always conform to the typical definitions of a bitext which current techniques assume.",
        "Bitext generally refers to two versions of a text in two different languages (Melamed, 1996).",
        "Though it is not known how information is shared among the different languages in Wikipedia, some pages tend to be translations of each other whereas the majority of the pages tend to be written independently of each other.",
        "Therefore, two versions of the same topic in two different languages can not simply be taken as parallel corpora.",
        "This in turn limits the application of some of the currently available techniques.",
        "In this paper, we present two approaches for finding similar sentences across multiple languages in Wikipedia.",
        "The first approach uses freely available online machine translation resources for translating pages and then carries out monolingual sentence similarity.",
        "The approach needs a translation system, and these are not available for every pair of languages in Wikipedia.",
        "This motivates a second approach to finding similar sentences across multiple languages, one which uses a bilingual title translation lexicon induced automatically using the link structure of Wikipedia.",
        "Briefly, two sentences are similar if they link to the same entities (or rather: to pages about the same entities), and we use Wikipedia itself to relate pages about a given entity across multiple languages.",
        "In Wikipedia, pages on the same topic in different languages are topically closely related.",
        "This means that even if one page is not a translation of another, they tend to share some common information.",
        "Our underlying assumption here is that there is a general agreement on the kind of information that needs to be included in the pages of different types of topics such as a biography of a person, and the definition and description of a concept etc., and that this agreement is to a consderable extent “materialized” in the hypertext links (and their anchor texts) in Wikipedia.",
        "Our main research question in this paper is this: how do the two methods just outlined differ?",
        "A priori it seems that the translation based approach to finding similar sentences across multiple languages will have a higher recall than the link-based method, while the latter outperforms the former in terms of precision.",
        "Is this correct?",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly discuss related work.",
        "Section 3 provides a detailed description of Wikipedia as a corpus.",
        "The two approaches to identifying similar sentences across multiple languages are presented in Section 4.",
        "An experimental evaluation is presented in Section 5.",
        "We conclude in Section 6."

        "One advantage of this method is that it relies on a large lexical resource which is bigger than what can be extracted from Wikipedia.",
        "However, the translation can be less accurate especially for the Wikipedia titles which form part of the content of a page and are very informative.",
        "The second approach relies on a bilingual lexicon which is generated from Wikipedia using the link structure: pages on the same topic in different languages are hyperlinked; see Figure 2.",
        "We use the titles of the pages that are linked in this manner to create a bilingual lexicon.",
        "Thus, our bilingual lexicon consists of terms that represent",
        "concepts or entities that have entries in Wikipedia, and we will represent sentences by entries from this lexicon: an entry is used to represent the content of a sentence if the sentence contains a hypertext link to the Wikipedia page for that entry.",
        "Sentence similarity is then captured in terms of the shared lexicon entries they share.",
        "In other words, the similarity measure that we use in this approach is based on “concept” or “page title” overlap.",
        "Intuitively, this approach has the advantage of producing a brief but highly accurate representation of sentences, more accurate, we assume than the MT approach as the titles carry important semantic information; it will also be more accurate than the MT approach because the translations of the titles are done manually.",
        "Both approaches assume that the Wikipedia corpus is aligned at the page level.",
        "This is easily achieved using the link structure since, again, pages on the same topic in different languages are hyperlinked.",
        "This, in turns, narrows down the search for similar text to a page level.",
        "Hence, for a given text of a page (sentence or chunk) in one language, we search for its equivalent text (sentence or chunk) only in the corresponding page in the other language, not in the entire corpus.",
        "We now describe the two approaches in more detail.",
        "To remain focused and avoid getting lost in technical details, we consider only two languages in our technical descriptions and evaluations below: Dutch and English; it will be clear from our presentation, however, that our second approach can be used for any pair of languages in Wikipedia."
