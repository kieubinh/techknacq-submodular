        "(Todd, 2005) distinguishes between “local-level topics (of sentences, utterances and short discourse segments)” and “discourse topics (of more extended stretches of discourse)”.1 (Todd, 2005) points out that “discourse-level topics are one of the most elusive and intractable notions in semantics”.",
        "Despite this difficulty in giving a rigorous definition of discourse topic, the task of discourse/dialogue segmentation into thematic episodes can be described by",
        "invoking an “intuitive notion of topic” (Brown and Yule, 1998).",
        "Thematic segmentation also relates to several notions such as speaker’s intention, topic flow and cohesion.",
        "In order to find out if thematic segment identification is a feasible task, previous state-of-the-art works appeal to experiments, in which several human subjects are asked to mark thematic segment boundaries based on their intuition and a minimal set of instructions.",
        "In this manner, previous studies, e.g. (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Galley et al., 2003), obtained a level of inter-annotator agreement that is statistically significant.",
        "Automatic thematic segmentation (TS), i.e. the segmentation of a text stream into topically coherent segments, is an important component in applications dealing with large document collections such as information retrieval and document browsing.",
        "Other tasks that could benefit from the thematic textual structure include anaphora resolution, automatic summarisation and discourse understanding.",
        "The work presented here tackles the problem of TS by adopting a supervised learning approach for capturing linear document structure of non-overlapping thematic episodes.",
        "A prerequisite for the input data to our system is that texts are divided into sentences or utterances.2 Each boundary between two consecutive utterances is a potential thematic segmentation point and therefore, we model the TS task as a binary-classification problem, where each utterance should be classified as marking the",
        "presence or the absence of a topic shift in the discourse/dialogue based only on observations of patterns in vocabulary use.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "The next section summarizes previous techniques, describes how our method relates to them and presents the motivations for a support vector approach.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present our approach in adopting support vector learning for thematic segmentation.",
        "Section 5 outlines the empirical methodology and describes the data used in this study.",

        "As in many existing approaches to the thematic segmentation task, we make the assumption that the thematic coherence of a text segment is reflected at lexical level and therefore we attempt to detect the correlation between word distribution and thematic changes throughout the text.",
        "In this manner, (Hearst, 1997; Reynar, 1998; Choi, 2000) start by using a similarity measure between sentences or fixed-size blocks of text, based on their word frequencies in order to find changes in vocabulary use and therefore the points at which the topic changes.",
        "Sentences are then grouped together by using a clustering algorithm.",
        "(Utiyama and Isahara, 2001) models the problem of TS as a problem of finding the minimum cost path in a graph and therefore adopts a dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "The main advantage of such methods is that no training time and corpora are required.",
        "By modeling TS as binary-classification problem, we introduce a new technique based on support vector machines (SVMs).",
        "The main advantage offered by SVMs with respect to methods such as those described above is related to the distance (or similarity) function used.",
        "Thus, although (Choi, 2000; Hearst, 1997) employ a distance function (i.e. cosine distance) to detect thematic shifts, SVMs are capable of using a larger variety of similarity functions.",
        "Moreover, SVMs can employ distance functions that operate in extremely high dimensional feature spaces.",
        "This is an important property for our task, where handling high dimensionality data representation is necessary (see section 4).",
        "An alternative to dealing with high dimension data may be to reduce the dimensionality of the data representation.",
        "Therefore, linear algebra dimensionality reduction methods like singular value decomposition have been adopted by (Choi et al., 2001; Popescu-Belis et al., 2004) in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for the task of thematic segmentation.",
        "A Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) approach has been adopted by (Brants et al., 2002; Farahat and Chen, 2006) for the TS task.",
        "(Blei and Moreno, 2001) proposed a TS approach, by embedding a PLSA model in an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach, while (Yam-ron et al., 1998) have previously proposed a HMM approach for TS.",
        "A shortcoming of the methods described above is due to their typically generative manner of training, i.e. using the maximum likelihood estimation for a joint sampling model of observation and label sequences.",
        "This poses the challenge of finding more appropriate objective functions, i.e. alternatives to the log-likelihood that are more closely related to application-relevant performance measures.",
        "Secondly, efficient inference and learning for the TS task often requires making questionable conditional independence assumptions.",
        "In such cases, improved performance may be obtained by using methods with a more discriminative character, by allowing direct dependencies between a label and past/future observations and by efficient handling higher-order combinations of input features.",
        "Given the discriminative character of SVMs, we expect our model to attain similar benefits."

        "Aside from the fact that we consider the TS task on different datasets (not only on narrative documents), our approach is different from the approach proposed by (Kauchak and Chen, 2005) mainly by the data representation we propose and by the fact that we put the emphasis on deriving the thematic structure merely from word distribution, while (Kauchak and Chen, 2005) observed that the ‘block similarities provide little information about the actual segment boundaries’ on their data and therefore they concentrated on exploiting other features.",
        "An excellent general introduction to SVMs and other kernel methods is given for instance in (Cris-tianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).",

        "On the other hand, dismissing true properties of the data as sampling bias in the training data will result in low accuracy.",
        "Therefore, the regularization parameter is used to balance the trade-off between these two competing considerations.",
        "Setting the regularization parameter too low can result in poor accuracy, while setting it too high can lead to overfitting.",
        "In the TS task, we used an automated procedure to select the regularization parameters, as further described in section 5.3.",
        "In cases where non-linear hypothesis functions should be optimised, each 2ti can be mapped into cp(2ti) E F, where F is a higher dimensional space usually called feature space, in order to make linear the relation between 2ti and yi.",
        "Thus the original linear learning machine can be adopted in finding the classification solution in the feature space.",
        "When using a mapping function cp : U – * F, if we have a way of computing the inner product (cp(2ti), cp(2tj)) directly as a function of the original input point, then the so-called kernel function K(2ti, 2tj) = (cp(2ti), cp(2tj)) is proved to simplify the computational complexity implied by the direct use of the mapping function cp.",
        "The choice of appropriate kernels and its specific parameters is an empirical issue.",
