        "Recently, dependency grammar has gained renewed attention in the parsing community.",

        "Many previous works focus on unlabeled parsing, in which exhaustive methods are often used (Eis-ner, 1996).",
        "Their global searching performs well in the unlabeled dependency parsing.",
        "But with the increase of parameters, efficiency has to be considered in labeled dependency parsing.",
        "Thus deterministic parsing was proposed as a robust and efficient method in recent years.",
        "Such method breaks the construction of dependency tree into a series of actions.",
        "A classifier is often used to choose the most probable action to assemble the dependency tree.",

        "The algorithm in (Nivre et al., 2004) is a blend of bottom-up and top-down processing.",
        "Its classifier is trained by memory-based learning.",
        "Deterministic parsing derives an analysis without redundancy or backtracking, and linear time can be achieved.",
        "But when searching the local optimum in the order of left-to-right, some wrong reduce may prevent next analysis with more possibility.",
        "(Jin et al., 2005) used a two-phase shift-reduce to decrease such errors, and improved the accuracy of long distance dependencies.",
        "In this paper a deterministic parsing based on dynamic local optimization is proposed.",
        "According to the probabilities of dependency arcs, the algorithm dynamically finds the one with the highest probabilities instead of dealing with the sentence in order.",
