        "Question Answering (QA) is an interactive human-machine process that aims to respond to users’ natural language questions with exact answers rather than a list of documents.",
        "In the last few years, QA has attracted broader research attention from both the information retrieval (Voorhees, 2004) and the computational linguistic fields (http://www.clt.mq.edu.au/Events/",
        "this technology to open-domain solutions.",
        "More task-oriented QA systems are deployed as virtual customer care agents addressing questions about specific domains.",
        "For instance, the AT&T Ask Allie® agent (http://www.allie.att.com/) is able to answer questions about the AT&T plans and services; and the Ikea “Just Ask Anna!” agent (http://www.ikea.com/ms/enUS/) targets questions pertaining the company’s catalog.",
        "Most of these QA systems, however, are limited to answer questions in isolation.",
        "The reality is that users often ask questions naturally as part of contextualized interaction.",
        "For instance, a question “How do I subscribe to the AT&T CallVantage® service?” is likely to be followed by other related questions like “How much will the basic plan cost?” and so on.",
        "Furthermore, many questions that users frequently want answers for cannot be satisfied with a simple answer.",
        "Some of them are too complicated, broad, narrow, or vague resulting that there isn’t a simple good answer or there are many good answer candidates, which entails a clarification procedure to constrain or relax the search.",
        "In all these cases, a question answering system that is able to answer contextual questions is more favored.",
        "Contextual question answering as a research challenge has been fostered by TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) since 2001.",
        "The TREC 2001 QA track made the first attempt to evaluate QA systems’ ability of tracking context through a series of questions.",
        "The TREC 2004 reintroduced this task and organized all questions into 64 series, with each series focusing on a specific topic.",
        "The earlier questions in a series provide context for the ongoing question.",
        "However, in reality, QA systems will not be",
        "informed about the boundaries between series in advance.",
        "One challenge of engaging dialogue into QA systems is to determine the boundaries between topics.",
        "For each question, the system would need to determine whether the question begins a new topic or it is a follow-up question related to the current existing topic.",
        "We refer to this procedure as relevancy recognition.",
        "If a question is recognized as a follow-up question, the next step is to make use of context information to interpret it and retrieve the answer.",
        "We refer to this procedure as context information fusion.",
        "Relevancy recognition is similar to text segmentation (Hearst, 1994), but relevancy recognition focuses on the current question with the previous text while text segmentation has the full text available and is allowed to look ahead.",
        "De Boni and Manandhar (2005) developed a rule-based algorithm for relevancy recognition.",
        "Their rules were manually deduced by carefully analyzing the TREC 2001 QA data.",
        "For example, if a question has no verbs, it is a follow-up question.",
        "This rule-based algorithm achieves 81 % in accuracy when recognizing the question relevance in the TREC 2001 QA data set.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that it involves a good deal of human effort to research on a specific data set and summarize the rules.",
        "For a new corpus from a different domain, it is very likely that one would have to go over the data set and modify the rules, which is time and human-effort consuming.",
        "An alternative is to pursue a data driven approach to automatically learn the rules from a data set.",
        "In this paper, we describe our experiments of using supervised learning classification techniques for the task of relevancy recognition.",
        "Experiments show that machine learning approach achieves better recognition accuracy and can also be easily applied to a new domain.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we summarize De Boni and Manandhar’s rule-based algorithm.",
        "We present our learning approach in Section 3.",
        "We ran our experiments on two data sets, namely, the TREC QA data and the HandQA data, and give the results in Section 4.",
        "In section 5, we report our preliminary study on context information fusion.",
        "We conclude this paper in Section 6."

        "Researchers have proposed a variety of ways in measuring the semantic similarity or relatedness between two words (to be exact, word senses) based on WordNet.",

        "Relevancy recognition is the first step of contextual question answering.",
        "If a question is recognized as following the current existing topic, the next step is to make use of the context information to interpret it",
        "and retrieve the answers.",
        "To explore how context information helps answer retrieval, we conducted preliminary experiments with the TREC 2004 QA data.",
        "We indexed the TREC documents using the Lucene search engine (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) for document retrieval.",
        "The Lucene search engine takes as input a query (a list of keywords), and returns a ranked list of relevant documents, of which the first 50 were taken and analyzed in our experiments.",
        "We tried different strategies for query formulation.",
        "Simply using the questions as the query, only 20% of the follow-up questions find their answers in the first 50 returned documents.",
        "This percentage went up to 85% when we used the topic words, provided in TREC data for each section, as the query.",
        "Because topic words are usually not available in real world applications, to be more practical, we tried using the noun phrases in the first question as the query.",
        "In this case, 81% of the questions are able to find the answers in the returned documents.",
        "When we combined the (follow-up) question with the noun phrases in the first question as the query, the retrieved rate increases to 84%.",
        "Typically, document retrieval is a crucial step for QA systems.",
        "These results suggest that context information fusion has a big potential to improve the performance of answer retrieval.",
        "However, we leave the topic of how to fuse context information into the follow-up questions as future work."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we present a data driven approach, decision tree learning, for the task of relevancy recognition in contextual question answering.",
        "Experiments show that this approach achieves 93% accuracy on the TREC data, about 12% improvement from the rule-based algorithm reported by De Boni and Mananhar (2005).",
        "Moreover, this data driven approach requires much less human effort on investigating a specific data set and less human expertise to summarize rules from the observation.",
        "All the features we used in the training can be automatically extracted.",
        "This makes it straightforward to train a model in a new domain, such as the HandQA.",
        "Furthermore, decision tree learning is a white-box model and the trained tree is human interpretable.",
        "It shows that the path measure has the best information gain among the other semantic similarity measures.",
        "We also report our preliminary experiment results on context information fusion for question answering."
