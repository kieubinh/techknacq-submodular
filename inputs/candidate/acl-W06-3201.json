        "For acoustic measurements, speech data must be accessible for model training.",

        "This paper presents a fully automated linguistic approach to measuring distance between phonemes across languages.",
        "In this approach, a phoneme is represented by a feature matrix where feature categories are fixed, hierarchically related and binary-valued; feature categorization explicitly addresses allophonic variation and feature values are weighted based on their relative prominence derived from lexical frequency measurements.",
        "The relative weight of feature values is factored into phonetic distance calculation.",
        "Two phonological distances are statistically derived from lexical frequency measurements.",
        "The phonetic distance is combined with the phonological distances to produce a single metric that quantifies cross-language phoneme distance.",
        "The performances of target-language phoneme HMMs constructed solely with source language HMMs, first selected by the combined phonetic and phonological metric and then by a data-driven, acoustics distance-based method, are compared in context-independent automatic speech recognition (ASR) experiments.",
        "Results show that this approach consistently performs equivalently to the acoustics-based approach, confirming its effectiveness in estimating cross-language similarity between phonemes in an ASR environment.",
        "erally restricted to only the most basic symbols, usually unmodified letters of the Roman alphabet (IPA 1999).",
        "Second, phoneme transcription labels fail to capture allophony.",
        "The best phonetic definition that a phoneme transcription label can offer is the most typical phonetic realization of that phoneme.",
        "Not surprisingly, label-based cross-language transfer experiments have produced poor performance results.",
        "In contrast to the subjective, label-based strategy, researchers in such fields as language reconstruction, dialectometry, and child language development, commonly use automatic feature-based approaches to articulatory similarity between phonemes.",
        "In these methods, phonemes are represented by a distinctive feature vector and a phonetic distance or similarity algorithm is used to align phoneme strings between related words (Connolly 1997; Kessler 1995, 2005; Kondrak 2002; Nerbonne and Heeringa 1997; Somers 1998).",
        "Significantly, in these approaches, phonological similarity is generally assumed.",
        "In principle, the feature-based approach to phonetic distance admits more precise specification of phonemes because it supports allophonic variance.",
        "For example, a standard feature-based approach to allophony representation restricts feature inclusion to only those features relevant to all realizations of the phoneme.",
        "Another common approach retains features that are relevant to all allophonic variants, but leaves their values underspecified (Archangeli 1988).",
        "However, it is unclear from the literature whether allophony is explicitly addressed in the current feature-based approaches to phoneme similarity.",
        "A strategy for specifying allophony and characterizing phonetic distance between phonemes is only one component in predicting phoneme similarity among diverse languages without acoustic data in an ASR environment.",
        "Because HMMs represent phonemes and significant allophones in a language-dependent context, it is necessary to consider the overall constructed target-language HMM system.",
        "Thus phonological distance quantities that regulate the priority of source languages for phoneme selection in accordance to their phonological similarity to the target language are also in order.",
        "In this paper, we describe an automated, combined phonetic-phonological (CPP) approach to estimating phoneme similarity across languages in ASR.",
        "Elsewhere, we provide the phonetic and phonological distance algorithms (Liu and Melnar 2005, 2006), though offer little linguistic justification of the approach or evaluation of the experiment results due to space limitations.",
        "Here, we focus on explaining the linguistic principles behind the algorithms and analyzing the results.",
        "The CPP approach is fundamentally based on articulatory phonetic features and is designed to handle allophonic variation.",
        "Feature salience and phonetic distance are automatically calculated and phoneme distance is constrained by statistically-derived phonological similarity biases.",
        "Unlike other distinctive feature-based approaches to phoneme similarity, phonological distance is not assumed.",
        "In testing this approach in cross-language transfer experiments, target-language resources are restricted to lexica and phonology descriptions and do not include speech data.",
        "In the next section, we describe our feature-based phoneme specification method.",
        "In section three, we show how our phoneme specification approach is used in calculating phonetic distance between phonemes.",
        "Section four describes two other distance metrics that predict phonological similarity between languages.",
        "We explain how the three distance metrics combine to quantify cross-language phoneme distance and select target-language phoneme HMM inventories.",

        "We suggest four principal performance factors to explain the results provided in Table 4: (1) rare phonemes in the target-language inventory; (2) target-language inventory complexity; (3) degree of source-language phonological distance to the target language; (4) reliability of source-language models.",
        "Because the CPP approach has only been tested on five languages, we consider this analysis preliminary.",
        "Regarding the first factor, rare phonemes in the target-language inventory, it is worth noting that neither Latin American Spanish nor Italian has phonemes whose exact feature specifications are unattested in phonemes from other languages in",
        "our dataset.",
        "For these languages, all phonemes have exact source-language matches.",
        "In contrast, Japanese, Danish, and European Portuguese each contain phonemes with feature specifications unique to their language.",
        "Based on this analysis, we propose that, all other factors being equal, the greater the overall phoneme correspondence between the target language and the source languages, the better the target-language HMM performance.",
        "In general, it appears that target languages associated with inventories that are greater in size than their least phonologically distant source languages perform worse than target languages associated with smaller inventories relative to their closest source languages.",
        "For example, the vowel systems of Danish, European Portuguese, and Japanese are the most complex of the five target languages, with Danish having 26 vowels, European Portuguese having 14 vowels, and Japanese having ten vowels.",
        "In sharp contrast, Latin American Spanish has only five vowels and Italian has seven.",
        "Both Latin American Spanish and Italian are phonologically similar to other Romance languages in the dataset that have greater vowel contrasts: Brazilian Portuguese (13 vowels), European Portuguese (14 vowels), Parisian French (17 vowels) and Canadian French (19 vowels).",
        "Here, we suggest that target languages that have a similar or lesser number of phoneme contrasts compared to the source languages are more likely to achieve higher recognition performances, all other factors being equal.",
        "Relative phonological distance of the source languages to the target language and reliability of source language models additionally impact target-language ASR performance.",
        "Consider Table 5 where the difference in these factors for Italian and European Portuguese are given.",
        "First, Italian and European Portuguese are both Romance languages and our dataset includes a total of six, presumably phonologically similar, Romance languages and dialects.",
        "However, the recognition results of the models selected by both the feature-based and acoustics-based phoneme distance method are very different for the two languages.",
        "If we compare the phonological distances between the least distant source languages to Italian and European Portuguese, we observe that Italian’s closest languages are less distant overall than European Portuguese’s closest languages.",
        "Because the phonologically least distant source languages contribute the majority of target-language HMMs, it is reasonable to expect that lesser phonological distance to the target language by a greater number of source languages is likely to result in a better target-language HMM performance, all other factors being equal.",
        "Finally, note the substantial discrepancy in native baseline performance between the phonologically least distant source languages for Italian and European Portuguese.",
        "The majority of selected models for Italian derive from Latin American Spanish which is associated with a high native recognition baseline.",
        "European Portuguese models, on the other hand, largely come from Brazilian Portuguese which has a much lower native baseline.",
        "This suggests that the most reliable source-language HMMs, as judged from their native recognition performance, contribute to better target-language recognition performance, all other factors being equal.",
        "In future work, we intend to test our CPP phoneme similarity approach on new target languages and expand the preliminary evaluation provided here.",
        "In particular, we are interested to what extent this method can predict recognition performance for new target languages."
