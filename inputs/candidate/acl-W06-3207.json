        "In Optimality Theory or OT (Prince and Smolen-sky, 1993) grammars are defined by a set of ranked universal and violable constraints.",
        "The function of the grammar is to map underlying or lexical forms to valid surface forms.",
        "The task of the learner is to find the correct grammar, or correct ranking of constraints, as well as the set of underlying forms that correspond to overt surface forms given only the surface forms and the set of universal constraints.",
        "The most well known algorithms for learning OT grammars (Tesar, 1995; Tesar and Smolensky, 1995; Boersma, 1997, 1998; Prince and Tesar, 1999; Boersma and Hayes, 2001) are supervised learners and focus on the task of learning the constraint ranking, given training pairs that map underlying forms to surface forms.",
        "Recent work has focused on the task of unsupervised learning of OT grammars, where only unstructured surface forms are provided to the learner.",
        "Some of this work focuses on grammar learning without training data (Tesar, 1998; Tesar, 1999; Hayes, 2004; Apoussidou and Boersma, 2004).",
        "The remainder of this work tackles the problem of learning the ranking and lexicon simultaneously, the problem addressed in the present paper (Tesar et al., 2003; Tesar, 2004; Tesar and Prince, to appear; Merchant and Tesar, to appear).",
        "These proposals adopt an algebraic approach wherein learning the lexicon involves iteratively eliminating potential underlying forms by determining that they have become logically impossible, given certain assumptions about the learning problem.1 In particular, one simplifying assumption of previous work requires that mappings be one-to-one and onto.",
        "This assumption prohibits input-output mappings with deletion and insertion as well as",
        "constraints that evaluate such mappings.",
        "This work represents a leap forward toward the accurate modeling of human language acquisition, but the identification of a general-purpose, unsupervised learner of OT remains an open problem.",
        "In contrast to previous work, this paper proposes a gradual, probabilistic algorithm for unsupervised OT learning based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Because the algorithm depends on gradually maximizing an objective function, rather than on wholly eliminating logically impossible hypotheses, it is not crucial to prohibit insertion or deletion.",
        "A major challenge posed by unsupervised learning of OT is that of learning restrictive grammars that generate only grammatical forms.",
        "In previous work, the preference for restrictive grammars is implemented by encoding a bias into the ranking algorithm that favors ranking constraints that prohibit marked structures as high as possible.",
        "In contrast, the solution proposed here involves a combination of likelihood maximization and explicit reliance on Richness of the Base, an OT principle requiring that the set of potential underlying forms be universal.",
        "This combination favors restrictive grammars because grammars that map a “rich” lexicon onto observed forms with high probability are preferred.",
        "The proposed model is tested on three constructed language systems, each exemplifying a different type of hidden structure."

        "While the primary task of the grammar is to map underlying forms to overt forms, the grammar’s secondary role is that of a filter – ruling out ungrammatical forms no matter what underlying form is fed to the grammar.",
        "The role of the grammar as filter follows from the OT principle of Richness of the Base, according to which the set of possible underlying forms is universal (Prince and Smolensky 1993).",
        "In other words, the grammar must be restrictive and not over-generate.",
        "The requirement that grammars be restrictive complicates the learning problem - it is not sufficient to find a combination of underlying forms and constraint ranking that yields the set of observed surface forms: the constraint ranking must yield only grammatical forms irrespective of the particular lexical items selected for the language.",
        "In classic OT, constraint ranking is categorical and non-probabilistic.",
        "In recent years various stochastic versions of OT have been proposed to account for free variation (Boersma and Hayes, 2001), lexically conditioned variation (Anttila, 1997), child language acquisition (Legendre et al., 2002) and the modeling of frequencies associated with these phenomena.",
        "In addition to these advantages, probabilistic versions of OT are advantageous from the point of view of learnability.",
        "In particular, the Gradual Learning Algorithm for Stochastic OT (Boersma, 1997, 1998; Boersma and Hayes, 2001) is capable of learning in spite of noisy training data and is capable of learning variable grammars in a supervised fashion.",
        "In addition, probabilistic versions of OT and variants of OT (Goldwater and Johnson, 2003; Rosenbach and Jaeger, 2003) enable learning of OT via likelihood maximization, for which there exist many established algorithms.",
        "Furthermore, as this paper proposes, unsupervised learning of OT using likelihood maximization combined with Richness of the Base provides a natural solution to the grammar-as-filter problem due to the power of probabilistic modeling to use negative evidence implicitly.",
        "The algorithm proposed here relies on a probabilistic extension of OT in which each possible constraint ranking is assigned a probability P(r).",
        "Thus, the OT grammar is a probability distribution over constraint rankings rather than a single constraint ranking.",
        "This notion of probabilistic OT is similar to - but less restricted than - Stochastic OT, in which the distribution over possible rankings is given by the joint probability over independently normally distributed constraints with fixed, equal variance.",
        "The advantage of the present model is computational simplicity, but the proposed learning algorithm does not depend on any particular instantiation of probabilistic OT.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the proposed probabilistic version of OT with an abstract example.",
        "Table 1 shows the violation marks assigned by three constraints, A, B and C, to five candidate outputs O1-O5 for the underlying form, or input /I/.",
        "To compute the winner of an optimization, constraints are applied to the candidate set in order according to their rank.",
        "Candidates continue to the next constraint if they have the fewest (or tie for fewest) constraint violation marks (indicated by asterisks).",
        "In this way the winning or optimal candidate, the",
        "candidate that violates the higher-ranked constraints the least, is selected.",
        "The third column of Table 2 identifies the winner under each possible ranking of the three constraints.",
        "For example, if the ranking is A >> B >> C, constraint A eliminates all but O3 and O4, then constraint B eliminates O3, designating O4 as the winner.",
        "The remainder of Table 2 illustrates the proposed probabilistic instantiation of OT.",
        "The first column shows the probability P(r) that the grammar assigns to each ranking in this example.",
        "The probability of each ranking determines the probability with which the winner under that ranking will be selected for the given input.",
        "In other words, it defines the conditional probability Pr(Ok | I), shown in the fourth column, of the kth output candidate given the input /I/ under the ranking r. The last column shows the total conditional probability for each candidate after summing across rankings.",
        "For instance, O3 is the winner under two of the rankings, and thus its total conditional probability P(O3 |I) is found by summing over the conditional probabilities under each ranking.",
        "The total conditional probability P(O3 |I) refers to the probability that underlying form /I/ will surface as O3, and this probability depends on the grammar.",
        "In addition to the conditional probability assigned by the grammar, this model relies on a probability distribution P(I |M) over possible underlying forms for a given morpheme M. This property of the model implements the standard linguistic proposition that each morpheme has a consistent underlying form across contexts, while the grammar drives allomorphic variation that may result in the morpheme having different surface realizations in different contexts.",
        "Rather than identifying a single underlying form for each morpheme, this model represents the underlying form as a distribution over possible underlying forms, and this distribution is constant across contexts.",
        "To determine the probability of an underlying form for a morphologically complex word, the product of the morpheme’s individual distributions is taken – the probability of an underlying form is taken to be independent of morphological context.",
        "For example, suppose that some morpheme Mk has two possible underlying forms, I1 and I2, and the two underlying forms are equally likely.",
        "This means that the conditional probabilities of both underlying forms are 50%: P(I1 |Mk) = P(I2 |Mk) = 50%.",
        "In sum, the probabilistic model described here consists of a grammar and lexicon, both of which are probabilistic.",
        "The task of learning involves selecting the appropriate parameter settings of both the grammar and lexicon simultaneously."

It is also conditional on M, the set of observed morphemes, which are annotated in the data provided to the algorithm.",
        "M is constant, however, and does not differ between hypotheses for the same data set.",
        "Under this model each unique surface form Ok is treated independently, and the likelihood of the data is simply the product of the probability of each surface form, raised to the power corresponding to its observed frequency Fk.",

        "In OT there are two basic types of constraints, markedness constraints, which penalize dis-preferred surface structures, and faithfulness constraints, which penalize nonidentical mappings from underlying to surface forms.",
        "In general, a restrictive grammar will have markedness constraints ranked high, because these constraints will restrict the type of surface forms that are allowed in a language.",
        "On the other hand, if faithfulness constraints are ranked high, all the distinctions introduced into the lexicon will surface.",
        "Thus, a heuristic preferring markedness constraints to rank high whenever possible does in general prefer restrictive grammars.",
        "However, the markedness over faithfulness heuristic does not exhaust the notion of restrictiveness.",
        "In particular, markedness over faithfulness does not favor grammar restrictiveness that follows from particular rankings between markedness constraints or between faithfulness constraints.",
        "This work aims to provide a general solution that does not require distinguishing various types of constraints – the proposed solution implements Richness of the Base explicitly in the initial state of the lexicon.",
        "Specifically, the solution involves requiring that initial distributions over the lexicon be uniform, or rich.",
        "Although the objective function alone does not prefer restrictive grammars over restrictive lexicons, a lexicon constrained to be uniform, or nonrestrictive, will in turn force the grammar to be restrictive.",

        "As in previous work on unsupervised learning of OT, the algorithm assumes knowledge of OT constraints, the possible underlying forms of overt forms, and sets of candidate outputs and their constraint violation profiles for all possible underlying forms.",
        "While the present version of the algorithm receives this information as input, recent work in computational OT (Riggle, 2004; Eisner, 2000) suggests that this information is formally derivable from the constraints and overt surface forms and can be generated automatically.",
        "In addition, the algorithm receives information about the morphological relations between observed surface forms.",
        "Specifically, output forms are segmented into morphemes, and the morphemes are indexed by a unique identifier.",
        "This information, which has also been assumed in previous work, cannot be derived directly from the constraints and observed forms but is a necessary component of a model that refers to underlying forms of morphemes.",

        "The set of potential underlying forms is derived from observed surface forms, morphological relations, and the constraint set.",
        "On the one hand the set of potential underlying forms, which is initially uniformly distributed, should be rich enough to constitute a rich base for the reasons discussed earlier.",
        "On the other hand, the set should be restricted enough so that the search space is not too large and so that the grammar is not pressured to favor mapping underlying forms to completely unrelated surface forms.",
        "For this reason, potential underlying forms are derived from surface forms by considering all featural variants of surface forms for features that are evaluated by the grammar.",
        "Of these potential underlying forms, only those that can yield each of the observed surface allomorphs of the morpheme under some ranking of the constraints are included.",

        "In particular, featural variants of all the observed surface allomorphs of the morpheme are considered as potential underlying forms for the morpheme if each of the observed surface forms can be generated under some ranking.",
        "Including these types of underlying forms extends previous work, which did not allow segmental insertion or deletion or constraints that evaluate these unfaithful mappings, such as MAX and DEP.",
        "The algorithm initializes both the lexicon and grammar to uniform probability distributions.",
        "This means that all rankings are initially equally likely.",
        "Likewise, all potential underlying forms for a morpheme are initially equally likely.",
        "Thus, the probability distributions begin unbiased, but choosing an unbiased lexicon initially begins the search through parameter space at a position that favors restrictive grammars.",

        "As discussed in Section 3, the objective function itself does not favor restrictive grammars, but the ability of the algorithm to learn restrictive grammars in these experiments suggests that initializing the lexicons to uniform distributions does compel the learning algorithm to select restrictive grammars rather than restrictive lexicons.",
        "While the experiments presented in this section focus on the task of learning a grammar and lexicon simultaneously, the proposed algorithm is also capable of learning grammars from structurally ambiguous forms.",
        "The same likelihood maximization procedure proposed here could be used for unsupervised learning of grammars that assign full structural description to overt forms.",

        "In sum, this paper has presented an unsupervised, probabilistic algorithm for OT learning.",
        "The paper argues that combining the OT principle of Richness of the Base and likelihood maximization provides a novel and general solution to the problem of finding a restrictive grammar.",
        "The proposed solution involves explicitly implementing Richness of the Base in the initialization of the lexicon in order to fully utilize the properties of the objective function.",
        "By relying on Richness of the Base and likelihood maximization, the algorithm is able to use negative evidence implicitly to find restrictive grammars.",
        "The algorithm is shown to be successful on three constructed languages featuring different types of neutralization and hidden structure.",
        "One potential extension of the proposed algorithm involves combining a system for unsupervised learning of morphological relations with the proposed algorithm for learning phonology.",
        "Several algorithms have been proposed for automatically inducing morphological relations, like those assumed by the present learner (Goldsmith, 2001; Snover and Brent, 2001).",
        "The task of uncovering morphological relations is complicated by allomorphic alternations that obscure the underlying identity of related morphemes.",
        "While these algorithms are very promising, their performance may be significantly enhanced if they were combined with an algorithm that models such phonological alternations.",
        "In conclusion, this is the first proposed unsupervised algorithm for OT learning that takes advan",
        "tage of the power of probabilistic modeling to learn a grammar and lexicon simultaneously.",
        "This paper demonstrates that combining OT theoretic principles with results from computational language learning is a worthwhile pursuit that may inform both disciplines.",
        "In this case the theoretical principle of Richness of the Base has provided a novel solution to a learning problem, but at the same time, this work also informs theoretical OT by providing a formal characterization of this theoretical principle.",
        "Future work includes testing on larger, more realistic languages, including language data with noise and variation, in order to determine the algorithm’s resistance to noise and ability to model variable grammars like those observed in natural languages and in human language acquisition."
