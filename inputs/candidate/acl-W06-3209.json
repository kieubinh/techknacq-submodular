        "In recent years researchers have addressed the task of unsupervised learning of declarative representations of morphological structure.",
        "These models include the signature of (Goldsmith 2001), the conflation set of (Schone and Jurafsky 2001), the paradigm of (Brent et.",
        "al.",
        "2002), and the inflectional class of (Monson 2004).",
        "While these representations group morphologically related words in systematic ways, they are rather different from the paradigm, the representation of morphology in traditional grammars.",
        "A paradigm lists the prototypical morphological properties of lexemes belonging to a particular part of speech (POS) category; for example, a paradigm for regular English verbs would include the suffixes { $ , ed$ , ing$ , s$ }1.",
        "Hand-built computational implementations of paradigms as inheritance hierarchies include DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996) and Functional Morphology (Forsberg and Ranta 2004).",
        "The two principal ways in which learned models have differed from paradigms are that: 1) they do not have POS types, and 2) they are not abstractions that generalize beyond the words of the input corpus.",
        "There are important reasons for learning a POS-associated, paradigmatic representation of morphology.",
        "Currently, the dominant technology for morphological analysis involves mapping between inflected and base of forms of words with finite-state transducers (FSTs), a procedural model of morphological relations.",
        "Rewrite rules are handcrafted and compiled into FSTs, and it would be beneficial if these rules could be learned automatically.",
        "One line of research in computational morphology has been directed towards learning finite-state mapping rules from some sort of paradigmatic structure, where all morphological forms and POS types are presumed known for a set of lexemes (Clark 2001, Kazakov and Manandhar 2001, Oflazer et.",
        "al.",
        "2001, Zajac 2001, Albright 2002).",
        "This can be accomplished by first deciding on a base form, then learning rules to convert other forms of the paradigm into this base form.",
        "If one could develop an unsupervised algorithm for learning paradigms, it could serve as the input to rule-learning procedures, effectively leading to an entirely unsupervised system for learning FSTs from raw data.",
        "This is our long-term goal.",
        "An alternative approach is to skip the paradigm formulation step and construct a procedural model directly from raw data.",
        "(Yarowsky and Wicen-towski 2000) bootstrap inflected and base forms directly from raw data and learn mappings between them.",
        "Their results are quite successful, but the morphological information they learn is not structured as clearly as a paradigmatic model.",
        "(Freitag 2005) constructs a morphological automaton, where nodes are clustered word types and arcs are suffixation rules.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of finding an organization of stems and suffixes as probabilistic paradigms (section 2), a model of morphology closer to linguistic notion of paradigm than previously proposed models.",
        "We encode the morphological structure of a language in a matrix containing frequencies of words, and formulate the problem of learning paradigms as one of finding latent classes within the matrix.",
        "We present a recursive LDA, a learning algorithm based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (section 3), and show that under certain conditions (section 5), it can correctly learn morphological paradigms for English and Spanish.",
        "In section 6, we compare the probabilistic paradigm to the signature model of (Goldsmith 2001).",
        "In section 7, we sketch some ideas for how to make our system more unsupervised and more linguistically adequate.",
        "We assume a model of morphology where each word is the concatenation of a stem and a single suffix representing all of the word's morphological and POS properties.",
        "Although this is a very simplistic view of morphology, there are many hitherto unresolved computational issues for learning even this basic model, and we consider it necessary to address these issues before developing more sophisticated models.",
        "For a stem/suffix representation, the task of learning a paradigm from raw data involves proposing suffixes and stems, proposing segmentations, and systematically organizing stems and suffixes into classes.",
        "One difficulty is suffix allomorphy: a suffix has multiple forms depending on its phonological environment (e.g. s $ / es $ ).",
        "Another problem is suffix cate-gorial ambiguity (s$ is ambiguous for noun and verb uses).",
        "Finally, lexemes appear in only a subset of their potential forms, due to sparse data.",
        "An unsupervised learner needs to be able to handle all of these difficulties in order to discover abstract paradigmatic classes.",
        "In this paper, we are primarily interested in how the co-occurrence of stems and suffixes in a corpus leads them to be organized into paradigms.",
        "We use data preprocessed with correct segmentations of words into stems and suffixes, in order to focus on the issue of determining what additional knowledge is needed.",
        "We demonstrate that paradigms for English and Spanish can be successfully learned when tokens have been assigned POS tags and allomorphs or gender/conjugational variants are given a common representation.",
        "Our learning algorithm is not supervised since the target concept of gold standard \"input\" POS category of stems is not known, but rather it is an unsupervised algorithm that relies on preprocessed data for optimal performance."

        "Ideally, all suffixes of a particular signature would be of the same category, and all the words of a particular category would be contained within one signature.",
        "POS fragmentation measures to what extent the words of an input POS category are scattered across different signatures.",
        "It is the average number of bits required to encode the probability distribution of some category’s words over signatures.",

        "It is the expected value of the number of bits required to encode the probability distribution of some signature’s suffixes over input POS categories.",
        "Table 7 shows that, according to these metrics, the signature does not organize morphological information as efficiently as probabilistic paradigms4.",
        "Linguistica’s impurity scores are reasonably low because many of the signatures with the most stems are categorically homogeneous.",
        "Fragmentation scores show that the placement of the majority of words within top signatures offsets the scattering of a POS category’s suffixes over many signatures.",

        "This paper has introduced the probabilistic paradigm model of morphology.",
        "It has some important benefits: it is an abstract, compact representation of a language's morphology, it accommodates lexical ambiguity, and it predicts forms of words not seen in the input data.",
        "We have formulated the problem of learning probabilistic paradigms as one of discovering latent classes within a suffix-stem count matrix, through the recursive application of LDA with an orthogonality constraint.",
        "Under optimal data conditions, it can learn the correct paradigms, and also models morphological and lexical probabilities extremely accurately.",
        "It is robust to corpus choice, so we can say that it learns a morphological grammar for the language.",
        "This is a new application of matrix factorization algorithms, and an usual one: whereas in document topic modeling, one tries to find that a document consists of multiple topics, we want to find orthogonal decompositions where each suffix (document) belongs to only one input POS category (topic).",
        "We have demonstrated that the algorithm can successfully learn morphological paradigms for English and Spanish under the conditions that segmentations are known, categorically ambiguous suffixes have been distinguished, and allomorphs have been merged.",
        "When suffixes have not been merged, there is a tendency to place allomorphic variants in different paradigms.",
        "The algorithm is the least successful in the unmerged, unlabeled case, as ambiguous suffixes do not allow for a clear split of suffixes into paradigms.",
        "However, the program output indicates which suffixes are potentially ambiguous or unambiguous, and this information could be used by bootstrapping procedures for suffix disambiguation.",
        "Some of the behavior of the learning algorithm can be explained in terms of several constraints.",
        "First, LDA assumes conditional independence of",
        "documents (suffixes) given topics (paradigms).",
        "A stem should be able to occur with each suffix of a canonical paradigm.",
        "But if a stem occurs with one allomorphic variant of a suffix, we know that it necessarily cannot occur with the other.",
        "Therefore, allomorphy violates conditional independence of suffixes given a paradigm, and we cope with this by merging allomorphs.",
        "Second, LDA also assumes conditional independence of words (stems) given topics (paradigm).",
        "As our data contains stem variants, this assumption does not hold either, but it is a less serious violation due to the large number of total stems.",
        "Third, we have imposed the constraint of orthogonality of suffixes and paradigms, which is not required by LDA (and actually undesired in document topic modeling, since documents can contain multiple topics).",
        "Orthogonal suffix splits are possible when categorically ambiguous suffixes have been disambiguated.",
        "In conclusion, we view morphology learning as a process of manipulating the representation of data to fit a learnable computational model.",
        "The alternative would be to complicate the model and learning algorithm to accommodate raw data and all its concurrent ambiguities and dependencies.",
        "We hypothesize that successful, fully unsupervised learning of linguistically adequate representations of morphology will be more easily accomplished by first bootstrapping the sorts of information that we have assumed, or, in other words, fitting the data to the model."
