        "Information Extraction (IE) is a natural language processing task in which text documents are analyzed with the aim of finding mentions of relevant entities and important relationships between them.",
        "In many cases, the subtask of relation extraction reduces to deciding whether a sentence asserts a particular relationship between two entities, which is still a difficult, unsolved problem.",
        "There are however cases where the decision whether the two entities are in a relationship is made relative to an entire document, or a collection of documents.",
        "In the biomedical domain, for example, one may be interested in finding the pairs of human proteins that are said to be interacting in any of the Medline abstracts, where the answer is not required to specify which abstracts are actually describing the interaction.",
        "Assembling a ranked list of interacting proteins can be very useful to biologists - based on this list, they can make more informed decisions with respect to which genes to focus on in their research.",
        "In this paper, we investigate methods that use multiple occurrences of the same pair of entities across a collection of documents in order to boost the performance of a relation extraction system.",
        "The proposed methods are evaluated on the task of finding pairs of human proteins whose interactions are reported in Medline abstracts.",
        "The majority of known human protein interactions are derived from individual, small-scale experiments reported in Medline.",
        "Some of these interactions have already been collected in the Reactome (Joshi-Tope et al., 2005), BIND (Bader et al., 2003), DIP (Xenarios et al., 2002), and HPRD (Peri et al., 2004) databases.",
        "The amount of human effort involved in creating and updating these databases is currently no match for the continuous growth of Medline.",
        "It is therefore very useful to have a method that automatically and reliably extracts interaction pairs from Medline.",
        "Systems that do relation extraction from a collection of documents can be divided into two major categories.",
        "In one category are IE systems that first extract information from individual sentences, and then combine the results into corpus-level results (Craven, 1999; Skounakis and Craven, 2003).",
        "The second category corresponds to approaches that do not exploit much information from the context of individual occurrences.",
        "Instead, based on co-occurrence counts, various statistical or information-theoretic tests are used to decide whether the two entities in a pair appear together more often than simple chance would predict (Lee et al., 2004; Ramani et al., 2005).",
        "We believe that a combination of the two approaches can inherit the advantages of each method and lead to improved relation extraction accuracy.",
        "The following two sections describe the two orthogonal approaches to corpus-level relation extraction.",
        "A model that integrates the two approaches is then introduced in Section 4.",
        "This is followed by a description of the dataset used for evaluation in Section 5, and experimental results in Section 6."

        "Most systems that identify relations between entities mentioned in text documents consider only pair of entities that are mentioned in the same sentence (Ray and Craven, 2001; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).",
        "To decide the existence and the type of a relationship, these systems generally use lexico-semantic clues inferred from the sentence context of the two entities.",
        "Much research has been focused recently on automatically identifying biologically relevant entities and their relationships such as protein-protein interactions or subcellular localizations.",
        "For example, the sentence “TR6 specifically binds Fas ligand”, states an interaction between the two proteins TR6 and Fas ligand.",
        "One of the first systems for extracting interactions between proteins is described in (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001).",
        "There, sentences are matched deterministically against a set of manually developed patterns, where a pattern is a sequence of words or Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and two protein-name tokens.",
        "Between every two adjacent words is a number indicating the maximum number of words that can be skipped at that position.",
        "An example is: “interaction of (3) <P> (3) with (3) <P>”.",
        "This approach is generalized in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), where subsequences of words (or POS tags) from the sentence are used as implicit features.",
        "Their weights are learned by training a customized subsequence kernel on a dataset of Medline abstracts annotated with proteins and their interactions.",
        "A relation extraction system that works at the sentence-level and which outputs normalized confidence values for each extracted pair of entities can also be used for corpus-level relation extraction.",
        "A straightforward way to do this is to apply an aggregation operator over the confidence values inferred for all occurrences of a given pair of entities.",
        "More exactly, if p1 and p2 are two entities that occur in a total of n sentences s1, s2, ..., sn in the entire corpus C, then the confidence P (R (p 1, p2) I C) that they are in a particular relationship R is defined as:",
        "Out of the four operators in Table 1, we believe that the max operator is the most appropriate for aggregating confidence values at the corpus-level.",
        "The question that needs to be answered is whether there is a sentence somewhere in the corpus that asserts the relationship R between entities p1 and p2.",
        "Using avg instead would answer a different question - whether R(p1� p2) is true in most of the sentences containing p1 and p2.",
        "Also, the and operator would be most appropriate for finding whether R(p1i p2) is true in all corresponding sentences in the corpus.",
        "The value of the noisy-or operator (Pearl, 1986) is too dependent on the number of occurrences, therefore it is less appropriate for a corpus where the occurrence counts vary from one entity pair to another (as confirmed in our experiments from Section 6).",
        "For examples, if the confidence threshold is set at 0.5, and the entity pair (p1� p2) occurs in 6 sentences or less, each with confidence 0.",
        "1, then R(p1� p2) is false, according to the noisy-or operator.",
        "However, if (p1� p2) occur in more than 6 sentences, with the same confidence value of 0.1, then the corresponding noisy-or value exceeds 0.5, making R(p1i p2) true."

        "Various measures such as pointwise mutual information (PMI) , chi-square (X2) or log-likelihood ratio (LLR) (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999) use the two entities’ occurrence statistics to detect whether their co-occurrence is due to chance, or to an underlying relationship.",
        "A recent example is the co-citation approach from (Ramani et al., 2005), which does not try to find specific assertions of interactions in text, but rather exploits the idea that if many different abstracts reference both protein p1 and protein p2, then p1 and p2 are likely to interact.",
        "Particularly, if the two proteins are co-cited significantly more often than one would expect if they were cited independently at random, then it is likely that they interact.",
        "The model used to compute the probability of random co-citation is based on the hypergeometric distribution (Lee et al., 2004; Jenssen et al., 2001).",

        "Given that the PMI will be used only for ranking pairs of potentially interacting proteins, the constant factor N andthe log operator can be ignored.",

        "Then one way of using the extraction confidence is to have each co-occurrence weighted by its confidence, i.e. replace the constant 1 with the normalized scores",
