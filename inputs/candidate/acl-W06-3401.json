        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) attempts to describe a given text in terms of its coherence, i.e. how it is that the parts of the text are related to one another and how each part plays a role.",
        "Two adjacent text spans will often exhibit a nucleus-satellite relationship, where the satellite plays a role that is relative to the nucleus.",
        "For example, one sentence might make a claim and the following sentence give evidence for the claim, with the second sentence being a satellite and the evidence relation existing between the two spans.",
        "In a text containing many sentences, these nucleus-satellite pairs can be built up to produce a document-wide rhetorical tree.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example of a rhetorical tree for a three-sentence text1 .",
        "Theories such as RST have been popular for some time as a way of describing the multilevelled rhetorical relations that exist in text, with relevant applications such as automatic summarization (Marcu, 1997) and natural language generation (Knott and Dale, 1996).",
        "However, implementing automatic rhetorical parsers has been a problematic area of research.",
        "Techniques that rely heavily on explicit signals, such as discourse markers, are of limited use both because only a small percentage of rhetorical relations are signalled explicitly and because explicit markers can be ambiguous.",
        "RST trees are binary branching trees distinguishing between nuclei and satellites, and automatically determining nucle-arity is also far from trivial.",
        "Furthermore, there are some documents which are simply not amenable to being described by a document-wide rhetorical tree (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992).",
        "Given the problems of automatically parsing text for rhetorical relations, it seems prohibitively difficult to attempt rhetorical parsing of speech documents - data which are marked by disfluencies, low information density, and sometimes little cohesion.",
        "For that reason, this pilot study sets out a comparatively modest task: to determine whether one of five relations holds between two adjacent dialogue acts in meeting speech.",
        "All relations are of the form nucleus-satellite, and the five relation types are contrast,",
        "elaboration, cause, question and summary.",
        "This work solely investigates the usefulness of prosodic features in classifying these five relations, rather than relying on discourse or lexical cues.",
        "A central motivation for this study is the hope that rhetorical parsing using prosodic features might aid an automatic summarization system."

      "text": [
        "Early work on automatic RST analysis relied heavily on discourse cues to identify relations (CorstonOliver, 1998; Knott and Sanders, 1998; Marcu, 1997; Marcu, 1999; Marcu, 2000) (e.g., “however” signaling an antithesis or contrast relation.",
        "As mentioned above, this approach is limited by the fact that rhetorical relations are often not explicitly signalled, and discourse markers can nevertheless be ambiguous.",
        "A novel approach was described in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), which used an unsupervised training technique, extracting relations that were explicitly and unamibiguously signalled and automatically labelling those examples as the training set.",
        "This unsupervised technique allowed the authors to label a very large amount of data and pairs of words found in the nucleus and satellite as the features of interest.",
        "The authors reported very encouraging pairwise classification results using these word-pair features, though subsequent work using the same bootstrapping technique has fared less well (Sporleder and Lascarides, to appear 2006).",
        "There is little precedent for applying RST to speech dialogues, though (Taboada, 2004) describes ✗ rhetorical analyses of Spanish and English spoken dialogues, with in-depth corpus analyses of discourse markers and their corresponding relations.",
        "The work in (Noordman et al., 1999) uses short read texts to explore the relationship between prosody and the level of hierarchy in an RST tree.",
        "The authors report that higher levels in the hierarchy are associated with longer pause durations and higher pitch.",
        "Similar results are reported in (den Ouden, 2004), who additionally found significant prosodic differences between causal and non-causal relations and between semantic and pragmatic relations.",
        "Litman and Hirschberg (1990) investigated whether prosodic features could be used to disambiguate sentential versus discourse instances of certain discourse markers such as “incidentally.” Passonneau and Litman (1997) explored the discourse structure of spontaneous narrative monologues, with a particular interest in both manual and automatic segmentation of narratives into coherent discourse units, using both lexical and prosodic features.",
        "Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) found that read AP news stories annotated for discourse structure in the Grosz and Sidner (1986) framework showed strong correlations between prosodic features and both global and local structure.",
        "Also in the Grosz and Sidner framework, Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that utterances from direction-giving monologues significantly differed in prosody depending on whether they appeared as segment-intial, segment-medial or segment-final."

        "As in Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Lascarides, 2004), an alternative framework for representing text structure, we included question/answer to our relations list.",
        "All training and testing pairs consist of a nucleus followed by a satellite, and the relations are defined as follows:",
        "• Contrast: The information in the satellite contradicts or is an exception to the information in the nucleus.",
        "Example: – Speaker 1: You use it as a tool Speaker 1: Not an end user • Elaboration: The information from the nucleus is discussed in greater detail in the satellite.",
        "Example: – Speaker 1: The last time I looked at it was a while ago Speaker 1: Probably a year ago • Cause: The situation described in the satellite results from the situation described in the nucleus.",
        "Example: – Speaker 1: So the GPS has crashed as well Speaker 1: So the first person has to ask you where you are • Summary: The information in the satellite is semantically equivalent to the information in the nucleus.",

        "Example: – Speaker 1: The whole point is that the text and lattice are isomorphic Speaker 1: They represent each other completely • Question/Answer: The satellite fulfills an information need explicitly stated in the nucleus.",

        "These experiments attempted to classify five rhetorical relations between dialogue acts in meeting speech using prosodic features.",
        "We primarily focused on pitch contour using numerous features of pitch slope and variance that intend to approximate the contour.",
        "In addition, we incorporated pause, energy, rate-of-speech and duration into our feature set.",
        "Using an unsupervised bootstrapping approach, we automatically labelled a large amount of training data and compared this approach to using a very small training set of manually labelled data.",
        "Whereas Marcu and Echihabi used such a bootstrapping approach to learn additional lexical information about relation pairs, we used the automatically labelled examples to learn the prosodic correlates of the relations.",
        "However, even a small amount of manually-labelled training data outperformed the unsupervised method, which is the same conclusion of Sporleder and Lascarides (Sporleder and Lascarides, to appear 2006), and a combined training method gave no additional benefit.",
        "One possible explanation for the poor performance of the bootstrapping approach is that some of the templates were inadvertently ambiguous, e.g., “I mean” can signal an elaboration or a summary and which can signal an elaboration or the beginning of a question relation.",
        "Furthermore, one possible drawback in employing this bootstrapping method is that there may be a complementary distribution between prosodic and lexical features.",
        "We are using explicit lexical cues to build an automatically labelled training set, but such explicitly cued relations may not be prosod-ically distinct.",
        "For example, a question that is sig",
        "nalled by “Who” or “What” may not have canonical question intonation since it is lexically signalled.",
        "This relates to a finding of Sporleder and Lascarides, who report that the unsupervised method of Marcu and Echihabi only generalizes well to relations that are already explicitly signalled, i.e. which could be found just by using the templates themselves.",
        "The pairwise results were quite encouraging, with the supervised training approach yielding average accuracies of 68% on the development and test sets.",
        "This illustrates that prosody alone is quite indicative of certain rhetorical relations between dialogue acts.",
        "However, the multi-class classification performance was not far above chance levels.",
        "If this automatic rhetorical analysis is to aid an automatic summarizaton system, we will need to expand the prosodic database and perhaps couple this approach with a limited lexical/discourse approach in order to improve the multi-class classification accuracy.",
        "But most importantly, if even a small amount of training data leads to decent pairwise classification using only prosodic features, then greatly increasing the amount of manual annotation should provide considerable improvement."
