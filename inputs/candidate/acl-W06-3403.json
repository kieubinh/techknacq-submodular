        "While document similarity has been a concern in computational linguistics for some time, less attention has been paid to change in similarity across time.",
        "And yet, while historical linguists have long addressed the issue of divergence or convergence among language groups over long periods of time, there has also been increasing interest in convergence (also referred to as entrainment, speech accommodation, or alignment) in other areas of Linguistics, with the realization that we have little understanding of change in very short periods of time, such as months, in a particular conversational setting, between two people, or in a large group.",

        "Yet there has been very little work on language similarity in online communities.",
        "In this paper we compare the use of three separate tools to measure document or message similarity in a large data set from an online community of over 3,000 participants from 140 different countries.",
        "Based on a review of related work on corpus similarity measures and document comparison techniques (Section 2.2), we chose Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient, a comparison algorithm that utilizes GZIP (which we will refer to as “Zipping”) and Latent Semantic Analysis.",
        "These three tools have all been shown effective for document comparison or corpus similarity, but never to our knowledge have any of them been used for document similarity over time, nor have they been compared to one another.",
        "Even though each of these tools is quite different in what it specifically measures and how it is used, and each has been used by quite different communities of researchers, they are all fairly well-understood (Section 4)."

        "ogy, or even non-verbal behaviors such as gesture (Brennan & Clark, 1996; Street & Giles, 1982).",
        "Some scholars suggest that this convergence or entrainment is based on a conscious need to accommodate to one’s conversational partner, or as a strategy to maximize communication effectiveness (Street & Giles, 1982).",

        "In short, conversational partners tend to accommodate to each other by imitating or matching the semantic, syntactic and phonological characteristics of their partners (Brennan & Clark, 1996; Garrod & Pickering, 2004).",

        "This effect has been quite clear among non-native speakers, who quickly pick up the vernacular and speech patterns of their new situation (Chambers, 2001), but the opposite is also true, with native speakers picking up speech patterns from non-native speakers (Auer & Hinskens, 2005) Linguistic innovation is particularly salient on the Internet, where words and linguistic patterns have been manipulated or reconstructed by individuals and quickly adopted by a critical mass of users (Crystal, 2001).",

        "Similar language socialization has been found in ethnographic research of large-scale online communities as well, in which various expressions are created and shared by group members (Baym, 2000; Cherny, 1999).",
        "Other research not only confirms the creation of new linguistic patterns online, and subsequent adoption by users, but suggests that the strength of the social ties between participants influences how patterns are spread and adopted (Paolillo, 2001).",
