        "A multitude of meetings are organized every day around the world to discuss and exchange important information, to make decisions and to collaboratively solve problems.",
        "Our goal is to create systems that automatically understand the discussions at meetings, and use this understanding to assist meeting participants in various tasks during and after meetings.",
        "One such task is the retrieval of information from previous meetings, which is typically a difficult and time consuming task for the human to perform (Banerjee et al., 2005).",
        "Another task is to automatically record the action items being discussed at meetings, along with details such as when the action is due, who is responsible for it, etc.",
        "Meeting analysis is a quickly growing field of study.",
        "In recent years, research has focussed on automatic speech recognition in meetings (Stolcke et al., 2004; Metze et al., 2004; Hain et al., 2005), activity recognition (Rybski and Veloso, 2004), automatic meeting summarization (Murray et al., 2005), meeting phase detection (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2004) and topic detection (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "Relatively little research has been performed on automatically detecting the roles that meeting participants play as they participate in meetings.",
        "These roles can be functional (e.g. the facilitator who runs the meeting, and the scribe who is the designated note taker at the meeting), discourse based (e.g. the presenter, and the discussion participant), and expertise related (e.g. the hardware acquisition expert and the speech recognition research expert).",
        "Some roles are tightly scoped, relevant to just one meeting or even a part of a meeting.",
        "For example, a person can be the facilitator of one meeting and the scribe of another, or the same person can be a presenter for one part of the meeting and a discussion participant for another part.",
        "On the other hand, some roles have a broader scope and last for the duration of a project.",
        "Thus a single person may be the speech recognition expert in a project and have that role in all meetings on that project.",
        "Additionally, the same person can play multiple roles, e.g. the scribe can be a speech recognition expert too.",
        "Automatic role detection has many benefits, espe",
        "cially when used as a source of constraint for other meeting understanding components.",
        "For example, detecting the facilitator of the meeting might help the automatic topic detection module if we know that facilitators officially change topics and move the discussion from one agenda item to the next.",
        "Knowing who the speech recognition expert is can help the automatic action item detector: If an action item regarding speech recognition has been detected but the responsible person field has not been detected, the module may place a higher probability on the speech recognition expert as being the responsible person for that action item.",
        "Additionally, detecting who is an expert in which field can have benefits of its own.",
        "For example, it can be used to automatically direct queries on a particular subject to the person deemed most qualified to answer the question, etc.",
        "Basic information such as participant role and expertise needs to be robustly extracted if it is to be of use to the more sophisticated stages of understanding.",
        "Accordingly, we have based our role detection algorithm on simple and highly accurate speech features, as described in section 5.1.2.",
        "(Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2004) describes the automatic detection of discourse roles in meetings.",
        "These roles included presenter (participants who make formal presentations using either slides or the whiteboard), discussion participant (participants involved in a discussion marked by frequent turn changes), observer (participants not speaking, but nevertheless consuming information during a presentation or discussion), etc.",
        "In this paper we focus on automatically detecting the functional and expertise based roles that participants play in a meeting.",
        "In the next section we describe the data that is used in all our role detection work in this paper.",

        "The remaining 2 or 3 participants played the roles of either the hardware acquisition expert or the building facilities expert.",
        "The role of the hardware expert was to make recommendations on the buying of computers and printers, and to actually make the purchases once a decision was made to do so.",

        "To make the meetings as natural as possible, the participants were given control over the evolution of the story, and were also encouraged to create conflicts between the manager’s demands and the advice that the experts gave him.",
        "For example, managers sometimes requested that all three employees be put in a single office, but the facilities expert announced that no 3 person room was available, unless the manager was agreeable to pay extra for them.",

        "Our approach to harness this information source is to use labeled training data to first create a set of words most strongly associated with each of the three roles, and then use only these words during the feature extraction phase to detect each participant’s role, as described in section 5.1.2.",
        "We created this list of keywords as follows.",
        "Given a training set of meeting sequences, we aggregated for each role all the speech from all the participants who had played that role in the training set.",
        "We then split this data into individual words and removed stop words – closed class words (mainly articles and prepositions) that typically contain less information pertinent to the task than do nouns and verbs.",
        "For all words across all the three roles, we computed the degree of association between each word and each of the three roles, using the chi squared method (Yang and Pedersen, 1997), and chose the top 200 high scoring word–role pairs.",
        "Finally we manually examined this list of words, and removed additional words that we deemed to not be relevant to the task (essentially identifying a domain–specific stop list).",
        "This reduced the list to a total of 180 words.",
        "The 5 most frequently occurring words in this list are: computer, right, need, week and space.",
        "Intuitively the goal of this keyword selection pre–processing step is to save the decision tree role classifier from having to automatically detect the important words from a much larger set of words, which would require more data to train.",
        "The input to the decision tree role classifier is a set of features abstracted from a specific participant’s speech.",
        "One strategy is to extract exactly one set of features from all the speech belonging to a participant across all the meetings in the meeting sequence.",
        "However, this approach requires a very large number of meetings to train.",
        "Our chosen strategy is to sample the speech output by each participant multiple times over the course of the meeting sequence, classify each such sample, and then aggregate the evidence over all the samples to arrive at the overall likelihood that a participant is playing a certain role.",
        "To perform the sampling, we split each meeting in the meeting sequence into a sequence of contiguous windows each n seconds long, and then compute one set of features from each participant’s speech during each window.",

        "Together with the rank feature above, these two features capture the amount of speech contributed by each participant to the window, relative to the other participants.",

        "• Rank of this participant (among this meeting’s participants) in terms of the number of times this keyword was spoken.",
        "Thus if in this window of time, this participant spoke the keyword printer more often than any of the other participants, then his feature value for this keyword is 1.",
        "• Ratio of the number of times this participant",
        "uttered this keyword in this window to the total number of times this keyword was uttered by all the participants during this window.",
