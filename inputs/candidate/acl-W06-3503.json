        "When coaching problem solving, simple short answer analysis techniques are frequently sufficient because the primary goal is to lead a trainee step-by-step through problem solving.",
        "There is a narrow range of possible responses and the context of the previous dialogue and questions invite short answers.",
        "But when the instructional objectives shift and a tutorial system attempts to explore a student’s chain of reasoning behind an answer or decision, deeper analysis techniques can begin to pay off.",
        "Having the student",
        "construct more on his own is important for learning perhaps in part because it reveals what the student does and does not understand (Chi et al., 2001).",
        "When the student is invited to provide a longer chain of reasoning, the explanations become multi-sentential.",
        "Compare the short explanation in Figure 1 to the longer ones in Figures 2 and 3.",

        "WHY2-ATLAS: Suppose a man is in an elevator that is falling without anything touching it (ignore the air, too).",
        "He holds his keys motionless right in front of his face and then just releases his grip on them.",
        "What will happen to them?",
        "Explain.",
        "Student: [omitted 15 correctpropositions]...",
        "Yet the gravitational pull on the man and the elevator is greater because they are of a greater weight and therefore they will fall faster then the keys.",
        "I believe that the keys will float up to the cieling as the elevator continues falling.",

        "Thus the degree to which details of the explanation are understood is limited.",
        "As can be seen from the examples, a student’s explanation about a formal domain such as qualitative physics may involve a number of phenomena: algebraic formulas, NL renderings of formulas, various degrees of formality, and conveying the logical structure of an argument (Makatchev et al., 2005).",
        "Tutoring goals involve eliciting correct statements of the appropriate degree of formality and their justifications to address possible gaps and errors in the explanation.",
        "To achieve these goals the NL understanding is required to answer the following questions:",
        "• Does the student explanation contain errors?",
        "If yes, what are the likely buggy assumptions that have led the student to these errors?",
        "• What required statements have not been covered by the student?",
        "Does the explanation contain statements that are logically close to the required statements?",
        "These requirements imply that a logical structure needs to be imposed on the space of possible domain statements.",
        "Considering such a structure to be a model of the student’s reasoning about the domain, the two requirements correspond to a solution of a model-based diagnosis problem (Forbus and de Kleer, 1993).",
        "How does one build such a model?",
        "A desire to make the process scalable and feasible necessitates an automated procedure.",
        "The difficulty is that this automated reasoner has to deal with the NL phenomena that are relevant for our application.",
        "In turn, this means that the knowledge representation (KR) would have to be able to express these phenomena (e.g. NL renderings of formulas, various degrees of formality).",
        "The reasoner has to account for common reasoning fallacies, have flexible consistency constraints and perform within the tight requirements of a real-time dialogue application.",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid of symbolic and statistical approaches that attempts to robustly provide a model-based diagnosis of a student’s explanation.",
        "In the next section, we provide a brief sketch of the KR used in WHY2-ATLAS.",

        "Following the representation used in the abductive reasoner Tacitus-lite (Thomason et al., 1996), our KR is function-free, does not have quantifiers, Skolem constants or explicit negation.",

        "NL understanding needs to distinguish formal versus informal physics expressions so that the tutoring system can coach on proper use of terminology.",
        "Many qualitative mechanics phenomena may",
        "be described informally, for example “speed up” instead of “accelerate” and “push” instead of “apply a force.” The relevant informal expressions fall into the following categories:",

        "Each of these categories (except for the last one) has a dedicated representation.",
        "While representing push and pull expressions via a dedicated predicate seems straightforward, we are still assessing the utility of distinguishing “man pushes the keys” and “man applies a force on the keys” for our tutoring application and currently represent both expressions as a nonzero force applied by the man to the keys.",
        "One of the tutoring objectives of WHY2-ATLAS is to encourage students to provide argumentative support for their conclusions.",

        "For WHY2-ATLAS, the classes are a subset of nodes in the correct and buggy chains of reasoning.",
        "Limiting the number of classes allows us to alleviate the problem of sparseness of training data, but the side-effect is that there are many misclassi-fications of sentences due to overlap in the classes; that is, words that discriminate between classes are shared by many other classes (Pappuswamy et al., 2005).",
        "We alleviate this problem some by aggregating classes and building three tiers of BOW text classifiers that use a kNN measure.",
        "By doing so, we obtain a 13% improvement in classification accuracy over a single classifier approach (Pappuswamy et al., 2005).",
