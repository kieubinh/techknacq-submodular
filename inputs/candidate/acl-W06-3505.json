        "To let a computer system understand natural language one needs knowledge about objects and their relations in the real world.",
        "As the manual modeling and maintenance of such knowledge structures, i.e. ontologies, are not only time and cost consuming, but also lead to not-scalable systems, there exists a demand to build and populate them automatically or at least semi automatically.",
        "This is possible by analyzing unstructured, semi-structured or fully structured data by various linguistic as well as statistical means and by converting the results into an ontological form.",
        "In an open-domain scalable natural language understanding (NLU) system the automatic learning of ontological concepts and corresponding relations between them is essential, as a complete modeling of the world is neither practicable nor feasible, as the real world and its objects, models and processes are constantly changing along with their denotations.",
        "This paper assumes that a viable approach to this challenging problem is to learn ontological concepts and relations relevant to a certain user in a given context by the dialog system at the time of the user’s inquiry.",
        "My central hypothesis is that the information about terms that lack any mapping to the employed knowledge representation of the language understanding component can only be found in topical corpora such as the Web.",
        "With the help of this information one can find the right node in the ontology to append the concept corresponding to the unknown term in case it is a noun or to insert it as an instance in case it is a proper noun or another named entity.",
        "The goal of the ontology learning component is to extend the knowledge base of the NLU system and therefore it will gradually adapt to the user’s needs.",
        "An example from the area of spoken dialog systems would be that of a user walking through the city of Heidelberg and asking: “How do I get to",
        "the Auerstein”.",
        "This would lead to the detection of Auerstein as being neither recognizable by the speech recognizer nor mappable to the knowledge representation of the system.",
        "Therefore, the corresponding hypernym of Auerstein has to be found on the internet by recourse to additional information about the context of the user.",
        "In this case, the additional information consists of the location of the user, namely Heidelberg.",
        "Once found, the hyper-nym is mapped to a corresponding concept, which already exists in the ontology.",
        "If there is no such corresponding concept, the concept for the hyper-nym thereof has to be determined.",
        "The formerly unknown term is mapped to a concept and is integrated into the system’s ontology as a child of the concept for the found hypernym.",
        "In case the unknown term is a proper noun, it is integrated as an instance of the concept for the hypernym.",
        "So far, the research undertaken is related to nouns and proper nouns, also more generally referred to as terms in this paper.",
        "In the following section, I will describe related work undertaken to solve the task of ontology learning, followed by some remarks of the distinction between ontology learning and natural language in Section 3.",
        "Thereafter, I will sketch out the minimal stages involved in the type of ontology learning proposed herein in Section 4."

        "The capability to acquire knowledge exactly at the time it is needed can be regarded as an important stepping stone towards scalable natural language understanding systems.",
        "The necessity of scalability in NLU became more and more obvious in open-domain dialog systems, as the knowledge base integrated into those can never be complete.",
        "Before the emergence of open-domain systems, more or less complete ontologies were modeled manually for the domain needed in the NLU system and were therefore not scalable to additional domains, unless modeled in advance in a manual fashion or by means of off-line ontology learning.",
        "Nonetheless, numerous off-line ontology learning frameworks exist, which alleviate the work of an ontology engineer to construct knowledge manually (Maedche, 2002), (Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005), (Cimiano et al., 2005).",
        "Most of these frameworks apply hybrid methods to optimize their learning results.",
        "For example, the ontology population method On-toLearn (Navigli et al., 2004) is based on text mining and other machine learning techniques and starts with a generic ontology like WordNet and documents in a given domain.",
        "The result is a domain extended and trimmed version of the initial ontology.",
        "For this, the system applies three phases to learn concepts:",
        "• First, a terminology extraction method, using shallow techniques that range from stochastic methods to more sophisticated syntactic approaches, is applied, which extracts a list of domain terms (mostly nouns and proper nouns) from a set of documents representative for a given domain.",
        "• Second, a semantic interpretation takes place which makes use of a compositional interpretation and structural semantic interconnections.",
        "• After these two phases the extending and trimming of the initial ontology takes place.",
        "With the help of the semantic interpretation of the terms they can be organized in sub-trees and appended under the appropriate node of the initial ontology applying linguistic rules.",
        "The text understanding system SYNDICATE (SYNthesis of DIstributed Knowledge Acquired from Texts) uses an integrated ontology learning module (Hahn and Marko, 2002).",
        "In this approach new concepts are learned with the help of text understanding, which applies two different sources of evidence, namely, the prior knowledge of the topic domain of the texts and grammatical constructions in which unknown lexical items occur in the texts.",
        "In an incremental process a given ontology is updated as new concepts are acquired from real-world texts.",
        "The acquisition process is centered on the linguistic and conceptual “quality” of various forms of evidence underlying the generation and refinement of concept hypotheses.",
        "On the basis of the quality of evidence, concept hypotheses are ranked according to credibility and the most credible ones are selected for assimilation into the domain knowledge base.",
        "The project Disciple (Stanescu et al., 2003) builds agents which can be initially trained by a subject matter expert and a knowledge engineer, in",
        "a way similar to how an expert would teach an apprentice.",
        "A Disciple agent applies two different methods for ontology learning, i.e. exception-based and example-based ontology learning.",
        "The exception-based learning approach consists of four main phases:",
        "• First, a candidate discovery takes place, in which the agent analyzes a rule together with its examples, exceptions and the ontology and finds the most plausible types of extensions of the latter that may reduce or eliminate the rule’s exceptions.",
        "• In the second phase the expert interacts with the agent to select one of the proposed candidates.",
        "• Afterwards the agent elicits the ontology extension knowledge from the expert and finally a rule refinement takes place, in which the agent updates the rule and eliminates its exceptions based on the performed ontology extension.",
        "• When the subject matter expert has to specify a",
        "fact involving a new instance or new feature in the agent teaching process, the example-based learning method is invoked.",
        "In this process the agent tries to find example sentences of the words next to a new term through various heuristics.",
        "For instance, he finds out that X is member of Y, and consequently can ask the expert.",
        "If he affirms, the new term can be memorized.",
        "All of the approaches described above exhibit theoretical as well as practical (in the light of the task undertaken herein) shortcomings.",
        "The theoretical problems that have not been resolved in a satisfactory manner by the works described above (as well as numerous others) are:",
        "• a clear separation of the linguistic and ontological subtasks involved in the overall ontology learning endeavor • systematic ways and methods for evaluating the individual learning results • rigorously defined baselines against which to evaluate the ensuing learning approaches.",
        "In the following I will describe how these issues can be addressed within the user-driven ontology learning framework proposed herein."

        "For these a corresponding concept (or set of possible concepts) in the ontology employed by the dialog system need to be found.",

        "This process is described in greater detail in Section 5.4).",

        "Therefore, information about this context needs to be added in order to make searching for the right hypernym feasible3 as shown in Section 5.3.",
        "For example, the term Lotus can refer to a flower, a specific type of car or among copious other real world entities to a restaurant in Heidelberg.",
