        "A review of publications by and about medical interpreters reveals a number of operational similarities and shared attitudes and beliefs with the medical coding and abstracting community as it existed ten years ago in the mid-1990's. At that time, the first of what have now become several successful commercial products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated coding and abstracting appeared.",
        "The initial reaction was that machines could never do what human coders and abstractors do, and anecdotal accounts illustrating the difficulty of the task proliferated.",
        "The claims of superior human capabilities and the accuracy of the anecdotal accounts were and are substantially true, but the fact is that the machines are more capable than what they were initially given credit for, and the percentage of cases that can be handled with automation fairly well approximates the 80/20 rule.",
        "In this paper, we present an early stage prototype medical interpreter system that is based on lessons learned in developing successful automated coding and abstracting systems and on the core infrastructure and techniques used in these systems.",
        "Specific techniques include leveraging standards based multilingual medical nomenclatures and clinical ontology systems, machine awareness of difficult situations, explanatory meta-knowledge, and an interactive environment that emphasizes the strengths of both the human and machine participants and mitigates the weaknesses of each."

        "The task of medical interpretation is demanding and difficult, and although U.S. hospitals that receive federal funds are required to provide interpreter services, the demands on the system are generally beyond the availability of qualified interpreters.",
        "Less than one fourth of U.S. hospitals have professionally trained interpreters and among these, many have no training in medical terminology.",
        "[Loviglio, 2004] After noting that well-to-do, educated patients have a relatively similar grasp of the process and content of medical care regardless of national or cultural origin, Haffner [1992] describes a variety of scenarios in which communication regarding medical treatment is far more difficult with the poor and undereducated.",
        "Karliner, Perez-Stable and Gildengorin [2004] formalize the study of medical interpreting, expand on the ad hoc observations of interpreters, and detail many of the challenges and pitfalls that befall the medical interpreter as well as the errors in medical care that may arise from inadequate cross-language and cross-cultural communications.",
        "These include hesitancy of patients to communicate fully and openly with physicians due to embarrassment or cultural norms, misunderstandings regarding offered treatments based on differing medical practices in the patient's native environment, and, in some cases, a lack of terminology by which western medical concepts can be easily translated to the patient.",
        "As in other areas of medicine such as medical coding and abstracting, the problem of an interpreter shortage is not likely to be self-limiting.",
        "For this reason, machine translation has undeniable interest.",
        "The demands of medicine, however, require that the matter be approached in a manner different or more comprehensive than those employed in translating web pages or interpreting tourism related queries and responses.",
        "Specific needs of both physicians and patients motivate the quest for medically accurate and culturally attuned communication.",
        "Experience in building successful systems that use NLP to automate medical coding and abstracting tasks teaches that success is achieved not in trying to create a machine that replaces the human but rather is achieved by creating a machine that assists and augments the human practitioner.",
        "Specifically, the machine should offload the portions of the job that are mundane, repetitive and that can be successfully automated.",
        "In the coding and abstracting area where A-Life Medical processes the free-text transcriptions for over two million clinical encounters per month, this equates to about 70% of the total volume.",
        "[Morris, et al., 2000] A second aspect of successful human-machine collaboration is that the machine needs the ability to accurately differentiate between language-based content that it can process independently and that which requires human review and/or intervention.",
        "We call this semi-knowledge in that it corresponds to the human capability to recognize that an utterance is of importance to the task at hand even though the full intent is not comprehended.",
        "In such cases, the machine must, like a human, seek expert guidance.",
        "In this regard, the machine will address the issue to a human expert, but the strengths of the machine can be used to provide on-line help and meta-data as an aid to the human expert.",
        "This is particularly helpful in the medical field where the sheer volume of knowledge is frequently beyond the ability of humans to keep in ready memory.",
        "In regard to the volume of knowledge, the problem in medicine is in part mitigated by the ongoing developments in the area of medical ontologies that provide for the unambiguous representation of the majority of clinical concepts.",
        "In particular, this project relies on the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terminology (SNOMED-CT®)1 for the core, multilingual nomenclature of clinical concepts and the Clinical Document Architecture, Release 2.0 (CDA2) [Dolin, et al., 2005] for the framework by which complex clinical events and communications can be represented using the core nomenclature."

        "For example, physician directives for the patient to stand, bend, take a deep breath, etc.",

        "Without a means to validate the communications that represent what we are calling the durable aspects, the physician can neither be sure nor give assurance that the communications have been accurate, and that the course of treatment is appropriate.",

        "Telemedicine is on the rise in the United States [Bauer, 2002] and worldwide.",

        "Although communication that is primarily physician directed with yes/no or multiple-choice patient responses can cover a lot of territory, there are several areas for which it is necessary that the patient be able to have a more comprehensive input.",

        "Karliner, et al.",
        "[2004] found that even when using interpreters, physician satisfaction levels with regard to their ability to elicit exact symptoms, explain treatments, elicit treatment preferences, and empower patients with regard to their own care was far lower than for the physician's satisfaction with their ability to diagnose and treat the medical condition.",
        "During medical encounters in which the physician and patient speak the same language, the physician may likely initiate dialogue on these topics with open-ended questions such as \"How did this happen?\", \"Do you have any other questions?\", \"Does this concern you?\", and the like.",
        "Because the answers to these questions may be complex and may be influenced by cultural sensitivities [Hudelson, 2005], cultural context must be accounted for in the design of an automated medical interpreter system."

        "The primary emphasis here will be on the use of CDA2 and SNOMED-CT. Based on the previous observations regarding physician and patient communication needs during a clinical encounter, we divide the clinical encounter into the following aspects: 1) establishing rapport; 2) chief complaint; 3) history; 4) review of systems; 5) physical examination; 6) diagnoses; 7) procedures; 8) medications; 9) instructions.",
