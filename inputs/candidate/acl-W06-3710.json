        "By implementing the ACAFE standardized protocols together with a voice system, we are able to assist in the first stage of the clinical pathway in the treatment and management of Asthma (see illustration of Stage 1 in figure 3).",
        "In this demonstration description, we are proposing a multilingual voice system based on a standardized patient management system called ACAFE that can effectively collect patient data in electronic format.",
        "The combination of the two systems would make it easier to assist in the recording and documentation of vast amounts of information whilst overcoming communication and efficiency barriers.",
        "This data can then be aggregated and analyzed after the event to assist with clinical and performance measures.",
        "This makes effective use of emergency department resources while providing the emergency staff with immediate access to important patient information."

        "Our demo prototype integrates a voice recognition system together with the ACAFE system described in more detail in section 5.3.",
        "Our voice recognition prototype relies on data extracted from the standardized treatment protocols that have been based on research by ACAFE (ACAFE et al., 2006).",
        "These standardized protocols form the basis of our systempatient interaction to the medical sub domain (Starlander et al., 2005).",
        "Since our system is heavily driven by ACAFE, we have been able to minimize the requirement for an open range of questions that require translation.",
        "As a result, we only require the use of the gram-marbased language model (GLM) that has been implemented using Nuance’s speech recognizer (Nuance 2005), and not a statistical language model (SLM).",
        "The standardized protocols require no manipulation or changes in tense as the ACAFE system is essentially a decision support tool.",
        "The flexibility of the decision support tool allows the clinician to make the final decision and vary any responses or inputs.",
        "Hence the range of questions our multilingual system poses to the patient is also standardized and limited.",
        "With the smaller set of questions it is feasible for translation to occur via direct ACAFE to'targetlanguage' mappings (subject language to many variations of a targetlanguage).",
        "The use of GLMs over SLMs for medical speech translation has been proven to provide higher translation accuracy (Rayner et al., 2004, Rayner et al., 2005).",
        "We expect that by combining the higher accuracy levels of recognition through the use of GLMs with a limited set of possible questions for a particular medical subdomain, we can achieve an improved translation success rate.",
        "Currently, our system requires the Overseer (such as a nurse) to specify the patient’s native language (in our example Chinese Mandarin) and problem subdomain (in our example asthma).",
        "From there, the Overseer can either speak a question as defined in the protocols contained within the ACAFE system (using English), or select one using the terminal.",
        "The question is then rendered using recorded audio (TTS is used as a fall back strategy) and played to the patient.",
        "Once the patient responds verbally or physically (e.g. nod of the head), the Overseer is required to enter that response into the system.",
        "The Overseer is capable of viewing reports that detail a particular patient’s responses prior to further analysis/treatment, or they can view statistical reports.",
        "As a proof of concept, the Overseer can generate a statistical report that details patient background precipitating factors (numbers of respiratory tract infections, cold weather, exercise and dust/pollens)"

        "The triage nurse will identify the patient’s native language to enable the correct voice system translator.",

        "When each question has been answered, the ACAFE system will store the answers and the voice system will then follow through to the next ACAFE question.",
        "Upon completion of the set of ACAFE based questions the voice system will then provide a review of the questions with answers in the ACAFE system in either English or the native language.",
        "A voice recording will also be stored to play back for future reference.",
        "Triage refers to the answers that have been collated in the ACAFE system via the assistance of the voice system.",
        "This information can be understood by all emergency team staff as the voice system has translated the answers of the patient into English according to the standardized management answers.",
        "The Emergency Department now has a pre compiled list of patient information compliant with Stage 1 of the clinical pathway contained in the ACAFE system to help assist in the treatment of asthma, without having to worry about communication difficulties between patient and medical staff."
