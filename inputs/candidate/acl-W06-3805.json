        "The DUC 2005 and 2006 summarization challenges were motivated by the desire to make summarization relevant to real users.",
        "The task was focussed by specifying an information need as a topic: one or a few statements or questions (Dang, 2005).",
        "Systems usually employ such data as a source of key words or phrases which then help rank document sentences by relevance to the topic.",
        "We explore other information that can be extracted from a topic description.",
        "In particular, we look at connections between open-class words.",
        "A dependency parser, MiniPar (Lin, 1998), builds a dependency relation graph for each sentence.",
        "We apply such graphs in two ways.",
        "We match a graph that covers the entire topic description against the graph for each sentence in the collection.",
        "We also extract all pairs of open-class words from the topic description, and check whether they are connected in the sentence graphs.",
        "Both methods let us rank sentences; the top-ranking ones go into a summary of at most 250 words.",
        "We evaluate the summaries with the summary content units (SCU) data made available after DUC 2005 (Nenkova and Passon-neau, 2004; Copeck and Szpakowicz, 2005).",
        "The experiments show that using more information than just keywords leads to summaries with more SCUs (total and unique) and higher SCU weight.",
        "We present related work in section 2, and the data and the representation we work with in section 3.",
        "Section 4 shows the algorithms in more detail.",
        "We describe the experiments and their results in section 5, and draw a few conclusions in section 6."
