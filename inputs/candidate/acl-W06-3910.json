        "We show that underlying states give us the same advantages as underlying events, with respect to recognizing concepts across categories for the purpose of inference, as they reify the predicates.",
        "We then discuss an alternative representation for copular expressions, based on the conviction that the states in these expressions are ontologically different from eventualities, and show that it has unfavorable consequences for inference.",
        "We end with a short note on related adjective-adverb pairs.",

        "It is of a more abstract nature, similar to facts and propositions.",
        "The main argument is their deviant combinatorial behavior.",
        "K-state verbs can not serve as the infinitival complement of a verb of perception (see also examples (12b) and (14a) later in this section), they cannot combine with most adverbials, such as manner adverbs and instrumentals, and neither do they combine with locative modifiers, all of this in contrast with D-states and other eventualities.",
        "This brings her to the following (tentative) definition of K-states.",

        "He argues the K-state should not be introduced by the copula, but rather by the postcopula predicate (e.g. an adjective), because attributively used adjectives also show the relevant behavior, without being accompanied by a copula.",
        "Also, he shows that it is problematic to put individuals introduced by an NP under the copula in the box that is introduced by \"~\" and presents the 'content' of the state.",
        "Because in that case the state in (11a) (being related to Opus) would be a different one then the state in (11b) (being related to George).",
        "And while the states in (11b) and (11d) are the same, if Opus is the tuba player of the Deathtongue, since the subject is in the outer box and therefore extensionalized over, this is not the case for the states in (11a) and (11c).",

        "c. George is related to the tuba player of the Deathtongue d. The tuba player of the Deathtongue is related to George.",
        "Identity relations between states get more coherent and intuitive if the content of the box embedded under \"œ\" is restricted to only the core predicate (e.g. related(x, y)).",
        "Now if Engelberg is right that K-states are not more fine grained than events and D-states, and the content of the embedded K-state box is in all cases only a core predicate, one can wonder what the advantage of the Kimian style representation still is.",
        "For facts and propositions this kind of representation is useful, exactly because the content of a proposition is more than a single predicate; it is a full-fledged proposition, and it makes sense to assign a referential argument to the proposition as a whole.",
        "Individuals introduced by NPs in embedded propositions are not extensionalized over.",
        "If George said that he is related to Opus and if Opus is the tuba player of the Deathtongue, it is not entailed that George said that he is related to the tuba player of the Deathtongue.",
