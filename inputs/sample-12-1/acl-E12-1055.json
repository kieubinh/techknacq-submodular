        "The performance degradation for alternative paths is partially due to optimization problems in MERT, but also due to a higher susceptibility to statistical outliers, as discussed in section 2.3.14 A pessimistic interpretation of the results would point out that performance gains compared to the best baseline system are modest or even inexistent in some settings.",
        "However, we want to stress two important points.",
        "First, we often do not know a priori whether adding an out-of-domain data set boosts or weakens translation performance.",
        "An automatic weighting of data sets reduces the need for trial-and-error experimentation and is worthwhile even if a performance increase is not guaranteed.",
        "Second, the potential impact of a weighted combination depends on the translation scenario and the available data sets.",
        "Generally, we expect non-uniform weighting to have a bigger impact when the models that are combined are more dissimilar (in terms of fitness for the task), and if the ratio of in-domain to out-of-domain data is low.",
        "Conversely, there are situa14We empirically verified this weakness in a synthetic experiment with a randomly split training corpus and identical weights for each path.",
        "parallel corpus; small IN TM: using 10% of available in-domain parallel data.",
        "tions where we actually expect a simple concatenation to be optimal, e.g. when the data sets have very similar probability distributions.",
        "Feature It is hard to empirically show how translation model perplexity optimization compares to using monolingual perplexity measures for the purpose of weighting translation models, as e.g. done by (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Koehn et al. 2010).",
        "One problem is that there are many different possible configurations for the latter.",
        "We can use source side or target side language models, operate with different vocabularies, smoothing techniques, and n-gram orders.",
        "One of the theoretical considerations that favour measuring perplexity on the translation model rather than using monolingual measures is that we can optimize each translation model feature separately.",
        "In the default Moses translation model, the four features are p(s|t), lex(s|t), p(t|s) and lex(t|s).",
        "We empirically test different optimization schemes as follows.",
        "We optimize perplexity on each feature independently, obtaining 4 weight vectors.",
        "We then compute one model with one weight vector per feature (namely the feature that the vector was optimized on), and four models that use one of the weight vectors for all features.",
        "A further model uses a weight vector that is the",
        "average of the other four.",
        "For linear interpolation, we also include a model whose weights have been optimized through language model perplexity optimization, with a 3-gram language model (modified Knesey-Ney smoothing) trained on the target side of each parallel data set.",
        "Table 7 shows the results.",
        "In terms of BLEU score, a separate optimization of each feature is a winner in our experiment in that no other scheme is better, with 8 of the 11 alternative weighting schemes (excluding uniform weights) being significantly worse than a separate optimization.",
        "The differences in BLEU score are small, however, since the alternative weighting schemes are generally felicitious in that they yield both a lower perplexity and better BLEU scores than uniform weighting.",
        "While our general expectation is that lower perplexities correlate with higher translation performance, this relation is complicated by several facts.",
        "Since the interpolated models are deficient (i.e. their probabilities do not sum to 1), perplexities for weighted counts and our implementation of linear interpolation cannot be com-pard.",
        "Also, note that not all features are equally important for decoding.",
        "Their weights in the log-linear model are set through MERT and vary between optimization runs."

        "This paper contributes to SMT domain adaptation research in several ways.",

        "We also show that we can separately optimize the four variable features in the Moses translation model through perplexity optimization.",
        "We break with prior domain adaptation research in that we do not rely on a binary clustering of in-domain and out-of-domain training data.",
        "We demonstrate that perplexity minimization scales well to a higher number of translation models.",
        "This is not only useful for domain adaptation, but for various tasks that profit from mixture mod-15The source code is available in the Moses repository http://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder elling.",
        "We envision that a weighted combination could be useful to deal with noisy datasets, or applied after a clustering of training data."
