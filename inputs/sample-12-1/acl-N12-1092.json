        "Assessment is a fundamental part of teaching, both to measure a student's mastery of the material and to identify areas where she may need reinforcement or additional instruction.",
        "Assessment has also been shown an important part of learning, as testing assists retention and can be used to guide learning (Anderson & Biddle, 1975).",
        "Thus, as learners move on from an educational setting to unstructured self-learning settings, they would still benefit from having the means for assessment available.",
        "Even in traditional educational settings, there is a need for automated test generation, as teachers want multiple tests for topics to give to different students, and students want different tests with which to study and practice the material.",
        "One possible solution to providing quizzes for new source material is the automatic generation of questions.",
        "This is a task the NLP community has already embraced, and significant progress has been made in recent years with the introduction of a shared task (Rus et al., 2010).",
        "However, thus far the research community has focused on the problem of generating grammatical questions (as in Heilman and Smith (2010a)) or generating effective distractors for multiple-choice questions (Agarwal and Mannem, 2011).",
        "While both of these research threads are of critical importance, there is another key issue that must be addressed ?",
        "which questions should we be asking in the first place?",
        "We have highlighted this aspect of the problem in the past (see Vanderwende (2008)) and begin to address it in this work, postulating that we can both collect human judgments on what makes a good question and train a machine learning model that can replicate these judgments.",
        "The resulting learned model can then be applied to new material for automated question generation.",
        "We see this effort as complementary to the earlier progress.",
        "In our approach, we factor the problem of generating good questions into two parts: first, the selection of sentences to ask about, and second, the identification of which part of the resulting sentences the question should address.",
        "Because we want to focus on these aspects of the problem and not the surface form of the questions, we have chosen to generate simple gap-fill (cloze) questions,",
        "though our results can also be used to trigger Wh-questions or multiple-choice questions by leveraging prior work.",
        "For sentence selection, we turn to methods in summarization and use the simple but effective SumBasic (Nenkova et al., 2006) algorithm to prioritize and choose important sentences from the article.",
        "We cast the second part, gap selection, as a learning problem.",
        "To do this, we first select a corpus of sentences from a very general body of instructional material (a range of popular topics from Wikipedia).",
        "We then generate a constrained subset of all possible gaps via NLP heuristics, and pair each gap with a broad variety of features pertaining to how it was generated.",
        "We then solicit a large number of human judgments via crowdsourcing to help us rate the quality of various gaps.",
        "With that data in hand, we train a machine learning model to replicate these judgments.",
        "The results are promising, with one possible operating point producing a true positive rate of 83% with a corresponding false positive rate of 19% (83% of the possible Good gaps are kept, and 19% of the not-Good gaps are incorrectly marked); see Figure 6 for the full ROC curve and Section 4 for an explanation of the labels.",
        "As the final model has only minimal dependence on Wikipedia-specific features, we expect that it can be applied to an even wider variety of material (blogs, news articles, health sites, etc.",

        "There already exists a large body of work in automatic question generation (QG) for educational purposes dating back to the Autoquest system (Wolfe, 1976), which used an entirely syntactic approach to generate Wh-Questions from individual sentences.",
        "In addition to Autoquest, several others have created systems for Wh-question generation using approaches including transformation rules (Mitkov and Ha, 2003), template-based generation (Chen et al., 2009; Curto et al., 2011), and overgenerate-and-rank (Heilman and Smith, 2010a).",
        "The work in this area has largely focused on the surface form of the questions, with an emphasis on grammaticality.",
        "Alternatively, generation of gap-fill style questions (a.k.a.",
        "cloze questions) avoids these issues of grammaticality by blanking out words or spans in a known good sentence.",
        "There is a large body of existing work that has focused on generation of this type of question, most of which has focused on vocabulary and language learning.",
        "The recent work of Agarwal and Mannem (2011) is closer to our purposes; they generated fill-in-the-blank questions and distractor answers for reading comprehension tests using heuristic scoring measures and a small evaluation set.",
        "Our work has similar aims but employs a data-driven approach.",
        "The Question-Generation Shared Task and Evaluation Challenge (QG-STEC) (Rus et al., 2010) marks a first attempt at creating a common task and corpus for empirical evaluation of question generation components.",
        "However, evaluation in this task was manual and the number of instances in both the development and training set were small.",
        "As there exists no other dataset for question generation, we created a new corpus using Amazon Mechanical Turk by soliciting judgments from non-experts.",
        "Snow et al. (2008) have validated AMT as a valid data source by comparing non-expert with gold-standard expert judgments.",
        "Corpus creation using AMT has numerous precedents now; see i.e. Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) and Heilman and Smith (2010b).",

        "We seek to empirically determine how to choose questions instead of relying on heuristics and rules for evaluating candidate surface forms.",
        "To do this, we cast question construction as a generate-and-filter problem: we overgenerate potential question/answer pairs from each sentence and train a discriminative classifier on human judgments of quality for those pairs.",
        "With the trained classifier, we can then apply this approach on unseen sentences to return the highest-scoring question/answer, all question/answer pairs scoring above a threshold, and so on.",
        "Generation Although it would be possible to select every word or phrase as a candidate gap, this tactic would produce a skewed dataset composed mostly of unusable questions, which would subsequently require much more annotation to discriminate good questions from bad ones.",
        "Instead we rely on syntactic and semantic constraints to reduce the number of questions that need annotation.",
        "To generate questions we first run the source sentence through a constituency parser and a semantic role labeler (components of a state-of-the-art natural language toolkit from (Quirk et al., 2012)), with the rationale that important parts of the sentence will occur within a semantic role.",
        "Each verb predicate found within the roles then automatically becomes a candidate gap.",

        "This outcome was then paired with a vector of features (see Section 5) extracted from the source sentence and the generated question.",

        "suggests that system performance can be improved via language modeling, as such features would penalize questions with answers that could be predicted mostly by word transition probabilities.",
        "Similarly, when classifying questions like example 2 (?such as ____ for a mathematical function?",
        "), the system could benefit from some measure of word frequency or answer novelty.",
        "While our model included a feature for the number of overlapping words between the question and the answer, the high classifier score for example 3 (?atop ______, the volcano?",

        "With false negative errors the judges rated the question as Good, whereas the system classified it as Bad.",
        "The question and answer pairs listed in Table 3 demonstrate some of these errors.",
        "In example 1 (?where Pompey was soon ___?",
        "), the system was likely incorrect because a majority of questions with verb-predicate answers had Bad ratings (only 12% are Good).",
        "Conversely, classification of example 2 (?Over the course of decades??)",
        "could be improved with a feature indicating the novelty of the words in the answers.",
        "Example 3 (?About 7.5% of the...?)",
        "appears to come from rater error or rater confusion as the question does little to test the understanding of the material.",
        "While the raters considered the answer to example 4 as Good, the low classifier score argues for different handling of answers derived from long coordinated phrases.",
        "One alternative approach would be to generate questions that use multiple gaps.",
        "Conversely, one may argue that a learner may be better off answering any one of the noun phrases like palm oil or cocoa in isolation."
