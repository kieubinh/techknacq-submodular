        "We report on experiments carried out for the development of competitive systems on the datasets of the 2012 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.",
        "Our main focus was directed on the effective use of all the available training data during training of translation and language models and tuning.",
        "We use the open source machine translation system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and other standard open source tools, hence all our experiments are straightforwardly replicable1.",
        "Compared to all single system submissions by participants of the workshop we achieved the best BLEU scores for four language pairs (es-en, en-es, cs-en, en-cs), the 2nd best results for two language pairs (fr-en, de-en), as well as a 3rd place (en-de) and a 5th place (en-fr) for the remaining pairs.",
        "We improved upon this in the post-evaluation period for some of the language pairs by more systematically applying our methods.",
        "During the development of our system, we saw most gains from using large corpora for translation model training, especially when using subsampling techniques for out-of-domain sets, using large corpora for language model training, and larger tuning sets.",
        "We also observed mixed results with alternative tuning methods.",
        "We also experimented with hierarchical models and semi-supervised training, but did not achieve any improvements.",
        "English words).",
        "We report all results in case-sensitive BLEU (mt-eval13a) on the newstest2011 test set (CallisonBurch et al., 2011).",
        "Please also note that baseline scores vary throughout the paper, since different methods were investigated at different time points."

        "for the language pairs es-en, en-es, fr-en and en-fr.",
        "In each case the idea was to include the NewsCommentary and Europarl corpora in their entirety, and to score the sentences in the remaining corpora (the selection corpus) using one of the two measures, adding either the top 10% or top 50% of the selection corpus to the training data.",
        "For Model 1 filtering, we trained IBM Model 1 on Europarl and NewsCommentary concatenated, in both directions, and scored the sentences in the selection corpus using the length-normalised sum of the IBM Model scores.",
        "For the modified Moore-Lewis filtering, we trained two 5-gram language models for source and target, the first on 5M sentences from the news2011 monolingual data, and the second on 5M words from the selection corpus, using the same vocabulary.",
        "The modified Moore-Lewis score for a sentence is the sum of the source and target's perplexity difference for the two language models.",
        "For the Spanish experiments, the selection corpus was the UN data, whilst for the French experiments it was the UN data and the GigaFrEn data, concatenated and with duplicates removed.",
        "The results of the subsampling are shown in Table 2, where the BLEU scores are averaged over 2 tuning runs.",
        "The conclusion was that modified Moore-Lewis subsampling was effective (and was used in our final submissions), but Model 1 sampling made no difference for the Spanish systems, and was harmful for the French systems."
