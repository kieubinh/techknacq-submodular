        "Our interest in this paper lies instead with variations at the level of text structuring – the way in which propositions are grouped into units like paragraphs, sections, and bulletted lists, and linked rhetorically by discourse connectives such as ‘since’, ‘nevertheless’, and ‘however’.",
        "Elsewhere, we have described a text-structuring method in which the options for organising propositions in a text are laid out as a set of constraints, so that acceptable solutions can be enumerated using constraint satisfaction and evaluated using a cost metric (Power et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper we show how this method, when harnessed to a system for recognising rhetorical structure in an input text, can be employed in order to produce large-scale paraphrases fulfilling purposes like improving coherence and achieving a desired style of layout."

        "Thus quick-results(elixir) is realised by a text-phrase (in Nunberg’s sense (Nunberg, 1990)) in Solution 1, and by a text-sentence (also a list item) in Solution 2.",
        "• Rhetorical relations can be expressed by different discourse connectives or layout options.",
        "In Solution 1, REASON is realised by ‘since’ and CONJUNCTION by ‘and’; in Solution 2 REASON is realised by ‘therefore’ and CONJUNCTION (more implicitly) by a bulletted list.",
        "• Propositions may be realised in different orders: for instance, the nucleus of the REASON relation comes first in Solution 1, while the satellite comes first in Solution 2.",
        "Note that order is constrained by the choice of discourse connective: ‘therefore’ requires satellite-first; ‘since’ allows both orders.",
        "These text-structuring decisions strongly influence the options for wording the individual propositions, mostly because they determine the order in which propositions are presented.",
        "In Solution 1, the nucleus of the REASON relation is presented first, so ‘Elixir’ has to be referenced by name, and there is no particular reason for preferring passive to active.",
        "In Solution 2, the same proposition occurs at the end, when Elixir has been introduced and established as the topic focus; it is therefore appropriate to refer to Elixir by a pronoun, and to promote this reference to the most salient position in the clause by passivization.",
        "Text structuring is controlled by hard constraints, which determine the set of solutions that can be generated, and by preferences (or soft constraints), which allow a ranking of solutions from best to worst.",
        "The purpose of hard constraints is to avoid solutions that are clearly anomalous, such as the following text in which the arguments of the CONJUNCTION relation are separated, thus altering the rhetorical interpretation: Since Elixir gives quick results doctors recommend it, and it has few side effects.",
        "A more marginal case is the following solution, in which the arguments of a nucleus-satellite relation are expressed as items in a bulletted list.",
        "In the default settings this is also considered an anomaly, since a bulletted list usually implies a parallelism among the items that is violated when one argument dominates the other.",

        "ICONOCLAST was originally developed as a component of a Natural Language Generation system.",
        "It assumes that the propositional content of the desired text is already formally encoded, along with a rhetorical-structure tree representing the role of each proposition in the argument.",
        "The program can also be run on a simplified input in which propositions are replaced by canned phrases; however, the quality in this case will obviously suffer, since referring expressions and clause structure cannot be adapted to context.",
        "By itself, then, ICONOCLAST cannot be used in order to paraphrase an independently provided text.",
        "However, once a semantic model is available, the system allows an unusual degree of flexibility and precision in controlling paraphrases.",
        "The source of this power lies in the use of explicitly encoded constraints and preferences, which can be edited through a direct-manipulation user interface in order to guide the generator in the desired directions.",
        "For hard constraints, the control interface works mostly by buttons for switching constraints on and off, or occasionally by menus for fixing the value of a parameter.",
        "Examples of switches are the following (also mentioned above): Allow indented list for arguments of a multinuclear relation (Yes/No) Allow indented list for arguments of a nucleus-satellite relation (No/Yes) Allow discourse connective introducing a list item (Yes/No) The default in each case is the option given first, which would allow (but not require) a solution to our example in which the conjunction was realised by a list including the discourse connective ‘and’: Doctors recommend Elixir because",
        "• Elixir gives quick results • And it has few side effects",
        "An example of a parameter setting would be a constraint fixing the textual unit governing the whole text, or the maximum text level allowed for an indented list item: Root textual unit",
        "By constraining the whole text to fit in a paragraph, we could eliminate any solution requiring multiple paragraphs (e.g., nucleus in one paragraph and satellite in another).",
        "Under this setting, both solutions 1 and 2 could be generated (although solution 1 would have to be a single-sentence paragraph).",
        "Further constraining the root level to sentence would preserve solution 1 but eliminate solution 2.",
        "For soft constraints, the user interface works through sliders representing both the direction of a preference and its intensity.",
        "In most cases, the sliders are calibrated to an 11-point scale from 5 to +5.",
        "A straightforward example is the dichotomy between active and passive voice, where negative values penalize use of the passive, while positive values penalize use of the active; the central value (zero) represents neutrality.",
        "A cost value is computed every time a proposition is realised by a clause for which the grammar allows passivization.",
        "Depending on the setting of the 11-point scale, a cost is incurred either for use of the passive (negative values on the scale), or for failure to use it (positive values on the scale); the amount of cost varies from 1 to 5, again depending on the setting.",
        "Thus if the user sets the passivization slider to a value of -4, a cost of 4 accrues every time a proposition is realised by a passive clause; or for a value of +2, a cost of 2 accrues every time a proposition that could have been realised by a passive clause is realised by an active one.",
        "In practice, this method of evaluating solutions typically means that every solution isflawed, given a non-trivial semantic input and a sufficient range of preferences.",
        "The reason is that many decisions are trade-offs: avoiding cost on",
        "one preference often means incurring cost elsewhere.",
        "For instance, a preference to avoid the passive conflicts with the preference to preserve topical coherence, which is expressed by penalizing a ‘salience violation’ – that is, a failure to equate the backward-looking center in a clause with the most salient forward-looking center (i.e., Cb with Cp) (Kibble and Power, 2004).",
        "If salience requires passivization, and passivization is penalized, then a cost must be incurred somewhere: the issue is which is the lesser evil.",
        "We have considered two ways of controlling a paraphrase in a constraint-based generator: imposing/relaxing a hard constraint, and changing a preference.",
        "A possibility that we have not yet implemented is a hard constraint defined only on the current problem, as opposed to the general settings illustrated above.",
        "The constraint might state, for example, that the proposition recommend (doctors, elixir) should appear at the beginning of the text, thus eliminating Solution 2.",
        "Or it might state that the conjunction relation between the other propositions should be realised by a bulletted list, thus eliminating Solution 1.",
        "To support constraints of this kind one would need a user interface in which the user can select part of the semantic input, perhaps by clicking on the corresponding part of the text, as in a WYSIWYM interface (Power and Scott, 1998); a dialogue box would then appear allowing a range of constraints specifically directed to the selected fragment.",
        "Such an interface would mimic the typical interaction between a human writer and human critic – e.g., the critic might highlight a paragraph and advise the writer to reformat it as a list."

        "It is hard to conceive of an NLG system that cannot produce alternative realisations, and thus paraphrases.",
        "Most systems, however, are only capable of producing variations at the lexical or syntactic levels (or both).",
        "As such, they operate very much like traditional Machine Translation systems – except that the source and target texts are now in the same language – and have similar limitations.",
        "Additionally, most of them work with input that is a representation of the meaning of a (source) text, rather than the text itself.",
        "The system described in this paper develops an existing NLG system into a full-blown paraphase generator capable of producing a wide range of alternative renditions of the source text, with variations at three linguistic levels: lexical choice, syntactic structure, and document structure.",
        "This is in contrast to most existing paraphrase generators, which are constrained to vary only the first or second of these levels (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Carroll et al., 1999; Dras, 1999; Inui and Nogami, 2001; Kozlowski et al., 2003; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Takahashi et al., 2001; Stede, 1999).",
        "The range of lexical and syntactic variation in a paraphrase generator obviously depends on how deeply the input text is interpreted, but even with the relatively superficial analysis proposed here, we can introduce variations for discourse connectives, referring expressions (in particular, when to use pronouns), and some clause patterns (e.g., whether to use active or passive).",
        "However, the innovation in our work lies in its controlled variation in the third level, document structure: just as the other paraphrase generators provide multiple lexical-syntactic structures for the same semantic structure, so our system provides multiple document structures for the same discourse structure (i.e., for the same rhetorical structure).",
        "The document structure solutions serve not only to realise the rhetorical input, but also to create a context that determines which of the alternative syntactic realisations is most suitable for the elementary propositions.",
        "Our paraphrase generator links an existing general-purpose discourse parser – DAS (Le Thanh et al., 2004)2 – which builds a discourse tree automatically from an input text, to an existing NLG system – ICONOCLAST (Power et al., 2003) – which generates a wide range of",
        "formulations for a given discourse structure.",
        "We have described here the issues that need to be taken into account when turning any NLG system into a fully-fledged paraphraser.",
        "We believe that our approach to text-structuring, whereby options for organising propositions in a text are laid out as a set of constraints, and acceptable solutions are enumerated using constraint satisfaction and evaluated using a cost metric, provides a particularly useful method for achieving large-scale paraphrases.",
        "Although we are agnostic with respect to the issue of psychological validity, it is worth noting that our method reflects many of the processes facing any writer or editor trying to achieve their ideal text, but constrained by the linguistic resources at hand (e.g., wording, syntax, discourse and layout) which interact with each other such that the final text is invariably a flawed version of the ideal.",
        "For evaluation of our system, two points need to be addressed.",
        "The first concernsfidelity: are the generated solutions equivalent in meaning to the original input text?",
        "The second concerns quality: are the generated solutions ranked, by the cost metric, in a way that corresponds to the preferences of good judges?",
        "More practically, we would like to explore the issue of usability: the main question here is whether human users can successfully manipulate the system’s constraints and preferences in order to guide solutions in the desired direction."
