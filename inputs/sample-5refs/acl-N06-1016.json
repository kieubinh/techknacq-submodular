        "Corpus-based methods for word sense disambiguation (WSD) have gained popularity in recent years.",
        "As evidenced by the SENSEVAL exercises (http://www.senseval.org), machine learning models supervised by sense-tagged training corpora tend to perform better on the lexical sample tasks than unsupervised methods.",
        "However, WSD tasks typically have very limited amounts of training data due to the fact that creating large-scale high-quality sense-tagged corpora is difficult and time-consuming.",
        "Therefore, the lack of sufficient labeled training data has become a major hurdle to improving the performance of supervised WSD.",
        "A promising method for solving this problem could be the use of active learning.",
        "Researchers use active learning methods to minimize the labeling of examples by human annotators.",
        "A decrease in overall labeling occurs because active learners (the machine learning models used in active learning) pick more informative examples for the target word (a word whose senses need to be learned) than those that would be picked randomly.",
        "Active learning requires human labeling of the newly selected training data to ensure high quality.",
        "We focus here on pool-based active learning where there is an abundant supply of unlabeled data, but where the labeling process is expensive.",
        "In NLP problems such as text classification (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), statistical parsing (Tang et al., 2002), information extraction (Thompson et al., 1999), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004), pool-based active learning has produced promising results.",
        "This paper presents our experiments in applying two active learning methods, a min-margin based method and a Shannon-entropy based one, to the task of the disambiguation of English verb senses.",
        "The contribution of our work is not only in demonstrating that these methods work well for the active learning of coarse-grained verb senses, but also analyzing the behavior of the active learning process on two levels: the instance level and the feature level.",
        "The analysis suggests that a careful treatment of feature design and feature generation is important for a successful application of active learning to WSD.",
        "We also accounted for the overfitting phenomena that occurred in the learning process based on our data analysis.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce two uncertainty sampling methods used in our active learning experiments and review related work in using active learning for WSD.",

        "The method performed well on the active learning of Japanese verb senses.",
        "However, the efficient computation of the training utility function relied on the nature of the example-based learning method, which made their example sampling method difficult to export to other types of machine learning models.",

        "Double-blind tagging is applied to 50 instances of the target word.",
        "If the ITA < 90%, the sense entry is revised by adding examples and explanations of distinguishing criteria.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the statistics of the data.",
        "The baseline accuracy was computed by using the “most frequent sense” heuristic to assign sense labels to verb instances (examples).",
        "The data used in active learning (Column 4 in Table 2) include two parts: an initial labeled training set and a pool of unlabeled training data.",
        "We experimented with sizes 20, 50 and 100 for the initial training set.",
        "The pool of unlabeled data had actually been annotated in advance, as in most pool-based active learning experiments.",
        "Each time an example was selected from the pool by the active learner, its label was returned to the learner.",
        "This simulates the process of asking human annotators to tag the selected unlabeled example at each time.",
        "The advantage of using such a simulation is that we can experiment with different settings (different sizes of the initial training set and different sampling methods).",
        "The data sets used for active learning and for held-out evaluation were randomly sampled from a large data pool for each round of the active learning experiment.",
        "We ran ten rounds of the experiments for each verb and averaged the learning curves for the ten rounds.",
        "In the experiments, we used random sampling (picking up an unlabeled example randomly at each time) as a lower bound.",
        "Another control (ultimate-maxent) was the learner’s performance on the test set when it was trained on a set of labeled data that were randomly sampled from a large data pool and equaled the amount of data used in the whole active learning process (e.g., 400 training data for the verb add).",
        "The machine learning model we used for active learning was a regularized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model (McCallum, 2002).",
        "The features used for disambiguating the verb senses included topical, collocation, syntactic (e.g., the subject, object, and preposition phrases taken by a target verb), and semantic (e.g., the WordNet synsets and hypernyms of the head nouns of a verb’s NP arguments) features (Chen and Palmer, 2005)."

        "These curves clearly show that the two uncertainty sampling methods, the entropy-based (called entropy-maxent in the figure) and the margin-based (called min_margin-maxent), work very well for active learning of the senses of these verbs.",
        "Both methods outperformed the random sampling method in that they reached the upper-bound accuracy earlier and had smoother learning curves.",
        "For the four verbs add, do, feel and see, their learning curves reached the upper bound at about 200~300 iterations, which means 1/2 or 1/3 of the annotation effort can be saved for these verbs by using active learning, while still achieving the same level of performance as supervised WSD without using active learning.",
        "Given the large-scale annotation effort currently underway in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006), this could provide considerable savings in annotation effort and speed up the process of providing sufficient data for a large vocabulary.",
        "The OntoNotes project has now provided coarse-grained entries for over 350 verbs, with corresponding double–blind annotation and adjudication in progress.",
        "As this adjudicated data becomes available, we will be able to train our system accordingly.",

        "Active learning could also be beneficial in porting these supervised taggers to new genres with different sense distributions.",
        "We also experimented with different sizes of the initial training set (20, 50 and 100) and found no significant differences in the performance at different settings.",
        "That means, for these 5 verbs, only 20 labeled training instances will be enough to initiate an efficient active learning process.",

        "This may not be so surprising, considering that the two methods are equal for two-class classification tasks (see Equations 1 and 2 for their definition) and the verbs used in our experiments have coarse-grained senses and often have only 2 or 3 major senses.",
        "An interesting phenomenon observed from these learning curves is that for the two verbs add and feel, the active learner reached the upper bound very soon (at about 100 iterations) and then even breached the upper bound.",

        "II.",
        "The contexts of the target verb are difficult for our feature exaction module to analyze.",

        "However, the feature exaction module found the wrong antecedent changes that is an unlikely fit for the intended verb sense.",
        "In the fourth example for feel, the feature extraction module cannot handle the expletive “it” (a dummy subject) in “it was felt that”, therefore, it cannot identify the typical syntactic pattern for Sense 3 (find, conclude), i.e., subject+feel+relative clause.",

        "We have shown that active learning can lead to substantial reductions (often by half) in the number of observations that need to be labeled to achieve a given accuracy in word sense disambiguation, compared to labeling randomly selected instances.",
        "In a follow-up experiment, we also compared a larger number of different active learning methods.",
        "The results suggest that for tasks like word sense disambiguation where maximum entropy methods are used as the base learning models, the minimum margin active criterion for active learning gives superior results to more comprehensive competitors including bagging and two variants of query by committee (Schein, 2005).",
        "By also taking into account the high running efficiency of the min-margin method, it is a very promising active learning method for WSD.",
        "We did an analysis on the learning process on two levels: instance-level and feature-level.",
        "The analysis suggests that a careful treatment of feature design and feature generation is very important for the active learner to take advantage of the difficult examples it finds during the learning process.",
        "The feature-level analysis identifies some characteristics of good features.",
        "It is worth noting that the good features identified are not particularly tied to active learning, and could also be obtained by a more standard feature selection method rather than by looking at how the features provide benefits as they are added in.",
        "For a couple of the verbs examined, we found that active learning gives higher prediction accuracy midway through the training than one gets after training on the entire corpus.",
        "Analysis suggests that this is not due to bad examples being added to the training set.",
        "It appears that the widely used maximum entropy model with Gaussian priors is overfitting: the model by including too many features and thus fitting noise as well as signal.",
        "Using different strengths of the Gaussian prior does not solve the problem.",
        "If a very strong prior is used, then poorer accuracy is obtained.",
        "We believe that using appropriate feature selection would cause the phenomenon to vanish."
