        "Distributional Similarity between words has been an active research area for more than a decade.",
        "It is based on the general idea of Harris' Distributional Hypothesis, suggesting that words that occur within similar contexts are semantically similar (Harris, 1968).",
        "Concrete similarity measures compare a pair of weighted context feature vectors that characterize two words (Church and Hanks, 1990; Ruge, 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Grefenstette, 1994; Lee, 1997; Lin, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Weeds and Weir, 2003).",
        "As it turns out, distributional similarity captures a somewhat loose notion of semantic similarity (see Table 1).",
        "It does not ensure that the meaning of one word is preserved when replacing it with the other one in some context.",
        "However, many semantic information-oriented applications like Question Answering, Information Extraction and Paraphrase Acquisition require a tighter similarity criterion, as was also demonstrated by papers at the recent PASCAL Challenge on Recognizing Textual Entailment (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "In particular, all these applications need to know when the meaning of one word can be inferred (entailed) from another word, so that one word could substitute the other in some contexts.",
        "This relation corresponds to several lexical semantic relations, such as synonymy, hyponymy and some cases of meronymy.",
        "For example, in Question Answering, the word company in a question can be substituted in the text by firm (synonym), automaker (hyponym) or division (meronym).",
        "Unfortunately, existing manually constructed resources of lexical semantic relations, such as WordNet, are not exhaustive and comprehensive enough for a variety of domains and thus are not sufficient as a sole resource for application needs1.",
        "Most works that attempt to learn such concrete lexical semantic relations employ a co-occurrence pattern-based approach (Hearst, 1992; Ravi-chandran and Hovy, 2002; Moldovan et al., 2004).",
        "Typically, they use a set of predefined lexico-syntactic patterns that characterize specific semantic relations.",
        "If a candidate word pair (like company-automaker) co-occurs within the same sentence satisfying a concrete pattern (like \" ...companies, such as automakers\"), then it is expected that the corresponding semantic relation holds between these words (hypernym-hyponym in this example).",
        "In recent work (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) we explored the correspondence between the distributional characterization of two words (which may hardly co-occur, as is usually the case for syno",
        "nyms) and the kind of tight semantic relationship that might hold between them.",
        "We formulated a lexical entailment relation that corresponds to the above mentioned substitutability criterion, and is termed meaning entailing substitutability (which we term here for brevity as lexical entailment).",
        "Given a pair of words, this relation holds if there are some contexts in which one of the words can be substituted by the other, such that the meaning of the original word can be inferred from the new one.",
        "We then proposed a new feature weighting function (RFF) that yields more accurate distributional similarity lists, which better approximate the lexical entailment relation.",
        "Yet, this method still applies a standard measure for distributional vector similarity (over vectors with the improved feature weights), and thus produces many loose similarities that do not correspond to entailment.",
        "This paper explores more deeply the relationship between distributional characterization of words and lexical entailment, proposing two new hypotheses as a refinement of the distributional similarity hypothesis.",
        "The main idea is that if one word entails the other then we would expect that virtually all the characteristic context features of the entailing word will actually occur also with the entailed word.",
        "To test this idea we developed an automatic method for testing feature inclusion between a pair of words.",
        "This algorithm combines corpus statistics with a web-based feature sampling technique.",
        "The web is utilized to overcome the data sparseness problem, so that features which are not found with one of the two words can be considered as truly distinguishing evidence.",
        "Using the above algorithm we first tested the empirical validity of the hypotheses.",
        "Then, we demonstrated how the hypotheses can be leveraged in practice to improve the precision of automatic acquisition of the entailment relation."

        "This subsection reviews the relevant details of earlier methods that were utilized within this paper.",
        "In the computational setting contexts of words are represented by feature vectors.",
        "Each word w is represented by a feature vector, where an entry in the vector corresponds to a feature f. Each feature represents another word (or term) with which w co-occurs, and possibly specifies also the syntactic relation between the two words as in (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003).",
        "Padó and Lapata (2003) demonstrated that using syntactic dependency-based vector space models can help distinguish among classes of different lexical relations, which seems to be more difficult for traditional “bag of words” co-occurrence-based models.",
        "A syntactic feature is defined as a triple <term, syntactic _relation, relation_direction> (the direction is set to 1, if the feature is the word’s modifier and to 0 otherwise).",
        "For example, given the word “company” the feature <earnings_report, gen, 0> (genitive) corresponds to the phrase “company’s earnings report”, and <profit, pcomp, 0> (prepositional complement) corresponds to “the profit of the company”.",
        "Throughout this paper we used syntactic features generated by the Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1993).",
        "The value of each entry in the feature vector is determined by some weight function weight(w,f), which quantifies the degree of statistical association between the feature and the corresponding word.",
        "The most widely used association weight function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990; Lin, 1998; Dagan, 2000; Weeds et al., 2004).",
        "Once feature vectors have been constructed, the similarity between two words is defined by some vector similarity metric.",
        "Different metrics have been used, such as weighted Jaccard (Grefenstette, 1994; Dagan, 2000), cosine (Ruge, 1992), various information theoretic measures (Lee, 1997), and the widely cited and competitive (see (Weeds and Weir, 2003)) measure of Lin (1998) for similarity between two words, w and v, defined as follows:",
        "where F(w) and F(v) are the active features of the two words (positive feature weight) and the weight function is defined as MI.",
        "As typical for vector similarity measures, it assigns high similarity scores if many of the two word’s features overlap, even though some prominent features might be disjoint.",
        "This is a major reason for getting such semantically loose similarities, like company - government and country - economy.",
        "Investigating the output of Lin’s (1998) similarity measure with respect to the above criterion in (Geffet and Dagan, 2004), we discovered that the quality of similarity scores is often hurt by inaccurate feature weights, which yield rather noisy feature vectors.",
        "Hence, we tried to improve the feature weighting function to promote those features that are most indicative of the word meaning.",
        "A new weighting scheme was defined for bootstrapping feature weights, termed RFF (Relative Feature Focus).",
        "First, basic similarities are generated by Lin’s measure.",
        "Then, feature weights are recalculated, boosting the weights of features that characterize many of the words that are most similar to the given one 2.",
        "As a result the most prominent features of a word are concentrated within the top-100 entries of the vector.",
        "Finally, word similarities are recalculated by Lin's metric over the vectors with the new RFF weights.",
        "The lexical entailment prediction task of (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) measures how many of the top ranking similarity pairs produced by the 2 In concrete terms RFF is defined by:",
        "where sim(w, v) is an initial approximation of the similarity space by Lin’s measure, WS(f) is a set of words co-occurring with feature f, and N(w) is the set of the most similar words of w by Lin’s measure.",
        "RFF-based metric hold the entailment relation, in at least one direction.",
        "To this end a data set of 1,200 pairs was created, consisting of top N (N=40) similar words of 30 randomly selected nouns, which were manually judged by the lexical entailment criterion.",
        "Quite high Kappa agreement values of 0.75 and 0.83 were reported, indicating that the entailment judgment task was reasonably well defined.",
        "A subset of the data set is demonstrated in Table 1.",
        "The RFF weighting produced 10% precision improvement over Lin’s original use of MI, suggesting the RFF capability to promote semantically meaningful features.",
        "However, over 47% of the word pairs in the top-40 similarities are not related by entailment, which calls for further improvement.",
        "In this paper we use the same data set 3 and the RFF metric as a basis for our experiments."

That is, the characteristic contexts of v are expected to be included within all w's contexts (but not necessarily amongst the most characteristic ones for w).",
        "Conversely, we might expect that if v's characteristic contexts are included within all w's contexts then it is likely that the meaning of v does entail w. Taking both directions together, lexical entailment is expected to highly correlate with characteristic feature inclusion.",
        "Two additional observations are needed before concretely formulating these hypotheses.",
        "As explained in Section 2, word contexts should be represented by syntactic features, which are more restrictive and thus better reflect the restrained semantic meaning of the word (it is difficult to tie entailment to looser context representations, such as co-occurrence in a text window).",

        "The comparison to the baseline (RFF-top-26 in Table 5) showed that ITA filters the output much better than just cutting off the lowest ranking similarities.",
        "We also tried a couple of variations on feature sampling for the web-based procedure.",
        "In one of our preliminary experiments we used the top-k RFF features instead of random selection.",
        "But we observed that top ranked RFF features are less discriminative than the random ones due to the nature of the RFF weighting strategy, which promotes features shared by many similar words.",
        "Then, we attempted doubling the sampling to 40 random features.",
        "As expected the recall was slightly decreased, while precision was increased by over 5%.",
        "In summary, the behavior of ITA sampling of k=20 and k=40 features is closely comparable (ITA-20 and ITA-40 in Table 5, respectively)4."

        "To estimate the empirical validity of the defined hypotheses we developed an automatic inclusion testing algorithm (ITA).",
        "The core of the algorithm is a web-based feature inclusion testing procedure, which helped significantly to compensate for data sparseness.",

        "Then a thorough analysis of the data behavior with respect to the proposed hypotheses was conducted.",
        "The first hypothesis was almost fully attested by the data, particularly at the sense level, while the second hypothesis did not fully hold.",
        "4.",
        "Motivated by the empirical analysis we proposed to employ ITA for the practical task of improving lexical entailment acquisition.",
        "The algorithm was applied as a filtering technique on the distributional similarity (RFF) output.",

        "tained 17% increase of precision and succeeded to improve relative F1 by 15% over the baseline.",
        "Although the results were encouraging our manual data analysis shows that we still have to handle word ambiguity.",
        "In particular, this is important in order to be able to learn the direction of entailment.",
        "To achieve better precision we need to increase feature discriminativeness.",
        "To this end syntactic features may be extended to contain more than one word, and ways for automatic extraction of features from the web (rather than from a corpus) may be developed.",
        "Finally, further investigation of combining the distributional and the co-occurrence pattern-based approaches over the web is desired."
