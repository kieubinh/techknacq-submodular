        "Recent computational linguistics research fully acknowledged the stringent need for a systematic and appropriate treatment of phraseological units in natural language processing applications (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Syntagmatic relations between words – also called multi-word expressions, or “idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries” (Sag et al., 2002, 2) – constitute an important part of the lexicon of a language: according to Jackendoff (1997), they are at least as numerous as the single words, while according to Mel’ ˇcuk (1998) they outnumber single words ten to one.",
        "Phraseological units include a wide range of phenomena, among which we mention compound nouns (dead end), phrasal verbs (ask out), idioms (lend somebody a hand), and collocations (fierce battle, daunting task, schedule a meeting).",
        "They pose important problems for NLP applications, both text analysis and text production perspectives being concerned.",
        "In particular, collocations1 are highly problematic, for at least two reasons: first, because their linguistic status and properties are unclear (as pointed out by McKeown and Radev (2000), their definition is rather vague, and the distinction from other types of expressions is not clearly drawn); second, because they are prevalent in language.",
        "Mel’ˇcuk (1998, 24) claims that “collocations make up the lions share of the phraseme inventory”, and a recent study referred in (Pearce, 2001) showed that each sentence is likely to contain at least one collocation.",
        "Collocational information is not only useful, but also indispensable in many applications.",
        "In machine translation, for instance, it is considered “the key to producing more acceptable output” (Orliac and Dillinger, 2003, 292).",
        "This article presents a system that extracts accurate collocational information from corpora by using a syntactic parser that supports several languages.",
        "After describing the underlying methodology (section 2), we report several extraction results for English, French, Spanish and Italian (section 3).",
        "Then we present in sections 4 and 5 a comparative evaluation experiment proving that a hybrid approach leads to more accurate results than a classical approach in which syntactic information is not taken into account."

        "We consider that syntactic analysis of source corpora is an inescapable precondition for collocation extraction, and that the syntactic structure of source text has to be taken into account in order to ensure the quality and interpretability of results.",
        "As a matter of fact, some of the existing collocation extraction systems already employ (but only to a limited extent) linguistic tools in order to support the collocation identification in text corpora.",
        "For instance, lemmatizers are often used for recognizing all the inflected forms of a lexical item, and POS taggers are used for ruling out certain categories of words, e.g., in (Justeson and Katz, 1995).",
        "Syntactic analysis has long since been recognized as a prerequisite for collocation extraction (for instance, by Smadja2), but the traditional systems simply ignored it because of the lack, at that time, of efficient and robust parsers required for processing large corpora.",
        "Oddly enough, this situation is nowadays perpetuated, in spite of the dramatic advances in parsing technology.",
        "Only a few exceptions exists, e.g., (Lin, 1998; Krenn and Ev-ert, 2001).",
        "One possible reason for this might be the way that collocations are generally understood, as a purely statistical phenomenon.",
        "Some of the best-known definitions are the following: “Collocations of a given word are statements of the habitual and customary places of that word” (Firth, 1957, 181); “arbitrary and recurrent word combination” (Benson, 1990); or “sequences of lexical items that habitually co-occur” (Cruse, 1986, 40).",
        "Most of the authors make no claims with respect to the grammatical status of the collocation, although this can indirectly inferred from the examples they provide.",
        "On the contrary, other definitions state explicitly that a collocation is an expression of language: “co-occurrence of two or more lexical items as realizations of structural elements within a given syntactic pattern” (Cowie, 1978); “a sequence of two or more consecutive words, that has characteristics of a syntactic and semantic unit” (Choueka, 1988).",
        "Our approach is committed to these later definitions, hence the importance we lend to using appropriate extraction methodologies, based on syntactic analysis.",
        "The hybrid method we developed relies on the parser Fips (Wehrli, 2004), that implements the Government and Binding formalism and supports several languages (besides the ones mentioned in 2“Ideally, in order to identify lexical relations in a corpus one would need to first parse it to verify that the words are used in a single phrase structure.",
        "However, in practice, freestyle texts contain a great deal of nonstandard features over which automatic parsers would fail.",
        "This fact is being seriously challenged by current research ( ... ), and might not be true in the near future” (Smadja, 1993, 151).",
        "the abstract, a few other are also partly dealt with).",
        "We will not present details about the parser here; what is relevant for this paper is the type of syntactic structures it uses.",
        "Each constituent is represented by a simplified X-bar structure (without intermediate level), in which to the lexical head is attached a list of left constituents (its specifiers) and right constituents (its complements), and each of these are in turn represented by the same type of structure, recursively.",
        "Generally speaking, a collocation extraction can be seen as a two-stage process: I. in stage one, collocation candidates are identified from the text corpora, based on criteria which are specific to each system; II.",
        "in stage two, the candidates are scored and ranked using specific association measures (a review can be found in (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999; Evert, 2004; Pecina, 2005)).",
        "According to this description, in our approach the parser is used in the first stage of extraction, for identifying the collocation candidates.",
        "A pair of lexical items is selected as a candidate only if there is a syntactic relation holding between the two items (one being the head of the current parse structure, and the other the lexical head of its specifier/complement).",
        "Therefore, the criterion we employ for candidate selection is the syntactic proximity, as opposed to the linear proximity used by traditional, window-based methods.",
        "As the parsing goes on, the syntactic word pairs are extracted from the parse structures created, from each head-specifier or head-complement relation.",
        "The pairs obtained are then partitioned according to their syntactic configuration (e.g., noun + adjectival or nominal specifier, noun + argument, noun + adjective in predications, verb + adverbial specifier, verb + argument (subject, object), verb + adjunt, etc).",
        "Finally, the log-likelihood ratios test (henceforth LLR) (Dunning, 1993) is applied on each set of pairs.",
        "We call this method hybrid, since it combines syntactic and statistical information (about word and co-occurrence frequency).",
        "The following examples – which, like all the examples in this paper, are actual extraction results – demonstrate the potential of our system to detect collocation candidates, even if subject to complex syntactic transformations.",

      "text": [
        "Extracting collocations from raw text, without preprocessing the source corpora, offers some clear advantages over linguistically-informed methods such as ours, which is based on the syntactic analysis: speed (in contrast, parsing large corpora of texts is expected to be much more time consuming), robustness (symbolic parsers are often not robust enough for processing large quantities of data), portability (no need to a priori define syntactic configurations for collocations candidates).",
        "On the other hand, these basic systems suffer from the combinatorial explosion if the candidate pairs are chosen from a large search space.",
        "To cope with this problem, a candidate pair is usually chosen so that both words are inside a context (‘collocational’) window of a small length.",
        "A 5 word window is the norm, while longer windows prove impractical (Dias, 2003).",
        "It has been argued that a window size of 5 is actually sufficient for capturing most of the collocational relations from texts in English.",
        "But there is no evidence sustaining that the same holds for other languages, like German or the Romance ones that exhibit freer word order.",
        "Therefore, as window-based systems miss the ‘long-distance’ pairs, their recall is presumably lower than that of parse-based systems.",
        "However, the parser could also miss relevant pairs due to inherent analysis errors.",
        "As for precision, the window systems are susceptible to return more noise, produced by the grammatically unrelated pairs inside the collocational window.",
        "By dividing the number of grammatical pairs by the total number of candidates considered, we obtain the overall precision with respect to grammaticality; this result is expected to be considerably worse in the case of basic method than for the parse-based methods, just by virtue of the parsing task.",
        "As for the overall precision with respect to collocability, we expect the proportional figures to be preserved.",
        "This is because the parser-based methods return less, but better pairs (i.e., only the pairs identified as grammatical), and because collocations are a subset of the grammatical pairs.",
        "Summing up, the evaluation hypothesis that can be stated here is the following: parse-based methods outperform basic methods thanks to a drastic reduction of noise.",
        "While unquestionable under the assumption of perfect parsing, this hypothesis has to be empirically validated in an actual setting."

        "The hypothesis above refers to the overall precision and recall, that is, relative to the entire list of selected candidates.",
        "One might argue that these numbers are less relevant for practice than they are from a theoretical (evaluation) perspective, and that the exact composition of the list of candidates identified is unimportant if only the top results (i.e., those pairs situated above a threshold) are looked at by a lexicographer or an application.",
        "Considering a threshold for the n-best candidates works very much in the favor of basic methods.",
        "As the amount of data increases, there is a reduction of the noise among the best-scored pairs, which tend to be more grammatical because the likelihood of encountering many similar noisy pairs is lower.",

        "It is an grammatically unrelated pair, while the correct pairs reflecting the right syntactic attachment are essai missile and missile (de) croisi`ere.",
        "We mentioned that parsing helps detecting the ‘long-distance’ pairs that are outside the limits of the collocational window.",
        "Retrieving all such complex instances (including all the extraposition cases) certainly augment the recall of extraction systems, but this goal might seem unjustified, because the risk of not having a collocation represented at all diminishes as more and more data is processed.",
        "One might think that systematically missing long-distance pairs might be very simply compensated by supplying the system with more data, and thus that larger data is a valid alternative to performing complex processing.",
        "While we agree that the inclusion of more data compensates for the ‘difficult’ cases, we do consider this truly helpful in deriving collocational information, for the following reasons: (1) more data means more noise for the basic methods; (2) some collocations might systematically appear in",
        "a complex grammatical environment (such as passive constructions or with additional material inserted between the two items); (3) more importantly, the complex cases not taken into account alter the frequency profile of the pairs concerned.",
        "These observations entitle us to believe that, even when more data is added, the n-best precision might remain lower for the basic methods with respect to the parse-based ones.",
        "4.3 How Real the Counts Are?",
        "Syntactic analysis (including shallower levels of linguistic analysis traditionally used in collocation extraction, such as lemmatization, POS tagging, or chunking) has two main functions.",
        "On the one hand, it guides the extraction system in the candidate selection process, in order to better pinpoint the pairs that might form collocations and to exclude the ones considered as inappropriate (e.g., the pairs combining function words, such as a preposition followed by a determiner).",
        "On the other, parsing supports the association measures that will be applied on the selected candidates, by providing more exact frequency information on words – the inflected forms count as instances of the same lexical item – and on their co-occurrence frequency – certain pairs might count as instance of the same pair, others do not.",
        "In the following example, the pair loi modifier is an instance of a subject-verb collocation in 3.a), and of a verb-object collocation type in 3.b).",

        "3.a) Loi modifiant la Loi sur la respons-abilit´e civile 3.b) la loi devrait ˆetre modifi´ee",
        "Parsing helps to create a more realistic frequency profile for the candidate pairs, not only because of the grammaticality constraint it applies on the pairs (wrong pairs are excluded), but also because it can detect the long-distance pairs that are outside the collocational window.",
        "Given that the association measures rely heavily on the frequency information, the erroneous counts have a direct influence on the ranking of candidates and, consequently, on the top candidates returned.",
        "We believe that in order to achieve a good performance, extraction systems should be as close as possible to the real frequency counts and, of course, to the real syntactic interpretation provided in the source texts6.",
        "Since parser-based methods rely on more accurate frequency information for words and their co-occurrence than window methods, it follows that the n-best list obtained with the first methods will probably show an increase in quality over the second.",
        "To conclude this section, we enumerate the hypotheses that have been formulated so far: (1) Parse methods provide a noise-freer list of collocation candidates, in comparison with the window methods; (2) Local precision (of best-scored results) with respect to grammaticality is higher for parse methods, since in basic methods some noise still persists, even if more data is included; (3) Local precision with respect to collocability is higher for parse methods, because they use a more realistic image of word co-occurrence frequency."

        "In accordance with (Evert and Kermes, 2003), we consider that the comparative evaluation of collocation extraction systems should not be done at the end of the extraction process, but separately for each stage: after the candidate selection stage, for evaluating the quality (in terms of grammaticality) of candidates proposed; and after the application of collocability measures, for evaluating the measures applied.",

        "Our experimental results confirm the hypotheses put forth in section 4, and show that parsing (even if imperfect) benefits to extraction, notably by a drastic reduction of the noise in the top of the significance list.",
        "In future work, we consider investigating other levels of the significance list, extending the evaluation to other languages, comparing against shallow-parsing methods instead of the window method, and performing recall-based evaluation as well.",
        "Acknowledgements We would like to thank Jorge Antonio Leoni de Leon, Mar Ndiaye, Vincenzo Pallotta and Yves Scherrer for participating to the annotation task.",
        "We are also grateful to Gabrielle Musillo and to the anonymous reviewers of an earlier version of",
        "this paper for useful comments and suggestions."
