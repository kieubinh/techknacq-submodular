        "In the field of automatic summarization, it is widely agreed upon that more attention needs to be paid to the development of standardized approaches to summarization evaluation.",
        "For example, the current incarnation of the Document Understanding Conference is putting its main focus on the development of evaluation schemes, including semiautomatic approaches to evaluation.",
        "One semiautomatic approach to evaluation is ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003), which is primarily based on n-gram co-occurrence between automatic and human summaries.",
        "A key question of the research contained herein is how well ROUGE correlates with human judgments of summaries within the domain of meeting speech.",
        "If it is determined that the two types of evaluations correlate strongly, then ROUGE will likely be a valuable and robust evaluation tool in the development stage of a summarization system, when the cost of frequent human evaluations would be prohibitive.",
        "Three basic approaches to summarization are evaluated and compared below: Maximal Marginal Relevance, Latent Semantic Analysis, and feature-based classification.",
        "The other major comparisons in this paper are between summaries on ASR versus manual transcripts, and between manual and automatic extracts.",
        "For example, regarding the former, it might be expected that summaries on ASR transcripts would be rated lower than summaries on manual transcripts, due to speech recognition errors.",
        "Regarding the comparison of manual and automatic extracts, the manual extracts can be thought of as a gold standard for the extraction task, representing the performance ceiling that the automatic approaches are aiming for.",
        "More detailed descriptions of the summarization approaches and experimental setup can be found in (Murray et al., 2005).",
        "That work relied solely on ROUGE as an evaluation metric, and this paper proceeds to investigate whether ROUGE alone is a reliable metric for our summarization domain, by comparing the automatic scores with recently-gathered human evaluations.",
        "Also, it should be noted that while we are at the moment only utilizing intrinsic evaluation methods, our ultimate plan is to evaluate these meeting summaries extrinsically within the context of a meeting browser (Wellner et al., 2005)."

      "text": [
        "LSA is a vector-space approach which involves projecting the original term-document matrix to a reduced dimension representation.",
        "It is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an m x n term-document matrix A, whose elements Ai� represent the weighted term frequency of term i in document j.",
        "In SVD, the term-document matrix is decomposed as follows:",
        "where U is an m x n matrix of left-singular vectors, S is an n x n diagonal matrix of singular values, and V is the n x n matrix of right-singular vectors.",
        "The rows of VT may be regarded as defining topics, with the columns representing sentences from the document.",
        "Following Gong and Liu (Gong and Liu, 2001), summarization proceeds by choosing, for each row in VT, the sentence with the highest value.",
        "This process continues until the desired summary length is reached.",
        "Two drawbacks of this method are that dimensionality is tied to summary length and that good sentence candidates may not be chosen if they do not “win” in any dimension (Steinberger and Jeˇzek, 2004).",
        "The authors in (Steinberger and Jeˇzek, 2004) found one solution, by extracting a single LSA-based sentence score, with variable dimensionality reduction.",
        "We address the same concerns, following the Gong and Liu approach, but rather than extracting the best sentence for each topic, the n best sentences are extracted, with n determined by the corresponding singular values from matrix S. The number of sentences in the summary that will come from the first topic is determined by the percentage that the largest singular value represents out of the sum of all singular values, and so on for each topic.",
        "Thus, dimensionality reduction is no longer tied to summary length and more than one sentence per topic can be chosen.",
        "Using this method, the level of dimensionality reduction is essentially learned from the data."

        "The remaining meetings were regarded as training data and a single human summary was created for these.",
        "Our summaries were created as follows.",
        "Annotators were given access to a graphical user interface (GUI) for browsing an individual meeting that included earlier human annotations: an orthographic transcription time-synchronized with the audio, and a topic segmentation based on a shallow hierarchical decomposition with keyword-based text labels describing each topic segment.",
        "The annotators were told to construct a textual summary of the meeting aimed at someone who is interested in the research being carried out, such as a researcher who does similar work elsewhere, using four headings:",
        "• general abstract: “why are they meeting and what do they talk about?”; • decisions made by the group; • progress and achievements; • problems described",
        "The annotators were given a 200 word limit for each heading, and told that there must be text for the general abstract, but that the other headings may have null annotations for some meetings.",
        "Immediately after authoring a textual summary, annotators were asked to create an extractive summary, using a different GUI.",
        "This GUI showed both their textual summary and the orthographic transcription, without topic segmentation but with one line per dialogue act based on the preexisting MRDA coding (Shriberg et al., 2004) (The dialogue act categories themselves were not displayed, just the segmentation).",
        "Annotators were told to extract dialogue acts that together would convey the information in the textual summary, and could be used to support the correctness of that summary.",
        "They were given no specific instructions about the number or percentage of acts to extract or about redundant dialogue act.",
        "For each dialogue act extracted, they were then required in a second pass to choose the sentences from the textual summary supported by the dialogue act, creating a many-to-many mapping between the recording and the textual summary.",
        "The MMR and LSA approaches are both unsupervised and do not require labelled training data.",
        "For both feature-based approaches, the GMM classifiers were trained on a subset of the training data representing approximately 20 hours of meetings.",

        "The resultant models (cross-word triphones trained on conversational side based cepstral mean normalised PLP features) were then MAP adapted to the meeting domain using the ICSI corpus (Hain et al., 2005).",
        "A trigram language model was employed.",
        "Fair recognition output for the whole corpus was obtained by dividing the corpus into four parts, and employing a leave one out procedure (training the acoustic and language models on three parts of the corpus and testing on the fourth, rotating to obtain recognition results for the full corpus).",
        "This resulted in an average word error rate (WER) of 29.5%.",
