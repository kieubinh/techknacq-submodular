        "Recent coreference resolution algorithms tackle the problem of identifying coreferent mentions of the same entity in text as a two step procedure: (1) a classification phase that decides whether pairs of noun phrases corefer or not; and (2) a clusterization phase that groups together all mentions that refer to the same entity.",
        "An entity is an object or a set of objects in the real world, while a mention is a textual reference to an entity1.",
        "Most of the previous coreference resolution methods have similar classification phases, implemented either as decision trees (Soon et al., 2001) or as maximum entropy classifiers (Luo et al., 2004).",
        "Moreover, these methods employ similar feature sets.",
        "The clusterization phase is different across current approaches.",
        "For example, there are several linking decisions for clusterization.",
        "(Soon et al., 2001) advocate the link-first decision, which links a mention to its closest candidate referent, while (Ng and Cardie, 2002) consider instead the link-best decision, which links a mention to its most confident 1 This definition was introduced in (NIST, 2003).",
        "candidate referent.",
        "Both these clustering decisions are locally optimized.",
        "In contrast, globally optimized clustering decisions were reported in (Luo et al., 2004) and (DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005a), where all clustering possibilities are considered by searching on a Bell tree representation or by using the Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO) framework (DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005b) respectively, but the first search is partial and driven by heuristics and the second one only looks back in text.",
        "We argue that a more adequate clusterization phase for coreference resolution can be obtained by using a graph representation.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel representation of the coreference space as an undirected edge-weighted graph in which the nodes represent all the mentions from a text, whereas the edges between nodes constitute the confidence values derived from the coreference classification phase.",
        "In order to detect the entities referred in the text, we need to partition the graph such that all nodes in each subgraph refer to the same entity.",
        "We have devised a graph partitioning method for coreference resolution, called BESTCUT, which is inspired from the well-known graph-partitioning algorithm Min-Cut (Stoer and Wagner, 1994).",
        "BESTCUT has a different way of computing the cut weight than Min-Cut and a different way of stopping the cut2.",
        "Moreover, we have slightly modified the Min-Cut procedures.",
        "BESTCUT replaces the bottom-up search in a tree representation (as it was performed in (Luo et al., 2004)) with the top-down problem of obtaining the best partitioning of a graph.",
        "We start by assuming that all mentions refer to a single entity; the graph cut splits the mentions into subgraphs and the split",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics ting continues until each subgraph corresponds to one of the entities.",
        "The cut stopping decision has been implemented as an SVM-based classification (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).",
        "The classification and clusterization phases assume that all mentions are detected.",
        "In order to evaluate our coreference resolution method, we have (1) implemented a mention detection procedure that has the novelty of employing information derived from the word senses of common nouns as well as selected lexico-syntactic information; and (2) used a maximum entropy model for coreference classification.",
        "The experiments conducted on MUC and ACE data indicate state-of-the-art results when compared with the methods reported in (Ng and Cardie, 2002) and (Luo et al., 2004).",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the coreference resolution method that uses the BESTCUT clusterization; Section 3 describes the approach we have implemented for detecting mentions in texts; Section 4 reports on the experimental results; Section 5 discusses related work; finally, Section 6 summarizes the conclusions."

        "We will divide this graph repeatedly by cutting the links between subgraphs until a stop model previously learned tells us that we should stop the cutting.",
        "The end result will be a partition that approximates the correct division of the text into entities.",

        "Despite the fact that the Bell tree is a complete representation of the search space, the search in it is optimized for size and time, while potentially losing optimal solutions– similarly to a Greedy search.",
        "Moreover, the fact that the two implementations are comparable is not inconceivable once we consider that (Luo et al., 2004) never compared their system to another coreference resolver and reported their competitive results on true mentions only.",
        "(Ng, 2005) treats coreference resolution as a problem of ranking candidate partitions generated by a set of coreference systems.",
        "The overall performance of the system is limited by the performance of its best component.",
        "The main difference between this approach and ours is that (Ng, 2005)’s approach takes coreference resolution one step further, by comparing the results of multiple systems, while our system is a single resolver; furthermore, he emphasizes the global optimization of ranking clusters obtained locally, whereas our focus is on globally optimizing the clusterization method inside the resolver.",
        "(DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005a) use the Learning as Search Optimization framework to take into account the non-locality behavior of the coreference features.",

        "By doing so, it may be easier to detect the entity type of a mention once we have additional clues (expressed in terms of coreference features) about its possible antecedents.",
