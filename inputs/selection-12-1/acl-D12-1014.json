        "We propose the weakly supervised Multi-Experts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews.",

        "For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data.",

        "Opinion mining is concerned with analyzing opinions expressed in natural language text.",
        "For example, many internet websites allow their users to provide both natural language reviews and numerical ratings to items of interest (such as products or movies).",
        "In this context, opinion mining aims to uncover the relationship between users and (features of) items.",
        "Preferences of users to items can be well understood by coarse-grained methods of opinion mining, which focus on analyzing the semantic orientation of documents as a whole.",
        "To understand why users like or dislike certain items, however, we need to perform more fine-grained analysis of the review text itself.",
        "In this paper, we focus on sentence-level analysis of semantic orientation (SO) in online reviews.",
        "The SO consists of polarity (positive, negative, or other1) and strength (degree to which a sentence is positive or negative).",
        "Both quantities can be ana-lyzed jointly by mapping them to numerical ratings: Large negative/positive ratings indicate a strong negative/positive orientation.",
        "A key challenge in fine-grained rating prediction is that fine-grained training data for both polarity and strength is hard to obtain.",
        "We thus focus on a weakly supervised setting in which only coarse-level training data (such as document ratings and subjectivity lexicons) and, optionally, a small amount of fine-grained training data (such as sentence polarities) is available.",
        "A number of lexicon-based approaches for phrase-level rating prediction has been proposed in the literature (Taboada et al2011; Qu et al2010).",
        "These methods utilize a subjectivity lexicon of words along with information about their semantic orientation; they focus on phrases that contain words from the lexicon.",
        "A key advantage of sentence-level methods is that they are able to cover all sentences in a review and that phrase identification is avoided.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the problem of rating prediction at the sentence level has not been addressed in the literature.",
        "A naive approach would be to simply average phrase-level ratings.",
        "Such an approach performs 1We assign polarity other to text fragments that are off-topic or not directly related to the entity under review.",
        "poorly, however, since (1) phrases are analyzed out of context (e.g., modal verbs or conditional clauses), (2) domain-dependent information about semantic orientation is not captured in the lexicons, (3) only phrases that contain lexicon words are covered.",
        "Here (1) and (2) lead to low precision, (3) to low recall.",
        "To address the challenges outlined above, we propose the weakly supervised Multi-Experts Model (MEM) for sentence-level rating prediction.",
        "MEM starts with a set of potentially noisy indicators of SO including phrase-level predictions, language heuristics, and co-occurrence counts.",
        "We refer to these indicators as base predictors; they constitute the set of experts used in our model.",
        "MEM is designed such that new base predictors can be easily integrated.",
        "Since the information provided by the base predictors can be contradicting, we use ideas from ensemble learning (Dietterichl, 2002) to learn the most confident indicators and to exploit domain-dependent information revealed by document ratings.",
        "Thus, instead of averaging base predictors, MEM integrates their features along with the available coarse-grained training data into a unified probabilistic model.",
        "The integrated model can be regarded as a Gaussian process (GP) model (Rasmussen, 2004) with a novel multi-expert prior.",
        "The multi-expert prior decomposes into two component distributions.",
        "The first component distribution integrates sentence-local information obtained from the base predictors.",
        "It forms a special realization of stacking (Dzeroski and Zenko, 2004) but uses the features from the base predictors instead of the actual predictions.",
        "The second component distribution propagates SO information across similar sentences using techniques from graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) (Zhu et al. 2003; Belkin et al2006).",
        "It aims to improve the predictions on sentences that are not covered well enough by our base predictors.",
        "Traditional GSSL algorithms support either discrete labels (classification) or numerical labels (regression); we extend these techniques to support both types of labels simultaneously.",
        "We use a novel variant of word sequence kernels (Cancedda et al2003) to measure sentence similarity.",
        "Our kernel takes the relative positions of words but also their SO and synonymity into account.",
        "Our experiments indicate that MEM significantly outperforms prior work in both sentence-level rating prediction and sentence-level polarity classification."

        "Similar to MEM, HCRF uses coarse-grained training data and, when available, a small amount of fine-grained sentence polarities.",
        "In contrast to MEM, HCRF does not predict the strength of semantic orientation and ignores the order of words within sentences.",
        "There exists a large number of lexicon-based methods for polarity classification (Ding et al2008; Choi and Cardie, 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al. 2006; Fu and Wang, 2010; Ku et al2008).",
        "The lexicon-based methods of (Taboada et al2011; Qu et al2010) also predict ratings at the phrase level; these methods are used as experts in our model.",

        "In more detail, we first define a score function for a pair of shared subsequences, and then sum up these scores to obtain the overall similarity score.",
