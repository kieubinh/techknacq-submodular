        "In recent years, more attention has been paid to sentiment analysis as it has been widely used in various natural language processing applications, such as question answering (Wiebe et al. 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003), information extraction (Riloff et al. 2005) and opinion-oriented sum-marization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al. 2005).",
        "Meanwhile, it also brings us lots of interesting and challenging research topics, such as subjectivity analysis (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), sentiment classification (Pang et al. 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2005; Wilson et al. 2009; He et al. 2011), opinion retrieval (Zhang et al. 2007; Zhang and Ye, 2008; Li et al. 2010) and so on.",
        "One fundamental task for sentiment analysis is to determine the semantic orientations of words.",
        "For example, the word 'beautiful' is positive, while 'ugly' is negative.",
        "Many researchers have developed several algorithms for this purpose and generated large static lexicons of words marked with prior polarities (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney et al. 2003; Esuli, 2008; Mohammad et al. . 2009; Velikovich et al. 2010).",
        "However, there exist some polarity-ambiguous words, which can dynamically reflect different polarities along with different contexts.",
        "A typical polarity-ambiguous word ???",
        "(?long?",
        "in English) is shown with two example sentences as follows.",
        "1.",
        "????[????]t?[?]p?",
        "(Positive) Translated as: The [battery life]t of this camera is [long]p. (Positive) 2.",
        "????[????]t?[?]p?",
        "(Negative)",
        "Translated as: This camera has [long]p [startup]t. (Negative) The phrases marked with p superscript are the polarity-ambiguous words, and the phrases marked with t superscript are targets modified by the polarity words.",
        "In the above two sentences, the sentiment orientation of the polarity word ???",
        "(?long?",
        "in English) changes along with different targets.",
        "When modifying the target ??????",
        "(?battery life?",
        "in English), its polarity is positive; and when modifying ??????",
        "(?startup?",
        "in English), its polarity is",
        "negative.",
        "In this paper, we especially define the collocation as a binary tuple of the polarity-ambiguous word and its modified target, such as ??,?????",
        "(?long, battery life?",
        "in English) or ??,?????",
        "(?long, startup?",
        "in English).",
        "This paper concentrates on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation.",
        "This is an important task as the problem of polarity-ambiguity is frequent.",
        "We analyze 4,861 common binary tuples of polarity words and their modified targets from 478 reviews1, and find that over 20% of them are the collocations defined in this paper.",
        "Therefore, the task of collocation polarity disambiguation is worthy of study.",
        "For a sentence s containing such a collocation c, since the in-sentence features are always ambiguous, it is difficult to disambiguate the polarity of c by using them.",
        "Thus some previous work turned to investigate its surrounding contexts?",
        "polarities (such as the sentences before or after s), and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation c (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).",
        "However, since the amount of contexts from the original review is very limited, the final resulting polarity for the collocation c is insufficient to be reliable.",
        "Fortunately, most collocations may appear multiple times, in different forms, both within the same review and within topically-related reviews.",
        "Thus for a collocation, we can collect large amounts of contexts from other reviews to improve its polarity disambiguation.",
        "These expanded contexts are called pseudo contexts in this paper.",
        "Some previous work used the similar methods.",
        "For example, Ding (Ding et al. 2008) expanded some pseudo contexts from a topically-related review set.",
        "But since the review set is limited, the expanded contexts are still limited and unreliable.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, we propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand more pseudo contexts from web for the collocation polarity disambiguation.",
        "Without using any labeled data, experiments on a Chinese data set from four product domains show that the three-component framework is feasible and the web-based pseudo contexts are useful for the collocation polarity disambiguation.",
        "Compared to other previous work, our method achieves an F1 1The dataset will be introduced in Section 4.1 in detail.",

        "The key of the collocation polarity disambiguation task is to recognize the polarity word's sentiment orientation of a collocation.",
        "There are basically two types of approaches for word polarity recognition: corpus-based and dictionary-based approaches.",
        "Corpus-based approaches find co-occurrence patterns of words in the large corpora to determine the word sentiments, such as the work in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Turney et al. 2003; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Velikovich et al. . 2010).",
        "On the other hand, dictionary-based approaches use synonyms and antonyms in WordNet to determine word sentiments based on a set of seed polarity words.",
        "Such approaches are studied in (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Kamps et al. 2004).",
        "Overall, most of the above approaches aim to generate a large static polarity word lexicon marked with prior polarities.",
        "However, it is not sensible to predict a word's sentiment orientation without considering its context.",
        "In fact, even in the same domain, a word may indicate different polarities depending on what targets it is applied to, especially for the polarity-ambiguous words, such as ???",
        "(?long?",
        "in English) shown in Section 1.",
        "Based on these, we need to consider both the polarity words and their modified targets, i.e., the collocations mentioned in this paper, rather than only the polarity words.",
        "To date, the task in this paper is similar with much previous work.",
        "Some researchers exploited the features of the sentences containing collocations to help disambiguate the polarity of the polarity-ambiguous word.",
        "For example, Hatzivassiloglou (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and Kanayama (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) used conjunction rules to solve this problem from large domain corpora.",
        "Suzuki (Suzuki et al. 2006)",
        "took into account many contextual information of the word within the sentence, such as exclamation words, emoticons and so on.",
        "However, the experimental results show that these in-sentence features are not rich enough.",
        "Instead of considering the current sentence alone, some researchers exploited external information and evidences in other sentences or other reviews to infer the collocation's polarity.",
        "For a collocation, Hu (Hu and Liu, 2004) analyzed its surrounding sentences?",
        "polarities to disambiguate its polarity.",
        "Ding (Ding et al. 2008) proposed a holistic lexicon-based approach of using global information to solve this problem.",
        "However, the contexts or evidences from these two methods are limited and unreliable.",
        "Except for the above unsupervised methods, some researchers (Wilson et al. 2005; Wilson et al. 2009) proposed supervised methods for this task, which need large annotated corpora.",
        "In addition, many related works tried to learn word polarity in a specific domain, but ignored the problem that even the same word in the same domain may indicate different polarities (Jijkoun et al. . 2010; Bollegala et al. 2011).",
        "And some work (Lu et al. ., 2011) combined difference sources of information, especially the lexicons and heuristic rules for this task, but ignored the important role of the context.",
        "Besides, there exists some research focusing on word sense subjectivity disambiguation, which aims to classify a word sense into subjective or objective (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert, 2009).",
        "Obviously, this task is different from ours."

        "We discuss the experimental results as follows: NoExp yields the worst performance, especially on the recall.",
        "The reason is that the original contexts used in this system are limited, and some of them are even noisy.",
        "In comparison, Expdataset adds a post-processing step of expanding pseudo contexts from the topically-related review dataset, which achieves a better result with an absolute improvement of 5.14% (F1).",
        "This suggests that the contexts expanded from other reviews are helpful in disambiguating the collocation's polarity.",
        "However, Expdataset is just effective in disambiguating the polarity of such a collocation c, which appears many times in the domain-related reviews.",
        "From Table 3, we can notice that this kind of collocations only accounts for 40% in all the collocations, and further they appear less than 4 times on average.",
        "Thus, for such a collocation c, the pseudo contexts expanded from other reviews that contain the same c are still far from enough, since the review set size in this system is not very large.",
        "In order to avoid the context limitation problem, we expand more pseudo contexts from web for each collocation.",
        "We first try to use a simple query form (Strategy0) for web mining.",

        "It can demonstrate that our web mining based pseudo context expansion is useful for disambiguating the collocation's polarity, since this system can explore more contexts.",
        "However, we can find that the performance is not very ideal.",
        "This system can generate some harmful contexts for the reason of the wrong modifying relations between polarity words and targets in the retrieved snippets.",
        "Thus this paper adds three query expansion strategies to generate more and accurate pseudo contexts.",
        "Table 4 shows that the corresponding system Expweb+exp can achieve a better result with F1 = 68.55%, which is significantly (?2 test with p < 0.01) outperforms Expweb+sig.",
        "It demonstrates that the query expansion strategies are useful.",
        "Finally, Table 4 gives the results of our method in this paper, Expmvweb+exp+com and Expcweb+exp+com, which combines the original and expanded pseudo contexts to yield a final polarity.",
        "We can observe that both of these systems outperform the system NoExp of just using the original contexts and the system Expweb+exp of just using the expanded pseudo contexts.",
        "This can illustrate that the two kinds of contexts are complementary to each other.",
        "In addition, we can also find that the two combination methods produce similar results.",
