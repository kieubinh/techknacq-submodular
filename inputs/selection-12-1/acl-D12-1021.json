        "In the twenty years since Brown et al1992) pioneered the first word-based statistical machine translation (SMT) models substantially more expressive models of translational equivalence have been developed.",
        "The prevalence of complex phrasal, discontiguous, and non-monotonic translation phenomena in real-world applications of machine translation has driven the development of hierarchical and syntactic models based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs).",
        "Such models are now widely used in translation and represent the state-of-the-art in most language pairs (Galley et al2004; Chiang, 2007).",
        "However, while the models used for translation have evolved, the way in which they are learnt has not: na?",
        "?ve word-based models are still used to infer translational correspondences from parallel corpora.",
        "In this work we bring the learning of the minimal units of translation in step with the representational power of modern translation models.",
        "We present a nonparametric Bayesian model of translation based on SCFGs, and we use its posterior distribution to infer synchronous derivations for a parallel corpus using a novel Gibbs sampler.",
        "Our model is able to: 1) directly model many-to-many alignments, thereby capturing non-compositional and idiomatic translations; 2) align discontiguous phrases in both the source and target languages; 3) have no restrictions on the length of a rule, the number of nonterminal symbols per rule, or their configuration.",
        "Learning synchronous grammars is hard due to the high polynomial complexity of dynamic programming and the exponential space of possible rules.",
        "As such most prior work for learning SCFGs has relied on inference algorithms that were heuristically constrained or biased by word-based alignment models and small experiments (Wu, 1997; Zhang et al., 2008; Blunsom et al2009; Neubig et al2011).",
        "In contrast to these previous attempts, our SCFG model scales to large datasets (over 1.3M sentence pairs) without imposing restrictions on the form of the grammar rules or otherwise constraining the set of learnable rules (e.g., with a word alignment).",
        "We validate our sampler by demonstrating its ability to recover grammars used to generate synthetic datasets.",
        "We then evaluate our model by inducing word alignments for SMT experiments in several typologically diverse language pairs and across a range of corpora sizes.",

        "The first issue this model faced was a massive parameter space and intractable inference.",
        "However a more subtle issue is that likelihood based models of this form suffer from a degenerate solution, resulting in the model learning whole sentences as phrases rather than minimal units of translation.",
        "DeNero et al2008) recognised this problem and proposed a nonparametric Bayesian prior for contiguous phrases.",
        "This had the dual benefits of biasing the model towards learning minimal translation units, and integrating out the parameters such that a much smaller set of statistics would suffice for inference with a Gibbs sampler.",
        "However this work fell short by not evaluating the model independently, instead only presenting results in which it was combined with a standard word-alignment initialisation, thus leaving open the question of its efficacy.",
        "The fact that flat phrasal models lack a structured approach to reordering has led many researchers to pursue SCFG induction instead (Wu, 1997; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al2008; Blunsom et al., 2009).",
        "The asymptotic time complexity of the inside algorithm for even the simplest SCFG models is O(|s|3|t|3), too high to be practical for most real translation data.",
        "A popular solution to this problem is to heuristically restrict inference to derivations which agree with an independent alignment model (Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "However this may have the unintended effect of biasing the model back towards the initial alignments that they attempt to improve upon.",
        "More recently Neubig et al2011) reported a novel Bayesian model for phrasal alignment and extraction that was able to model phrases of multiple granularities via a synchronous Adaptor Grammar.",
        "However this model suffered from the common problem of intractable inference and results were presented for a very small number of samples from a heuristically pruned beam, making interpreting the results difficult.",
        "Blunsom et al2009) presented an approach similar to ours that implemented a Gibbs sampler for a nonparametric Bayesian model of ITG.",
        "While that work managed to scale to a non-trivially sized corpus, like other works it relied on a state-of-the-art word alignment model for initialisation.",
        "Our model goes further by allowing discontiguous phrasal translation units.",
