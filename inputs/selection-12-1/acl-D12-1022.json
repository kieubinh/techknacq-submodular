        "has consistently attracted attention.",
        "Despite considerable research effort, the automatic generation of multi-document summaries that resemble those written by humans remains challenging.",

        "Recent years have seen increased interest in global inference methods for summarization.",
        "ILP-based models have been developed for several subtasks ranging from sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2008), to single-and multi-document summarization (McDonald, 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009; Gillick and Favre, 2009; Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al2011), and headline generation (Deshpande et al2007; Woodsend et al2010).",
        "Most of these approaches are either purely extractive or implement a single rewrite operation, namely word deletion.",
        "Although it is well-known that handwritten summaries often exhibit additional edits and sentence recombinations (Jing, 2002), the challenges involved in acquiring the rewrite rules, interfacing them with inference, and ensuring grammatical output make the development of abstractive models non-trivial.",
        "Our work is closest to Gillick et al2008) who also develop an ILP model for multi-document summarization.",
        "A key assumption in their model which we also follow is that input documents contain a variety of concepts, each of which are allocated a value, and the goal of a good summary is to maximize the sum of these values subject to the length constraint.",
        "The authors use bigrams as concepts and their frequency in the input documents as a proxy for their value.",
        "This model can also perform sentence compression (see also Gillick et al2009)), however, the deletion rules are hand-coded.",
        "Berg-Kirkpatrick et al2011) build on this work by recasting it as a structured prediction problem.",
        "They essentially combine the same bigram content scoring system with features relating to the parse tree",
        "which they learn using a maximum-margin SVM trained on annotated gold-standard compressions.",
        "Our multi-document summarization model jointly optimizes different aspects of the task involving both content selection and surface realization.",
        "Each individual aspect has its own dedicated expert, which we argue is advantageous as it renders inference simpler and affords flexibility (e.g., additional aspects can be incorporated into the model or trained separately on different datasets).",
        "Our work differs from Gillick et al.",
        "(2009) and Berg-Kirkpatrick et al2011) in three important respects.",
        "Firstly, we develop a genuinely abstractive model that is not limited to deletion.",
        "Our rewrite rules are encoded in quasi-synchronous tree substitution grammar and learned automatically from source documents and their summaries.",
        "Unlike previous applications of STSG to sentence compression (Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Cohn and Lapata, 2008) our quasi-synchronous TSG does not attempt to learn the complete translation from source to target sentence; it only loosely links the syntactic structure of the two (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and is therefore well suited to describing the relationship between documents and their abstracts.",
        "Secondly, our content selection component extends to features beyond the bigram horizon, as we learn to identify important concepts based on syntactic and positional information.",
        "We also learn which words are unlikely to appear in a summary.",
        "Thirdly, unlike Berg-Kirkpatrick et al2011) our model does not try to learn all the parameters (e.g., content, rewrite rules, style) of the summarization problem jointly; although decoupling learning from inference is perhaps less elegant from a modeling perspective, the learning process is more robust and reliable."

        "Our results are summarized in Table 4.",

        "As can be seen",

        "In the lower section, performance of our model without (w/o) each component in turn.",
        "The final columns show the number of source sentences, the average compression ratio, and the proportion of sentences modified.",
        "from the upper section of Table 4, the systems incorporating some form of rewriting gain slightly higher ROUGE scores than ICSI-1.",
        "The multiple aspects ILP system (MA-ILP) yields ROUGE scores similar to B-K, despite performing rewriting operations which increase the scope for error and without requiring any hand-crafted compression rules or manually annotated training data.",
        "Indeed, the outputs of the two systems are not significantly different under ROUGE (using a paired t-test, p > 0.5).",
        "In the lower section of Table 4, we show the performance of our model when each of the contributing components described in Section 3 are removed.",
        "Clearly the bigram content indicators are an important element for the ROUGE scores, as their removal yields a reduction of 2.46 points (see the row ILP w/o bigrams in Table 4).",
        "The model without QTSG rules (ILP w/o QTSG) is effectively limited to sentence extraction, and removing rewrite rules also lowers ROUGE scores to levels similar to ICSI-1.",
        "ROUGE scores are increased by allowing the model to select ?poor quality?",
        "sentences (ILP w/o style), higher indeed than those of the BK system.",
        "The inclusion of non-summary language (ILP w/o log-ratio) does not affect ROUGE scores to the same extent that bigrams and QTSG do.",
        "Table 4 includes a breakdown of the systems?",
        "rewrite operations as measured by TER.",
        "We also show the number of source sentences (Count), the average compression ratio (CR %) and the proportion of sentences modified (Mod %) by each system.",
        "As can be seen, MA-ILP draws on fewer sentences,",
        "performs less deletion and more rewriting than B-K.",
        "The number of deletions increases when individual ILP components are removed and so does the number of substitutions.",
        "All the subsystems are more aggressive in their rewriting than when used in combination (higher TER, higher compression rate and a larger number of sentences are modified).",
        "Expectedly, when removing the QTSG rules, the ILP is limited to a pure extractive system (last row in Table 4).",
        "The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5.",
        "We elicited grammaticality and informativeness ratings for a randomly selected model summary, ICSI-1, B-K, the multiple aspect ILP (MA-ILP), and the ILP w/o style which we included in this study as it performed best under ROUGE.",
        "ICSI-1, B-K, and MA-ILP are rated highly on the grammaticality dimension.",
        "MA-ILP is indistinguishable from the sentence extraction system (ICSI-1).",
        "Both systems are significantly more grammatical than BK (?< 0.05, using a Post-hoc Tukey test).",
        "Notice that summaries created by the ILP w/o style are rated poorly by humans, contrary to ROUGE.",

        "sentences and quotations from being included in the summary even if they have quite high bigram or content scores.",
        "Without it, the model tends to generate summaries that are fragmentary and lacking proper context, resulting in lower grammaticality (and informativeness) when judged by humans.",
        "The MA-ILP system obtains the highest rating with respect to information content.",
        "It is significantly better (?< 0.05) than ICSI-1 and B-K.",
        "This is not entirely surprising as our model includes additional content selection elements over and above the bigram units.",
        "There is still a significant gap from all systems to the gold-standard human-authored summaries.",
        "Example output summaries of the full ILP model are shown in Table 6.",
        "Overall, we obtain best results when considering the contributions from the individual model experts collectively.",
        "This suggests that additional improvements could be obtained with more experts.",
        "It is also possible that optimizing the relative weightings of experts in the ILP objective would improve output.",
        "The TER analysis shows that the experts have a tempering effect on each other, resulting in less aggressive, but qualitatively better, rewriting than when used individually.",
        "Generally, experts work together to shape an output sentence, but they can also compete.",
        "In the future, we also plan to test the ability of the model to adapt to other multi-document summarization tasks, where the location of summary information is not as regular as it is in news articles.",
        "We would also like interface our model with sentence ordering and more generally with some notion of the coherence of the generated summary.",
