      "text": [
        "Recently, very large, structured, and semantically rich knowledge bases have become available.",
        "Examples are Yago (Suchanek et al2007), DBpedia (Auer et al2007), and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008).",
        "DBpedia forms the nucleus of the Web of Linked Data (Heath and Bizer, 2011), which interconnects hundreds of RDF data sources with a total of 30 billion subject-property-object (SPO) triples.",
        "The diversity of linked-data sources and their high heterogeneity make it difficult for humans to search and discover relevant information.",
        "As linked data is in RDF format, the standard approach would be to run structured queries in triple-pattern-based languages like SPARQL, but only expert programmers are able to precisely specify their information needs and cope with the high heterogeneity of the data (and absence or very high complexity of schema information).",
        "For less initiated users the only option to query this rich data is by keyword search (e.g., via services like sig.ma (Tummarello et al2010)).",
        "None of these approaches is satisfactory.",
        "Instead, the by far most convenient approach would be to search in knowledge bases and the Web of linked data by means of natural-language questions.",
        "As an example, consider a quiz question like ?Which female actor played in Casablanca and is married to a writer who was born in Rome??.",
        "The answer could be found by querying several linked data sources together, like the IMDBstyle LinkedMDB movie database and the DBpedia knowledge base, exploiting that there are entity-level sameAs links between these collections.",
        "One can think of different formulations of the example question, such as ?Which actress from Casablanca is married to a writer from Rome??.",
        "A possible SPARQL formulation, assuming a user familiar with the schema of the underlying knowledge base(s), could consist of the following six triple patterns (joined by shared-variable bindings): ?x hasGender female, ?x isa actor, ?x actedIn Casablanca (film), ?x marriedTo ?w, ?w isa writer, ?w bornIn Rome.",
        "This complex query, which involves multiple joins, would yield good results, but it is difficult for the user to come",
        "up with the precise choices for relations, classes, and entities.",
        "This would require familiarity with the contents of the knowledge base, which no average user is expected to have.",
        "Our goal is to automatically create such structured queries by mapping the user's question into this representation.",
        "Keyword search is usually not a viable alternative when the information need involves joining multiple triples to construct the final result, notwithstanding good attempts like that of Pound et al2010).",
        "In the example, the obvious keyword query ?female actress Casablanca married writer born Rome?",
        "lacks a clear specification of the relations among the different entities."

        "Given a natural language question qNL and a knowledge base KB, our goal is to translate qNL into a formal query qFL that captures the information need expressed by qNL.",
        "We focus on input questions that put the emphasis on entities, classes, and relations between them.",
        "We do not consider aggregations (counting, max/min, etc.)",
        "and negations.",
        "As a result, we generate structured queries of the form known as conjunctive queries or select-project-join queries in database terminology.",
        "Our target language is SPARQL 1.0, where the above focus leads to queries that consist of multiple triple patterns, that is, conjunctions of SPO search conditions.",
        "We do not use any pre-existing query templates, but generate queries from scratch as they involve a variable number of joins with a-priori unknown join structure.",
        "A major challenge is in the ambiguity of the phrases occurring in a natural-language question.",
        "Phrases can denote entities (e.g., the city of Casablanca or the movie Casablanca), classes (e.g., actresses, movies, married people), or relations/properties (e.g., marriedTo between people, played between people and movies).",
        "A priori, we do not know if a phrase should be mapped to an entity, a class, or a relation.",
        "In fact, some phrases may denote any of these three kinds of targets.",
        "For example, a phrase like ?wrote score for?",
        "in a question about film music composers, could map to the composer-film relation wroteSoundtrackForFilm, to the class of movieSoundtracks (a subclass of music pieces), or to an entity like the movie ?The Score?.",
        "Depending on the choice, we may arrive at a structurally good query (with triple patterns that can actually be joined) or at a meaningless and non-executable query (with disconnected triple patterns).",
        "This generalized disambiguation problem is much more challenging than the more focused task of named entity disambiguation (NED).",
