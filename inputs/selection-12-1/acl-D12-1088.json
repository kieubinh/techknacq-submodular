        "Phrase-based Machine Translation Models (Koehn et al. 2003) model n-to-m translations of n source words to m target words, which are encoded in phrase pairs and stored in the translation model.",
        "This approach has an advantage over Word-based Translation Models (Brown et al. 1993), since translating multiple source words allows the context for each source word to be considered during translation.",
        "For instance, the translation of the English word 'in' by itself to Portuguese is not obvious, since we do not have any context for the word.",
        "This word can be translated in the context of 'in (the box)' to 'dentro', or in the context of 'in (China)' as 'na'.",
        "In fact, the lexical entry for 'in' has more than 10 good translations in Portuguese.",
        "Consequently, the lexical translation entry for Word-based models splits the probabilistic mass between different translations, leaving the choice based on context to the language model.",
        "On the other hand, in Phrase-based Models, we would have a phrase pair p(in the box, dentro da caixa) and p(in china, na china), where the words ?in the box' and 'in China' can be translated together to 'dentro da caixa' and ?na China?, which substantially reduces the ambiguity.",
        "In this case, both the translation and language models contribute to find the best translation based on the local context, which generally leads to better translations.",
        "However, not all words add the same amount of contextual information.",
        "Using the same example for ?in?, if we add the context ?",
        "(hid the key) in?, it is still not possible to accurately identify the best translation for the word ?in?.",
        "The phrase extraction algorithm (Ling et al. 2010) does not discriminate which phrases pairs encode contextual information, and extracts all phrase pairs with consistent alignments.",
        "Hence, phrases that add no contextual information, such as, p(hid the key in, escondeu a chave na) and p(hid the key in, escondeu a chave dentro) are extracted.",
        "This is undesirable because we are populating translation models with redundant phrase pairs, whose translations can be obtained using com",
        "binations of other phrases with the same probabilities, namely p(hid the key, escondeu a chave), p(in, dentro) and p(in, na).",
        "This is a problem that is also found in language modeling, where large amounts of redundant higher-order n-grams can make the model needlessly large.",
        "For backoff language models, multiple pruning strategies based on relative entropy have been proposed (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) (Stolcke, 1998), where the objective is to prune n-grams in a way to minimize the relative entropy between the model before and after pruning.",
        "While the concept of using relative entropy for pruning is not new and frequently used in backoff language models, there are no such models for machine translation.",
        "Thus, the main contribution of our work is to propose a relative entropy pruning model for translation models used in Phrase-based Machine Translation.",
        "It is shown that our pruning algorithm can eliminate phrase pairs with little or no impact in the predictions made in our translation model.",

        "While the IWSLT translation model has only 88,424 phrase pairs, for the EUROPARL experiment, the translation model was composed by 48,762,372 phrase pairs, which had to be decoded.",
        "The average time to decode each phrase pair using the full translation model is 4 seconds per sentence, since the table must be read from disk due to its size.",
        "This would make translating 48M phrase pairs unfeasible.",
        "To address this problem, we divide the phrase pairs in the translation model into blocks of K phrase pairs, that are processed separately.",
        "For each block, we resort to the approach used in MERT tuning, where the model is filtered to only include the phrase pairs that are used for translating tuning sentences.",
        "We filter each block with phrase pairs fromK to 2K with the source sentences sK , ..., s2K .",
        "Furthermore, since we are force decoding using the target sentences, we also filter the remaining translation models using the target sentences tK , ..., t2K .",
        "We used blocks of 10,000 phrase pairs and each filtered table was reduced to less than 1% of the translation table on average, reducing the average decoding time to 0.03 seconds per sentence.",
        "Furthermore, each block can be processed in parallel allowing multiple processes to be used for the task, depending on the resources that are available."

        "We observe that there is a range of values from 65% to 95% where we actually observe improvements caused by our pruning algorithm, with the peak at 85% for the uniform distribution, where we improve from 15.68 to 15.82 (0.9% improvement).",
        "Between 26% and 65%, the BLEU score is lower than the baseline at 100%, with the minimum at 26% with 15.54, where only atomic phrase pairs remain and both the multinomial and uniform distribution have the same performance, obviously.",

        "parison between the uniform and multinomial distribution, we can see that both distributions yield similar results, specially when a low number of phrase pairs is pruned.",
        "In theory, the multinomial distribution should yield better results, since the pruning model will prefer to prune phrase pairs that are more likely to be observed.",
        "However, longer phrase pairs, which tend compete with other long phrase pairs on which get pruned first.",
        "These phrase pairs generally occur only once or twice, so the multinomial model will act similarly to the uniform model regarding longer phrase pairs.",
        "On the other hand, as the model size reduces, we can see that using multinomial distribution seems to start to improve over the uniform distribution.",
        "The comparison between our pruning model and pruning based on significance is shown in table 2.",
        "These models are hard to compare, since not all phrase table sizes can be obtained using both metrics.",
        "For instance, the significance metric can either keep or remove all phrase pairs that only appear once, leaving a large gap of phrase table sizes that cannot be attained.",
        "In the EUROPARL experiment the sizes of the table suddenly drops from 60% to 8%.",
        "The same happens with our metric that cannot distinguish atomic phrase pairs.",
        "In the EUROPARL experiment, we cannot generate phrase tables with sizes smaller than 15%.",

        "On the other hand, on the EUROPARL experiment, our model only achieves slightly higher results.",
        "We believe that this is related by the fact the EUROPARL corpora is generated from automatically aligning documents, which means that there are misaligned sentence pairs.",
        "Thus, many spurious phrase pairs are extracted.",
        "Significance pruning performs well under these conditions, since the measure is designed for this purpose.",
        "In our metric, we do not have any means for detecting spurious phrase pairs, in fact, spurious phrase pairs are probably kept in the phrase table, since each distinct spurious phrase pair is only extracted once, and thus, they have very few derivations in its support set.",
        "This suggests, that the significance score can be integrated in our model to improve our model, which we leave as future work.",

        "We believe that in language pairs such as Chinese",
        "English with large distance reorderings between phrases are more prone to search errors and benefit more from our pruning algorithm.",
        "To illustrate this, let us consider the source sentence ?John married in Portugal?, and translating either using the blocks ?John?, ?married?",
        "and ?in Portugal?",
        "or the blocks ?John?, ?married in?, ?Portugal?, the first hypothesis would be much more viable, since the word ?Portugal?",
        "is more relevant as the context for the word ?in?.",
        "Thus, the key choice for the decoder is to decide whether to translate using ?married?",

        "Furthermore, the more words exist between ?married?",
        "and ?Portugal?, the more likely will the correct hypothesis not exist when we reach ?Portugal?.",
        "By pruning the hypothesis ?married in?",
        "a priori, we contribute in preventing such search errors.",
        "We observe that some categories of phrase pairs that are systematically pruned, but these cannot be generalized in rules, since there are many exceptions.",

        "For instance, the word ?please?",
