        "Taxonomies are widely used for knowledge standardization, knowledge sharing, and inferencing in natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Harabagiu et al. 2003; Szpektor et al. 2004).",
        "However, another common function of taxonomies, browsing, has received little attention in the NLP community.",
        "Browsing is the task of exploring and accessing information through a structure, e.g. a hierarchy, built upon a given document collection.",
        "In fact, taxonomies serve as browsing tools in many venues, including the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH, 2011) for the U.S. Library of Congress and the Open Directory Project (ODP, 2011) for about 5% of the entire Web.",
        "We call taxonomies supporting browsing as browsing taxonomies.",
        "When used for browsing, concepts1 in taxonomies are linked to documents containing them and taxonomic structures are navigated to find particular documents.",
        "Users can navigate through a browsing taxonomy to explore the documents in the collection.",
        "A browsing taxonomy benefits information access by providing corpus overview for a document collection and allowing more focused reading by presenting together documents about the same concept.",
        "Most existing browsing taxonomies, such as LCSH and ODP, are manually constructed to support large collections in general domains.",
        "Not only their constructions are expensive and slow, but also their structures are static and difficult to adapt to specific tasks.",
        "In situations where document collections are given ad-hoc, such as search result organization (Carpineto et al. 2009), email collection exploration (Yang and Callan, 2008), and literature investigation (Chau et al. 2011), existing taxonomies may even not be able to provide the right coverage of concepts.",
        "It is necessary to explore ad-hoc (semi-)automatic techniques to quickly derive task-specific browsing taxonomies for arbitrary document collections.",
        "(Hovy, 2002) pointed out that one key challenge in taxonomy construction is multiple perspectives embedded in concepts and relations.",
        "One cause for multiple perspectives is the inherent facets in concepts, e.g., jewelries can be organized by price or by gemstone types.",
        "Another cause is task specification or even personalization.",
        "For example, when building a taxonomy for search results of query trip to",
        "DC, Jane may organize the concepts based on places of interests while Tom may organize them based on dates in visit.",
        "Typically, a taxonomy only conveys one or two perspectives from many choices.",
        "It is difficult to decide which perspective should be present.",
        "One realistic solution is to leave the decision to the constructor independent of the confusion that comes from facets, task specification or personalization.",
        "When multiple perspectives present in the same taxonomy, it is not uncommon that the perspectives are mixed.",
        "For example, along a path financial institute?bank?river bank, financial institute?bank shows one perspective and bank?river bank shows another.",
        "We call this problem path inconsistency.",
        "Many approaches on automatic taxonomy construction suffer from this problem because their foci are on accurately identifying local relations between concept pairs (Etzioni et al. 2005; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) instead of on global control over the entire taxonomic structure.",
        "More recently, approaches attempted to build the full taxonomy structure (Snow et al. 2006; Yang and Callan, 2009; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010), however, few have looked into how to incorporate task specifications into taxonomy construction.",
        "In this paper, we extended an existing taxonomy construction approach (Yang and Callan, 2009) to build task-specific taxonomies for document collection browsing.",
        "The extension comes in two parts: handling path consistency and incorporating specifications from users.",
        "We uniquely employ pairwise semantic distance as an entry point to incrementally build browsing taxonomies.",
        "A supervised distance learning algorithm not only allows us to incorporate multiple semantic features to evaluate the proximity between concepts, but also allows us to learn the metric function from personal preferences.",
        "Users can thus manually modify the taxonomies and to some extent teach the algorithm to predict his/her way to organize the concepts.",
        "Moreover, by minimizing the overall semantic distances among concepts and restricting minimal semantic distances along a path, we find the best hierarchical structure as the browsing taxonomy.",
        "Our contributions include:",
        "- A supervised learning mechanism to capture task-specific or personalized requirements for organizing a browsing taxonomy; - A strategy to address path inconsistency due to word sense ambiguity and/or mixed perspectives; - A general scheme to capture user inputs in taxonomy construction; - A user study to evaluate the effectiveness of task-specific taxonomies for browsing activities."

        "To support browsing in arbitrary collections, in this paper, we propose to incorporate task specification in a taxonomy.",
        "One way to achieve it is to define task-specific distances among concepts.",
        "Moreover, through controlling distance scores among concepts, we can enforce path consistency in taxonomies.",

Although our extraction algorithm is very effective with 95% precision and 80% recall in a manual evaluation, sometimes C may still miss some important concepts for the collection.",

        "Document collection browsing is another common use of taxonomies.",

        "This paper explores techniques to quickly derive task-specific taxonomies supporting browsing in arbitrary document sets.",
        "In particular, we uniquely employ pairwise semantic distance as an entry point to incrementally build browsing taxonomies.",
        "The supervised distance learning algorithm not only allows us to incorporate multiple semantic features to evaluate the proximity between concepts, but also allows us to learn the metric function from personal preferences.",
        "Users can thus manually modify the taxonomies and to some extent teach the algorithm to predict his/her way to organize the concepts.",
        "Moreover, by minimizing the overall semantic distances among concepts and restricting minimal semantic distances along a path, we find the best hierarchical structure as the browsing hierarchy.",
        "It guarantees that semantically close concepts are put together so that users will have a good idea about why the concepts are put together.",
        "This greatly increases the interpretability of a constructed browsing hierarchy than the existing approaches.",
        "This makes our approach more flexible and more general to effectively creating browsing taxonomies to support more complicated and more realistic tasks such as Web information triage."
