        "Domain information pervades most of the text we read every day.",
        "If we just think of the Web, the vast majority of its textual content is domain oriented.",
        "A case in point is Wikipedia, which provides ency-clopedic coverage for a huge number of knowledge domains (Medelyan et al. 2009), but most blogs, Web sites and newspapers also provide a great deal of information focused on specific areas of knowledge.",
        "When it comes to automatic text understanding, then, it is crucial to take into account the domain specificity of a piece of text, so as to perform a focused and as-precise-as-possible analysis which, in its turn, can enable domain-aware applications such as question answering and information extraction.",
        "Domain knowledge also has the potential to improve open-text applications such as summarization (Cey-lan et al. 2010) and machine translation (Foster et al., 2010).",
        "Research in Word Sense Disambiguation (Navigli, 2009, WSD), the task aimed at the automatic labeling of text with word senses, has been oriented towards domain text understanding for several years now.",
        "Many approaches have been devised, including the identification of domain-specific predominant senses (McCarthy et al. 2007; Lapata and Keller, 2007), the development of domain resources (Magnini and Cavaglia`, 2000; Magnini et al. 2002), their application to WSD (Gliozzo et al. 2004), and the effective use of link analysis algorithms such as Personalized PageRank (Agirre et al. 2009; Navigli et al. 2011).",
        "More recently, semi-supervised approaches to domain WSD have been proposed which aim at decreasing the amount of supervision needed to carry out the task (Khapra et al. 2010).",
        "High-performance domain WSD, however, has been hampered by the widespread use of a general-purpose sense inventory, i.e., WordNet (Miller et al., 1990; Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Unfortunately WordNet does not contain many specialized terms, making it difficult to use it in work on arbitrary specialized domains.",
        "While Wikipedia has recently been considered a valid alternative (Mihalcea, 2007), it is mainly focused on covering named entities and, strictly speaking, does not contain a formal wide-coverage sense inventory (not even in disambiguation pages, which are often incomplete, especially in the lexicographic sense).",
        "In this paper we provide three main contributions: ?",
        "We tackle the above issues by introducing a new framework based on the minimally-supervised acquisition of specialized glossaries for dozens of domains.",
        "?",
        "In turn, we use the acquired domain glossaries as a sense inventory for domain WSD.",
        "As a result, we redefine the domain WSD task as one of picking out the most appropriate gloss (fine-grained setting) or domain (coarse-grained setting) from a multi-domain glossary.",
        "?",
        "We show that our framework represents a considerable departure from the common usage of a general-purpose sense inventory such as WordNet, in that, thanks to the wide coverage of domain meanings, it enables high-performance unsupervised WSD on many domains in the range of 69-80% F1.",
        "Furthermore, our approach can be customized to any set of domains of interest, and new senses, i.e., glosses, can be added at any time (either manually or automatically) to the multi-domain sense inventory."

        "Domain WSD has been the focus of much interest in the last few years.",
        "An important research direction identifies distributionally similar neighbors in raw text as cues for determining the predominant sense of a target word by means of a semantic similarity measure (McCarthy et al. 2004; Koeling et al. 2005; McCarthy et al. 2007).",
        "Other distributional methods include the use of a word-category cooccur-rence matrix, where categories are coarse senses obtained from an existing thesaurus (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), and synonym-based word occurrence counts (Lapata and Keller, 2007).",
        "Domain-informed methods have also been proposed which make use of domain labels as cues for disambiguation purposes (Gliozzo et al. 2004).",
        "Domain-driven approaches have been shown to obtain the best performance among the unsupervised alternatives (Strapparava et al. 2004), especially when domain kernels are coupled with a syntag-matic one (Gliozzo et al. 2005).",
        "However, their performance is typically lower than supervised systems.",
        "On the other hand, supervised systems fall short of carrying out high-performance WSD within domains, the main reason being the need for retraining on each new specific knowledge domain.",
        "Nonetheless, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck can be relieved by means of domain adaptation (Chan and Ng, 2006; Chan and Ng, 2007; Agirre and de La-calle, 2009) or by effectively injecting a general-purpose corpus into a smaller domain-specific training set (Khapra et al. 2010).",
        "However, as mentioned above, most work on domain WSD uses WordNet as a sense inventory.",
        "But even if WordNet senses have been enriched with topically-distinctive words and concepts (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004; Cuadros and Rigau, 2008), manually-developed domain labels (Magnini et al. 2002), and disambiguated semantic relations (Navigli, 2005), the main obstacle of being stuck with an open-ended fine-grained sense inventory remains.",
        "Recent results on the SPORTS and FINANCE gold standard dataset (Koeling et al. 2005) show that domain WSD can achieve accuracy in the 50- 60% ballpark when a state-of-the-art algorithm such as Personalized PageRank is paired with a distributional approach (Agirre et al. 2009) or with semantic model vectors acquired for many domains (Navigli et al. 2011).",
        "In this paper, we take domain WSD to the next level by proposing a new framework based on the minimally-supervised acquisition of large domain sense inventories thanks to which high performance can be attained on virtually any domain using unsupervised algorithms.",
        "Glossary acquisition approaches in the literature are mostly focused on pattern-based definition extraction (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000; Hovy et al. 2003; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006, among others) and lattice-based supervised models (Navigli and Velardi, 2010) starting from an initial terminology, while we jointly bootstrap the lexicon and the definitions for several domains with minimal supervision and without the requirement of domain-specific corpora.",
        "To do so, we adapt bootstrapping techniques (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pa≈üca et al. 2006) to the novel task of domain glossary acquisition from the Web.",
        "Approaches to domain sense modeling have already been proposed which go beyond the WordNet sense inventory (Duan and Yates, 2010).",
        "Distinctive collocations are extracted from corpora and used as features to bootstrap a supervised WSD system.",
        "Experiments in the biomedical domain show good performance, however only in-domain ambiguity is addressed.",
        "In contrast, our approach tackles cross",
        "domain ambiguity, by working with virtually any set of domains and minimizing the requirements by harvesting domain terms and definitions from the Web, bootstrapped using a small number of seeds.",
        "The existing approach closest to ours is that of Huang and Riloff (2010), who devised a bootstrapping approach to induce semantic class taggers from domain text.",
        "The semantic classes are associated with arbitrary NPs and must be established beforehand.",
        "Our objective, instead, is to perform domain disambiguation at the word level.",
        "To do this, we redefine the domain WSD problem as one of selecting the most suitable gloss from those available in our full-fledged multi-domain glossary."

        "Sports, Finance and Environment For the SPORTS, FINANCE and ENVIRONMENT datasets (cf.",
        "Section 4.3) we did not have gloss-based sense annotations, so we could not perform a fine-grained evaluation.",

        "We have here presented a new framework for domain Word Sense Disambiguation.",

        "Our work provides three main contributions: i) we propose a new, flexible approach to glossary bootstrapping which harvests hundreds of thousands of term/gloss pairs; the resulting multi-domain glossary is shown to have wide coverage across domains and to include a large amount of terms not available in WordNet; ii) we propose a novel framework for fully-unsupervised domain WSD which uses the multi-domain glossary as our sense inventory; iii) we show that high performance can be achieved by means of simple, unsupervised WSD algorithms (around 80% and 69% in a coarse-and fine-grained setting, respectively).",
        "Note that our aim here has not been to determine which system performs best, but rather to show that a reliable, full-fledged framework for domain WSD can be set up with minimal supervision.",
        "Additionally, our framework can be applied to any language of interest, provided enough glossaries are available online, by simply translating the keywords used for our queries.",
