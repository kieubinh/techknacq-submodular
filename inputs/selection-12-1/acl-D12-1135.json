        "The number of people having an identity on one of the Internet social networks (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.)",
        "has been steadily growing, many users communicate online on a daily basis.",
        "Their interactions open new possibilities for social sciences, and linguistics is no exception.",
        "For example, with the development and growth of Web 2.0, it has become possible to get access to masses of text data labeled with respect to different social",
        "parameters such as country, age, gender, profession or religion.",
        "The study of language varieties between groups separated by a certain social variable belongs to the field of sociolinguistics which more generally investigates the effect of society on how language is used (Coulmas, 1998).",
        "Historically, sociolinguistics is connected to dialectology whose focus has been primarily on the phonetic aspect of the regional dialects but was later extended to sociolects (Chambers & Trudgill, 1998).",
        "A usual study would involve sampling speakers from a population, interviewing them and analyzing the linguistic items with respect to social variables (Hudson, 1980).",
        "The last decade has seen several studies investigating the relationship between the language and the demographics of the users of blogs or Twitter (see Sec. 2 for references).",
        "Most of those studies used social network sites to collect labeled data'",
        "samples of text together with the demographics variable.",
        "However, they did not analyse how social environment affects language, although very similar questions have been recently posed (but not yet answered) by Ellist (2009).",
        "In our work we attempt to address precisely this issue.",
        "In particular, we consider the task of user gender prediction on YouTube and contrast two information sources: (1) the comments written by the user and (2) her social neighborhood as defined by the bipartite user-video graph.",
        "We use the comments to train a gender classifier on a variety of linguistic features.",
        "We also introduce a simple gender propagation procedure to predict person's gender from the user-video graph.",
        "In what follows we will argue that although language does provide us with signals indicative of the",
        "user's gender5 (as reported in the user's profile), it is in fact more indicative of a socially defined gender.",
        "Leaving aside the debate on the intricate relationship between language and gender (see Eckert & McConnell-Ginet (2003) for a thorough discussion of the subject), we simply demonstrate that a classifier trained to predict the predominant gender in the user's social environment, as approximated by the YouTube graph of users and videos, achieves higher accuracy for both genders than the one trained to predict the user's inborn gender.",
        "We also investigate ways of how the language-based and the social views can be combined to improve prediction accuracy.",
        "Finally, we look at three age groups '",
        "teenagers, people in their twenties and people over thirty '",
        "and show that gender identity is more evident in the language of younger people but also that there is a higher correlation between their inborn gender and the predominant gender in their social environment.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: we first review related work on the language of social media and user demographics (Sec. 2) and elaborate on the goals of our research (Sec. 3).",
        "Then we describe our data (Sec. 4), introduce the demographics propagation experiments (Sec. 5) and the experiments on supervised learning gender from language (Sec. 6)."

      "text": [
        "Similarly to previous NLP studies, our starting goal is to predict the self-reported user gender.",
        "The first novelty of our research is that in doing so we contrast two sources of information: the user's social environment and the text she has written.",
        "Indeed, a topic which has not yet been investigated much in the reviewed studies on language and user demographics is the relationship between the language of the user and her social environment.",
        "The data analysis studies (Sec. 2.1) verified hypotheses concerning the dependency between a language trait (e.g., average sentence length) and a demographic parameter (e.g., gender).",
        "The demographics prediction studies (Sec. 2.2) mostly relied on language and user profile features and considered users in isolation.",
        "An exception to this is Garera & Yarowsky (2009) who showed that, for gender prediction in a dialogue, it helps to know the interlocutor's gender.",
        "However, we aim at investigating the impact of the social environment in a much broader sense than the immediate interlocutors and in a much broader context than a conversation.",
        "Language is a social phenomenon, and it is this fact that motivates all the sociolinguistic research.",
        "Many if not most language traits are not hard-wired or inborn but can be explained by looking at who the person interacts most with.",
        "Since every language speaker can be seen as a member of multiple overlapping communities (e.g., computer scientists, French, males, runners), the language of the person may reflect her membership in different communities to various degrees.",
        "Repeated interactions with other language speakers influence the way the person speaks (Baxter et al. 2006; Bybee, 2010), and the influence is observable on all the levels of the language representation (Croft, 2000).",
        "For example, it has been shown that the more a person is integrated in a certain community and the tighter the ties of the social network are, the more prominent are the representative traits of that community in the language of the person (Milroy & Milroy, 1992; Labov, 1994).",
        "In our study we adopt a similar view and analyse the implications it has for gender prediction.",
        "Given its social nature, does the language reflect the norms of a community the user belongs to or the actual value of a demographic variable'",
        "In our study we address this issue with a particular modeling technique: we assume that the observed online behavior adequately reflects the offline life of a user (more on this in Sec. 4 and 5) and based on this assumption make inferences about the user's social environment.",
        "We use language-based features and a supervised approach to gender prediction to analyse the relationship between the language and the variable to be predicted.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to question whether it is really the inborn gender that language-based classifiers learn to predict.",
        "More concrete questions we are going to suggest answers to are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Previous studies which looked at online data relied on self-reported demographics.",
        "The profile data are known to be noisy, although it is hard to estimate the proportion of false profiles (Burger et al. 2011).",
        "Concerning the prediction task, how can we make use of what we know about the user's social environment to reduce the effect of noise'",
        "How can we benefit from the language samples from the users whose gender we do not know at all'",
        "2.",
        "When analyzing the language of a user, how much are its gender-specific traits due to the user's inborn gender and to which extent can they be explained by her social environment'",
        "Using our modeling technique and a language-based gender classifier, how is its performance",
        "affected by what we know about the online social environment of the user'",
        "3.",
        "Concerning gender predictions across different",
        "age groups, how does classifier performance change'",
        "Judging from the online communication, do teenagers signal their gender identity more than older people'",
        "In terms of classifier accuracy, is it easier to predict a teenager's gender than the gender of an adult'",

        "To address these questions we contrast two classifiers: (1) the one described in the beginning of the section which is trained on the gender labels collected from the user profiles; (2) a classifier trained on the vicinity gender, that is the dominating gender of the environment of a speaker as obtained with the procedure described in Section 5.",
        "Age groups and gender prediction.",
        "Finally, we look at how gender predictions change with age and train three age-specific models to predict gender for teenagers (13-19), people in their twenties (20-29) and people over thirty (30+), the age is also extracted from the profiles.",
        "These groups are identified in order to check whether teenagers tend to signalize their gender identity more than older people, a hypothesis investigated earlier on a sample of blog posts (Huffaker & Calvert, 2005)."

        "We report the results of the supervised experiments for all the settings described above.",
        "As an estimate of the lowest bound we also give the results of the majority class baseline (all male) which guarantees 70% accuracy.",
        "For the supervised classifiers we report accuracy and per-gender precision, recall and f-measure.",
        "Table 3 presents the results for the starting classifier trained to predict profile gender.",
        "In order to investigate the relationship between the social environment of a person, her gender and the language, we split the users from the test set into two groups: those whose profile gender matched the gender propagated from the vicinity and those for whom there was a mismatch.",
        "Thus Table 4 presents the same results as Table 3 but separated for these",
        "two groups of users.",
        "It also gives user counts w.r.t.",
        "the profile gender.",
        "matches/differs from the vicinity gender.",
        "Enhanced training set.",
        "In the next experiment we refined the training set by removing all the users whose vicinity gender did not match the gender reported in the profile.",
        "The evaluation was done on the unmodified set (Table 5).",
        "The predictions made by the model trained on a refined set of users turned out to be slightly less accurate than those made by the model trained on the full training set (Table 3).",
        "The refined model performed slightly (< 1%) better than the starting one on the users whose vicinity and the profile genders matched but got very poor results on the users with a gender mismatch, the accuracy being as low as 37%.",
        "The accuracy of the starting model on those users is 47% (Table 4).",
        "training set.",
        "In another experiment we extended the training data with the users whose gender was unknown but was predicted with the propagation method.",
        "However, a larger training set makes a difference only if there is a substantial performance gain over the increasing size of the training set.",
        "We observed only a minor gain in performance (< 1%) when the training data size was increased by an order of magnitude.",
        "Given that, it is not surprising that adding 12% did not affect the results.",
        "Language, the vicinity and the profile genders.",
        "The gap in accuracies of predictions for the two user groups in Table 4 is remarkable: 47% vs. 94%.",
        "If we extrapolate what we observe in the affiliation graph to other online and offline life, then this result may suggest that gender traits are more prominent in the language of people spending more time with the people of their gender than in that of the people who spend more time with the people of the opposite gender.",
        "Given the remarkable difference, a further question arises whether the classifier actually learns to predict a kind of socially rather than the profile gender.",
        "To investigate this, we looked at the results of the model which knew nothing about the profile gender but was trained to predict the vicinity gender instead (Table 6).",
        "This model relied on the exact same set of features but both for training and testing it used the gender labels obtained from the propagation procedure described in Section 5.",
        "propagated gender.",
        "According to all the evaluation metrics, for both genders the performance of the classifier trained and tested on the propagated gender is higher (cf. Table 3): the differences in f-measure for female and male are four and two points respectively, both statistically significant.",
        "This indicates that it is the predominant environment gender that a language-based classifier is better at learning rather than the inborn gender.",
        "Predictions across age groups.",
        "Finally, to address the question of whether gender differences are more prominent and thus easer to identify in the language of younger people, we looked at the accuracy of gender predictions across three age groups.",
        "Table 7 summarizes the results and gives the accuracy of the all male baseline as well as of the propagation procedure (Prop-acc).",
        "Although the overall accuracy over the three groups does not degrade much, from 89% to 87%, both precision and recall do decrease significantly for females.",
        "This is not directly reflected in the accuracy because the number of females drops dramatically from 42% among teenagers to 26% and then 21% in the latter groups.",
        "For a comparison, the accuracy of the propagated gender (Prop-acc) also decreases from younger to older age groups although it is slightly higher than that of language-based predictions.",
        "One conclusion we can make at this point is that a teenager's gender is easier to predict from the language which is in line with the hypothesis that younger people signalize their gender identities more than older people.",
        "Another observation is that, as the person gets older, we can be less sure about her gender by looking at her social environment.",
        "This in turn might be an explanation of why there are less gender signals in the language of a person: the environment becomes more mixed, and the influence of both genders becomes more balanced."

      "heading": "7 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "In our study we addressed the gender prediction task from two perspectives: (1) the social one where we looked at an affiliation graph of users and videos and propagated gender information between users, and (2) the language one where we trained a classifier on features which have been claimed to be indicative of gender.",
        "We demonstrated that both perspectives provide us with comparably accurate predictions (around 90%) but that they are far from being independent.",
        "We also investigated a few ways of how the performance of a language-based classifier can be enhanced by the social aspect, compared the accuracy of predictions across different age groups and found support for hypotheses made in earlier sociolinguistic studies.",
        "We are not the first to predict gender from language features with online data.",
        "However, to our knowledge, we are the first to contrast the two views, social and language-based, using online data and to question whether there is a clear understanding of what gender classifiers actually learn to predict from language.",
        "Our results indicate that from the standard language cues we are better at predicting a social gender, that is the gender defined by the environment of a person, rather than the inborn gender.",
        "The theoretical significance of this result is that it provides support for the usage-based view on language (Bybee, 2010), namely that the person's language is largely shaped by the interactions with her social environment.",
        "On the practical side, it may have implications for targeted advertisement as it enriches the understanding of what gender classifiers predict.",
