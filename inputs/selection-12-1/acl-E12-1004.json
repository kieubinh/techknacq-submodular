        "Distributional semantics (DS) approximates linguistic meaning with vectors summarizing the contexts where expressions occur.",
        "The success of DS in lexical semantics has validated the hypothesis that semantically similar expressions occur in similar contexts (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Sahlgren, 2006; Schu?tze, 1997; Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Formal semantics (FS) represents linguistic meanings as symbolic formulas and assemble them via composition rules.",
        "FS has successfully modeled quantification and captured inferential relations between phrases and between sentences (Montague, 1970; Thomason, 1974; Heim and Kratzer, 1998).",
        "The strengths of DS and FS have been complementary to date: On one hand, DS has induced large-scale semantic representations from corpora, but it has been largely limited to the lexical domain.",
        "On the other hand, FS has provided sophisticated models of sentence meaning, but it has been largely limited to hand-coded models that do not scale up to real-life challenges by learning from data.",
        "Given these complementary strengths, we naturally ask if DS and FS can address each other's limitations.",
        "Two recent strands of research are bringing DS closer to meeting core FS challenges.",
        "One strand attempts to model compositionality with DS methods, representing both primitive and composed linguistic expressions as distributional vectors (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Guevara, 2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "The other strand attempts to reformulate FS's notion of logical inference in terms that DS can capture (Erk, 2009; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Kotlerman et al. 2010; Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2010).",
        "In keeping with the lexical emphasis of DS, this strand has focused on inference at the word level, or lexical entailment, that is, discovering from distributional vectors of hyponyms (dog) that they entail their hypernyms (animal).",
        "This paper brings these two strands of research together by demonstrating two ways in which the distributional vectors of composite expressions bear on inference.",
        "Here we focus on phrasal vectors harvested directly from the corpus rather than obtained compositionally.",
        "In a first experiment, we exploit the entailment properties of a class of composite expressions, namely adjective-noun constructions (ANs), to harvest training data for an entailment recognizer.",
        "The recognizer is then successfully applied to detect lexical entailment.",
        "In short, since almost all ANs entail the noun they contain (red car entails car), the distributional vectors of ANN pairs can train a classifier to detect noun pairs that stand in the same relation (dog",
        "entails animal).",
        "With almost no manual effort, we achieve performance nearly identical with the state-of-the-art balAPinc measure that Kotlerman et al(2010) crafted, which detects feature inclusion between the two nouns?",
        "occurrence contexts.",
        "Our second experiment goes beyond lexical inference.",
        "We look at phrases built from a quantifying determiner1 and a noun (QNs) and use their distributional vectors to recognize entailment relations of the form many dogs |= some dogs, between two QNs sharing the same noun.",
        "It turns out that a classifier trained on a set of Q1N |=Q2N pairs can recognize entailment in pairs with a new quantifier configuration.",
        "For example, we can train on many dogs |= some dogs then correctly predict all cats|=several cats.",
        "Interestingly, on the QN entailment task, neither our classifier trained on ANN pairs nor the balAPinc method beat baseline methods.",
        "This suggests that our successful QN classifiers tap into vector properties beyond such relations as feature inclusion that those methods for nominal entailment rely upon.",
        "Together, our experiments show that corpus-harvested DS representations of composite expressions such as ANs and QNs contain sufficient information to capture and generalize their inference patterns.",
        "This result brings DS closer to the central concerns of FS.",
        "In particular, the QN study is the first to our knowledge to show that DS vectors capture semantic properties not only of content words, but of an important class of function words (quantifying determiners) deeply studied in FS but of little interest until now in DS.",
        "Besides these theoretical implications, our results are of practical import.",
        "First, our AN study presents a novel, practical method for detecting lexical entailment that reaches state-of-the-art performance with little or no manual intervention.",
        "Lexical entailment is in turn fundamental for constructing ontologies and other lexical resources (Buitelaar and Cimiano, 2008).",
        "Second, our QN study demonstrates that phrasal entailment can be automatically detected and thus paves the way to apply DS to advanced NLP tasks such as recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al. 2009).",

        "semantics Entailment in FS To characterize the conditions under which a sentence is true, FS begins with the lexical meanings of the words in the sentence and builds up the meanings of larger and larger phrases until it arrives at the meaning of the whole sentence.",
        "The meanings throughout this",
        "compositional process inhabit a variety of semantic domains, depending on the syntactic category of the expressions: typically, a sentence denotes a truth value (true or false) or truth conditions, a noun such as cat denotes a set of entities, and a quantifier phrase (QP) such as all cats denotes a set of sets of entities.",
        "The entailment relation (|=) is a core notion of logic: it holds between one or more sentences and a sentence such that it cannot be that the former (antecedent) are true and the latter (consequent) is false.",
        "FS extends this notion from formal-logic sentences to natural-language expressions.",
        "By assigning meanings to parts of a sentence, FS allows defining entailment not only among sentences but also among words and phrases.",
        "Each semantic domain A has its own entailment relation |=A.",
        "The entailment relation |=S among sentences is the logical notion just described, whereas the entailment relations |=N and |=QP among nouns and quantifier phrases are the inclusion relations among sets of entities and sets of sets of entities respectively.",
        "Our results in Section 5 show that DS needs to treat |=N and |=QP differently as well.",
        "Empirical, corpus-based perspectives on entailment Until recently, the corpus-based research tradition has studied entailment mostly at the word level, with applied goals such as classifying lexical relations and building taxonomic WordNet-like resources automatically.",
        "The most popular approach, first adopted by Hearst (1992), extracts lexical relations from patterns in large corpora.",
        "For instance, from the pattern N1 such as N2 one learns that N2 |=N1 (from insects such as beetles, derive beetles |= insects).",
        "Several studies have refined and extended this approach (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Snow et al. 2005; Snow et al. 2006; Turney, 2008).",
        "While empirically very successful, the pattern-based method is mostly limited to single content words (or frequent content-word phrases).",
        "We are interested in entailment between phrases, where it is not obvious how to use lexico-syntactic patterns and cope with data sparsity.",
        "For instance, it seems hard to find a pattern that frequently connects one QP to another it entails, as in all beetles PATTERN many beetles.",
        "Hence, we aim to find a more general method and investigate whether DS vectors (whether corpus-harvested or compositionally derived) encode the information needed to account for phrasal entailment in a way that can be captured and generalized to unseen phrase pairs.",
        "Rather recently, the study of sentential entailment has taken an empirical turn, thanks to the development of benchmarks for entailment systems.",
        "The FS definition of entailment has been modified by taking common sense into account.",
        "Instead of a relation from the truth of the consequent to the truth of the antecedent in any circumstance, the applied view looks at entailment in terms of plausibility: ?",
        "|= ?",
        "if a human who reads (and trusts) ?",
        "would most likely infer that ?",
        "is also true.",
        "Entailment systems have been compared under this new perspective in various evaluation campaigns, the best known being the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) initiative (Dagan et al. 2009).",
        "Most RTE systems are based on advanced NLP components, machine learning techniques, and/or syntactic transformations (Zanzotto et al. 2007; Kouleykov and Magnini, 2005).",
        "A few systems exploit deep FS analysis (Bos and Markert, 2006; Chambers et al. 2007).",
        "In particular, the FS results about QP properties that affect entailment have been exploited by Chambers et alwho complement a core broad-coverage system with a Natural Logic module to trade lower recall for higher precision.",
        "For instance, they exploit the monotonicity properties of no that cause the following reversal in entailment direction: some beetles |= some insects but no insects |= no beetles.",
        "To investigate entailment step by step, we address here a much simpler and clearer type of entailment than the more complex notion taken up by the RTE community.",
        "While RTE is outside our present scope, we do focus on QP entailment as Natural Logic does.",
        "However, our evaluation differs from Chambers et als, since we rely on general-purpose DS vectors as our only resource, and we look at phrase pairs with different quantifiers but the same noun.",
        "For instance, we aim to predict that all beetles |= many beetles but few beetles 6|=all beetles.",
        "QPs, of course, have many well-known semantic properties besides entailment; we leave their analysis to future study.",
        "Entailment in DS Erk (2009) suggests that it may not be possible to induce lexical entailment directly from a vector space representation, but it is possible to encode the relation in this space after it has been derived through other means.",
        "On the other hand, recent studies (Geffet and Dagan,",
        "2005; Kotlerman et al. 2010; Weeds et al. 2004) have pursued the intuition that entailment is the asymmetric ability of one term to ?substitute?",
        "for another.",
        "For example, baseball contexts are also sport contexts but not vice versa, hence baseball is ?narrower?",
        "than sport and baseball |=sport.",
        "On this view, entailment between vectors corresponds to inclusion of contexts or features, and can be captured by asymmetric measures of distribution similarity.",
        "In particular, Kotlerman et al(2010) carefully crafted the balAPinc measure (see Section 3.5 below).",
        "We adopt this measure because it has been shown to outperform others in several tasks that require lexical entailment information.",
        "Like Kotlerman et al. we want to capture the entailment relation between vectors of features.",
        "However, we are interested in entailment not only between words but also between phrases, and we ask whether the DS view of entailment as feature inclusion, which captures entailment between nouns, also captures entailment between QPs.",

        "The concatenation operation gave more successful results.",
        "3To keep a manageable parameter space, we picked 300 columns without tuning.",

        "An SVM with a polynomial kernel takes into account not only individual input features but also their interactions (Manning et al. 2008, chapter 15).",
        "Thus, our classifier can capture not just properties of individual dimensions of the antecedent and consequent pairs, but also properties of their combinations (e.g., the product of the first dimensions of the antecedent and the consequent).",
        "We conjecture that this property of SVMs is fundamental to their success at detecting entailment, where relations between the antecedent and the consequent should matter more than their independent characteristics.",
        "Since the contexts of AN must be a subset of the contexts of N, semantic vectors harvested from AN phrases and their head Ns are by construction in an inclusion relation.",
        "The first experiment shows that these vectors constitute excellent training data to discover entailment between nouns.",
        "This suggests that the vector pairs representing entailment between nouns are also in an inclusion relation, supporting the conjectures of Kotlerman et al(2010) and others.",

        "The first baseline (fq(N1)< fq(N2)) guesses entailment if the first word is less frequent than the second.",

        "Interestingly, the balAPinc decision thresholds tuned on the AN |= N set and on the test data are very close (0.26 vs. 0.24), resulting in very similar performance for balAPincAN |= N and balAPincupper.",
        "This suggests that the relation captured by balAPinc on the phrasal entailment training data is indeed the same that the measure captures when applied to lexical entailment data.",
        "The success of this first experiment shows that the entailment relation present in the distributional representation of AN phrases and their head Ns transfers to lexical entailment (entailment among Ns).",
        "Most importantly, this result demonstrates that the semantic vectors of composite expressions (such as ANs) are useful for lexical entailment.",
        "Moreover, the result is in accordance with the view of FS, that ANs and Ns have the same semantic type, and thus they enter entailment relations of the same kind.",
        "Finally, the hypothesis that entailment among nouns is reflected by distributional inclusion among their semantic vectors (Kotlerman et al. 2010) is supported both by the successful generalization of the SVM classifier trained on AN |= N pairs and by the good performance of the balAPinc measure."

        "These additional instances turned out to be much easier to classify: adding an equal proportion of them to the training data and testing data, such that the number of instances where N1 = N2 and where N1 6= N2 is equal, reduced every error rate roughly by half.",
