        "A number of unsupervised semantic models (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008, for example) have recently been proposed which are inspired at least in part by the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954)?that a word's meaning can be characterized by the contexts in which it appears.",
        "Such models represent word meaning as one or more high-dimensional vectors which capture the lexical and syntactic contexts of the word's occurrences in a training corpus.",
        "Much of the recent work in this area has, following Mitchell and Lapata (2008), focused on the notion of compositionality as the litmus test of a truly semantic model.",
        "Compositionality is a natural way to construct representations of linguistic units larger than a word, and it has a long history in Montagovian semantics for dealing with argument structure and assembling rich semantical expressions of the kind found in predicate logic.",
        "While compositionality may thus provide a convenient recipe for producing representations of propositionally typed phrases, it is not a necessary condition for a semantic representation.",
        "Rather, that distinction still belongs to the crucial ability to support inference.",
        "It is not the intention of this paper to argue for or against compositionality in semantic representations.",
        "Rather, our interest is in evaluating semantic models in order to determine their suitability for inference tasks.",
        "In particular, we contend that it is desirable and arguably necessary for a compositional semantic representation to support inference invariantly, in the sense that the particular syntactic construction that guided the composition should not matter relative to the representations of syntactically different phrases with the same meanings.",
        "For example, we can assert that John threw the ball and The ball was thrown by John have the same meaning for the purposes of inference, even though they differ syntactically.",
        "An analogy can be drawn to research in image processing, in which it is widely regarded as important for the representations of images to be invariant to rotation and scaling.",
        "What we should want is a representation of sentence meaning that is invariant to diathesis, other regular syntactic alternations in the assignment of argument structure, and, ideally, even invariant to other meaning-preserving or near-preserving paraphrases.",
        "Existing evaluations of distributional semantic models fall short of measuring this.",
        "One evaluation approach consists of lexical-level word substitution tasks which primarily evaluate a system's ability to disambiguate word senses within a controlled syntactic environment (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009, for example).",
        "Another approach is to evaluate parsing accuracy (Socher et al. 2010, for example), which is really a formalism-specific approximation to argument structure analysis.",
        "These evaluations may certainly be relevant to specific components of, for example, machine translation or natural language generation systems, but they tell us little about a semantic model's ability to support inference.",
        "In this paper, we propose a general framework for evaluating distributional semantic models that build sentence representations, and suggest two evaluation methods that test the notion of structurally invariant inference directly.",
        "Both rely on determining whether sentences express the same semantic relation between entities, a crucial step in solving a wide variety of inference tasks like recognizing textual entailment, information retrieval, question answering, and summarization.",
        "The first evaluation is a relation classification task, where a semantic model is tested on its ability to recognize whether a pair of sentences both contain a particular semantic relation, such as Company X acquires Company Y.",
        "The second task is a question answering task, the goal of which is to locate the sentence in a document that contains the answer.",
        "Here, the semantic model must match the question, which expresses a proposition with a missing argument, to the answer-bearing sentence which contains the full proposition.",
        "We apply these new evaluation protocols to several recent distributional models, extending several of them to build sentence representations.",
        "We find that the models outperform a simple lemma overlap model only slightly, but that combining these models with the lemma overlap model can improve performance.",
        "This result is likely due to weaknesses in current models?",
        "ability to deal with issues such as named entities, coreference, and negation, which are not emphasized by existing evaluation methods, but it does suggest that distributional models of semantics can play a more central role in systems that require deep, precise inference."

        "Semantics The idea of compositionality has been central to understanding contemporary natural language semantics from an historiographic perspective.",
        "The idea is often credited to Frege, although in fact Frege had very little to say about compositionality that had not already been repeated since the time of Aristotle (Hodges, 2005).",
        "Our modern notion of compositionality took shape primarily with the work of Tarski (1956), who was actually arguing that a central difference between formal languages and natural languages is that natural language is not compositional.",
        "This in turn was the ?the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages,?",
        "that Richard Montague so famously rejected (Montague, 1974).",
        "Compositionality also features prominently in Fodor and Pylyshyn's (1988) rejection of early connection-ist representations of natural language semantics, which seems to have influenced Mitchell and Lapata (2008) as well.",
        "Logic-based forms of compositional semantics have long strived for syntactic invariance in meaning representations, which is known as the doctrine of the canonical form.",
        "The traditional justification for canonical forms is that they allow easy access to a knowledge base to retrieve some desired information, which amounts to a form of inference.",
        "Our work can be seen as an extension of this notion to distributional semantic models with a more general notion of representational similarity and inference.",
        "There are many regular alternations that semantics models have tried to account for such as passive or dative alternations.",
        "There are also many lexical paraphrases which can take drastically different syntactic forms.",
        "Take the following example from Poon and Domingos (2009), in which the same semantic relation can be expressed by a transitive verb or an attributive prepositional phrase: (1) Utah borders Idaho.",
        "Utah is next to Idaho.",
        "In distributional semantics, the original sentence similarity test proposed by Kintsch (2001) served as the inspiration for the evaluation performed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and most later work in the area.",
        "Intransitive verbs are given",
        "in the context of their syntactic subject, and candidate synonyms are ranked for their appropriateness.",
        "This method targets the fact that a synonym is appropriate for only some of the verb's senses, and the intended verb sense depends on the surrounding context.",
        "For example, burn and beam are both synonyms of glow, but given a particular subject, one of the synonyms (called the High similarity landmark) may be a more appropriate substitution than the other (the Low similarity landmark).",
        "So, if the fire is the subject, glowed is the High similarity landmark, and beamed the Low similarity landmark.",
        "Fundamentally, this method was designed as a demonstration that compositionality in computing phrasal semantic representations does not interfere with the ability of a representation to synthesize non-compositional collocation effects that contribute to the disambiguation of homographs.",
        "Here, word-sense disambiguation is implicitly viewed as a very restricted, highly lexicalized case of inference for selecting the appropriate disjunct in the representation of a word's meaning.",
        "Kintsch (2001) was interested in sentence similarity, but he only conducted his evaluation on a few hand-selected examples.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2008) conducted theirs on a much larger scale, but chose to focus only on this single case of syntactic combination, intransitive verbs and their subjects, in order to ?factor out inessential degrees of freedom?",
        "to compare their various alternative models more equitably.",
        "This was not necessary?using the same, sufficiently large, unbiased but syntactically heterogeneous sample of evaluation sentences would have served as an adequate control?and this decision furthermore prevents the evaluation from testing the desired invariance of the semantic representation.",
        "Other lexical evaluations suffer from the same problem.",
        "One uses the WordSim-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al. 2002), which contains human word pair similarity judgments that semantic models should reproduce.",
        "However, the word pairs are given without context, and homography is unaddressed.",
        "Also, it is unclear how reliable the similarity scores are, as different annotators may interpret the integer scale of similarity scores differently.",
        "Recent work uses this dataset mostly for parameter tuning.",
        "Another is the lexical paraphrase task of McCarthy and Navigli (2009), in which words are given in the context of the surrounding sentence, and the task is to rank a given list of proposed substitutions for that word.",
        "The list of substitutions as well as the correct rankings are elicited from annotators.",
        "This task was originally conceived as an applied evaluation of WSD systems, not an evaluation of phrase representations.",
        "Parsing accuracy has been used as a preliminary evaluation of semantic models that produce syntactic structure (Socher et al. 2010; Wu and Schuler, 2011).",
        "However, syntax does not always reflect semantic content, and we are specifically interested in supporting syntactic invariance when doing semantic inference.",
        "Also, this type of evaluation is tied to a particular grammar formalism.",
        "The existing evaluations that are most similar in spirit to what we propose are paraphrase detection tasks that do not assume a restricted syntactic context.",
        "Washtell (2011) collected human judgments on the general meaning similarity of candidate phrase pairs.",
        "Unfortunately, no additional guidance on the definition of ?most similar in meaning?",
        "was provided, and it appears likely that subjects conflated lexical, syntactic, and semantic relatedness.",
        "Dolan and Brockett (2005) define paraphrase detection as identifying sentences that are in a bidirectional entailment relation.",
        "While such sentences do support exactly the same inferences, we are also interested in the inferences that can be made from similar sentences that are not paraphrases according to this strict definition ?",

        "Also, compared to word similarity assessments or paraphrase elicitation, determining whether a sentence expresses a semantic relation is a much easier task cognitively for human judges.",

        "We have proposed an evaluation framework for distributional models of semantics which build phrase-and sentence-level representations, and instantiated two evaluation tasks which test for the crucial ability to recognize whether sentences express the same semantic relation.",
        "Our results demonstrate that compositional distributional models of semantics already have some utility in the context of more empirically complex semantic tasks than WSD-like lexical substitution tasks, in which compositional invariance is a requisite property.",
        "Simply computing lemma overlap, however, is a very competitive baseline, due to issues in these protocols with named entities and domain adaptivity.",
        "The better performance of the mixture models in Task 2 shows that such weaknesses can be addressed by hybrid semantic models.",
        "Future work should investigate more refined versions of such hybridization, as well as extend this idea to other semantic phenomena like coreference, negation and modality.",
        "We also observe that no single model or composition operator performs best for all tasks and datasets.",
        "The latent sense mixture model of Dinu and Lapata (2010) performs well in recognizing semantic relations in general web text.",
        "Because of the difficulty of adapting it to a specialized domain, however, it does less well in biomedical question answering, where the syntax-based model of Thater et al(2010) performs the best.",
        "A more thorough investigation of the factors that can predict the performance and/or invariance of a given composition operator is warranted.",
        "In the future, we would like to evaluate other models of compositional semantics that have been recently proposed.",
        "We would also like to collect more comprehensive test data, to increase the external validity of our evaluations."
