        "In Information Retrieval (IR) in general and Question Answering (QA) in particular, queries and relevant textual content often significantly differ in their properties and are therefore difficult to relate with traditional IR methods, e.g. keyword matching.",
        "In this paper we describe an algorithm that addresses this problem, but rather than looking at it on a term matching/term reformulation level, we focus on the syntactic differences between questions and relevant text passages.",
        "To this end we propose a novel algorithm that analyzes dependency structures of queries and known relevant text passages and acquires transformational patterns that can be used to retrieve relevant textual content.",
        "We evaluate our algorithm in a QA setting, and show that it outperforms a baseline that uses only dependency information contained in the questions by 300% and that it also improves performance of a state of the art QA system significantly."

        "It is a well known problem in Information Retrieval (IR) and Question Answering (QA) that queries and relevant textual content often significantly differ in their properties, and are therefore difficult to match with traditional IR methods.",
        "A common example is a user entering words to describe their information need that do not match the words used in the most relevant indexed documents.",
        "This work addresses this problem, but shifts focus from words to syntactic structures of questions and relevant pieces of text.",
        "To this end, we present a novel algorithm that analyses the dependency structures of known valid answer sentence and from these acquires patterns that can be used to more precisely retrieve relevant text passages from the underlying document collection.",
        "To achieve this, the position of key phrases in the answer sentence relative to the answer itself is an-alyzed and linked to a certain syntactic question type.",
        "Unlike most previous work that uses dependency paths for QA (see Section 2), our approach does not require a candidate sentence to be similar to the question in any respect.",
        "We learn valid dependency structures from the known answer sentences alone, and therefore are able to link a much wider spectrum of answer sentences to the question.",
        "The work in this paper is presented and evaluated in a classical factoid Question Answering (QA) setting.",
        "The main reason for this is that in QA suitable training and test data is available in the public domain, e.g. via the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), see for example (Voorhees, 1999).",
        "The methods described in this paper however can also be applied to other IR scenarios, e.g. web search.",
        "The necessary condition for our approach to work is that the user query is somewhat grammatically well formed; this kind of queries are commonly referred to as Natural Language Queries or NLQs.",
        "Table 1 provides evidence that users indeed search the web with NLQs.",
        "The data is based on two query sets sampled from three months of user logs from a popular search engine, using two different sampling techniques.",
        "The ?head?",
        "set samples queries taking query frequency into account, so that more common queries have a proportionally higher chance of being selected.",

        "As a result, rare and frequent queries have the same chance of being selected.",
        "Doubles are excluded from both sets.",
        "Table 1 lists the percentage of queries in the query sets that start with the specified word.",
        "In most contexts this indicates that the query is a question, which in turn means that we are dealing with an NLQ.",
        "Of course there are many NLQs that start with words other than the ones listed, so we can expect their real percentage to be even higher."

        "These inference rules are based on dependency paths, each of which connects two nouns.",
        "Their paths have the following form: N:subj:V?find?V:obj:N?solution?N:to:N This path represents the relation ?X finds a solution to Y?",

        "The candidate whose paths show the highest matching score is selected.",
        "(Shen and Klakow, 2006) also describe a method that is primarily based on similarity scores between dependency relation pairs.",

        "Unlike the related work described above, it acknowledges that a) a valid answer sentence's syntax might be very different for the question's syntax and b) several valid answer sentence structures, which might be completely independent from each other, can exist for one and the same question.",

        "As can be seen, on evaluation set 1 our method outperforms the baseline by 300%, on evaluation set 2 by 311%, taking accuracy if a pattern exists as a basis.",
        "Many of the papers cited earlier that use an approach similar to our baseline approach of course report much better results than Tables 7 and 8.",
        "This however is not too surprising as the approach",

        "It was a deliberate decision from our side not to use any of these approaches.",
        "After all, this would result in an experimental setup where the performance of our answer extraction strategy could not have been observed in isolation.",

        "This ranking is combined with the existing QA system's candidate ranking by simply using it as an additional feature that boosts candidates proportionally to their confidence score.",
