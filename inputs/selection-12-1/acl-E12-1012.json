        "This work proposes to adapt an existing general SMT model for the task of translating queries that are subsequently going to be used to retrieve information from a target language collection.",
        "In the scenario that we focus on access to the document collection itself is not available and changes to the IR model are not possible.",
        "We propose two ways to achieve the adaptation effect and both of them are aimed at tuning parameter weights on a set of parallel queries.",
        "The first approach is via a standard tuning procedure optimizing for BLEU score and the second one is via a reranking approach optimizing for MAP score.",
        "We also extend the second approach by using syntax-based features.",
        "Our experiments show improvements of 1-2.5 in terms of MAP score over the retrieval with the non-adapted translation.",
        "We show that these improvements are due both to the integration of the adaptation and syntax-features for the query translation task."

        "However, many of the content providers are not willing to change existing well-established document indexing and search tools, nor to provide access to their document collection by a third-party external service.",
        "The work presented in this paper assumes such a context of use, where a query translation service allows translating queries posed to the search engine of a content provider into several target languages, without requiring changes to the undelying IR system used and without accessing, at translation time, the content provider's document set.",
        "Keeping in mind these constraints, we present two approaches on query translation optimisation.",
        "One of the important observations done during the CLEF 2009 campaign (Ferro and Peters, 2009) related to CLIR was that the usage of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems (eg.",
        "Google Translate) for query translation led to important improvements in the cross-lingual retrieval performance (the best CLIR performance increased from ?55% of the monolingual baseline in 2008 to more than 90% in 2009 for French and German target languages).",
        "However, general-purpose SMT systems are not necessarily adapted for query translation.",
        "That is because SMT systems trained on a corpus of standard parallel phrases take into account the phrase structure implicitly.",
        "The structure of queries is very different from the standard phrase structure: queries are very short and the word order might be different than the typical full phrase one.",
        "This problem can be seen as a problem of genre adaptation for SMT, where the genre is ?query?.",
        "To our knowledge, no suitable corpora of parallel queries is available to train an adapted SMT system.",
        "Small corpora of parallel queries1 however can be obtained (eg.",
        "CLEF tracks) or manually created.",
        "We suggest to use such corpora in order to adapt the SMT model parameters for query translation.",
        "In our approach the parameters of the SMT models are optimized on the basis of the parallel queries set.",
        "This is achieved either directly in the SMT system using the MERT (Mini",
        "ing according to the BLEU2(Papineni et al. 2001) score, or via reranking the Nbest translation candidates generated by a baseline system based on new parameters (and possibly new features) that aim to optimize a retrieval metric.",
        "It is important to note that both of the proposed approaches allow keeping the MT system independent of the document collection and indexing, and thus suitable for a query translation service.",
        "These two approaches can also be combined by using the model produced with the first approach as a baseline that produces the Nbest list of translations that is then given to the reranking approach.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first present related work addressing the problem of query translation.",
        "We then describe two approaches towards adapting an SMT system to the query-genre: tuning the SMT system on a parallel set of queries (Section 3.1) and adapting machine translation via the reranking framework (Section 3.2).",

        "might also be explained by the small size of the test set (compared to a standard test set of 1000 full-sentences).",
        "Secondly, we looked at the weights of the features both in the baseline model (Europarl-tuned) and in the adapted model (CLEF-tuned), shown in Table 4.",
        "We are unsure how suitable the sizes of the CLEF tuning sets are, especially for the pairs involving English and French.",
        "Nevertheless we do observe and comment on some patterns.",
        "For the pairs involving English and German the distortion weight is much higher when tuning with CLEF data compared to tuning with Europarl data.",
        "The picture is reversed when looking at the two pairs involving English and French.",
        "This is to be expected if we interpret a high distortion weight as follows: ?it is not encouraged to place source words that are near to each other far away from each other in the translation?.",
        "Indeed, the local reorderings are much more frequent between English and French (e.g. white house = maison blanche), while the long-distance reorderings are more typcal between English and German.",
        "The word penalty is consistenly higher over all pairs when tuning with CLEF data compared to tuning with Europarl data.",
        "We could see an explanation for this pattern in the smaller size of the CLEF sentences if we interpret higher word penalty as a preference for shorter translations.",
        "This can be explained both with the smaller average size of the queries and with the specific query structure: mostly content words and fewer function words when compared to the full sentence.",
        "The language model weight is consistently though not drastically smaller when tuning with CLEF data.",
        "We suppose that this is due to the fact that a Europarl-base language model is not the best choice for translating query data.",
        "The reranking experiments include different features combinations.",
        "First, we experiment with the Moses features only in order to make this approach comparable with the first one.",
        "Secondly, we compare different syntax-based features combinations, as described in section 3.2.2.",
        "Thus, we compare the following reranking models (defined by the feature set): moses, lex (lexical coupling + moses features), lab (label-specific coupling + moses features), posmaplex (lexical PoS mapping + moses features ), lab-lex (label-specific coupling + lexical coupling + moses features), lab-lex-posmap (label-specific coupling + lexical coupling features + generic PoS mapping).",
        "To reduce the size of feature-functions vectors we take only the 20 most frequent features in the training data for Label-specific coupling and PoS mapping features.",
        "The computation of the syntax features is based on the rule-based XIP parser, where some heuristics specific to query processing have been integrated into English and French (but not German) grammars (Brun et al. 2012).",
        "The results of these experiments are illustrated",
        "baseline, T2: after reranking with lab-lex), MAP and 1-gramm BLEU scores for German-English.",
        "in Figure 1.",
        "To keep the figure more readable, we report only on 3-gramm BLEU scores.",
        "When computing the 5best MAP score, the order in the Nbest list is defined by a corresponding reranking model.",
        "Each reranking model is illustrated by a single horizontal red bar.",
        "We compare the reranking results to the baseline model (vertical line) and also to the results of the first approach (yellow bar labelled MERT:moses) on the same figure.",
        "First, we remark that the adapted models (query-genre tuning and reranking) outperform the baseline in terms of MAP (1best and 5 best) for French-English and German-English translations for most of the models.",
        "The only exception is posmaplex model (based on PoS tagging) for German which can be explained by the fact that the German grammar used for query processing was not adapted for queries as opposed to English and French grammars.",
        "However, we do not observe the same tendency for BLEU score, where only a few of the adapted models outperform the baseline, which confirms the hypothesis of the low correlation between BLEU and MAP scores in these settings.",
        "Table 5 gives some examples of the queries translations before (T1) and after (T2) reranking.",
        "These examples also illustrate different types of disagreement between MAP and 1 gramm BLEU5 score.",
        "The results for English-German and English-French look more confusing.",
        "This can be partly due to the more rich morphology of the target languages which may create more noise in the syntax structure.",
        "Reranking however improves over the 1-best MAP baseline for English-German, and 5-best MAP is also improved excluding the models involving PoS tagging for German (posmap, posmaplex, lab-lex-posmap).",
        "The results for English-French are more difficult to interpret.",
        "To find out the reason of such a behavior, we looked at the translations.",
        "We observed the following to-kenization problem for French: the apostrophe is systematically separated, e.g. ?d ?",
        "aujourd ?",
        "hui?.",
        "This leads to both noisy pre-retrieval preprocessing (eg.",
        "d is tagged as a NOUN) and noisy syntax-based feature values, which might explain the unstable results.",
        "Finally, we can see that the syntax-based features can be beneficial for the final retrieval quality: the models with syntax features can outperform the model basd on the moses features only.",
        "The syntax-based features leading to the most sta",
        "in yellow): the results of the tuning approach, other bars(in red): the results of the reranking approach.",
        "ble results seem to be lab-lex (combination of lexical and label-specific coupling): it leads to the best gains over 1-best and 5-best MAP for all language pairs excluding English-French.",
        "This is a surprising result given the fact that the underlying IR model doesn't take syntax into account in any way.",
        "In our opinion, this is probably due to the interaction between the pre-retrieval preprocessing (lemmatisation, PoS tagging) done with the linguistic tools which might produce noisy results when applied to the SMT outputs.",
        "The reranking with syntax-based features allows to choose a better-formed query for which the PoS tagging and lemmatisation tools produce less noise which leads to a better retrieval."
