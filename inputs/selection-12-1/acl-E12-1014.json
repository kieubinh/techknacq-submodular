        "Bilingual lexicon induction describes the class of algorithms that attempt to learn translations from monolingual corpora.",

        "Using large, unrelated English and German corpora (with 163m and 135m words) and a small German-English bilingual dictionary (with 22k entires), Rapp (1999) demonstrated that reasonably accurate translations could be learned for 100 German nouns that were not contained in the seed bilingual dictionary.",
        "His algorithm worked by (1) building a context vector representing an unknown German word by counting its co-occurrence with all the other words in the German monolingual corpus, (2) projecting this German vector onto the vector space of English using the seed bilingual dictionary, (3) calculating the similarity of this sparse projected vector to vectors for English words that were constructed using the English monolingual corpus, and (4) outputting the English words with the highest similarity as the most likely translations.",
        "A variety of subsequent work has extended the original idea either by exploring different measures of vector similarity (Fung and Yee, 1998) or by proposing other ways of measuring similarity beyond co-occurence within a context window.",
        "For instance, Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) demonstrated that word translations tend to co-occur in time across languages.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2002) used similarity in spelling as another kind of cue that a pair of words may be translations of one another.",
        "Garera et al(2009) defined context vectors using dependency relations rather than adjacent words.",
        "Bergsma and Van Durme (2011) used the visual similarity of labeled web images to learn translations of nouns.",
        "Additional related work on learning translations from monolingual corpora is discussed in Section 6.",
        "In this paper, we apply bilingual lexicon induction methods to statistical machine translation.",
        "Given the obvious benefits of not having to rely on scarce bilingual parallel training data, it is surprising that bilingual lexicon induction has not been used for SMT before now.",
        "There are several open questions that make its applicability to SMT uncertain.",
        "Previous research on bilingual lexicon induction learned translations only for a small number of high frequency words (e.g. 100",

        "Although previous work reported high translation accuracy, it may be misleading to extrapolate the results to SMT, where it is necessary to translate a much larger set of words and phrases, including many low frequency items.",
        "In a preliminary study, we plotted the accuracy of translations against the frequency of the source words in the monolingual corpus.",
        "Figure 2 shows the result for translations induced using contextual similarity (defined in Section 3.1).",
        "Unsurprisingly, frequent terms have a substantially better chance of being paired with a correct translation, with words that only occur once having a low chance of being translated accurately.1 This problem is exacerbated when we move to multi-token phrases.",
        "As with phrase translation features estimated from parallel data, longer phrases are more sparse, making similarity scores less reliable than for single words.",
        "Another impediment (not addressed in this paper) for using lexicon induction for SMT is the number of translations that must be learned.",
        "Learning translations for all words in the source language requires n2 vector comparisons, since each word in the source language vocabulary must",

        "By limiting ourselves to phrases in a phrase table, we vastly limit the search space of possible translations.",
        "This is an idealization because high quality translations are guaranteed to be present.",
        "However, as our lesion experiments in Section 5.1 show, a phrase table without accurate translation probability estimates is insufficient to produce high quality translations.",
