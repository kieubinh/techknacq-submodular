        "Since the objective of these models is to maximize the probability of the observed data, they have a tendency to explain only the most obvious and superficial aspects of a corpus.",
        "They effectively sacrifice performance on rare topics to do a better job in mod-eling frequently occurring words.",
        "The user is then left with a skewed impression of the corpus, and perhaps one that does not perform well in extrinsic tasks.",
