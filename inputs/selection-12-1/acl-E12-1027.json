        "We then proceed to extend existing solutions for the problem of temporal information processing with the information extracted this way.",
        "The improved performance of the resulting models shows that (i) aspectual type can be data-mined with unsupervised methods with a level of noise that does not prevent this information from being useful and that (ii) temporal information processing can profit from information about aspectual type."

        "Extracting the temporal information present in a text is relevant to many natural language processing applications, including question-answering, information extraction, and even document sum-marization, as summaries may be more readable if they follow a chronological order.",

        "TempEval (Verhagen et al. 2007), in 2007, and more recently TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al. 2010), in 2010, were concerned with this problem.",
        "Additionally, they provided data that can be used to develop and evaluate systems that can automatically temporally tag natural language text.",
        "These data are annotated according to the TimeML (Pustejovsky et al. 2003) scheme.",
        "Figure 1 shows a small and slightly simplified fragment of the data from TempEval, with TimeML annotations.",
        "There, event terms, such as the term referring to the event of releasing the tapes, are annotated using EVENT tags.",
        "States (such as the situations denoted by verbs like want or love) are also considered events.",
        "Temporal expressions, such as today, are enclosed in TIMEX3 tags.",
        "The attribute value of time expressions holds a normalized representation of the date or time they refer to (e.g. the word today denotes the date 1998-01-14 in this example).",
        "The TLINK elements at the end describe temporal relations between events and temporal expressions.",
        "For instance, the event of the plane going down is annotated as temporally preceding the date denoted by the temporal expression today.",
        "The major tasks of these two TempEval evaluation challenges were about guessing the type of temporal relations, i.e. the value of the relType attribute of the TLINK elements in Figure 1, all other annotations being given.",
        "Temporal relation classification is also the most interesting problem in temporal information processing.",
        "The other relevant tasks (identifying and normalizing temporal expressions and events) have a longer research history and show better evaluation results.",
        "TempEval was organized in three tasks (TempEval-2 has four additional ones, that are not relevant to this work): task A was concerned with classifying temporal relations holding between an event and a time mentioned in the same sentence (although they could be syntactically unrelated, as the temporal relation represented by the TLINK with the lid with the value l1 in Figure 1); task",

        "B focused on the temporal relation between events and the document's creation time, which is also annotated in TimeML (not shown in that Figure); and task C was about classifying the temporal relation between the main events of two consecutive sentences.",

        "Distinctions of aspectual type (also referred to as situation type, lexical aspect or Aktionsart) of the sort of Vendler (1967) and Dowty (1979) are expected to improve the existing solutions to the problem of temporal relation classification.",
        "The major aspectual distinctions are between (i) states (e.g. to hate beer, to know the answer, to own a car, to stink), (ii) processes, also called activities (to work, to eat ice cream, to grow, to play the piano), (iii) culminated processes, also called accomplishments (to paint a picture, to burn down, to deliver a sermon) and (iv) culminations, also called achievements (to explode, to win the game, to find the key).",
        "States and processes are atelic situations in that they do not make salient a specific instant in time.",
        "Culminated processes and culminations are telic situations: they have an intrinsic, instantaneous endpoint, called the culmination (e.g. in the case of to paint a picture, it is the moment when the picture is ready; in the case of to explode, it is the moment of the explosion).",
        "There are several reasons to think aspectual",
        "type is relevant to temporal information processing.",
        "First, these distinctions are related to how long events last: culminations are punctual, whereas states can be very prolonged in time.",
        "States are thus more likely to temporally overlap other temporal entities than culminations, for instance.",
        "Second, there are grammatical consequences on how events are anchored in time.",
        "Consider the following examples, from Ritchie (1979) and Moens and Steedman (1988): (1) When they built the 59th Street bridge, they used the best materials.",
        "(2) When they built that bridge, I was still a young lad.",
        "The situation of building the bridge is a culminated processed, composed by the process of actively building a bridge followed by the culmination of the bridge being finished.",
        "In sentence (1), the event described in the main clause (that of using the best materials) is a process, but in sentence (2) it is a state (the state of being a young lad).",
        "Even though the two clauses in each sentence are connected by when, the temporal relations holding between the events of each clause are different.",
        "On the one hand, in sentence (1) the event of using the best materials (a process) overlaps with the process of actively building the bridge and precedes the culmination of finishing the bridge.",
        "On the other hand, in sentence (2) the event of being a young lad (which is a state) overlaps with both the process of actively building the bridge and the culmination of the bridge being built.",
        "This difference is arguably caused by the different aspectual types of the main events of each sentence.",
        "As another example, states overlap with temporal location adverbials, as in (3), while culminations are included in them, as in (4).",
        "(3) He was happy last Monday.",
        "(4) He reached the top of Mount Everest last",
        "Monday.",
        "In other cases, differences in aspectual type can disambiguate ambiguous linguistic material.",
        "For instance, the preposition in is ambiguous as it can be used to locate events in the future but also to measure the duration of culminated processes; it is thus ambiguous with culminated processes, as in he will read the book in three days but not with other aspectual types, as in he will be living there in three days.",
        "A factor related to aspectual class, that is not trivial to account for, is the phenomenon of aspectual shift, or aspectual coercion (Moens and Steedman, 1988; de Swart, 1998; de Swart, 2000).",
        "Many linguistic contexts pose constraints on aspectual type.",
        "This does not mean, however, that clashes of aspectual type cause ungrammaticality.",
        "What often happens is that phrases associated with an incompatible aspectual type get their type changed in order to be of the required type, causing a change in meaning.",
        "For instance, the progressive construction combines with processes.",
        "When it combines with e.g. a culminated process, the culmination is stripped off from this culminated process, which is thus converted into a process.",
        "The result is that a sentence like (5) does not say that the bridge was finished (the event has no culmination), whereas one such as (6) does say this (the event has a culmination).",
        "(5) They were building that bridge.",
        "(6) They built that bridge.",
        "Aspectual type is not a property of just words, but phrases as well.",
        "For example, while the progressive construction just mentioned combines with processes, the resulting phrase behaves as a state (cf. the sentence When they built the 59th Street bridge, they were using the best materials and what was mentioned above about when clauses)."

        "This methodology is not perfect, since multiple occurrences of the queried expression in the same web page are not reflected in the hit count, and in many cases the hit counts reported by search engines are just estimates and might not be very accurate.",

        "These temporal relations relate an event (referred by the eventID attribute of TLINK elements) to another temporal entity, that can be a time (pointed to by the relatedToTime attribute), in the case of tasks A and B, or, in the case of task C, another event (given by the relatedToEvent attribute).",

        "In the case of task C, two features are added for each indicator, one for each event term.",
        "We extended each of these classifiers with one of these features at a time (two in the case of task C), and checked whether it improved the results on the test data.",
        "So for instance, in order to test Indicator S1, we extended each of these classifiers with a feature that encodes the value that this indicator presents for the term that denotes the event present in the temporal relation to be classified.",
        "In the case of task C, two classifier features are added, one for each event term, and both for the same Indicator S1.",
        "For instance, for the (training) instance corresponding to the TLINK in Figure 2 with the lid attribute that has the value l1, the classifier feature for Indicator S1 has the value that was computed for the verb cair ?go down?, since this is the stem of the word that denotes",

        "After adding each of these features, we retrained the classifiers on the training data and tested them on the held-out test data.",
        "In order to keep the evaluation manageable, we did not test combinations of multiple indicators.",
        "Table 3 shows the overall results.",
        "For task A, the best indicators were P4 (with JRip), A1 (NaiveBayes) and S1 (SMO).",
        "For task B the best one was P4 (KStar).",
        "For task C, the best indicators were P3 (J48), A1 and P3 (JRip),",
        "Each of the indicators S2, P1 and A2 either does not improve the results or does so but not as much as another, better indicator for the same task and algorithm.",
        "It seems clear from Table 3 that some tasks benefit from these indicators more than others.",
        "In particular, task C shows consistent improvements whereas task B is hardly affected.",
        "Since task C is about relations involving two events, the classifiers may be picking up the sort of linguistic generalizations mentioned in Section 2 about when clauses.",
        "J48 and JRip produce human-readable models.",
        "We checked how these classifiers are taking advantage of the aspectual indicators.",
        "For task C, the induced models are generally associating high",
        "values of the indicators A1 and P3 with overlap relations and low values of these indicators with other types of relations.",
        "This is expected.",
        "On the one end, high values for these indicators are associated with atelicity (i.e. the endpoint of the corresponding event is not presented).",
        "On the other hand, both indicators are based on queries containing the phrase durante muito tempo ?for a long time?, which, in addition to picking up events that can be modified by for adverbials, more specifically pick up events that happen for a long time and are thus likely to overlap other events.",
        "For task A, JRip also associates high values of the indicator P4?which constitute evidence that the corresponding events are processes (which are atelic)?with overlap relations.",
        "This is a specially interesting result, considering that the queries on which this indicator is based reflect a purely aspectual constraint."

      "heading": "6 Concluding Remarks",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we evaluated the relevance of information about aspectual type for temporal processing tasks.",
        "Temporal information processing has received substantial attention recently with the two TempEval challenges in 2007 and 2010.",
        "The most interesting problem of temporal information processing, that of temporal relation classification, is still affected by high error rates.",
        "Even though a very substantial part of the semantics literature on tense and aspect focuses on aspectual type, solutions to the problem of automatic temporal relation classification have not incorporated this sort of semantic information.",
        "In part this is expected, as aspectual type is very interconnected with syntax (cf. the discussion about aspectual coercion in Section 2), and the phenomenon of aspect shift can make it hard to compute even when syntactic information is available.",
        "Our contribution with this paper is to incorporate this sort of information in existing machine learned classifiers that tackle this problem.",
        "Even though these classifiers do not have access to syntactic information, aspectual type information seemed to be useful in improving the performance of these models.",
        "We hypothesize that combining aspectual type information with information about syntactic structure can further improve the problems of temporal information processing, but we leave that research to future work.",
        "An interesting question that we hope will be addressed by future work is how these results extend to other languages.",
        "We cannot provide an answer to this question, as we do not have the data.",
        "However, this experiment can be replicated for any language that has (i) TimeML annotated data, (ii) a reasonable size of documents on the Web and a search engine capable of separating them from the documents in other languages and (iii) an aspectual system similar enough that the question being addressed in this paper makes sense (and useful patterns for queries can be constructed, even if not entirely identical to the ones that we used).",
        "The second criterion is met by many, many languages.",
        "The third one also seems to affect many languages, as the existing literature on aspectual phenomena indicates that these phenomena are quite widespread.",
        "The second criterion is, at the moment, the hardest to fulfill as not many languages have data with rich annotations about time (i.e. including events and temporal relations).",
        "We speculate that our results can extend to English, although a different set of query patterns may have to be used in order to extract the aspectual indicators that are employed.",
        "We believe this because the two languages largely overlap when it comes to aspectual phenomena."
