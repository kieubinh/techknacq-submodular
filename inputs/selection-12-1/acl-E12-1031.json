        "People typically use color terms to describe the visual characteristics of objects, and certain col-ors often have strong associations with particular objects, e.g., blue - sky, white - snow.",
        "However, people also take advantage of color terms to strengthen their messages and convey emotions in natural interactions (Jacobson and Bender, 1996; Hardin and Maffi, 1997).",
        "Colors are both indicative of and have an effect on our feelings and emotions.",
        "Some colors are associated with positive emotions, e.g., joy, trust and admiration and some with negative emotions, e.g., aggressiveness, fear, boredom and sadness (Ortony et al. 1988).",
        "Given the importance of color and visual descriptions in conveying emotion, obtaining a deeper understanding of the associations between colors, concepts and emotions may be helpful for many tasks in language understanding and generation.",
        "A detailed set of color-concept-emotion associations (e.g., brown - darkness - boredom; red - blood - anger) could be quite useful for sentiment analysis, for example, in helping to understand what emotion a newspaper article, a fairy tale, or a tweet is trying to evoke (Alm et al. 2005; Mo-hammad, 2011b; Kouloumpis et al. 2011).",
        "Color-concept-emotion associations may also be useful for textual entailment, and for machine translation as a source of paraphrasing.",
        "Color-concept-emotion associations also have the potential to enhance human-computer interactions in many real-and virtual-world domains, e.g., online shopping, and avatar construction in gaming environments.",
        "Such knowledge may allow for clearer and hopefully more natural descriptions by users, for example searching for a sky-blue shirt rather than blue or light blue shirt.",
        "Our long term goal is to use color-emotionconcept associations to enrich dialog systems with information that will help them generate more appropriate responses to users?",
        "different emotional states.",
        "This work introduces a new lexicon of color-concept-emotion associations, created through crowdsourcing.",
        "We call this lexicon CLEX1.",
        "It is comparable in size to only two known lexicons: WORDNET-AFFECT (Strapparava and Val-itutti, 2004) and EMOLEX (Mohammad and Turney, 2010).",
        "In contrast to the development of these lexicons, we do not restrict our annotators to a particular set of emotions.",
        "This allows us to",
        "collect more linguistically rich color-concept annotations associated with mood, cognitive state, behavior and attitude.",
        "We also do not have any restrictions on color naming, which helps us to discover a rich lexicon of color terms and collocations that represent various hues, darkness, saturation and other natural language collocations.",
        "We also perform a comprehensive analysis of the data by investigating several questions including: What affect terms are evoked by a certain color, e.g., positive vs. negative?",
        "What concepts are frequently associated with a particular color?",
        "What is the distribution of part-of-speech tags over concepts and affect terms in the data collected without any preselected set of affect terms and concepts?",
        "What affect terms are strongly associated with a certain concept or a category of concepts and is there any correlation with a semantic orientation of a concept?",
        "Finally, we share our experience collecting the data using crowdsourcing, describe advantages and disadvantages as well as the strategies we used to ensure high quality annotations."
