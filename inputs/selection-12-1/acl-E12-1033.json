        "Opinion holder extraction is one of the most important subtasks in sentiment analysis.",
        "The extraction of sources of opinions is an essential component for complex real-life applications, such as opinion question answering systems or opinion summarization systems (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2011).",
        "Common approaches designed to extract opinion holders are based on data-driven methods, in particular supervised learning.",
        "In this paper, we examine the role of generalization for opinion holder extraction in both in-domain and cross-domain classification.",
        "Generalization may not only help to compensate the availability of labeled training data but also conciliate domain mismatches.",
        "In order to illustrate this, compare for instance",
        "(1) and (2).",
        "(1) Malaysia did not agree to such treatment of Al-Qaeda sol",
        "diers as they were prisoners-of-war and should be accorded treatment as provided for under the Geneva Convention.",
        "(2) Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development.",
        "Though both sentences contain an opinion holder, the lexical items vary considerably.",
        "However, if the two sentences are compared on the basis of some higher level patterns, some similarities become obvious.",
        "In both cases the opinion holder is an entity denoting a person and this entity is an agent1 of some predictive predicate (i.e. agree in (1) and wishes in (2)), more specifically, an expression that indicates that the agent utters a subjective statement.",
        "Generalization methods ideally capture these patterns, for instance, they may provide a domain-independent lexicon for those predicates.",
        "In some cases, even higher order features, such as certain syntactic constructions may vary throughout the different domains.",
        "In (1) and (2), the opinion holders are agents of a predictive predicate, whereas the opinion holder her daughters in (3) is a patient2 of embarrasses.",
        "(3) Mrs. Bennet does what she can to get Jane and Bingley to",
        "gether and embarrasses her daughters by doing so.",
        "If only sentences, such as (1) and (2), occur in the training data, a classifier will not correctly extract the opinion holder in (3), unless it obtains additional knowledge as to which predicates take opinion holders as patients.",
        "In this work, we will consider three different generalization methods being simple unsupervised word clustering, an induction method and the usage of lexical resources.",
        "We show that generalization causes significant improvements and that the impact of improvement depends on how much training and test data differ from each other.",
        "We also address the issue of opinion holders in patient position and present methods including a novel extraction method to detect these opinion holders without any labeled training data as standard datasets contain too few instances of them.",
        "In the context of generalization it is also important to consider different classification methods as the incorporation of generalization may have a varying impact depending on how robust the classifier is by itself, i.e. how well it generalizes even with a standard feature set.",

        "This corpus contains almost exclusively news texts.",
        "In order to divide it into different domains, we use the topic labels from (Stoyanov et al. 2004).",
        "By inspecting those topics, we found that many of them can grouped to a cluster of news items discussing human rights issues mostly in the context of combating global terrorism.",
        "This means that there is little point in considering every single topic as a distinct (sub)domain and, therefore, we consider this cluster as one single domain ETHICS.3 For our cross-domain evaluation, we want to have another topic that is fairly different from this set of documents.",
        "By visual inspection, we found that the topic discussing issues regarding the International Space Station would suit our purpose.",
        "It is henceforth called SPACE.",
        "In addition to these two (sub)domains, we chose some text type that is not even news text in order to have a very distant domain.",

        "Existing text collections containing product reviews (Kessler et al. 2010; Toprak et al. 2010), which are generally a popular resource for sentiment analysis, were not found suitable as they only contain few distinct opinion holders.",
        "We finally used a few summaries of fictional work (two Shakespeare plays and one novel by Jane Austen4) since their language is notably different from that of news texts and they contain a large number of different opinion holders (therefore opinion holder extraction is a meaningful task on this text type).",

        "Similar to the in-domain setting using few labeled training data, the incorporation of generalization increases both precision and recall.",
        "Moreover, a combination of generalization methods is better than just using one method on average, although Lexis again a fairly robust individual generalization method.",
        "Generalization is more effective in this setting than on the in-domain evaluation using all training data, in particular for CK, since the training and test data are much more different from each other and suitable generalization methods partly close that gap.",
        "There is a notable difference in precision between the SPACE-and FICTION-domain (and also the source domain ETHICS (Table 8)).",
        "We strongly assume that this is due to the distribution of opinion holders in those datasets (Table 1).",

        "The motivation for this is the following: The FICTION-domain is the only domain to have a significant proportion of opinion holders appearing as patients.",
        "We want to know how much of them can be recognized with the best out-of-domain classifier using training data with only very few instances of this type and what benefit the addition of using various RBs which have a clearer notion of these constructions brings about.",
        "Moreover, we already observed that the learning-based methods have a bias towards preserving a high precision and this may have as a consequence that the generalization features incorporated into CK will not receive sufficiently large weights.",
        "Unlike the SPACE-domain where a sufficiently high recall is already achieved with CK (presumably due to its stronger similarity towards the source domain) the FICTION-domain may be more severely affected by this bias and evidence from RB may compensate for this.",
