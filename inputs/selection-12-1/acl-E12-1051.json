        "Instance-level annotations correspond to factual knowledge that can be found in repositories extracted automatically from text (Banko et al. 2007; Wu and Weld, 2010) ?Contributions made during an internship at Google.",

        "The frequent occurrence of instances, relative to more abstract concepts, in Web documents and popular Web search queries (Barr et al. 2008; Li, 2010), is both an asset and a liability from the point of view of knowledge acquisition.",
        "On one hand, it makes instance-level annotations relatively easy to find, either from manually created resources (Remy, 2002; Bollacker et al. 2008), or extracted automatically from text (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "On the other hand, it makes concept-level annotations more difficult to acquire directly.",

        "may be immediate children of more general concepts (?Actors?",
        "), or transitive descendants of more general concepts (?Entertainers?).",
        "The hierarchy is not required to be a tree; in particular, a concept may have multiple parent concepts.",
        "The instance-level annotations may be created collaboratively by human contributors, or extracted automatically from Web documents or some other data source.",
        "Goal: Given the data sources, the goal is to determine to which concept c in the hierarchy H the arguments of the target concept-level annotation r should be attached.",
        "While the left argument of acted-in could attach to ?American Actors?, ?People from Kiev?, ?Entertainers?",
        "or ?People?, it is best attached to the concept ?Actors?.",

        "Intuitions and Challenges: Given instances such as milla jovovich that instantiate an argument of an annotation like acted-in, the conceptual hierarchy can be used to propagate the annotation upwards, from instances to their concepts, then in turn further upwards to more general concepts.",

        "While the intuitions seem clear, their inclusion in a working method faces a series of practical challenges.",
        "First, the data sources may be noisy.",
        "One form of noise is missing or erroneous",
        "instance-level annotations, which may artificially skew the distribution of matching instances towards a less than optimal region in the hierarchy.",
        "If the input annotations for acted-in are available almost exhaustively for all descendant instances of ?American Actors?, and are available for only a few of the descendant instances of ?Belgian Actors?, ?Italian Actors?",
        "etc., then the distribution over the hierarchy may incorrectly suggest that the left argument of acted-in is ?American Actors?",
        "rather than the more general ?Actors?.",
        "In another example, if virtually all instances that instantiate the left argument of the annotation won-award are mapped to the concept ?Award Winning Actors?, then it would be difficult to distinguish ?Award Winning Actors?",
        "from the more general ?Actors?",
        "or ?People?, as best concept to be computed for the annotation.",
        "Another type of noise is missing or erroneous edges in the hierarchy, which could artificially direct propagation towards irrelevant regions of the hierarchy, or prevent propagation from even reaching relevant regions of the hierarchy.",
        "For example, if the hierarchy incorrectly maps ?Actors?",
        "to ?Entertainment?, then ?Entertainment?",
        "and its ancestor concepts incorrectly become candidate concepts during propagation for the left argument of acted-in.",

        "to not have any children in the hierarchy, then ?Actors?",
        "would not even be reached and considered as a candidate concept during propagation.",

        "Note that, in the latter case, the MRR and DRR scores are equivalent to precision@1 scores.",
        "Several conclusions can be drawn from the results.",
        "First, as expected by definition of the scoring metrics, DRR scores are higher than the stricter MRR scores, as they give partial credit to concepts that, while not identical to the gold concepts, are still close approximations.",
        "This is particularly noticeable for the runs MAXENT and PERCEPTRON with raw-ratio features (4.6 and 4.8 times higher respectively).",
        "Second, among the baselines, INSTPERCENT is the most accurate, with the computed concepts identifying the gold concept strictly at rank 22 on average (for an MRR score 0.045), and loosely at an average of 4 steps away from the gold concept (for a DRR score of 0.224).",
        "Third, the accuracy of the learning algorithms varies with how the pairwise feature values are combined.",
        "Overall, raw-ratio feature values perform the worst, and scaled-ratio the best, with binary in-between.",
        "Fourth, the scores of the best experimental run, MAXENT with scaled-ratio features, are 0.430 (MRR) and 0.513 (DRR) over the top 20 computed concepts, and 0.245 (MRR) and 0.456 (DRR) when considering only the first concept.",
        "These scores correspond to the ranked list being less than one step away in the hierarchy.",
        "The very first computed concept exactly matches the gold concept in about one in four cases, and is slightly more than one step away from it.",
        "In comparison, the very first concept computed by the best baseline matches the gold concept in about one in 35 cases (0.029 MRR), and is about 6 steps away (0.173 DRR).",
        "The accuracies of the various learning algorithms (not shown) were also measured and correlated roughly with the MRR and DRR scores.",

        "are matched but 70% of ?Bushrangers?",

        "Such imbalances may be inherent to how annotations are added to Freebase: different human contributors may add new annotations to particular portions of Freebase, but miss other relevant portions.",

        "Of the more than 100K concepts in the hierarchy, 3479 are roots of subhierarchies that are mutually disconnected.",

        "In the worst case, the gold concept becomes disconnected, and thus will be missing from the set of candidate concepts compiled during propagation.",

        "This paper introduces a method to convert flat sets of instance-level annotations to hierarchically organized, concept-level annotations.",
        "The method determines the appropriate concept for a given semantic annotation in three stages.",
        "First, it propagates annotations upwards in the hierarchy, forming a set of candidate concepts.",
        "Second, it classifies each candidate concept as more or less appropriate than each other candidate concept within an annotation.",
        "Third, it ranks candidate concepts by the number of other concepts relative to which it is classified as more appropriate.",
        "Because the features are comparisons between concepts within a single semantic annotation, rather than considerations of individual concepts, the method is able to generalize across annotations, and can thus be applied to new, previously unseen annotations.",
        "Experiments demonstrate that, on average, the method is able to identify the concept of a given annotation's argument within one hierarchy edge of the gold concept.",
        "The proposed method can take advantage of existing work on open-domain information extraction.",
        "The output of such work is usually instance-level annotations, although often at surface level (non-disambiguated arguments) rather than semantic level (disambiguated arguments).",
        "After argument disambiguation (e.g., (Dredze et al., 2010)), the annotations can be used as input to determining concept-level annotations.",
        "Thus, the method has the potential to generalize any existing database of instance-level annotations to concept-level annotations."
