        "Computational lexicons providing accurate lexical-syntactic information, such as subcategorization frames (SCFs) are vital for many NLP applications involving parsing and word sense disambiguation.",
        "In parsing, SCFs have been successfully used to improve the output of statistical parsers (Klenner (2007), Deoskar (2008), Sigogne et al(2011)) which is particularly significant in high-precision domain-independent parsing.",
        "In word sense disambiguation, SCFs have been identified as important features for verb sense disambiguation (Brown et al. 2011), which is due to the correlation of verb senses and SCFs (Andrew et al. 2004).",
        "SCFs specify syntactic arguments of verbs and other predicate-like lexemes, e.g. the verb say",
        "takes two arguments that can be realized, for instance, as noun phrase and that-clause as in He says that the window is open.",
        "Although a number of freely available, large-scale and accurate SCF lexicons exist, e.g. COMLEX (Grishman et al. 1994), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2008) for English, availability and limitations in size and coverage remain an inherent issue.",
        "This applies even more to languages other than English.",
        "One particular approach to address this issue is the combination and integration of existing manually built SCF lexicons.",
        "Lexicon integration has widely been adopted for increasing the coverage of lexicons regarding lexical-semantic information types, such as semantic roles, selectional restrictions, and word senses (e.g., Shi and Mi-halcea (2005), the Semlink project2, Navigli and Ponzetto (2010), Niemann and Gurevych (2011), Meyer and Gurevych (2011)).",
        "Currently, SCFs are represented idiosyncratically in existing SCF lexicons.",
        "However, integration of SCFs requires a common, interoperable representation format.",
        "Monolingual SCF integration based on a common representation format has already been addressed by King and Crouch (2005) and just recently by Necsulescu et al.",
        "(2011) and Padro?",

        "The definition of an interoperable representation format according to an existing standard, such as the ISO",
        "prerequisite for reusing this format in different contexts, thus contributing to the standardization and interoperability of language resources.",
        "While LMF models exist that cover the representation of SCFs (see Quochi et al(2008), Buitelaar et al(2009)), their suitability for representing SCFs at a large scale remains unclear: neither of these LMF-models has been used for standardizing lexicons with a large number of SCFs, such as VerbNet.",
        "Furthermore, the question of their applicability to different languages has not been investigated yet, a situation that is complicated by the fact that SCFs are highly language-specific.",
        "The goal of this paper is to address these gaps for the two languages English and German by presenting a uniform LMF representation of SCFs for English and German which is utilized for the standardization of large-scale English and German SCF lexicons.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We present the LMF model Subcat-LMF, an LMF-compliant lexicon representation format featuring a uniform and very fine-grained representation of SCFs for English and German.",
        "Subcat-LMF is a subset of Uby-LMF (Eckle-Kohler et al. 2012), the LMF model of the large integrated lexical resource Uby (Gurevych et al. 2012).",
        "(2) We convert lexicons with large-scale SCF information to Subcat-LMF: the English VerbNet and two German lexicons, i.e., GermaNet (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002) and a subset of IMSlex3 (Eckle-Kohler, 1999).",
        "(3) We perform a comparison of these three lexicons regarding SCF coverage and SCF overlap, based on the standardized representation.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives a detailed description of Subcat-LMF and section 3 demonstrates its usefulness for representing and cross-lingually comparing large-scale English and German lexicons.",
        "Section 4 provides a discussion including related work and section 5 concludes."

        "While the LMF core package models a lexicon in terms of lexical entries, each of which is defined as the pairing of one to many forms and zero to many senses, the LMF extensions provide UML classes for different types of lexicon organization, e.g., covering the synset-based organization of WordNet and the class-based organization of VerbNet.",
        "The first step results in a set of UML classes that are associated according to the UML diagrams given in ISO LMF.",
        "In the second step, these UML classes may be enriched by attributes.",
        "While neither attributes nor their values are given by the standard, the standard states that both are to be linked to Data Categories (DCs) defined in a Data Category Registry (DCR) such as ISOCat.4 DCs that are not available in ISOCat may be defined and submitted for standardization.",

These are by far not sufficient to represent the fine-grained SCFs available in such large-scale lexicons as VerbNet.",
        "In contrast, the Syntax part of Subcat-LMF comprises 58 DCs that are properly linked to ISOCat DCs; a number of DCs were missing in ISOCat, so we entered them ourselves.11 The majority of the attributes in Subcat-LMF are attached to the SyntacticArgument class.",
