        "Lexical-semantic resources (LSRs) are the foundation of many NLP tasks such as word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, question answering and information extraction.",
        "They are needed on a large scale in different languages.",
        "The growing demand for resources is met neither by the largest single expert-constructed resources (ECRs), such as WordNet and FrameNet, whose coverage is limited, nor by collaboratively constructed resources (CCRs), such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary, which encode lexical-semantic knowledge in a less systematic form than ECRs, because they are lacking expert supervision.",
        "Previously, there have been several independent efforts of combining existing LSRs to enhance their coverage w.r.t.",
        "their breadth and depth, i.e. (i) the number of lexical items, and (ii) the types of lexical-semantic information contained (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010b; Meyer and Gurevych, 2011).",
        "As these efforts often targeted particular applications, they focused on aligning selected, specialized information types.",
        "To our knowledge, no single work focused on modeling a wide range of ECRs and CCRs in multiple languages and a large variety of information types in a standardized format.",
        "Frequently, the presented model is not easily scalable to accommodate an open set of LSRs in multiple languages and the information mined automatically from corpora.",
        "The previous work also lacked the aspects of lexicon format standardization and API access.",
        "We believe that easy access to information in LSRs is crucial in terms of their acceptance and broad applicability in NLP.",
        "In this paper, we propose a solution to this.",
        "We define a standardized format for modeling LSRs.",
        "This is a prerequisite for resource interoperability and the smooth integration of resources.",
        "We employ the ISO standard Lexical Markup Framework (LMF: ISO 24613:2008), a metamodel for LSRs (Francopoulo et al. 2006), and Data Categories (DCs) selected from ISOCat.1 One of the main challenges of our work is to develop a model that is standard-compliant, yet able to express the information contained in diverse LSRs, and that in the long term supports the integration of the various resources.",
        "The main contributions of this paper can be",
        "summarized as follows: (1) We present an LMF-based model for large-scale multilingual LSRs called UBY-LMF.",
        "We model the lexical-semantic information down to a fine-grained level of information (e.g. syntactic frames) and employ standardized definitions of linguistic information types from ISOCat.",
        "(2) We present UBY, a large-scale LSR implementing the UBY-LMF model.",
        "UBY currently contains nine resources in two languages: English WordNet (WN, Fellbaum (1998), Wiktionary2 (WKT-en), Wikipedia3 (WP-en), FrameNet (FN, Baker et al(1998)), and VerbNet (VN, Kipper et al(2008)); German Wiktionary (WKT-de), Wikipedia (WP-de), and GermaNet (GN, Kunze and Lemnitzer (2002)), and the English and German entries of OmegaWiki4 (OW), referred to as OW-en and OW-de.",
        "OW, a novel CCR, is inherently multilingual ?",
        "its basic structure are multilingual synsets, which are a valuable addition to our multilingual UBY.",
        "Essential to UBY are the nine pairwise sense alignments between resources, which we provide to enable resource interoperability on the sense level, e.g. by providing access to the often complementary information for a sense in different resources.",
        "(3) We present a Java-API which offers unified access to the information contained in UBY.",
        "We will make the UBY-LMF model, the resource UBY and the API freely available to the research community.5 This will make it easy for the NLP community to utilize UBY in a variety of tasks in the future."

        "The work presented in this paper concerns standardization of LSRs, large-scale integration thereof at the representational level, and the unified access to lexical-semantic information in the integrated resources.",
        "Standardization of resources.",
        "Previous work includes models for representing lexical information relative to ontologies (Buitelaar et al. 2009; McCrae et al. 2011), and standardized single",
        "McCrae et al(2011) propose LEMON, a conceptual model for lexicalizing ontologies as an extension of the LexInfo model (Buitelaar et al. 2009).",
        "LEMON provides an LMF-implementation in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is similar to UBY-LMF, as it also uses DCs from ISOCat, but diverges further from the standard (e.g. by removing structural elements such as the predicative representation class).",
        "While we focus on modeling lexical-semantic information comprehensively and at a fine-grained level, the goal of LEMON is to support the linking between ontologies and lexicons.",
        "This goal entails a task-targeted application: domain-specific lexicons are extracted from ontology specifications and merged with existing LSRs on demand.",
        "As a consequence, there is no available large-scale instance of the LEMON model.",
        "Soria et al(2009) define WordNet-LMF, an LMF model for representing wordnets used in the KYOTO project, and Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) do this for GN, the German wordnet.",
        "These models are similar, but they still present different implementations of the LMF meta-model, which hampers interoperability between the resources.",
        "We build upon this work, but extend it significantly: UBY goes beyond modeling a single ECR and represents a large number of both ECRs and CCRs with very heterogeneous content in the same format.",
        "Also, UBY-LMF features deeper modeling of lexical-semantic information.",
        "Henrich and Hinrichs (2010), for instance, do not explicitly model the argument structure of subcategorization frames, since each frame is represented as a string.",
        "In UBY-LMF, we represent them at a fine-grained level necessary for the transparent modeling of the syntax-semantics interface.",
        "Large-scale integration of resources.",
        "Most previous research efforts on the integration of resources targeted at world knowledge rather than lexical-semantic knowledge.",
        "Well known examples are YAGO (Suchanek et al. 2007), or DBPedia (Bizer et al. 2009).",
        "Atserias et al(2004) present the Meaning Multilingual Central Repository (MCR).",
        "MCR integrates five local wordnets based on the Interlingual Index of EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998).",
        "The overall goal of the work is to improve word sense disambiguation.",
        "This work is similar to ours, as it",
        "aims at a large-scale multilingual resource and includes several resources.",
        "It is however restricted to a single type of resource (wordnets) and features a single type of lexical information (semantic relations) specified upon synsets.",
        "Similarly, de Melo and Weikum (2009) create a multilingual wordnet by integrating wordnets, bilingual dictionaries and information from parallel corpora.",
        "None of these resources integrate lexical-semantic information, such as syntactic subcategorization or semantic roles.",
        "McFate and Forbus (2011) present NULEX, a syntactic lexicon automatically compiled from WN, WKT-en and VN.",
        "As their goal is to create an open-license resource to enhance syntactic parsing, they enrich verbs and nouns in WN with inflection information from WKT-en and syntactic frames from VN.",
        "Thus, they only use a small part of the lexical information present in WKT-en.",
        "Padro?",
        "et al(2011) present their work on lexicon merging within the Panacea Project.",
        "One goal of Panacea is to create a lexical resource development platform that supports large-scale lexical acquisition and can be used to combine existing lexicons with automatically acquired ones.",
        "To this end, Padro?",
        "et al(2011) explore the automatic integration of subcategorization lexicons.",
        "Their current work only covers Spanish, and though they mention the LMF standard as a potential data model, they do not make use of it.",
        "Shi and Mihalcea (2005) integrate FN, VN and WN, and Palmer (2009) presents a combination of Propbank, VN and FN in a resource called SEM-LINK in order to enhance semantic role labeling.",
        "Similar to our work, multiple resources are integrated, but their work is restricted to a single language and does not cover CCRs, whose popularity and importance has grown tremendously over the past years.",
        "In fact, with the exception of NULEX, CCRs have only been considered in the sense alignment of individual resource pairs (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010a; Meyer and Gurevych, 2011).",
        "API access for resources.",
        "An important factor to the success of a large, integrated resource is a single public API, which facilitates the access to the information contained in the resource.",
        "The most important LSRs so far can be accessed using various APIs, for instance the Java WordNet API,6 or the Java-based Wikipedia API.7 With a stronger focus of the NLP community on sharing data and reproducing experimental results these tools are becoming important as never before.",
        "Therefore, a major design objective of UBY is a single API.",
        "This is similar in spirit to the motivation of Pradhan et al(2007), who present integrated access to corpus annotations as a main goal of their work on standardizing and integrating corpus annotations in the OntoNotes project.",
        "To summarize, related work focuses either on the standardization of single resources (or a single type of resource), which leads to several slightly different formats constrained to these resources, or on the integration of several resources in an idiosyncratic format.",
        "CCRs have not been considered at all in previous work on resource standardization, and the level of detail of the modeling is insufficient to fully accommodate different types of lexical-semantic information.",
        "API access is rarely provided.",
        "This makes it hard for the community to exploit their results on a large scale.",
        "Thus, it diminishes the impact that these projects might achieve upon NLP beyond their original specific purpose, if their results were represented in a unified resource and could easily be accessed by the community through a single public API."

        "LMF defines a metamodel of LSRs in the Unified Modeling Language (UML).",
        "It provides a number of UML packages and classes for modeling many different types of resources, e.g. wordnets and multilingual lexicons.",
        "The design of a standard-compliant lexicon model in LMF involves two steps: in the first step, the structure of the lexicon model has to be defined by choosing a combination of the LMF core package and zero to many extensions (i.e. UML packages).",
        "In the second step, these UML classes are enriched by attributes.",
        "To contribute to semantic interoperability, it is essential for the lexicon model that the attributes and their values refer to Data Categories (DCs) taken from a reference repository.",
        "DCs are standardized specifications of the terms that are used for attributes and their values, or in other words, the linguistic vocabulary occurring",
        "in a lexicon model.",

        "In WN, on the contrary, a lexeme is an abstract pairing of meaning and form.",
        "According to LMF, the DCs are to be selected from ISOCat, the implementation of the ISO 12620 Data Category Registry (DCR, Broeder et al(2010)), resulting in a Data Category Selection (DCS).",

        "We have designed UBY-LMF8 as a model of the union of various heterogeneous resources, namely WN, GN, FN, and VN on the one hand and CCRs on the other hand.",
        "Two design principles guided our development of UBY-LMF: first, to preserve the information available in the original resources and to uniformly represent it in UBY-LMF.",
        "Second, to be able to extend UBY in the future by further languages, resources, and types of linguistic information, in particular, alignments between different LSRs.",
        "Wordnets, FN and VN are largely complementary regarding the information types they provide, see, e.g. Baker and Fellbaum (2009).",
        "Accordingly, they use different organizational units to represent this information.",
        "Wordnets, such as WN and GN, primarily contain information on lexical-semantic relations, such as synonymy, and use synsets (groups of lexemes that are synonymous) as organizational units.",
        "FN focuses on groups of lexemes that evoke the same prototypical situation (so-called semantic frames, Fillmore (1982)) involving semantic roles (so-called frame elements).",
        "VN, a large-scale verb lexicon, is organized in Levin-style verb classes (Levin, 1993) (groups of verbs that share the same syntactic alternations and semantic roles) and provides rich subcategorization frames including semantic roles and a specification of semantic predicates.",
        "UBY-LMF employs several direct subclasses of Lexicon in order to account for the various organization types found in the different LSRs considered.",
        "While the LexicalEntry class reflects the traditional headword-based lexicon organiza",
        "posed of syntactic arguments, while SemanticPredicate is composed of semantic arguments.",
        "The linking between syntactic and semantic arguments is represented by the SynSemCorrespondence class.",
        "The SenseAxis class is very important in UBY-LMF, as it connects the different source LSRs.",
        "Its role is twofold: first, it links the corresponding word senses from different languages, e.g. English and German.",
        "Second, it represents monolingual sense alignments, i.e. sense alignments between different lexicons in the same language.",
        "The latter is a novel interpretation of SenseAxis introduced by UBY-LMF.",
        "The organization of lexical-semantic knowledge found in WP, WKT, and OW can be modeled with the classes in UBY-LMF as well.",
        "WP primarily provides encyclopedic information on nouns.",
        "It mainly consists of article pages which are modeled as Senses in UBY-LMF.",
        "WKT is in many ways similar to traditional dictionaries, because it enumerates senses under a given headword on an entry page.",
        "Thus, WKT entry pages can be represented by LexicalEntries and WKT senses by Senses.",
        "OW is different from WKT and WP, as it is organized in multilingual synsets.",
        "To model OW in UBY-LMF, we split the synsets per language and included them as monolingual Synsets in the corresponding Lexicon (e.g., OW-en or OW-de).",
        "The original multilingual information is preserved by adding a SenseAxis between corresponding synsets in OW-en and OW-de.",
        "The LMF standard itself contains only few linguistic terms and does neither specify attributes nor their values.",
        "Therefore, an important task in developing UBY-LMF has been the specification of attributes and their values along with the proper attachment of attributes to LMF classes.",
        "In particular, this task involved selecting DCs from ISOCat and, if necessary, adding new DCs to ISOCat.",
        "Extensions in UBY-LMF.",
        "Although UBY-LMF is largely compliant with LMF, the task of building a homogeneous lexicon model for many highly heterogeneous LSRs led us to extend LMF in several ways: we added two new classes and several new relationships between classes.",
        "First, we were facing a huge variety of lexical-semantic labels for many different dimensions of",
        "semantic classification.",
        "Examples of such dimensions include ontological type (e.g. selectional restrictions in VN and FN), domain (e.g.",
        "Biology in WN), style and register (e.g. labels in WKT, OW), or sentiment (e.g. sentiment of lexical units in FN).",
        "Since we aim at an extensible LMF-model, capable of representing further dimensions of semantic classification, we did not squeeze the information on semantic classes present in the considered LSRs into existing LMF classes.",
        "Instead, we addressed this issue by introducing a more general class, SemanticLabel, which is an optional subclass of Sense, SemanticPredicate, and SemanticArgument.",
        "This new class has three attributes, encoding the name of the label, its type (e.g. ontological, register, sentiment), and a numeric quantification (e.g. sentiment strength).",
        "Second, we attached the subclass Frequency to most of the classes in UBY-LMF, in order to encode frequency information.",
        "This is of particular importance when using the resource in machine learning applications.",
        "This extension of the standard has already been made in WordNet-LMF (Soria et al. 2009).",
        "Currently, the Frequency class is used to keep corpus frequencies for lexical units in FN, but we plan to use it for enriching many other classes with frequency information in future work, such as Senses or SubcategorizationFrames.",
        "Third, the representation of FN in LMF required adding two new relationships between LMF classes: we added a relationship between SemanticArgument and Definition, in order to represent the definitions available for frame elements in FN.",
        "In addition, we added a relationship between the Context class and the MonoLingualExternalRef, to represent the links to annotated corpus sentences in FN.",
        "Finally, WKT turned out to be hard to tackle, because it contains a special kind of ambiguity in the semantic relations and translation links listed for senses: the targets of both relations and translation links are ambiguous, as they refer to lemmas (word forms), rather than to senses (Meyer and Gurevych, 2010).",
        "These ambiguous relation targets could not directly be represented in LMF, since sense and translation relations are defined between senses.",
        "To resolve this, we added a relationship between SenseRelation and FormRepresentation, in order to encode the ambiguous WKT relation target as a word form.",
        "Disambiguating the WKT relation targets to infer the target sense is left to future work.",
        "A related issue occurred, when we mapped WN to LMF.",
        "WN encodes morphologically related forms as sense relations.",
        "UBY-LMF represents these related forms not only as sense relations (as in WordNet-LMF), but also at the morphological level using the RelatedForm class from the LMF Morphology extension.",
        "In LMF, however, the RelatedForm class for morphologically related lexemes is not associated with the corresponding sense in any way.",
        "Discarding the WN information on the senses involved in a particular morphological relation would lead to information loss in some cases.",
        "Consider as an example the WN verb buy (purchase) which is derivationally related to the noun buy, while on the other hand buy (accept as true, e.g.",
        "I can't buy this story) is not derivationally related to the noun buy.",
        "We addressed this issue by adding a sense attribute to the RelatedForm class.",
        "Thus, in extension of LMF, UBY-LMF allows sense relations to refer to a form relation target and morphological relations to refer to a sense relation target.",
        "Data Categories in UBY-LMF.",
        "We encountered large differences in the availability of DCs in ISOCat for the morpho-syntactic, lexical-syntactic, and lexical-semantic parts of UBY-LMF.",
        "Many DCs were missing in ISOCat and we had to enter them ourselves.",
        "While this was feasible at the morpho-syntactic and lexical-syntactic level, due to a large body of standardization results available, it was much harder at the lexical-semantic level where standardization is still ongoing.",
        "At the lexical-semantic level, UBY-LMF currently allows string values for a number of attribute values, e.g. for semantic roles.",
        "We can easily integrate the results of the ongoing standardization efforts into UBY-LMF in the future."

        "To support this task for a large number of resources across languages, we have designed a flexible alignment framework based on the state-of-the-art method of Niemann and Gurevych (2011).",
        "The framework is generic in order to allow alignments between different kinds of entities as found in different resources, e.g. WN synsets, FN frames or WP articles.",
        "The only requirement is that the individual entities are distinguishable by a unique identifier in each resource.",
        "The alignment consists of the following steps: First, we extract the alignment candidates for a given resource pair, e.g. WN sense candidates for a WKT-en entry.",
        "Second, we create a gold standard by manually annotating a subset of candidate pairs as ?valid?",
        "or ?non-valid?.",
        "Then, we extract the sense representations (e.g. lemmatized bag-of-words based on glosses) to compute the similarity of word senses (e.g. by cosine similarity).",
        "The gold standard with corresponding similarity values is fed into Weka (Hall et al. 2009) to train a machine learning classifier, and in the final step this classifier is used to automatically classify the candidate sense pairs as (non-)valid alignment.",
        "Our framework also allows us to train on a combination of different similarity measures.",
        "Using our framework, we were able to reproduce the results reported by Niemann and Gurevych (2011) and Meyer and Gurevych (2011) based on the publicly available evaluation datasets10 and the configuration details reported in the corresponding papers.",

        "is translated into {Schiff, Wasserfahrzeug} and ?Ein Fahrzeug fu?r Wassertransport?, and then the candidate extraction and all downstream steps can take place in German.",
        "An inherent problem with this approach is that incorrect translations also lead to invalid alignment candidates.",

        "The created gold standard could, for instance, be reused to evaluate alignments for other languages in OW.",
        "To compute the similarity of word senses, we followed the approach by Niemann and Gurevych (2011) while covering both translation directions.",
        "We used the cosine similarity for comparing the German OW glosses with the German translations of WN glosses and cosine and personalized page rank (PPR) similarity for comparison of the German OW glosses translated into English with the original English WN glosses.",
        "Note that PPR similarity is not available for German as it is based on WN.",
        "Thereby, we filtered out the OW concepts without a German gloss which left us with 11,806 unique candidate pairs.",
        "We randomly selected 500 WN synsets for analysis yielding 703 candidate pairs.",
        "These were manually annotated as being (non-)alignments.",
        "For the subsequent machine learning task we used a simple threshold-based classifier and tenfold cross validation.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the results of different system configurations.",
        "We observe that translation",
        "into English works significantly better than into German.",
        "Also, the more elaborate similarity measure PPR yields better results than cosine similarity, while the best result is achieved by a combination of both.",
        "Niemann and Gurevych (2011) make a similar observation for the monolingual setting.",
        "Our F-measure of 0.717 in the best configuration lies between the results of Meyer and Gurevych (2011) (0.66) and Niemann and Gurevych (2011) (0.78), and thus verifies the validity of the machine translation approach.",
