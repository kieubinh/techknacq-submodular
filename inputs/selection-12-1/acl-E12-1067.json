        "Unsupervised morphological segmentation of a text involves learning rules for segmenting words into their morphemes.",

        "For example, the word respectively is split into morphemes respect, ive and ly.",
        "Many fields, such as machine translation, information retrieval, speech recognition etc., require morphological segmentation since new words are always created and storing all the word forms will require a massive dictionary.",
        "The task is even more complex, when morphologically complicated languages (i.e. agglutinative languages) are considered.",
        "The sparsity problem is more severe for more morphologically complex languages.",
        "Applying morphological segmentation mitigates data sparsity by tackling the issue with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "In this paper, we propose a paradigmatic approach.",
        "A morphological paradigm is a pair (StemList, SuffixList) such that each concatenation of Stem+Suffix (where Stem ? StemList and Suffix ? SuffixList) is a valid word form.",
        "The learning of morphological paradigms is not novel as there has already been existing work in this area such as Goldsmith (2001), Snover et al(2002), Monson et al(2009), Can and Manandhar (2009) and Dreyer and Eisner (2011).",
        "However, none of these existing approaches address learning of the hierarchical structure of paradigms.",
        "Hierarchical organisation of words help capture morphological similarities between words in a compact structure by factoring these similarities through stems, suffixes or prefixes.",
        "Our inference algorithm simultaneously infers latent variables (i.e. the morphemes) along with their hierarchical organisation.",
        "Most hierarchical clustering algorithms are single-pass, where once the hierarchical structure is built, the structure does not change further.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: section 2 gives the related work, section 3 describes the probabilistic hierarchical clustering scheme, section 4 explains the morphological segmentation model by embedding it into the clustering scheme and describes the inference algorithm along with how the morphological segmentation is performed, section 5 presents the experiment settings along with the evaluation scores, and finally section 6 presents a discussion with a comparison with other systems that participated in Morpho Challenge 2009 and 2010 ."
