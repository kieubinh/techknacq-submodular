        "The fact that natural language allows messages to be conveyed in a great variety of ways constitutes an important difficulty for NLP, with applications in both text analysis and generation.",
        "The term paraphrase is now commonly used in the NLP litterature to refer to textual units of equivalent meaning at the phrasal level (including single words).",
        "For instance, the phrases six months and half a year form a paraphrase pair applicable in many different contexts, as they would appropriately denote the same concept.",
        "Although one can envisage to manually build high-coverage lists of synonyms, enumerating meaning equivalences at the level of phrases is too daunting a task for humans.",
        "Because this type of knowledge can however greatly benefit many NLP applications, automatic acquisition of such paraphrases has attracted a lot of attention (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010; Madnani and Dorr, 2010), and significant research efforts have been devoted to this objective (Callison-Burch, 2007; Bhagat, 2009; Madnani, 2010).",
        "Central to acquiring paraphrases is the need of assessing the quality of the candidate paraphrases produced by a given technique.",
        "Most works to date have resorted to human evaluation of paraphrases on the levels of grammaticality and meaning equivalence.",
        "Human evaluation is however often criticized as being both costly and non reproducible, and the situation is even more complicated by the inherent complexity of the task that can produce low inter-judge agreement.",
        "Task-based evaluation involving the use of paraphrasing into some application thus seem an acceptable solution, provided the evaluation methodologies for the given task are deemed acceptable.",
        "This, in turn, puts the emphasis on observing the impact of paraphrasing on the targeted application and is rarely accompanied by a study of the intrinsic limitations of the paraphrase acquisition technique used.",
        "The present work is concerned with the task of sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition from pairs of related sentences.",
        "A large variety of techniques have been proposed that can be applied to this task.",
        "They typically make use of different kinds of automatically or manually acquired knowledge.",
        "We make the hypothesis that their performance can be increased if candidate para",
        "phrases can be validated using information that characterize paraphrases in complement to the set of techniques that proposed them.",
        "We propose to implement this as a bi-class classification problem (i.e. paraphrase vs. not paraphrase), allowing any paraphrase acquisition technique to be easily integrated into the combination system.",
        "In this article, we report experiments on two languages, English and French, with 5 individual techniques based on a) statistical word alignment models, b) translational equivalence, c) handcoded rules of term variation, d) syntactic similarity, and e) edit distance on word sequences.",
        "We used parallel monolingual parallel corpora obtained via multiple translation from a single language as our sources of related sentences, and a large set of features including surface to contextual similarity measures.",
        "Relative improvements in F-measure close to 18% are obtained on both languages over the best performing techniques.",
        "The remainder of this article is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly review previous work on sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition in section 2.",
        "We then describe our experimental setting in section 3 and the individual techniques that we have studied in section 4.",
        "Section 5 is devoted to our approach for validating paraphrases proposed by individual techniques.",

        "classification A natural improvement to the naive combination of paraphrase candidates from all techniques can consist in validating candidate paraphrases by using several models that may be good indicators of their paraphrasing status.",
        "We can therefore cast our problem as one of biclass classification (i.e. ?paraphrase?",
        "vs. ?not paraphrase?).",
        "We have used a maximum entropy classifier11 with the following features, aiming at capturing information on the paraphrase status of a candidate pair: Morphosyntactic equivalence (POS) It may be the case that some sequences of part-of-speech can be rewritten as different sequences, e.g. as a result of verb nominalization.",
        "We therefore use features to indicate the sequences of part-of-speech for a pair of candidate paraphrases.",
        "We used the preterminal symbols of the syntactic trees of the parser used for SYNT.",
        "Character-based distance (CAR) Morphological variants often have close word forms, and more generally close word forms in sentential paraphase pairs may indicate related words.",
        "We used features for discretized values of the edit distance between the two phrases of a candidate paraphrase pair as measured by the Levenshtein distance.",
        "Stem similarity (STEM) Inflectional morphology, which is quite productive in languages such as French, can increase vocabulary size significantly, while in sentential paraphrases common stems may indicate related words.",
        "We used a binary feature indicating whether the stemmed phrases of a candidate paraphrase pair match.12 Token set identity (BOW) Syntactic rearrangements may involve the same sets of words in various orders.",
        "We used discretized features indicating the proportion of common tokens in the set",
        "snowball.tartarus.org of tokens for the two phrases of a candidate paraphrase pair.",
        "Context similarity (CTXT) It can be derived from the distributionality hypothesis that the more two phrases will be seen in similar contexts, the more they are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "We used discretized features indicating how similar the contexts of occurrences of two paraphrases are.",
        "For this, we used the full set of bilingual English-French data available for the translation task of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation13, totalling roughly 30 million parallel sentences: this again ensures that the same resources are used for experiments in the two languages.",
        "We collect all occurrences for the phrases in a pair, and build a vector of content words cooccurring within a distance of 10 words from each phrase.",
        "We finally compute the cosine between the vectors of the two phrases of a candidate paraphrase pair.",
        "Relative position in a sentence (REL) Depending on the language in which parallel sentences are analyzed, it may be the case that sub-sentential paraphrases occur at close locations in their respective sentence.",
        "We used a discretized feature indicating the relative position of the two phrases in their original sentence.",
        "Identity check (COOC) We used a binary feature indicating whether one of the two phrases from a candidate pair, or the two, occurred at some other location in the other sentence.",
        "Phrase length ratio (LEN) We used a discretized feature indicating phrase length ratio.",
        "Source techniques (SRC) Finally, as our setting validates paraphrase candidates produced by a set of techniques, we used features indicating which combination of techniques predicted a paraphrase candidate.",
        "This can allow learning that paraphrases in the intersection of the predicted sets for some techniques may produce good results.",
        "We used a held out training set consisting of 150 sentential paraphrase pairs from the same corpora as our previous developement and test sets for both languages.",
        "Positive examples were taken from the candidate paraphrase pairs from any of",
        "the 5 techniques in our study which belong to the gold standard, and we used a corresponding number of negative examples (randomly selected) from candidate pairs not in the gold standard.",
        "The right part of Table 2 provides the results for our validation experiments of the union set for all previous techniques.",
        "We obtain our best results for this study using the output of our validation classifier over the set of all candidate paraphrase pairs.",
        "On French, it yields an improvement in F-measure (43.16) of +6.46 over the best individual technique (TERp) and of +15.63 over the naive union from all individual techniques.",
        "On English, the improvement in F-measure (45.37) is for the same conditions of respectively +6.91 (over TERp) and +13.66.",
        "We unfortunately observe an important decrease in recall over the naive union, of respectively -17.54 and -19.68 for French and English.",
        "Increasing our amount of training data to better represent the full range of paraphrase types may certainly overcome this in part.",
        "This would indeed be sensible, as better covering the variety of paraphrase types as a one-time effort would help all subsequent validations.",
        "Figure 2 shows how performance varies on French with number of training examples for various feature configurations.",
        "However, some paraphrase types will require integration of more complex knowledge, as is the case, for instance, for paraphrase pairs involving some anaphora and its antecedent (e.g. China?",
        "it).",
        "While these results, which are very comparable for the two languages studied, are already satisfying given the complexity of our task, further inspection of false positives and negatives may help us to develop additional models that will help us obtain a better classification performance."

        "In this article, we have addressed the task of combining the results of sub-sentential paraphrase ac-quition from parallel monolingual corpora using a large variety of techniques.",
        "We have provided justifications for using highly parallel corpora consisting of multiply translated sentences from a single language.",
        "All our experiments were conducted on both English and French using comparable resources, so although the results cannot be directly compared they give some acceptable comparison points.",
        "The best recall of any individual technique is around 45 for both language,",
        "moving features individually.",
        "and F-measure in the range 36-38, indicating that the task under study is a very challenging one.",
        "Our validation strategy based on bi-class classification using a broad set of features applicable to all candidate paraphrase pairs allowed us to obtain a 18% relative improvement in F-measure over the best individual technique for both languages.",
        "Our future work include performing a deeper error analysis of our current results, to better comprehend what characteristics of paraphrase still defy current validation.",
        "Also, we want to investigate adding new individual techniques to provide so far unseen candidates.",
        "Another possible approach would be to submit all pairs of sub-sentential paraphrase pairs from a sentence pair to our validation process, which would obviously require some optimization and devising sensible heuristics to limit time complexity.",
        "We also intend to collect larger corpora for all other corpus types appearing in Table 1 and conducting anew our acquisition and validation tasks."
