      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "The task of surface realization, especially in a relatively free word order language like German, is only partially determined by hard syntactic constraints.",
        "The space of alternative realizations that are strictly speaking grammatical is typically considerable.",
        "Nevertheless, for any given choice of lexical items and prior discourse context, only a few realizations will come across as natural and will contribute to a coherent text.",
        "Hence, any NLP application involving a non-trivial generation step is confronted with the issue of soft constraints on grammatical alternatives in one way or another.",
        "There are countless approaches to modelling these soft constraints, taking into account their interaction with various aspects of the discourse context (givenness or salience of particular referents, prior mentioning of particular concepts).",
        "Since so many factors are involved and there is further interaction with subtle semantic and pragmatic differentiations, lexical choice, stylistics and presumably processing factors, theoretical accounts making reliable predictions for real corpus examples have for a long time proven elusive.",
        "As for German, only quite recently, a number of corpus-based studies (Filippova and Strube, 2007; Speyer, 2005; Dipper and Zinsmeister, 2009) have made some good progress towards a coherence-oriented account of at least the left edge of the German clause structure, the Vorfeld constituent.",
        "What makes the technological application of theoretical insights even harder is that for most relevant factors, automatic recognition cannot be performed with high accuracy (e.g., a coreference accuracy in the 70's means there is a good deal of noise) and for the higher-level notions such as the information-structural focus, interannotator agreement on real corpus data tends to be much lower than for core-grammatical notions (Poesio and Artstein, 2005; Ritz et al. 2008).",
        "On the other hand, many of the relevant discourse factors are reflected indirectly in properties of the sentence-internal material.",
        "Most notably, knowing the shape of referring expressions narrows down many aspects of givenness and salience of its referent; pronominal realizations indicate givenness, and in German there are even two variants of the personal pronoun (er and der) for distinguishing salience.",
        "So, if the generation task is set in such a way that the actual lexical choice, including functional categories such as determiners, is fully fixed (which is of course not always the case), one can take advantage of",
        "these reflexes.",
        "This explains in part the fairly high baseline performance of n-gram language models in the surface realization task.",
        "And the effect can indeed be taken much further: the discriminative training experiments of Cahill and Riester (2009) show how effective it is to systematically take advantage of asymmetry patterns in the mor-phosyntactic reflexes of the discourse notion of information status (i.e., using a feature set with well-chosen purely sentence-bound features).",
        "These observations give rise to the question: in the light of the difficulty in obtaining reliable discourse information on the one hand and the effectiveness of exploiting the reflexes of discourse in the sentence-internal material on the other ?",
        "can we nevertheless expect to gain something from adding sentence-external feature information?",
        "We propose two scenarios for adressing this question: first, we choose an approximative access to context information and relations between discourse referents ?",
        "lexical reiteration of head words, combined with information about their grammatical relation and topological positioning in prior sentences.",
        "We apply these features in a rich sentence-internal surface realisation ranking model for German.",
        "Secondly, we choose a more controlled scenario: we train a constituent ordering classifier based on a feature model that captures properties of discourse referents in terms of manually annotated coreference relations.",
        "As we get the same effect in both setups ?",
        "the sentence-external features do not improve over a baseline that captures basic morphosyntactic properties of the constituents ?",
        "we conclude that sentence-internal realisation is actually a relatively accurate predictor of discourse context, even more accurate than information that can be obtained from coreference and lexical chain relations."

        "The idea that the occurence of discourse referents in a text is a central aspect of discourse structure has been systematically pursued by Centering Theory (Grosz et al. 1995).",
        "Its most important notions are related to the realisation of discourse referents (i.e. described as ?centers?)",
        "and the way the centers are arranged in a sequence of utterances to make this sequence a coherent discourse.",
        "Another important concept is the ?ranking?",
        "of discourse referents which basically determines the prominence of a referent in a certain sentence and is driven by several factors (e.g. their grammatical function).",
        "For free word order languages like German, word order has been proposed as one of the factors that account for the ranking (Poesio et al., 2004).",
        "In a similar spirit, Morris and Hirst (1991) have proposed that chains of (related) lexical items in a text are an important indicator of text structure.",
        "Our main hypothesis was that it is possible to exploit these intuitions from Centering Theory and the idea of lexical chains for word order prediction.",
        "Thus, we expected that it would be easier to predict the position of a referent in a sentence if we have not only given its realisation in the current utterance but also its prominence in the previous discourse.",
        "Especially, we expected this intuition to hold for cases where the morpho-syntactic realisation of a constituent does not provide many clues.",
        "This is illustrated in Examples (1) and (2) which both exemplify the reiteration of a lexical item in two subsequent sentences, (reiteration is one type of lexical chain discussed in Morris and Hirst (1991)).",

        "are realised as bare proper nouns without an overt morphosyntactic clue indicating their discourse status.",
        "Beyond the simple presence of reitered items in sequences of sentences, we expected that it would be useful to look at the position and syntactic function of the previous mentions of a discourse referent.",
        "In Example (1), the reiterated item is first introduced in an embedded sentence and realised in the Vorfeld in the second utterance.",
        "In terms of centering, this transition would correspond to a topic shift.",
        "In Example (2), both instances are realised in the Vorfeld, such that the topic of the first sentence is carried over to the next.",
        "In Example (3), we illustrate a further type of lexical reiteration.",
        "In this case, two identical head nouns are realised in subsequent sentences, even though they refer to two different discourse referents.",
        "While this type of lexical chain is described as ?reiteration without identity of referents?",
        "by Morris and Hirst (1991), it would not be captured in Centering since this is not a case of strict coreference.",
        "On the other hand, lexical chains do not capture types of reiterated discourse referents that have distinct morpho-syntactic realisations, e.g. nouns and pronouns.",
        "Originally, we had the hypothesis that strict corefence information is more useful and accurate for word order prediction than rather loose lexical chains which conflate several types of referential and lexical relations.",

        "This suggests that sentence-internal realisation implicitly carries a lot of im-formation about discourse context.",

        "Although we should certainly not expect a computational model to achieve a perfect accuracy in the constituent ordering task ?",
        "even humans only agree to a certain extent in rating word order variants (Belz and Reiter, 2006; Cahill, 2009) ?",
        "the average accuracy in the 60's for prediction of Vorfeld occupance is still moderate.",
        "An obvious direction would be to further investigate more complex representations of discourse that take into account the relations between utterances, such as topic shifts.",
        "Moreover, it is not clear whether the effects we find for linearisation in this paper carry over to other levels of generation such as tactical generation where syntactic functions are not fully specified.",
        "In a broader perspective, our results underline the need for better formalisations of discourse that can be translated into features for large-scale applications such as generation."
