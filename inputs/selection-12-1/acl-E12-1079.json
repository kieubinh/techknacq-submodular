        "Over the past decade, the paradigm of information sharing in the web has shifted towards participatory and collaborative content production.",
        "Texts are no longer exclusively prepared by individuals and then shared with the community.",
        "They are increasingly created collaboratively by multiple authors and iteratively revised by the community.",
        "When researchers first conducted surveys on professional writers in the 1980s, they found that the collaborative writing process differs considerably from the way individual writing is done (Posner and Baecker, 1992).",
        "In joint writing, the writers have to externalize processes that are otherwise not made explicit, like the planning and the organization of the text.",
        "The authors have to communicate how the text should be written and what exactly it should contain.",
        "Today, many tools are available that support collaborative writing.",
        "A tool that has particularly taken hold is the Wiki, a web-based, asyn",
        "chronous co-authoring tool.",
        "A unique characteristic of Wikis is the documentation of the edit history which keeps track of every change that is made to a Wiki page.",
        "With this information, it is possible to reconstruct the writing process from the beginning to the end.",
        "Additionally, many Wikis offer their users a communication platform, the Talk pages, where they can discuss the ongoing writing process with other users.",
        "The most prominent example for a successful, large-scale Wiki is Wikipedia, a collaboratively created online encyclopedia, which has grown considerably since its launch in 2001, and contains a total of almost 20 million articles in 282 languages and dialects, as of Sept. 2011.",
        "As there is no editorial body that manages Wikipedia top-down, it is an open question how the huge online community around Wikipedia regulates and enforces standards of behavior and article quality.",
        "The user discussions on the article Talk pages might shed light on this issue and give an insight into the otherwise hidden processes of collaboration that, until now, could only be analyzed via interviews or group observations in experimental settings.",
        "The main goal of the present paper is to analyze the content of the discussion pages of the Simple English Wikipedia with respect to the dialog acts aimed at the coordination efforts for article improvement.",
        "Dialog acts, according to the classic speech act theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969), represent the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force, i.e. a dialog act label concisely characterizes the intention and the role of a contribution in a dialog.",
        "We chose the Simple English Wikipedia for our initial analysis, because we are able to obtain more representative results",
        "by covering almost 15% of all relevant Talk pages, as opposed to the much smaller fraction we could achieve for the English Wikipedia.",
        "The long-term goal of this work is to identify relations between contributions on the Talk pages and particular article edits.",
        "We plan to analyze the relation between article discussions and article content and identify the edits in the article revision history that react to the problems discussed on the Talk page.",
        "In combination with article quality assessment (Yaari et al., 2011), this opens up the possibility to identify successful patterns of collaboration which increase the article quality.",
        "Furthermore, our work will enable practical applications.",
        "By augmenting Wikipedia articles with the information derived from automatically labeled discussions, article readers can be made aware of particular problems that are being discussed on the Talk page ?behind the article?.",
        "Our primary contributions in this paper are: (1) an annotation schema for dialog acts reflecting the efforts for coordinating the article improvement; (2) the Simple English Wikipedia Discussion (SEWD) corpus, consisting of 100 segmented and annotated Talk pages which we make freely available for download; and (3) a dialog act classification pipeline that incorporates several state of the art machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques and achieves an average F1-score of .82 on our corpus."

        "The speech act theory was further systematized by Searle (1969), whose classification of illocutionary acts (Searle, 1976) is still used as a starting point for creating dialog act classification schemata for natural language processing.",
        "A well known, domain-and task-independent annotation schema is DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997).",
        "It was created as the standard annotation schema for dialog tagging on the utterance level by the Discourse Resource Initiative.",
        "It uses a four-dimensional tagset that allows arbitrary label combinations for each utterance.",
        "Jurafsky et al. (1997) augmented the DAMSL schema to fit the peculiarities of the Switchboard corpus.",
        "The resulting SWDB-DAMSL schema contained more than 220 distinct labels which have been clustered to 42 coarse grained labels.",
        "Both schemata have often been adapted for special purpose annotation tasks.",
        "With the rise of the social web, the amount of research analyzing user generated discourse substantially increased.",
        "In addition to analyzing web forums (Kim et al. 2010a), chats (Carpenter and Fujioka, 2011) and emails (Cohen et al. 2004), Wikipedia Talk pages have recently moved into the center of attention of the research community.",

        "They confirm the findings of Vie?gas et althat coordination requests occur most frequently in the discussions.",
        "Bender et al(2011) describe a corpus of 47 Talk pages which have been annotated for authority claims and alignment moves.",
        "With this corpus, the authors analyze how the participants in Wikipedia discussions establish their credibility and how they express agreement and disagreement towards other participants or topics.",
        "From a different perspective, Stvilia et al. (2008) analyze 60 discussion pages in regard to how information quality (IQ) in Wikipedia articles is assessed on the Talk pages and which types of IQ problems are identified by the community.",
        "They describe a Wikipedia IQ assessment model and map it to established frameworks.",
        "Furthermore, they provide a list of IQ problems along with related causal factors and necessary actions which has also inspired the design of our annotation schema.",

        "According to these guidelines, distinguished articles must be well-written in simple English, comprehensive, neutral, stable, accurate, verifiable and follow the Wikipedia style guidelines4.",
        "These criteria are the main points of reference in the discussions on the Talk pages.",
        "Discourse analysis, as it is performed in this paper, can be carried out on various levels, depending on what is regarded as the smallest unit of the discourse.",
        "In this work, we focus on turns, not on individual utterances, as we are interested in a coarse-grained analysis of the discourse-structure as a first step towards a finer-grained discourse analysis.",
        "We define a turn (or contribution) as the body of text that is added by an individual contributor in one or more revisions to a single discussion topic until another contributor edits the page.",

        "Therefore, we manually analyzed a set of thirty Talk pages from the Simple English Wikipedia to identify the types of article deficiencies that are discussed and the way article improvement is coordinated.",
        "We furthermore incorporated the findings from an information-scientific analysis of information quality in Wikipedia (Stvilia et al. 2008), which identifies twelve types of quality problems, like e.g.",
        "Accuracy, Completeness or Relevance.",
        "Our resulting tagset consists of 17 labels (cf. Table 1) which can be subdivided into four higher level categories: Article Criticism Denote comments that identify deficiencies in the article.",

        "Interpersonal Describe the attitude that is expressed towards other participants in the discussion and/or their comments.",
        "Since a single turn may consist of several utterances, it can consequently comprise multiple dialog acts.",
