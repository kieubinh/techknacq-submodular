        "A linguistic notion central to discourse processing is information status (IS).",
        "It describes the extent to which a discourse entity, which is typically referred to by noun phrases (NPs) in a dialogue, is available to the hearer.",
        "Different definitions of IS have been proposed over the years.",
        "In this paper, we adopt Nissim et als (2004) proposal, since it is primarily built upon Prince's (1992) and Eck-ert and Strube's (2001) well-known definitions, and is empirically shown by Nissim et alto yield an annotation scheme for IS in dialogue that has good reproducibility.1 Specifically, Nissim et al(2004) adopt a three-way classification scheme for IS, defining a discourse entity as (1) old to the hearer if it is known to the hearer and has previously been referred to in the dialogue; (2) new if it is unknown to her and 1It is worth noting that several IS annotation schemes have been proposed more recently.",
        "See Go?tze et al(2007) and Riester et al(2010) for details.",
        "has not been previously referred to; and (3) mediated (henceforth med) if it is newly mentioned in the dialogue but she can infer its identity from a previously-mentioned entity.",
        "To capture finer-grained distinctions for IS, Nissim et alallow an old or med entity to have a subtype, which subcat-egorizes an old or med entity.",
        "For instance, a med entity has the subtype set if the NP that refers to it is in a set-subset relation with its antecedent.",
        "IS plays a crucial role in discourse processing: it provides an indication of how a discourse model should be updated as a dialogue is processed incrementally.",
        "Its importance can be reflected in part in the amount of attention it has received in theoretical linguistics over the years (e.g., Halli-day (1976), Prince (1981), Hajic?ova?",
        "(1984), Vallduv??",
        "(1992), Steedman (2000)), and in part in the benefits it can potentially bring to NLP applications.",
        "One task that could benefit from knowledge of IS is identity coreference: since new entities by definition have not been previously referred to, an NP marked as new does not need to be resolved, thereby improving the precision of a coreference resolver.",
        "Knowledge of fine-grained or subcat-egorized IS is valuable for other NLP tasks.",
        "For instance, an NP marked as set signifies that it is in a set-subset relation with its antecedent, thereby providing important clues for bridging anaphora resolution (e.g., Gasperin and Briscoe (2008)).",
        "Despite the potential usefulness of IS in NLP tasks, there has been little work on learning the IS of discourse entities.",
        "To investigate the plausibility of learning IS, Nissim et al(2004) annotate a set of Switchboard dialogues with such information2 , and subsequently present a 2These and other linguistic annotations on the Switchboard dialogues were later released by the LDC as part of the NXT corpus, which is described in Calhoun et al(2010).",
        "rule-based approach and a learning-based approach to acquiring such knowledge (Nissim, 2006).",
        "More recently, we have improved Nissim's learning-based approach by augmenting her feature set, which comprises seven string-matching and grammatical features, with lexical and syntactic features (Rahman and Ng, 2011; henceforth R&N).",
        "Despite the improvements, the performance on new entities remains poor: an F-score of 46.5% was achieved.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to investigate fine-grained IS determination, the task of classifying a discourse entity as one of the 16 IS subtypes defined by Nissim et al(2004).3 Owing in part to the increase in the number of categories, fine-grained IS determination is arguably a more challenging task than the 3-class IS determination task that Nissim and R&N investigated.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first empirical investigation of automated fine-grained IS determination.",
        "We propose a knowledge-rich approach to fine-grained IS determination.",
        "Our proposal is motivated in part by Nissim's and R&N's poor performance on new entities, which we hypothesize can be attributed to their sole reliance on shallow knowledge sources.",
        "In light of this hypothesis, our approach employs semantic and world knowledge extracted from manually and automatically constructed knowledge bases, as well as coreference information.",
        "The relevance of coreference to IS determination can be seen from the definition of IS: a new entity is not coreferential with any previously-mentioned entity, whereas an old entity may.",
        "While our use of coreference information for IS determination and our earlier claim that IS annotation would be useful for coreference resolution may seem to have created a chicken-and-egg problem, they do not: since coreference resolution and IS determination can benefit from each other, it may be possible to formulate an approach where the two tasks can mutually bootstrap.",
        "We investigate rule-based and learning-based approaches to fine-grained IS determination.",
        "In the rule-based approach, we manually compose rules to combine the aforementioned knowledge sources.",
        "While we could employ the same knowledge sources in the learning-based approach, we chose to encode, among other knowledge sources, 3One of these 16 classes is the new type, for which no subtype is defined.",
        "For ease of exposition, we will refer to the new type as one of the 16 subtypes to be predicted.",
        "the handwritten rules and their predictions directly as features for the learner.",
        "In an evaluation on 147 Switchboard dialogues, our learning-based approach to fine-grained IS determination achieves an accuracy of 78.7%, substantially outperforming the rule-based approach by 21.3%.",
        "Equally importantly, when employing these linguistically rich features to learn Nissim's 3-class IS determination task, the resulting classifier achieves an accuracy of 91.7%, surpassing the classifier trained on R&N's state-of-the-art feature set by 8.8% in absolute accuracy.",
        "Improvements on the new class are particularly substantial: its F-score rises from 46.7% to 87.2%."

      "text": [
        "In Nissim et als (2004) IS classification scheme, an NP can be assigned one of three main types (old, med, new) and one of 16 subtypes.",
        "Below we will illustrate their definitions with examples, most of which are taken from Nissim (2003) or Nissim et als (2004) dataset (see Section 3).",
        "Old.",
        "An NP is marked is old if (i) it is coreferential with an entity introduced earlier, (ii) it is a generic pronoun, or (iii) it is a personal pronoun referring to the dialogue participants.",
        "Six subtypes are defined for old entities: identity, event, general, generic, ident generic, and relative.",
        "In Example 1, my is marked as old with subtype identity, since it is coreferent with I.",
        "(1) I was angry that he destroyed my tent.",
        "However, if the markable has a verb phrase (VP) rather than an NP as its antecedent, it will be marked as old/event, as can be seen in Example 2, where the antecedent of That is the VP put my phone number on the form.",
        "(2) They ask me to put my phone number on the form.",
        "That I think is not needed.",
        "Other NPs marked as old include (i) relative pronouns, which have the subtype relative; (ii) personal pronouns referring to the dialogue participants, which have the subtype general, and (iii) generic pronouns, which have the subtype generic.",
        "The pronoun you in Example 3 is an instance of a generic pronoun.",
        "(3) I think to correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyer out of it.",
        "Note, however, that in a coreference chain of generic pronouns, every element of the chain is",
        "assigned the subtype ident generic instead.",
        "Mediated.",
        "An NP is marked as med if the entity it refers to has not been previously introduced in the dialogue, but can be inferred from already-mentioned entities or is generally known to the hearer.",
        "Nine subtypes are available formed entities: general, bound, part, situation, event, set, poss, func value, and aggregation.",
        "General is assigned to med entities that are generally known, such as the Earth, China, and most proper names.",
        "Bound is reserved for bound pronouns, an instance of which is shown in Example 4, where its is bound to the variable of the universally quantified NP, Every cat.",
        "(4) Every cat ate its dinner.",
        "Poss is assigned to NPs involved in intra-phrasal possessive relations, including prenominal genitives (i.e., X's Y) and postnominal genitives (i.e., Y of X).",
        "Specifically, Y will be marked as poss if X is old or med; otherwise, Y will be new.",
        "For example, in cases like a friend's boat where a friend is new, boat is marked as new.",
        "Four subtypes, namely part, situation, event, and set, are used to identify instances of bridging (i.e., entities that are inferrable from a related entity mentioned earlier in the dialogue).",
        "As an example, consider the following sentences: (5a) He passed by the door of Jan's house and saw that the door was painted red.",
        "(5b) He passed by Jan's house and saw that the door was painted red.",
        "In Example 5a, by the time the hearer processes the second occurrence of the door, she has already had a mental entity corresponding to the door (after processing the first occurrence).",
        "As a result, the second occurrence of the door refers to an old entity.",
        "In Example 5b, on the other hand, the hearer is not assumed to have any mental representation of the door in question, but she can infer that the door she saw was part of Jan's house.",
        "Hence, this occurrence of the door should be marked as med with subtype part, as it is involved in a part-whole relation with its antecedent.",
        "If an NP is involved in a set-subset relation with its antecedent, it inherits themed subtype set.",
        "This applies to the NP the house payment in Example 6, whose antecedent is our monthly budget.",
        "(6) What we try to do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have the house payment.",
        "If an NP is part of a situation set up by a previously-mentioned entity, it is assigned the subtype situation, as exemplified by the NP a few horses in the sentence below, which is involved in the situation set up by John's ranch.",
        "(7) Mary went to John's ranch and saw that there were only a few horses.",
        "Similar to old entities, an NP marked as med may be related to a previously mentioned VP.",
        "In this case, the NP will receive the subtype event, as exemplified by the NP the bus in the sentence below, which is triggered by the VP traveling in Miami.",
        "(8) We were traveling in Miami, and the bus was very full.",
        "If an NP refers to a value of a previously mentioned function, such as the NP 30 degrees in Example 9, which is related to the temperature, then it is assigned the subtype func value.",
        "(9) The temperature rose to 30 degrees.",
        "Finally, the subtype aggregation is assigned to coordinated NPs if at least one of the NPs involved is not new.",
        "However, if all NPs in the coordinated phrase are new, the phrase should be marked as new.",
        "For instance, the NP My son and I in Example 10 should be marked as med/aggregation.",
        "(10) I have a son ... My son and I like to play chess after dinner.",
        "New.",
        "An entity is new if it has not been introduced in the dialogue and the hearer cannot infer it from previously mentioned entities.",
        "No subtype is defined for new entities.",
        "There are cases where more than one IS value is appropriate for a given NP.",
        "For instance, given two occurrences of China in a dialogue, the second occurrence can be labeled as old/identity (because it is coreferential with an earlier NP) or med/general (because it is a generally known entity).",
        "To break ties, Nissim (2003) define a precedence relation on the IS subtypes, which yields a total ordering on the subtypes.",
        "Since all the old subtypes are ordered before their med counterparts in this relation, the second occurrence of China in our example will be labeled as old/identity.",

        "The motivations behind having a rule-based approach are two-fold.",

        "Reporting results using these two ways of obtaining chains facilitates the comparison of the IS determination results that we can realistically obtain using existing coreference technologies against those that we could obtain if we further improved existing coreference resolvers.",
        "Note that both sources provide identity coreference chains.",
        "Specifically, the gold chains were annotated for NPs belonging to old/identity and old/ident generic.",
        "Hence, these chains can be used to distinguish between old/general NPs and old/ident generic NPs, because the former are not part of a chain whereas the latter are.",
        "However, they cannot be used to distinguish between old/general entities and old/generic entities, since neither of them belongs to any chains.",
        "As a result, when gold chains are used, Rule 1 will classify all occurrences of ?you?",
        "that are not part of a chain as old/general, regardless of whether the pronoun is generic.",
        "While the gold chains alone can distinguish old/general and old/ident generic NPs, the Stanford chains cannot distinguish any of the old subtypes in the absence of other knowledge sources, since it generates chains for all old NPs regardless of their subtypes.",
        "This implies that Rule 1 and several other rules are only a very crude approximation of the definition of the corresponding IS subtypes.",
        "The rules for the remaining old subtypes can be interpreted similarly.",
        "A few points deserve mention.",
        "First, many rules depend on the string of the NP under consideration (e.g., ?they?",
        "in Rule 2 and ?whatever?",
        "in Rule 4).",
        "The decision of which strings are chosen is based primarily on our inspection of the training data.",
        "Hence, these rules are partly data-driven.",
        "Second, these rules should be applied in the order in which they are shown.",
        "For instance, though not explicitly stated, Rule 3 is only applicable to the non-anaphoric ?you?",
        "and ?they?",
        "pronouns, since Rule 2 has already covered their anaphoric counterparts.",

        "For convenience, we identify part-whole relations in Rule 12 based on the output produced by ReVerb (Fader et al. 2011), an open information extraction system.",
        "The output contains, among other things, relation instances, each of which is represented as a triple, <A,rel,B>, where rel is a relation, and A and B are its arguments.",
        "To pre-process the output, we first identify all the triples that are instances of the part-whole relation using regular expressions.",
        "Next, we create clusters of relation arguments, such that each pair of arguments in a cluster has a part-whole relation.",
        "This is easy: since part-whole is a transitive relation (i.e., <A,part,B> and <B,part,C> implies <A,part,C>), we cluster the arguments by taking the transitive closure of these relation instances.",

        "Specifically, row 1 shows their accuracy, which is defined as the percentage of correctly classified instances.",
        "For each approach, we present results that are generated based on gold coreference chains as well as automatic chains computed by the Stanford resolver.",
        "As we can see, the rule-based approach achieves accuracies of 66.0% (gold coreference) and 57.4% (Stanford coreference), whereas the learning-based approach achieves accuracies of 86.4% (gold) and 78.7% (Stanford).",
        "In other words, the gold coreference results are better than the Stanford coreference results, and the learning-based results are better than the rule-based results.",
        "While perhaps neither of these results are surprising, we are pleasantly surprised by the extent to which the learned classifier outperforms the hand-crafted rules: accuracies increase by 20.4% and 21.3% when gold coreference and Stanford coreference are used, respectively.",
        "In other words, machine learning has ?transformed?",
        "a ruleset that achieves mediocre performance into a system that achieves relatively high performance.",
        "These results also suggest that coreference plays a crucial role in IS subtype determination: accuracies could increase by up to 7.7?8.6% if we solely improved coreference resolution performance.",
        "This is perhaps not surprising: IS and coreference can mutually benefit from each other.",
        "To gain additional insight into the task, we also show in rows 2?17 of Table 3 the performance on each of the 16 subtypes, expressed in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F).",
        "A few points deserve mention.",
        "First, in comparison to the rule-based approach, the learning-based approach achieves considerably better performance on almost all classes.",

        "As we can see in row 17, its F-score rises by about 30 points.",
        "These gains are accompanied by a simultaneous rise in recall and precision.",
        "In particular, recall increases by about 40 points.",
        "Now, recall from the introduc-to overfitting (by setting C to a small value) tends to yield poorer classification performance.",
        "The remaining learning parameters are set to their default values.",
        "tion that previous attempts on 3-class IS determination by Nissim and R&N have achieved poor performance on the new class.",
        "We hypothesize that the use of shallow features in their approaches were responsible for the poor performance they observed, and that using our knowledge-rich feature set could improve its performance.",
        "We will test this hypothesis at the end of this section.",
        "Other subtypes that are worth discussing are med/aggregation, med/func value, and med/poss.",
        "Recall that the rules we designed for these classes were only crude approximations, or, perhaps more precisely, simplified versions of the definitions of the corresponding subtypes.",
        "For instance, to determine whether an NP belongs to med/aggregation, we simply look for occurrences of ?and?",
        "and ?or?",
        "(Rule 9), whereas its definition requires that not all of the NPs in the coordinated phrase are new.",
        "Despite the over-simplicity of these rules, machine learning has enabled the available features to be combined in such a way that high performance is achieved for these classes (see rows 14?16).",
        "Also worth examining are those classes for which the hand-crafted rules rely on sophisticated knowledge sources.",
        "They include med/part, which relies on ReVerb; med/situation, which relies on FrameNet; and med/event, which relies on WordNet.",
        "As we can see from the rule-based results (rows 10?12), these knowledge sources have yielded rules that achieved perfect precision but low recall: 19.5% for part, 28.7% for situation, and 10.5 for event.",
        "Nevertheless, the learning algorithm has again discovered a profitable way to combine the available features, enabling the F-scores of these classes to increase by 35.1?50.6%.",
        "While most classes are improved by machine learning, the same is not true for old/event and med/bound, whose F-scores are 4.5% (row 3) and 5.1% (row 9), respectively, when Stanford coreference is employed.",
        "This is perhaps not surprising.",
        "Recall that the multi-class SVM classifier was trained to maximize classification accuracy.",
        "Hence, if it encounters a class that is both difficult to learn and is under-represented, it may as well aim to achieve good performance on the easier-to-learn, well-represented classes at the expense of these hard-to-learn, under-represented classes.",
        "Feature analysis.",
        "In an attempt to gain additional insight into the performance contribution of each of the five types of features used in the learning-based approach, we conduct feature ablation experiments.",

        "For easy reference, the accuracy of the classifier trained on all types of features is shown in row 1 of the table.",
        "According to the paired t-test (p < 0.05), performance drops significantly whichever feature type is removed.",
        "This suggests that all five feature types are contributing positively to overall accuracy.",

        "important feature groups.",
        "To get a better idea of the utility of each feature type, we conduct another experiment in which we train five classifiers, each of which employs exactly one type of features.",
        "The accuracies of these classifiers are shown in Table 5.",
        "As we can see, the markables features have the smallest contribution, whereas unigrams have the largest contribution.",
        "Somewhat interesting are the results of the classifiers trained on the rule conditions: the rules are far more effective when gold coreference is used.",
        "This can be attributed to the fact that the design of the rules was based in part on the definitions of the subtypes, which assume the availability of perfect coreference information.",
        "Knowledge source analysis.",
        "To gain some insight into the extent to which a knowledge source or a rule contributes to the overall performance of the rule-based approach, we conduct ablation experiments: in each experiment, we measure the performance of the ruleset after removing a particular rule or knowledge source from it.",
        "Specifically, rows 2?4 of Table 6 show the accuracies of the ruleset after removing the memorization rule (Rule 17), the rule that uses ReVerb's output (Rule 12), and the cue words used in Rules 4 and 10, respectively.",
        "For easy reference, the accuracy of the original ruleset is shown in row 1 of the table.",
        "According to the paired t-test (p < 0.05), performance drops significantly in all three ablation experiments.",
        "This suggests that the memorization rule, ReVerb, and the cue words all contribute positively to the accuracy of the ruleset.",
        "IS type results.",
        "We hypothesized earlier that the poor performance reported by Nissim and R&N on identifying new entities in their 3-class IS classification experiments (i.e., classifying an NP as old, med, or new) could be attributed to their sole reliance on lexico-syntactic features.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we (1) train a 3-class classifier using the five types of features we employed in our learning-based approach, computing the features based on the Stanford coreference chains; and (2) compare its results against those obtained via the lexico-syntactic approach in R&N on our test set.",
        "Results of these experiments, which are shown in Table 7, substantiate our hypothesis: when we replace R&N's features with ours, accuracy rises from 82.9% to 91.7%.",
        "These gains can be attributed to large improvements in identifying new and med entities, for which F-scores increase by about 40 points and 10 points, respectively."
