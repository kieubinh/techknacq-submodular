        "However, annotation is also one of the most time-consuming and financially costly components of many NLP research efforts, and can place heavy demands on human annotators for maintaining annotation quality and consistency.",
        "Yet, modern annotation tools are generally technically oriented and many offer little support to users beyond the minimum required functionality.",
        "We believe that intuitive and user-friendly interfaces as well as the judicious application of NLP technology to support, not supplant, human judgements can help maintain the quality of annotations, make annotation more accessible to non-technical users such as subject ?These authors contributed equally to this work",

        "This was done by adding functionality for recognising standard user interface gestures familiar from text editors, presentation software, and many other tools.",
        "In BRAT, a span of text is marked for annotation simply by selecting it with the mouse by ?dragging?",

        "BRAT is browser-based and built entirely using standard web technologies.",
        "It thus offers a familiar environment to annotators, and it is possible to start using BRAT simply by pointing a standards-compliant modern browser to an installation.",
        "There is thus no need to install or distribute any additional annotation software or to use browser plug-ins.",
        "The use of web standards also makes it possible for BRAT to uniquely identify any annotation using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which enables linking to individual annotations for discussions in e-mail, documents and on web pages, facilitating easy communication regarding annotations."

        "BRAT is fully configurable and can be set up to support most text annotation tasks.",

        "either directed or undirected ?",

        "n-ary associations of annotations are also supported, allowing the annotation of event structures such as those targeted in the MUC (Sundheim, 1996), ACE (Doddington et al. 2004), and BioNLP (Kim et al. 2011) Information Extraction (IE) tasks (Figure 2).",
        "Additional aspects of annotations can be marked using attributes, binary or multivalued flags that can be added to other annotations.",
        "Finally, annotators can attach free-form text notes to any annotation.",
        "In addition to information extraction tasks, these annotation primitives allow BRAT to be configured for use in various other tasks, such as chunking (Abney, 1991), Semantic Role La-beling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005), and dependency annotation (Nivre, 2003) (See Figure 1 for examples).",
        "Further, both the BRAT client and server implement full support for the Unicode standard, which allow the tool to support the annotation of text using e.g. Chinese or Devana?gar??",

        "BRAT is distributed with examples from over 20 corpora for a variety of tasks, involving texts in seven different languages and including examples from corpora such as those introduced for the CoNLL shared tasks on language-independent named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) and multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "BRAT also implements a fully configurable system for checking detailed constraints on annotation semantics, for example specifying that a TRANSFER event must take exactly one of each of GIVER, RECIPIENT and BENEFICIARY arguments, each of which must have one of the types PERSON, ORGANIZATION or GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY, as well as a MONEY argument of type",
        "to the annotator MONEY, and may optionally take a PLACE argument of type LOCATION (LDC, 2005).",

        "However, human judgements cannot be replaced or based on a completely automatic analysis without some risk of introducing bias and reducing annotation quality.",

        "The reduction in the time spent in selecting the span is explained by the limiting of the number of candidate types exposed to the annotator, which were decreased from the original 54 to an average of 2.88 by the semantic class disambiguation component (Stenetorp et al. 2011a).",
