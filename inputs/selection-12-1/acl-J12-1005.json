        "Recent years have seen growing interest in the shallow semantic analysis of natural language text.",
        "The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatic identification and labeling of the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).",
        "Semantic roles themselves have a long-standing tradition in linguistic theory, dating back to the seminal work of Fillmore (1968).",
        "They describe the relations that hold between a predicate and its arguments, abstracting over surface syntactic configurations.",
        "Consider the following example sentences:",
        "(1) a.",
        "The burglar broke the window with a hammer.",
        "b.",
        "A hammer broke the window.",
        "c. The window broke.",
        "?",
        "Center for Computational Learning Systems, Columbia University, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 850,",
        "Here, the phrase the window occupies different syntactic positions?it is the object of break in sentences (1a) and (1b), and the subject in (1c)?and yet bears the same semantic role denoting the affected physical object of the breaking event.",
        "Analogously, hammer is the instrument of break both when attested with a prepositional phrase in (1a) and as a subject in (1b).",
        "The examples represent diathesis alternations1 (Levin 1993), namely, regular variations in the syntactic expressions of semantic roles, and their computational treatment is one of the main challenges faced by automatic semantic role labelers.",
        "Several theories of semantic roles have been proposed in the literature, differing primarily in the number and type of roles they postulate.",
        "These range from Fillmore's (1968) small set of universal roles (e.g., Agentive, Instrumental, Dative) to individual roles for each predicate (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).",
        "Frame semantic theory (Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003) occupies the middle ground by postulating situations (or frames) that can be evoked by different predicates.",
        "In this case, roles are not specific to predicates but to frames, and therefore ought to generalize among semantically related predicates.",
        "As an example, consider the sentences in Example (2): (2) a.",
        "[Lee]Agent [punched]CAUSE HARM [John]Victim [in the eye]Body part.",
        "b.",
        "[A falling rock]Cause [crushed]CAUSE HARM [my ankle]Body part.",
        "c. [She]Agent [slapped]CAUSE HARM [him]Victim [hard]Degree [for his change of mood]Reason.",
        "d. [Rachel]Agent [injured]CAUSE HARM [her friend]Victim [by closing the car door on his left hand]Means.",
        "Here, the verbs punch, crush, slap, and injure are all frame evoking elements (FEEs), that is, they evoke the CAUSE HARM frame, which in turn exhibits the frame-specific (or ?core?)",
        "roles Agent, Victim, Body part, and Cause, and the more general (?non-core?)",
        "roles Degree, Reason, and Means.",
        "A frame may be evoked by different lexical items, which may in turn inhabit several frames.",
        "For instance, the verb crush may also evoke the GRINDING frame, and slap the IMPACT frame.",
        "The creation of resources that document the realization of semantic roles in example sentences such as FrameNet (Fillmore, Johnson, and Petruck 2003) and PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) has greatly facilitated the development of learning algorithms capable of automatically analyzing the role semantic structure of input sentences.",
        "Moreover, the shallow semantic analysis produced by existing systems has been shown to benefit a wide spectrum of applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2003) and question answering (Shen and Lapata 2007), to machine translation (Wu and Fung 2009) and summarization (Melli et al. 2005).",
        "Most semantic role labeling (SRL) systems to date conceptualize the task as a supervised learning problem and rely on role-annotated data for model training.",
        "Supervised methods deliver reasonably good performance2 (F1 measures in the low 80s on standard test collections for English); however, the reliance on labeled training data, which is both difficult and highly expensive to produce, presents a major obstacle to the widespread application of semantic role labeling across different languages and text genres.",
        "And although nowadays corpora with semantic role annotations exist in",
        "Fu?rstenau and Lapata Semi-Supervised SRL via Structural Alignment other languages (e.g., German, Spanish, Catalan, Chinese, Korean), they tend to be smaller than their English equivalents and of limited value for modeling purposes.",
        "It is also important to note that the performance of supervised systems degrades considerably (by 10%) on out-of-domain data even within English, a language for which two major annotated corpora are available (Pradhan, Ward, and Martin 2008).",
        "And this is without taking unseen events into account, which unavoidably affect coverage.",
        "The latter is especially an issue for FrameNet (version 1.3) which is still under development, despite being a relatively large resource?it contains almost 140,000 annotated sentences for a total of 502 frames, which are evoked by over 5,000 different lexical units.",
        "Coverage issues involve not only lexical units but also missing frames and incompletely exemplified semantic roles.",
        "In this article, we attempt to alleviate some of these problems by using semi-supervised methods that make use of a small number of manually labeled training instances and a large number of unlabeled instances.",
        "Whereas manually labeled data are expensive to create, unlabeled data are often readily available in large quantities.",
        "Our approach aims to improve the performance of a supervised SRL system by enlarging its training set with automatically inferred annotations of unlabeled sentences.",
        "The key idea of our approach is to find novel instances for classifier training based on their similarity to manually labeled seed instances.",
        "The underlying assumption is that sentences that are similar in their lexical material and syntactic structure are likely to share a frame semantic analysis.",
        "The annotation of an unlabeled sentence can therefore be inferred from a sufficiently similar labeled sentence.",
        "For example, given the labeled sentence (3) and the unlabeled sentence (4), we wish to recognize that they are lexically and structurally similar; and infer that thumped also evokes the IMPACT frame, whereas the rest of his body and against the front of the cage represent the Impactor and Impactee roles, respectively.",
        "(3) [His back]Impactor [thudded]IMPACT [against the wall]Impactee.",
        "(4) The rest of his body thumped against the front of the cage.",
        "We formalize the detection of similar sentences and the projection of role annotations in graph-theoretic terms by conceptualizing the similarity between labeled and unlabeled sentences as a graph alignment problem.",
        "Specifically, we represent sentences as dependency graphs and seek an optimal (structural) alignment between them.",
        "Given this alignment, we then project annotations from the labeled onto the unlabeled sentence.",
        "Graphs are scored using a function based on lexical and syntactic similarity which allows us to identify alternations like those presented in Example (1) and more generally to obtain training instances with novel structure and lexical material.",
        "We obtain the best scoring graph alignment using integer linear programming, a general-purpose exact optimization framework.",
        "Importantly, our approach is not tied to a particular SRL system.",
        "We obtain additional annotations irrespective of the architecture or implementation details of the supervised role labeler that uses them.",
        "This renders our approach portable across learning paradigms, languages, and domains.",
        "After discussing related work (Section 2), we describe the details of our semi-supervised method (Section 3) and then move on to evaluate its performance (Section 4).",
        "We conduct two sets of experiments using data from the FrameNet corpus: In Section 5, we apply our method to increase the training data for known predicates, that is, words for which some seed annotations already exist.",
        "In Section 6, we focus on the complementary task of creating training instances for unknown predicates, that is, words that do not occur in the FrameNet corpus at all.",

        "As our algorithm produces novel annotated sentences, it could also be used to reduce annotation effort by offering automatically labeled sentences to humans to inspect and correct.",
        "The experiments presented here are limited to verbal categories and focus solely on English.",
        "In the future, we would like to examine whether our approach generalizes to other syntactic categories such as nouns, adjectives, and prepositions.",
        "An obvious extension also involves experiments with other languages.",
        "Experiments on the SALSA corpus (Burchardt et al. 2006) show that similar improvements can be obtained for German (Fu?rstenau 2011).",
        "Finally, the general formulation of our expansion framework allows its application to other tasks.",
        "Deschacht and Moens (2009) adapt our approach to augment subsets of the PropBank corpus and observe improvements over a supervised system for a small seed corpus.",
        "They also show that defining the lexical similarity measure in terms of Jensen?Shannon divergence instead of cosine similarity can additionally improve performance.",
        "Another possibility would be to employ our framework for the acquisition of paraphrases, for example, by extending the multiple-sequence alignment approach of Barzilay and Lee (2003) with our notion of graph alignments.",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to investigate how to reduce the dependency on full syntactic analyses, for example, by employing shallow parsers or chunkers.",
        "Appendix: Detailed Experimental Results In this appendix, we give complete results for the expansion experiments discussed in Sections 5 and 6.",
        "Asterisks in the tables indicate levels of significance.",
        "For simplicity, we only present two levels of significance, p < 0.05 with a single asterisk (*) and p < 0.001 with two asterisks (**).",
        "Significance tests for exact match and frame labeling accuracy were performed using McNemar's test.",
        "We used stratified shuffling Noreen (1989) to examine whether differences in labeled F1 were significant.12 Experiments on Known Predicates.",
        "The following table shows the performance of expanded classifiers when [1?6] automatically generated nearest neighbors (NN) are added to seed corpora containing [1?10] manually labeled sentences per verb.",
        "We report precision (Prec), recall (Rec), their harmonic mean (F1), and exact match (ExMatch; the proportion of sentences that receive entirely correct frame and role annotations).",
        "Some of these results were visualized in Figure 5.",
        " Experiments on Unknown Predicates.",
        "In the following, we show the performance of unexpanded and expanded classifiers when selecting among [1?5] frame candidates generated by the WordNet-based method.",
        "We report frame labeling accuracy, role labeling performance, and exact match scores.",
        "Asterisks indicate that the expanded classifier is significantly better than an unexpanded classifier choosing among the same number of candidates.",
        "For frame labeling accuracy, we additionally provide the results of the random baseline and an upper bound, which always chooses the correct frame if it is among the candidates.",
        "Some of these results were shown in Figure 9.",
        "For two candidates, the expanded classifier also performs significantly better than the best unexpanded classifier (i.e., the one given only one candidate) in terms of frame labeling accuracy, F1, and exact match (p < 0.05).",
        "In terms of exact match, it also performs significantly better for three candidates (p < 0.05), four candidates (p < 0.05), and five candidates (p < 0.001).",
        "Vector-based frame candidates.",
        "The following graphs show the performance of the unexpanded and expanded classifiers when frame candidates are selected by the vector-based method.",
        "The expanded classifiers significantly outperform the unexpanded ones in terms of frame labeling accuracy and role labeling F1 for [2?5] candidates (p < 0.001).",
        "For two candidates, frame labeling accuracy and role labeling F1 also significantly improve compared with the type-based approach of always choosing the first candidate (p < 0.001).",
        "For three candidates performance is significantly better only in terms of frame labeling accuracy (p < 0.05) but not F1."
