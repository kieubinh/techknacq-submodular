        "In computational linguistics, especially in information extraction and retrieval, it is of the utmost importance to distinguish between uncertain statements and factual information.",
        "In most cases, what the user needs is factual information, hence uncertain propositions should be treated in a special way: Depending on the exact task, the system should either ignore such texts or separate them from factual information.",
        "In machine translation, it is also necessary to identify linguistic cues of uncertainty because the source and the target language may differ in their toolkit to express uncertainty (one language uses an auxiliary, the other uses just a morpheme).",
        "To cite another example, in clinical document classification, medical reports can be grouped according to whether the patient definitely suffers, probably suffers, or does not suffer from an illness.",
        "There are several linguistic phenomena that are referred to as uncertainty in the literature.",
        "We consider propositions to which no truth value can be attributed, given the speaker's mental state, as instances of semantic uncertainty.",
        "In contrast, uncertainty may also arise at the discourse level, when the speaker intentionally omits some information from the statement, making it vague, ambiguous, or misleading.",
        "Determining whether a given proposition is uncertain or not may involve using a finite dictionary of linguistic devices (i.e., cues).",
        "Lexical cues (such as modal verbs or adverbs) are responsible for semantic uncertainty whereas discourse-level uncertainty may be expressed by lexical cues and syntactic cues (such as passive constructions) as well.",
        "We focus on four types of semantic uncertainty in this study and henceforth the term cuewill be taken to mean lexical cue.",
        "The key steps of recognizing semantically uncertain propositions in a natural language processing (NLP) application include the steps of locating lexical cues for uncertainty, disambiguating them (as not all occurrences of the cues indicate uncertainty), and finally linking them with the textual representation of the propositions in question.",
        "The linking of a cue to the textual representation of the proposition can be performed on the basis of syntactic rules that depend on the word class of the lexical cue, but they are independent of the actual application domain or text type where the cue is observed.",
        "The set of cues used and the frequency of their certain and uncertain usages are domain and genre dependent, however, and this has to be addressed if we seek to craft automatic uncertainty detectors.",
        "Here we interpret genre as the basic style and formal characteristics of the writing that is independent of its topic (e.g., scientific papers, newswire texts, or business letters), and domain as a particular field of knowledge and is related to the topic of the text (e.g., medicine, archeology, or politics).",
        "Uncertainty cue candidates do not display uncertainty in all of their occurrences.",
        "For instance, the mathematical sense of probable is dominant in mathematical texts whereas its ratio can be relatively low in papers in the humanities.",
        "The frequency of the two distinct meanings of the verb evaluate (which can be a synonym of judge [an",
        "Szarvas et al. Cross-Genre and Cross-Domain Detection of Semantic Uncertainty uncertain meaning] and calculate) is also different in the bioinformatics and cell biology",
        "domains.",
        "Compare: (1) To evaluateCUE the PML/RARalpha role in myelopoiesis, transgenic mice expressing PML/RARalpha were engineered.",
        "(2) Our method was evaluated on the Lindahl benchmark for fold recognition.",
        "In this article we focus on the domain-dependent aspects of uncertainty detection and we examine the recognition of uncertainty cues in context.",
        "We do not address the problem of linking cues to propositions in detail (see, e.g., Chapman, Chu, and Dowling [2007] and Kilicoglu and Bergler [2009] for the information extraction case).",
        "For the empirical investigation of the domain dependent aspects, data sets are required from various domains.",
        "To date, several corpora annotated for uncertainty have been constructed for different genres and domains (BioScope, FactBank, WikiWeasel, and MPQA, to name but a few).",
        "These corpora cover different aspects of uncertainty, however, being grounded on different linguistic models, which makes it hard to exploit cross-domain knowledge in applications.",
        "These differences in part stem from the varied application needs across application domains.",
        "Different types of uncertainty and classes of linguistic expressions are relevant for different domains.",
        "Although hypotheses and investigations form a crucial part of the relevant cases in scientific applications, they are less prominent in newswire texts, where beliefs and rumors play a major role.",
        "This finding motivates a more fine-grained treatment of uncertainty.",
        "In order to bridge the existing gaps between application goals, these typical cases need to be differentiated.",
        "A fine-grained categorization enables the individual treatment of each subclass, which is less dependent on domain differences than using one coarse-grained uncertainty class.",
        "Moreover, this approach enables each particular application to identify and select from a pool of models only those aspects of uncertainty that are relevant in the specific domain.",
        "As one of the main contributions of this study, we propose a uniform subcategorization of semantic uncertainty in which all the previous corpus annotation works can be placed, and which reveals the fundamental differences between the currently existing resources.",
        "In addition, we manually harmonized the annotations of three corpora and performed the fine-grained labeling according to the suggested subcategorization so as to be able to perform cross-domain experiments.",
        "An important factor in training robust cross-domain models is to focus on shallow features that can be reliably obtained for many different domains and text types, and to craft models that exploit the shared knowledge from different sources as much as possible, making the adaptation to new domains efficient.",
        "The study of learning efficient models across different domains is the subject of transfer learning and domain adaptation research (cf. Daume?",
        "III and Marcu 2006; Pan and Yang 2010).",
        "The domain adaptation setting assumes a target domain (for which an accurate model should be learned with a limited amount of labeled training data), a source domain (with characteristics different from the target and for which a substantial amount of labeled data is available), and an arbitrary supervised learning model that exploits both the target and source domain data in order to learn an improved target domain model.",
        "The success of domain adaptation mainly depends on two factors: (i) the similarity of the target and source domains (the two domains should be sufficiently similar to allow knowledge transfer); and (ii) the application of an efficient domain adaptation",
        " method (which permits the learning algorithm to exploit the commonalities of the domains while preserving the special characteristics of the target domain).",
        "As our second main contribution, we study the impact of domain differences on uncertainty detection, how this impact depends on the distance between target and source domains concerning their domains and genres, and how these differences can be reduced to produce accurate target domain models with limited annotation effort.",
        "Because previously existing resources exhibited fundamental differences that made domain adaptation difficult,1 to our knowledge this is the first study to analyze domain differences and adaptability in the context of uncertainty detection in depth, and also the first study to report consistently positive results in cross-training.",
        "The main contributions of the current paper can be summarized as follows: We provide a uniform subcategorization of semantic uncertainty (with definitions, examples, and test batteries for annotation) and classify all major previous studies on uncertainty corpus annotation into the proposed categorization system, in order to reveal and analyze the differences.",
        "We provide a harmonized, fine-grained reannotation of three corpora, according to the suggested subcategorization, to allow an in-depth analysis of the domain dependent aspects of uncertainty detection.",
        "We compare the two state-of-the-art approaches to uncertainty cue detection (i.e., the one based on token classification and the one on sequence labeling models), using a shared feature set, in the context of the CoNLL-2010 shared task, to understand their strengths and weaknesses.2 We train an accurate semantic uncertainty detector that distinguishes four fine-grained categories of semantic uncertainty (epistemic, doxastic, investigation, and condition types) and thus is better for future applications in various domains than previous models.",
        "Our experiments reveal that, similar to the best model of the CoNLL-2010 shared task for biological texts but in a fine-grained context, shallow features provide good results in recognizing semantic uncertainty.",
        "We also show that this representation is less suited to detecting discourse-level uncertainty (which was part of the CoNLL task for Wikipedia texts).",
        "We examine in detail the differences between domains and genres as regards the language used to express semantic uncertainty, and learn how the domain or genre distance affects uncertainty recognition in texts with unseen characteristics.",
        "We apply domain adaptation techniques to fully exploit out-of-domain data and minimize annotation costs to adapt to a new domain, and we report successful results for various text domains and genres.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, our classification of uncertainty phenomena is presented in detail and it is compared with the concept of",
        "Szarvas et al. Cross-Genre and Cross-Domain Detection of Semantic Uncertainty uncertainty used in existing corpora.",
        "A framework for detecting semantic uncertainty is then presented in Section 3.",
        "Relatedwork on cue detection is summarized in Section 4, which is followed by a description of our cue recognition system and a presentation of our experimental set-up using various source and target genre and domain pairs for cross-domain learning and domain adaptation in Section 5.",
        "Our results are elaborated on in Section 6 with a focus on the effect of domain similarities and on the annotation effort needed to cover a new domain.",
        "We then conclude with a summary of our results and make some suggestions for future research."

        "In this respect, uncertainty differs from both factuality and negation; as regards the former, the hearer/reader is sure that the information is true and as for the latter, he is sure that the information is not true.",
        "From the viewpoint of computer science, uncertainty emerges due to partial observability, nondeterminism, or both (Russell and Norvig 2010).",

        "The common point in these approaches is that in the case of uncertainty, the truth value/reliability of the proposition cannot be decided because some other piece of information is missing.",

        "The size of the target and source data sets largely influences to what extent external data can improve results.",
        "The only case where domain adaptation had only a negligible effect (an F-score gain less than 1%) is where the target data set is itself very large.",
        "This is expected as the more target data one has, the less crucial it is to incorporate additional data with some undesirable characteristics (difference in style, domain, certain/uncertain sense distribution, etc.).",
        "The performance scores for the CROSS setting clearly indicate the domain/genre distance of the data sets: Themore distant the domain and genre of the source and target data sets are, the more the CROSS performance (where no labeled target data is used) degrades, compared with the TARGET model.",
        "In general, when the distance between both the domain and the genre of texts is substantial (++/++ and +/+ rows in Tables 5",
        " and 6), this accounts for a 6?10% decrease in both the sentence and cue-level F-scores.",
        "An exception is the case of encyclopedic source and news target domains.",
        "Here the performance is very close to the target domain performance.",
        "This indicates that these settings are not so different from each other as it might seem at the first glance.",
        "The encyclopedic and news genres share quite a lot of commonalities (compare cue distributions in Figure 4, for instance).",
        "We verified this observation by using a knowledge-poor quantitative estimator of similarity between domains (Van Asch and Daelemans 2010): Using cosine as the similarity measure, the newswire and encyclopedia texts are found to be the second most similar domain pair in our experiments, with a score comparable to those obtained for the pairs of scientific article types bmc, hbc, and fly.",
        "When there is a domain or genre match between source and target (?/+ and +/?",
        "rows in Tables 5 and 6), however, and the distance regarding the other is just moderate, the cross-training performance is close to or even better than the target-only results.",
        "That is, the larger amount of source training data balances the differences between the domains.",
        "These results indicate that the learned uncertainty classifiers can be directly applied to slightly different data sets.",
        "This suitability is due to the learned disambiguation models, which generalize well in similar settings.",
        "This is contrary to the findings of earlier studies, which built the uncertainty detectors using seed examples and bootstrapping.",
        "These models were not designed to learn any disambiguation models for the cue words found, and their performance degraded even for slightly different data (Szarvas 2008).",
        "Comparing the two domain adaptation procedures DA/CUE and DA/ALL, adaptation via transferring only source sentences that contain a target domain cue is, on average, comparable to transferring all the data from the source domain.",
        "In other words, when we have a small but sufficient amount of target data available, it is enough to account for source data corresponding to the uncertainty cues we saw in the limited target data set.",
        "This observation has several consequences, namely: The source-only cues, or to be more precise, their disambiguation models, are not helpful for the target domains as they cannot be adapted.",
        "This is due to the differences in the source and target disambiguation models.",
        "Similarly, domain adaptation improves the disambiguation models for the observed target cues, rather than introducing new vocabulary into the target domain.",
        "This mechanism coincides with our initial goal of using domain adaptation to learn better semantic models.",
        "This effect is the opposite of how bootstrapping-based weakly supervised approaches improve the performance in an underresourced domain.",
        "This observation suggests a promising future direction of combining the two approaches to maximize the gains while minimizing the annotation costs.",
        "In a general context, we can effectively extend the data for a given domain if we have robust knowledge of the potential uncertainty vocabulary for that domain.",
        "Given the wide variety of the domains and genres of our data sets, it is reasonable to suppose that they represent uncertain language in general quite well, and the joint vocabularies provide a good starting point for a targeted data development for further domains.",
        "As regards the fine-grained classification results, Table 7 demonstrates that the fine-grained distinction results in only a small, or no, loss in performance.",
        "The coarse-grained model is slightly more accurate than the fine-grained model (counting correctly",
        "Szarvas et al. Cross-Genre and Cross-Domain Detection of Semantic Uncertainty recognized but misclassified cues as true positives) in most settings.",
        "The most significant difference is observed for the target-only settings, where no out-of-domain data are used for the training and thus the data sets are accordingly smaller.",
        "A noticeable exception is when scientific abstracts are used for cross training: In those settings the coarse-grained model performs poorly, due to its lower recall, which we attribute to overfitting the special characteristics of abstracts.",
        "The fact that in fine-grained classification the CROSS results consistently outperform the TARGET models (see Table 8) even for distant domain pairs, also underlines that the increased sparseness caused by the differentiation of the various subtypes of uncertainty is an important factor only for smaller data sets.",
        "The improvement by domain adaptation is clearly more prominent in fine-grained than in coarse-grained classification, however: The individual cue types benefit by 5?10% points in terms of the F-score from out-of-domain data and domain adaptation.",
        "Moreover, as Table 8 shows, for the domain pairs and fine-grained classes where a nice amount of positive examples are at hand, the per class Fcue scores are also around 80% and above.",
        "This means that it is possible to accurately identify the individual subtypes of semantic uncertainty, and thus it also proves the feasibility of the subcategorization and annotation scheme proposed in this study (Section 2).",
        "Other important observations here are that domain adaptation is even more significant in the more difficult fine-grained classification setting, and that the condition class represents a challenge for our model.",
        "The performance for the condition class is lower than that for the other classes, which can only in part be attributed to the fact that this is the least represented subtype in our data sets: as opposed to other cue types, condition cues are typically used in many different contexts and they may belong to other uncertainty classes as well."

        "It is easy to see that the TARGET results approach to DA results with more target data.",
        "Figure 5 shows that the size of the target training data set where the supervised TARGET setting outperforms the CROSS model (trained on 4,000 source sentences) is around 1,000 sentences.",
        "Aswementioned earlier, even distant domain data can improve the cue recognition model in the absence of a sufficient target data set.",
        "Figure 5 justifies this observation, as the CROSS and DA settings outperform the TARGET setting on each source?target data set pair.",
        "It can also be observed that the doxastic type is more domain-dependent than the others and its results consistently improve by increasing the size of the target domain annotation (which coincides with the cue frequency investigations of Section 5.1.3).",
        "In the news target domain, however, the investigation and epistemic classes benefit a lot from a small amount of annotated target data but their performance scores increase just slightly after that.",

        " target data.",
        "The condition class is underrepresented in both the source and target data sets and hence no reliable observations can bemade regarding this subclass (see Table 2).",
        "Overall, if we would like to have an uncertainty cue detector for a new genre/domain: (i) We can achieve performance around 60?70% by using cross training depending on the difference between the domains (i.e., without any annotation effort); (ii) By annotating around 3,000 sentences, we can have a performance of 70?80%, depending on the level of difficulty of the texts; (iii) We can get the same 70?80% results with annotating just 1,000 sentences and using domain adaptation."

        "Still, it is rarely used as a cue in other domains but without domain adaptation, the model trained on biological texts marks quite a few occurrences of or as cues in the news or encyclopedia domains.",

        "Many errors were related to multi-class cues.",

        "dispute the fact mean the same).",
        "It is rather a stylistic issue to further express uncertainty at the discourse level (i.e., there are some unidentified people who dispute the fact, hence the opinion cannot be associated with any definite source).",
        "The last two uses of would are not typically described in grammars of English and seem to be characteristic primarily of the news and encyclopedia domains.",

        "Hence, POS-tagging errors can lead to a serious decline in performance.",
        "We think that an analysis of similar examples can further support domain adaptation and cue detection across genres and domains.",
        "In this article, we introduced an uncertainty cue detection model that can perform well across different domains and genres.",
        "Even though several types of uncertainty exist, available corpora and resources focus only on some of the possible types and thereby only cover particular aspects of the phenomenon.",
        "This means that uncertainty models found in the literature are heterogeneous, and the results of experiments on different corpora are hardly comparable.",
        "These facts motivated us to offer a unified model of semantic uncertainty enhanced by linguistic and computer science considerations.",
        "In accordance with this classification, we reannotated three corpora from several domains and genres using our uniform annotation guidelines.",
        "Our results suggest that simple cross training can be employed and it achieves a reasonable performance (60?70% cue-level F-score) when no annotated data is at hand for a new domain.",
        "When some annotated data is available (here somemeans fewer than 3,000 annotated sentences for the target domain), domain adaptation techniques are the best choice: (i) they lead to a significant improvement compared to simple cross training, and (ii) they can provide a reasonable performance with significantly less annotation.",
        "In our experiments, the annotation of 3,000 sentences and training only on these is roughly equivalent to the annotation of 1,000 sentences using external data and domain adaptation.",
        "If the size of the training data set is sufficiently large (larger than 5,000 sentences) the effect of incorporating additional data?having some undesirable characteristics?is not crucial.",
        "Comparing different domain adaptation techniques, we found that similar results could be attained when the source domain was filtered for sentences that contained cues in the target domain.",
        "This tells us that models learn to better disambiguate the cues seen in the target domain instead of finding new, unseen cues.",
        "In this sense, this approach can be regarded as a complementarymethod toweakly supervised techniques for lexicon extraction.",
        "A promising way to further minimize annotation costs while maximizing performance would be the integration of the two approaches, which we plan to investigate in the near future.",
        "In our study, we did not pay attention to dynamic modality (due to the lack of annotated resources), but the detection of such phenomena is also desirable.",
        "For instance, dynamically modal events cannot be treated as certain'that is, the event of buying cannot be assigned the same truth value in They agreed to buy the company and They bought the company.",
        "Whereas the second sentence expresses a fact, the first one informs us about the intention of buying the company, which will be certainly carried out in a world where moral or business laws are observed but at the moment it cannot be stated whether the transaction takes place (i.e., that it is certain).",
        "Hence, in the future, we also intend to integrate the identification of dynamically modal cues into our uncertainty cue detector."
