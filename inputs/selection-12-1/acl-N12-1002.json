        "Entrainment, also termed alignment, adaptation, priming or coordination, is the phenomenon of conversational partners becoming more similar to each other in what they say, how they say it, and other behavioral phenomena.",
        "Entrainment has been shown to occur for numerous aspects of spoken language, including speakers?",
        "choice of referring expressions (Brennan & Clark, 1996); linguistic style (Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2002; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011); syntactic structure (Reitter et al., 2006); speaking rate (Lev-itan & Hirschberg, 2011); acoustic/prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, voice quality (Levitan & Hirschberg, 2011); and phonetics (Pardo, 2006).",
        "Entrainment in many of these dimensions has also been associated with different measures of dialogue success.",
        "For example, Chartrand and Bargh (1999) demonstrated that mimicry of posture and behavior led to increased liking between the dialogue participants as well as a smoother interaction.",
        "They also found that naturally empathetic individuals exhibited a greater degree of mimicry than did others.",
        "Nenkova et al. (2008) found that entrainment on high-frequency words was correlated with naturalness, task success, and coordinated turn-taking behavior.",
        "Natale (1975) showed that an individual's social desirability, or ?propensity to act in a social manner,?",
        "can predict the degree to which that individual will match her partner's vocal intensity.",
        "Levitan et al. (2011) showed that entrainment on backchannel-preceding cues is correlated with shorter latency between turns, fewer interruptions, and a higher degree of task success.",
        "In a study of married couples discussing problems in their relationships, Lee et al. (2010) found that entrainment measures derived from pitch features were significantly higher in positive interactions than in negative interactions and were predictive of the polarity of the participants?",
        "attitudes.",
        "These studies have been motivated by theoretical models such as Giles?",
        "Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles & Coupland, 1991), which proposes that speakers promote social approval or",
        "efficient communication by adapting to their interlocutors?",
        "communicative behavior.",
        "Another theory informing the association of entrainment and dialogue success is the coordination-rapport hypothesis (Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1990), which posits that the degree of liking between conversational partners should be correlated with the degree of nonverbal coordination between them.",
        "Motivated by such theoretical proposals and empirical findings, we hypothesized that entrainment on acoustic/prosodic dimensions such as pitch, intensity, voice quality and speaking rate might also be correlated with positive aspects of perceived social behaviors as well as other perceived characteristics of efficient, well-coordinated conversations.",
        "In this paper we describe a series of experiments investigating the relationship between objective acoustic/prosodic dimensions of entrainment and manually-annotated perception of a set of social variables designed to capture important aspects of conversational partners?",
        "social behaviors.",
        "Since prior research on other dimensions of entrainment has sometimes observed differences in degree of entrainment between female-female, male-male and mixed gender groups (Bilous & Krauss, 1988; Pardo, 2006; Namy et al., 2002), we also examined our data for variation by gender pair, considering female-female, male-male, and female-male pairs of speakers separately.",
        "If previous findings extend to acoustic/prosodic entrainment, we would expect female-female pairs to entrain to a greater degree than male-male pairs and female partners in mixed gender pairs to entrain more than their male counterparts.",
        "Since prior findings posit that entrainment leads to smoother and more natural conversations, we would also expect degree of entrainment to correlate with perception of other characteristics descriptive of such conversations.",
        "Below we describe the corpus and annotations used in this study and how our social annotations were obtained in Sections 2 and 3.",
        "We next discuss our method and results for the prevalence of entrainment among different gender groups (Section 4).",
        "In Sections 5 and 6, we present the results of correlating acoustic entrainment with social variables and objective success measures, respectively.",
        "Finally, in Section 7, we explore entrainment in cases of outlier feature values."

        "Outlier pairs have higher relative entrainment than do normal pairs for intensity mean and max, shimmer, and syllables per second.",
        "This means that speakers confronted with an interlocutor who diverges widely from the norm for those four features make a larger adjustment to their speech in order to converge to that interlocutor.",
        "An ANOVA shows that relative entrainment on intensity maxis higher in outlier cases for male-male pairs than for female-female pairs and even higher for female-male pairs (F=11.33, p=5.3e-05).",
        "Relative entrainment on NHR in these cases is lower for male-male pairs than for female-female pairs and higher for female-male pairs (F=11.41, p=6.5e05).",

        "Our study of entrainment on acoustic/prosodic variables yields new findings about entrainment behavior for female-female, male-male, and mixed-gender dyads, as well as the association of entrainment with perceived social characteristics and objective measures of dialogue smoothness and efficiency.",
        "We find that entrainment is the most prevalent for mixed-gender pairs, followed by female-female pairs, with male-male pairs entraining the least.",
        "Entrainment is the most important to the perception of social behavior of mixed-gender pairs, and it is the most important to the efficiency and flow of male-male dialogues.",
        "For the most part, the directions of the correlations of entrainment with success variables accord with hypotheses motivated by the relevant literature.",
        "Giving encouragement and trying to be liked are positively correlated with entrainment, as are percentage of overlaps and number of turns.",
        "Mean latency, a symptom of a poorly-run conversation, is negatively associated with entrainment.",
        "However, several exceptions suggest that the associations are not straightforward and further research must be done to fully understand the relationship between entrainment, social characteristics and dialogue success.",
        "In particular, the explanation behind the associations of entrainment on certain variables with certain social and objective measures is an interesting direction for future work.",
        "Finally, we find that in ?outlier?",
        "cases where a particular speaker diverges widely from the norm for intensity mean, intensity max, or syllables per second, entrainment is more pronounced.",
        "This supports the theory that the perception-behavior link is the mechanism behind entrainment and provides a possible direction for research into why speakers entrain on certain features and not others.",
        "In future work we will explore this direction and go more thoroughly into individual differences in entrainment behavior."
