        "Table 2 also provides some examples from our development set, for comparison.",
        "We observed many instances of correctly marked shell, including many that appeared very different in style than the language used in essays.",
        "For example, Lincoln demonstrates an aggressive style in the following: ?Now, I say that there is no charitable way to look at that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy.?",
        "Also, Bush employs a somewhat atypical sentence structure here: ?It's not what I think and its not my intentions and not my plan.?",
        "However, the system also incorrectly tagged sequences as shell, particularly in short sentences (e.g., ?Are we as strong as we should be??).",
        "It also missed shell, partially or entirely, such as in the following example: ?But let's get back to the core issue here.?",
        "These results suggest that although there is potential for improvement in adapting to new domains, our approach to shell detection at least partially generalizes beyond our initial domain of persuasive essay writing."

        "In research on intentional structure, Grosz and Sidner (1986) propose that any discourse is composed of three interacting components: the linguistic structure defined by the actual utterances, the intentional structure defined by the purposes underlying the discourse, and an attentional structure defined by the discourse participants?",

        "Detecting shell may also be seen as trying to identify explicit cues of intentional structure in a discourse.",
        "Additionally, the categorization of shell spans as to whether they evaluate the opponents claims, connect ones own claims, etc., may be seen as determining what Grosz and Sidener call ?discourse segment purposes?",
        "(i.e., the intentions underlying the segments containing the shell spans).",
        "We can also view shell detection as the task of identifying phrases that indicate certain types of speech acts (Searle, 1975).",
        "In particular, we aim to identify markers of assertive speech acts, which declare that the speaker believes a certain proposition, and expressive speech acts, which express attitudes toward propositions.",
        "Shell also overlaps with the concept of discourse markers (Hutchinson, 2004), such as ?however?",

        "TP However, the argument lacks specificity and relies on too many questionable assumptions to make a strong case for adopting an expensive and logistically complicated program.",

        "?therefore.?",
        "Discourse markers, however, are typically only single words or short phrases that express a limited number of relationships.",
        "On the other hand, shell can capture longer sequences that express more complex relationships between the components of an argumentative discourse (e.g., ?But let's get back to the core issue here?",
        "signals that the following point is more important than the previous one).",
        "There are also various other approaches to analyzing arguments.",
        "Notably, much recent theoretical research on argumentation has focused on argumentation schemes (Walton et al., 2008), which are high-level strategies for constructing arguments (e.g., argument from consequences).",
        "Recently, Feng and Hirst (2011) developed automated methods for classifying texts by argumentation scheme.",
        "In similar work, Anand et al. (2011) use argumentation schemes to identify tactics in blog posts (e.g., moral appeal, social generalization, appeals to external authorities etc.).",
        "Although shell language can certainly be found in persuasive writing, it is used to organize the persuader's tactics and claims rather than to express them.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence: ?It must be the case that this diet works since it was recommended by someone who lost 20 pounds on it.?",
        "In shell detection, we focus on the lexico-syntactic level, aiming to identify the bold words as shell.",
        "In contrast, work on argumentation schemes focuses at a higher level of abstraction, aiming to classify the sentence as an attempt to persuade by appealing to an external authority."
