        "One of the most important reasons for the recent advances made in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has been the development of automated metrics for evaluation of translation quality.",
        "The goal of any such metric is to assess whether the translation hypothesis produced by a system is semantically equivalent to the source sentence that was translated.",
        "However, cross-lingual semantic equivalence is even harder to assess than monolingual, therefore, most MT metrics instead try to measure whether the hypothesis is semantically equivalent to a human-authored reference translation of the same source sentence.",
        "Using such automated metrics as proxies for human judgments can provide a quick assessment of system performance and allow for short feature and system development cycles, which are important for evaluating research ideas.",
        "In the last 5 years, several shared tasks and competitions have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated metrics that go beyond the computation of n-gram overlaps (BLEU, NIST) or edit distances (TER, WER, PER etc.).",
        "Note that the task of an MT metric is essentially one of identifying whether the translation produced by a system is a paraphrase of the reference translation.",
        "Although the notion of using MT metrics for the task of paraphrase identification is not novel (Finch et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006), it merits a re-examination in the light of the development of these novel MT metrics for which we can ask ?How much better, if at all, do these newer metrics perform for the task of paraphrase identification??",
        "This paper describes such a re-examination.",
        "We employ 8 different MT metrics for identifying paraphrases across two different datasets - the well-known Microsoft Research paraphrase corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al., 2004) and the plagiarism detection corpus (PAN) from the 2010 Uncovering Plagiarism, Authorship and Social Software Misuse shared task (Potthast et al., 2010).",
        "We include both MSRP and PAN in our study because they represent two very different sources of paraphrased text.",
        "The creation of MSRP relied on the massive redundancy of news articles on the web and extracted sentential paraphrases from different stories written about the same topic.",
        "In the case of PAN, humans consciously paraphrased existing text to generate new,",
        "plagiarized text.",
        "In the next section, we discuss previous work on paraphrase identification.",
        "In ?3, we describe our approach to paraphrase identification using MT metrics as features.",
        "Our approach yields impressive results ?",
        "the current state of the art for MSRP and extremely positive for PAN.",
        "In the same section, we examine whether each metric's purported strength is demonstrated in our datasets.",
        "Next, in ?4 we conduct an analysis of our system's misclassifications for both datasets and outline a taxonomy of errors that our system makes.",

      "heading": "6 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we re-examined the idea that automatic metrics used for evaluating translation quality can perform well explicitly for the task of paraphrase recognition.",
        "The goal of our paper was to determine whether approaches developed for the related but different task of MT evaluation can be as competitive as approaches developed specifically for the task of paraphrase identification.",
        "While we do treat the metrics as black boxes to an extent, we explicitly chose metrics that were high performing but also complementary in nature.",
        "Specifically, our re-examination focused on the more sophisticated MT metrics of the last few years that claim to go beyond simple n-gram overlap and edit distance.",
        "We found that a meta-classifier trained using only MT metrics outperforms all previous approaches for the MSRP corpus.",
        "Unlike previous studies, we also applied our approach to a new plagiarism dataset and obtained extremely positive results.",
        "We examined both datasets not only to find pairs that demonstrated the strength of each metric but also to conduct an error analysis to discover the top sources of errors that an MT metric based approach is susceptible to.",
        "Finally, we discovered that using the TERp metric by itself provides fairly good performance and can outperform many other supervised classification approaches utilizing multiple, complex features.",
        "We also have two specific suggestions that we believe can benefit the community.",
        "First, we believe that binary indicators of semantic equivalence are not ideal and a continuous value between 0 and 1 indicating the degree to which two pairs are paraphrastic is more suitable for most approaches.",
        "However, rather than asking annotators to rate pairs on a scale, a better idea might be to show the sentence pairs to a large number of Turkers (?",
        "20) on Amazon Mechanical Turk and ask them to classify it as either a paraphrase or a non-paraphrase.",
        "A simple estimate of the degree of semantic equivalence of the pair is simply the proportion of the Turkers who classified the pair as paraphrastic.",
        "An example of such an approach, as applied to the task of grammatical error detection, can be found in (Madnani et al., 2011).3 Second, we believe that the PAN corpus?",
        "with Turker simulated plagiarism?contains much more realistic examples of paraphrase and should be incorporated into future evaluations of paraphrase identification.",
        "In order to encourage this, we are releasing our PAN dataset containing 13,000 sentence pairs.",
        "We are also releasing our error analysis data (100 pairs for MSRP and 100 pairs for PAN) since they might prove useful to other researchers as well.",
        "Note that the annotations for this analysis were produced by the authors themselves and, although, they attempted to accurately identify all error categories for most sentence pairs, it is possible that the errors in some sentence pairs were not comprehensively identified.4"
