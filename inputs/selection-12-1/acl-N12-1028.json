        "It has two main functions.",
        "First of all, a title can be informative (it conveys relevant information about the text content and aim), and second, it can be catchy or incentive (Herrero Cecilia, 2007).",
        "A heading is said to be catchy when it succeeds in capturing the reader's attention on an aspect of the announced event, in a ingenious, metaphoric, enigmatic, or shocking way.",
        "From a syntactic point of view, a title can be a word, a phrase, an expression, a sentence, that designates a paper or one of its parts, by giving its subject.",
        "Titles are used within applications such as automatic generation of contents, or summarization.",
        "So, it is interesting to automate the process that produces relevant titles by extracting them from texts, and supplying other applications with such data, while avoiding any human intervention: Direct applications (as automatic titling of \"no object\" e-mails) are thus possible.",
        "The point is that several titles can be relevant for a same text: This constitutes the main difficulty of automatic titling.",
        "Some writers prefer informative titles, whereas others prefer catchy ones.",
        "Others juggle with both criteria according to the context and the type of the publication.",
        "So, evaluation of automatic titling is a complex step requiring a human intervention.",
        "Indeed, how can titles relevance be estimated ?",
        "How an automatic title can be compared to a human-written (\"real\") title, knowing that both can have a very different morphosyntactic structure?",
        "Automatic titling is a full process, possessing its own functions.",
        "It has to be sharply differentiated from summarization and indexation tasks.",
        "Its purpose is to propose title(s) that have to be short, informative and/or catchy, and keep a coherent syntactic structure.",
        "NLP1 methods will be exploited in order to abide by language morphosyntactic and semantic constraints in titling.",
        "In this paper, we describe an approach of automatic titling relying on nominalization, i.e. rules transforming a verb phrase into a noun phrase (e.g. \"the president left\" is nominalized into \" President's Departure\").",
        "This study raises two crucial questions: (1) Determining sentences and phrases containing relevant information (2) Nominalizing a chosen item and using it as a title.",
        "Example: From the following pair of sentences \"The disappointing perfor",

        "For months, they defended their candidate on the Web.\", containing the relevant information about an article in the French press in 2007, the idea is to built the following title: \"S?gol?ne Royal: Surprise of the French citizens\".",
        "In fact, other titles could apply such as \"S?gol?ne Royal's Disappointing Performance\" or \"Surprising the French Citizens\", but notice that both are less informative, since they drop a part of the information.",

        "Automatic titling of textual documents is a subject often confused with summarization and indexation tasks.",
        "While a summary has to give an outline of the text contents, the title has to indicate the subject of the text without revealing all the contents.",
        "The process of summarization can use titles, as in (Blais et al., 2007) and (Amini et al., 2005), thus demonstrating their importance.",
        "Automatic summarization provides a set of relevant sentences extracted from the text: The total number of sentences is diminished, but sentences are not shortened by themselves.",
        "Ultimately reducing the number to one does not provide a title, since the latter is very rarely a sentence, but needs to be grammatically consistent.",
        "It is also necessary to differentiate automatic titling from text compression: Text compression might shorten sentences but keep the original number of sentences (Yousfi-Monod and Prince, 2008).",
        "Mixing both approaches appears as a very costly process to undertake, more adapted to a summarization task, when titling might be obtained by less expansive techniques.",
        "Titling must also be differentiated from indexation because titles do not always contain the text key-words: Headings can present a partial or total reformulation of the text, not relevant for an index, which role is to facilitate the user's search and retrieval.",
        "Once again, the construction of an index can use titles appearing in the document.",
        "So, if determining relevant titles is a successful task, the quality of indexation will largely be improved.",
        "An automatic titling approach, named POSTIT, extracts relevant noun phrases to be used as titles (Lopez et al., 2011b).",
        "One of its benefits is that long titles, syntactically correct, can be proposed.",
        "The main inconvenience is that it cannot provide original titles, using a funny form for example, unless this one already appears in the text (which can be rather scarce, even in newspapers articles).",
        "In the same environment, a variant of this approach, called CATIT, constructing short titles, has been developed by the same authors (Lopez et al., 2011a).",
        "It tries to built titles which are relevant to the texts.",
        "It evaluates their quality by browsing the Web (popular and recognized expressions), as well as including those titles dynamic context.",
        "Applied to a corpus of journalistic articles, CATIT was able to provide headings both informative and catchy.",
        "However, syntactical patterns used for titles building were short (two terms) and experience showed that longer titles were often preferred.",
        "Another approach, presented by (Banko et al., 2000), consists in generating coherent summaries that are shorter than a single sentence.",
        "These summaries are called \"headlines\".",
        "The main difficulty is to adjust the threshold (i.e., the length of the headline), in order to obtain syntactically correct titles.",
        "This is the main difference with our method NOMIT, which ensures that its produced titles are always syntactically correct.",
        "If a system were to produce informative, catchy, and variable-sized (in number of words) titles, the nominalization of constituents seems to be an interesting approach.",
        "Nominalization is a process transforming an adjective or a verb into a noun or noun phrase.",
        "In a nominalized constituent, the time of the event is not in touch with the time of the speech of the event (for example, \"President's departure\" does not infer that the president already left, contrary to \"The president left\").",
        "In some languages such as German and French, nominalization answers an ac",
        "tivity of conceptualization and conciseness.",
        "In a title, it allows to focus, according to the context of the author, on the dimension of the event considered the most relevant.",
        "(Moirand, 1975) already noticed that in French journalistic articles, numerous titles appear with a nominalized form.",
        "This observation was recently confirmed by (Herrero Cecilia, 2007).",
        "It is thus interesting to study automatic titling by nominalization of constituents when dealing with languages where it is often used.",
        "In English, the method stays the same, but the pattern changes: English headings patterns incline towards progressive present (e.g. \"Tempest looming\"), an infinitive form with a past participle (e.g. \"Conference to be held\"), and always with a deletion of articles.",
        "This paper focuses mostly on French because of its available data, but a shift in languages and patterns is contemplated in a further step."

        "The main cause is that it depends on personal interests.",
        "It is thus necessary to ask the following question: Do we have to consider that a title is definitely catchy when at least one person judges it so?",
        "Otherwise, how many people at least?",
        "This is still an open question and needs to be further investigated.",
        "Also, some interesting extensions could be envisaged: The approach presented in this paper uses three rules of transformation based on the presence of an auxiliary followed by a past participle.",
        "The addition of new rules would enable a syntactic enrichment of the titles.",
        "So, it might be profitable to set up rules taking into account the presence of syntactical patterns (others than \"auxiliary + past participle\") to allow more texts to be titled by NOMIT.",
        "Taking the punctuation of the end of sentences into account might also be a promising track.",
        "For example, \"did it use an electric detonator?\" would become \"Use of an electric detonator?\".",
        "It is an interesting point because the presence of a punctuation at the end of a title (in particular the exclamation or the interrogation) constitutes a catchy criterion.",
        "Last, NOMIT is a method (easily reproducible in other languages, English in particular) that stepped out of preceding attempts in automatic headings generation (POSTIT, CATIT).",
        "Exploring syntactic patterns, as it does, means that increasing the amount of linguistic information in the process might lead to a reliable heading method.",
        "One of the perspectives can be to track the optimum point between the richness of involved information and processes, and the cost of the method.",
        "The incremental methodology followed from POSTIT to NOMIT tends to enhance the belief that parameters (i.e. length, shape, relevance, etc...) for an automatic heading procedure have to be studied and well defined, thus leading to a customized titling process."
