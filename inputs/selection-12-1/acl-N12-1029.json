      "text": [
        "Automatically detecting and correcting grammatical errors in learner language is a growing sub-field of Natural Language Processing.",
        "As the field has progressed, we have seen research focusing on a range of grammatical phenomena including English articles and prepositions (c.f.",
        "Tetreault et al., 2010; De Felice and Pulman, 2008), particles in Korean and Japanese (c.f.",
        "Dickinson et al., 2011; Oyama, 2010), and broad approaches that aim to find multiple error types (c.f Rozovskaya et al., 2011; Ga-mon, 2011).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any research published specifically on correcting erroneous comma usage in English (though there have been efforts such as the MS Word grammar checker, and products like Gram-marly and White Smoke that include comma checking).",
        "There are a variety of reasons that motivate our interest in attempting to correct comma errors.",
        "First of all, a review of error typologies in Leacock et al. (2010) reveals that comma usage errors are the fourth most common error type among non-native writers in the Cambridge Learner Corpus (Nicholls, 1999), which is composed of millions of words of text from essays written by learners of English.",
        "The problem of comma usage is not limited to non-native writers; six of the top twenty error types for native writers involve misuse of commas (Connors and Lunsford, 1988).",
        "Given these apparent deficits among both non-native and native speakers, developing a sound methodology for automatically identifying comma errors will prove useful in both learning and automatic assessment environments.",
        "A quick examination of English learner essays reveals a variety of errors, with writers both overusing and underusing commas in certain contexts.",
        "Consider examples (1) and (2):",
        "(1) erroneous: If you want to be a master you",
        "should know your subject well.",
        "corrected: If you want to be a master , you should know your subject well.",
        "(2) erroneous: I suppose , that it is better to specialize in one specific subject.",
        "corrected: I suppose that it is better to specialize in one specific subject.",
        "In example (1), an introductory conditional phrase begins the sentence, but the learner has not used the appropriate comma to separate the dependent clause from the independent clause.",
        "The comma in this case helps the reader to see where one clause ends",
        "and another begins.",
        "In example (2), the comma after suppose is unnecessary in American English, and although this error is related more to style than to readability, most native writers would omit the comma in this context, so it should be avoided by learners as well.",
        "Another motivating factor for this work is the fact that sentence internal punctuation contributes to the overall readability of a sentence (Hill and Murray, 1998).",
        "Proper comma placement can lead to faster reading times and reduce the need to reread entire sentences.",
        "Commas also help remove or reduce problems arising from difficult ambiguities; the garden path effect can be greatly reduced if commas are correctly inserted after introductory phrases and reduced relative clauses.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions: ?",
        "We present the first published comma error correction system for English, evaluated on essays written by both native and non-native speakers of English.",
        "?",
        "The same system also achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of restoring commas in well-edited text.",
        "?",
        "We describe a novel annotation scheme that allows for robust mark up of comma errors and use it to annotate two corpora of student essays.",
        "?",
        "We show that distance and combination features can improve performance for both the error correction and restoration tasks.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we review prior work.",
        "Section 3 details our typology of comma usage.",
        "We discuss our choice of classifier and selection of features in section 4.",
        "In section 5, we apply our system to the task of comma restoration.",
        "We describe our annotation scheme and error correction system and evaluation in sections 6 and 7.",
        "Finally, we summarize and outline plans for future research in section 8."

        "The only reported research that we are aware of which specifically deals with comma errors in learner writing is reported in Hardt (2001) and Ale-gria et al. (2006), two studies that deal with Danish and Basque, respectively.",
        "Hardt (2001) employs an error driven approach featuring the Brill tagger (Brill, 1993).",
        "The Brill tagger works as it would for the part-of-speech tagging task for which it was designed, i.e. it learns rules based on templates by iterating over a large corpus.",
        "This work is also evaluated on native text where all existing commas are considered correct, and additional ?erroneous?",
        "commas are added randomly to a sub-corpus, so that the tagger can learn from the errors.",
        "The system is tested on a distinct subset for the task of correcting existing comma errors and achieves 91.4% precision and 76.9% recall.",
        "Alegria et al. (2006) compare implementations of Naive Bayes, decision-tree, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and utilize a feature set based on word-forms, categories, and syntactic information about each decision point.",
        "While the system is designed as a possible means for correcting errors, it is only evaluated on the task of restoring commas in well-formed text produced by native writers.",
        "The system obtains good precision (96%) and recall (98.3%) for correctly not inserting commas, but performs less well at actually inserting commas (69.6% precision, 48.6% recall).",
        "It is important to note that the results in both of the projects are based on constructed errors in an otherwise native corpus which is free of any other contextual errors that might be present in actual learner data.",
        "Moreover, as we will show in section 6, errors of omission (failing to use needed commas) are much more common than errors of commission (inserting commas inappropriately) in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) data that we use.",
        "Crucially, our error correction efforts described in section 7 must be able to account for noise and be able to insert new commas as well as remove erroneous ones, as we do evaluate on a set of English learner essays.",
        "Although we have not found any work published specifically on correcting comma errors in English, for language learners or otherwise, there is a fairly large amount of work that focuses on the task of comma restoration.",
        "Comma restoration refers to placing commas in a sentence which is presented with no sentence internal punctuation.",
        "This task is",
        "mostly attempted in the larger context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), since there are no absolute cues of where commas should be placed in a stream of speech.",
        "Many of these systems use feature sets that include prosodic elements that are clearly not available for text based work (see e.g., Favre et al., 2009; Huang and Zweig, 2002; Moniz et al., 2009).",
        "There are, however, a few punctuation restoration projects that have used well-formed text-only data.",
        "Shieber and Tao (2003) explore restoring commas to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn Treebank (PTB).",
        "The authors augment a HMM trigram-based system with constituency parse information at each insertion point.",
        "Using fully correct parses directly from the PTB, the authors achieve an F-score of 74.8% and sentence accuracy of 57.9%1.",
        "However, a shortcoming of this methodology is that it dictates that all commas are missing, but these parses were generated with comma information present in the sentence and moreover hand-corrected by human annotators.",
        "Using parses automatically generated with commas removed from the data, they achieve an F-score of 70.1% and sentence accuracy of 54.9%.",
        "More recently, Gravano et al. (2009), who work with newswire text, including WSJ, pursue the task of inserting all punctuation and correcting capitalization in a string of text in a single pass, rather than just comma restoration, but do provide results based solely on comma insertion.",
        "The authors employ an n-gram language model and experiment with n-grams from size n = 3 to n = 6, and with different training data sizes.",
        "The result relevant to our work is their comma F-score on WSJ test data, which is just over 60% when using 5-grams and 55 billion training tokens.",
        "Baldwin and Joseph (2009) also restore punctuation and capitalization to newswire texts, using machine based learning with retagging.",
        "Their results are difficult to compare with our work because they use a different data set and do not focus on commas in their evaluation.",
        "Lu and Ng (2010) take an approach that inserts all 1Sentence accuracy is a measure used by some in the field that counts sentences with 100% correct comma decisions as correct, and any sentence where a comma is missing or mistakenly placed as incorrect.",
        "It is motivated by the idea that all commas are essential to understanding a sentence.",
        "punctuation symbols into text.",
        "They use transcribed English and Chinese speech data and do not provide specific evaluation for commas, however one important contribution of their research to our current task is the finding that Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) perform better at this task than Hidden Event Language Models, another algorithm that has been used for restoration.",
        "One reason for this could be CRFs?",
        "better handling of long range dependencies because they model the entire sequence, rather than making a singular decision based on information at each point in the sequence (Liu et al., 2005).",
        "CRFs also do not suffer from the label bias problem that affects Maximum Entropy classifiers (Lafferty et al., 2001)."

        "One of the challenges present in this research is the ambiguity as to what constitutes ?correct?",
        "comma usage in American English.",
        "For one thing, not all commas contribute to grammaticality; some are more tied to stylistic rules and preferences.",
        "While there are certainly rule-based decision points for comma insertion (Doran, 1998), particularly in the case of commas that set off significant chunks or phrases within sentences, there are also some commas that appear to be more prescriptive, as they have less of an effect on sentence processing (such as in example (2) in the introduction), and opposing usage rules for the same contexts are attested in different style manuals.",
        "A common example of opposing rules is the notorious serial or Oxford comma that refers to the final comma found in a series, which is required by the Chicago Manual of Style (University of Chicago, 1993), but is considered incorrect by the New York Times Manual of Style (Siegal and Connolly, 1999).",
        "As a starting point, we needed to know what kinds of commas are taught by English language teachers, as well as what style manuals recommend and/or require.",
        "However, creating a list of comma uses was a non-trivial part of the process.",
        "After consulting style manuals (University of Chicago, 1993; Siegal and Connolly, 1999; Strunk and White, 1999) and popular ESL websites, we compiled a list of over 30 rules for use of commas in English.",
        "We took the most commonly mentioned rules and created a final",
        "list of 15 usage rules (the 14 most common plus one miscellaneous category) for our annotation scheme, which is discussed in section 6.",
        "These rules are given in Table 1.",
        "The 16 rules that were removed from the list occurred in only one source or were similar enough to other rules to be conflated.",
        "It is worth noting here that while many of the comma uses in this table might be best served by some statistical methodology like the one we describe in section 4, one can envision fairly simple heuristic rules to insert commas and find errors in numbers, dates, geographical names, titles, and introducing words."

        "In keeping with practices established within the field of grammatical error correction, the system has been optimized for high precision even at the cost of recall, to ensure that feedback systems avoid confusing learners by",

        "For these, whatever decision the system makes is scored as correct.",
        "Since the grammaticality/readability of the sentence will not be affected by the presence or absence of a comma in these cases, we feel this is the fairest assessment of the system."

        "In order to get a sense of what kinds of constructions are difficult for our system, we randomly extracted 50 sentences from the output that exhibited at least one wrong comma decision made by the system.",
        "The 50 sentences contained a combined total of 62 system errors.",
        "Among these cases, the most common context where the system makes the wrong decision is in introductory words and phrases, which is not surprising given the frequency with which commas occur in these environments in our development set (about 40% of all commas in the essays).",
        "In (4), for example, the first word, Here, should be followed by a comma.",
        "Since Here is not a common introductory word in this type of sentence structure in the training data, this is a difficult case for the system to correct.",
        "(4) Here we can get specific knowledge in the science that we like the most .",
        "The next most common misclassification involves comma splices, i.e. conjoining complete sentences with a comma rather than separating them with a full stop.",
        "In (5), for example, there should be a full stop between college and I, rather than a comma.",
        "This result is not surprising because the system is not yet equipped to deal with comma splices.",
        "Comma splices are a different type of phenomenon because correcting them requires removing the comma and inserting a full stop, essentially two separate steps rather than the single reject/accept step that the system currently handles.",
        "(5) I entered college, I could learn it and make an effort to achieve my goal.",
        "The next most common context for system errors was between clauses that are conjoined with a coordinating conjunction as in (6), where there should not be a comma.",
        "In (6), the second clause is actually a dependent clause, so no comma should precede the coordinating conjunction.",
        "There are a number of system errors dealing with commas between two independent clauses.",
        "For example in (7), our annotator recommended a comma between things and but, however the system did not make the insertion.",
        "The problem with these examples likely stems from the fact that the rule for comma usage in these contexts is not clearly stated, even in well-respected manuals, and therefore likely not clearly understood, even by high-level native writers.",
        "For example, the NYT style manual (Siegal and Connolly, 1999) states that ?Commas should be used in compound sentences before conjunctions...",
        "When the clauses are exceptionally short, however, the comma may be omitted.?",
        "Adding a feature that measures clause length might help, but even then the classifier must rely on training data that may have considerable variation as to what length of clauses requires an intervening comma.",
        "(6) They wants to see their portfolio, and what kind of skill do they have for company.",
        "(7) I have many things but the best is my parents.",
        "Another facet of the data that consistently challenges the system is the existence of errors other than the commas in the sentences.",
        "Consider the sentence in (8), where erroneous is the original text from the essay and corrected is a well-formed interpretation.",
        "(8) erroneous: In the other hand , having just one specific subject , which represents a great downfall for many students corrected: On the other hand, knowing only one subject is a downfall for many students.",
        "The comma after subject is unnecessary, but so is the word which.",
        "In fact, which would normally signify the beginning of a non-restrictive clause in this context, which should be set off with a comma.",
        "It is no surprise then, that the system has trouble removing commas in these types of contexts.",
        "At least 11 of the 62 system mistakes that we examined have grammatical errors in the immediate context of the comma in question, which makes the classification more difficult."

        "We presented a novel comma error correction system for English that achieves an average of 89% precision and 25% recall on essays written by learners of different levels and language backgrounds, including native English speakers.",
        "The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of comma restoration, beating previous systems?",
        "F-score and sentence accuracy by 4% and 7%, respectively.",
        "We discovered that augmenting lexical features, which have been commonly used in previous work, with the combination and distance features can improve F-score by as much as 1% in both the error correction and comma restoration tasks.",
        "We also developed and implemented a novel comma error annotation scheme.",
        "Additionally, we are interested in the effect of correct comma placement on other NLP processes.",
        "Jones (1994) and Briscoe and Carroll (1995) show that adding punctuation to grammars that utilize part-of-speech (POS) tags, rather than lexical items, adds more structure and reduces ambiguity as well as the number of parses for each sentence.",
        "Similarly, Doran (1998) and White and Rajkumar (2008) found that adding punctuation improved parsing results in tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) and combinatorial categorial grammar (CCG) parsing, respectively.",
        "These studies all highlight the importance of correctly inserted punctuation, especially commas, for parsing.",
        "Given these results, we believe that by enhancing the quality of the text, comma error correction will improve not only tagging and parsing, but also the ability of systems to correct many other forms of grammatical errors, such as those involving incorrect word order, number disagreement, and misuse of prepositions, articles, and collocations."
