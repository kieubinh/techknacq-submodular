        "First story detection (FSD), sometimes also called new event detection (NED), is the task of detecting the first story about a new event from a stream of documents.",
        "It began as one of the tasks in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) (Allan, 2002) where the overall goal of the project was to improve technologies related to event-based information organization tasks.",
        "Of the five TDT tasks, first story detection is considered the most difficult one (Allan et al., 2000a).",
        "A good FSD system would be very useful for business or intelligence analysts where timely discovery of events is crucial.",
        "With the significant increase in the amount of information being produced and consumed every day, a crucial requirement for a modern FSD system to be useful is efficiency.",
        "This means that the system should be able to work in a streaming setting where documents are constantly coming in at a high rate, while still producing good results.",
        "While previous work has addressed the efficiency (Petrovic?",
        "et al, 2010) aspect, there has been little work on improving FSD performance in the past few years.",
        "A major obstacle is the high degree of lexical variation in documents that cover the same event.",
        "Here we address this problem, while keeping in mind the efficiency constraints.",
        "The problem of lexical variation plagues many IR and NLP tasks, and one way it has been addressed in the past is through the use of paraphrases.",
        "Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing the same meaning in the same language.",
        "For example, the phrase he got married can be paraphrased as he tied the knot.",
        "Paraphrases were already shown to help in a number of tasks: for machine translation to translate unknown phrases by translating their paraphrases (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), for query expansion in information retrieval (Spa?rck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jones et al., 2006), or for improving question answering (Riezler et al., 2007).",
        "A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Here, we present the first work to use paraphrases for improving first story detection.",
        "Using paraphrases, we are able to detect that some documents previously thought to be about new events are actually paraphrases of the documents already",
        "seen.",
        "Our approach is simple and we show a novel way of integrating paraphrases with locality sensitive hashing (LSH) (Indyk and Motwani, 1998).",
        "This way we obtain a very efficient FSD system with all the benefits of using paraphrases, while avoiding computationally expensive topic modeling approaches such as Ahmed et al. (2011).",
        "First story detection was introduced as a task before the popularization of social media.",
        "Event detection in social media, especially Twitter is a very good fit: we cover a much larger set of events than would be possible by using newswire, and the stories are reported in real time, often much sooner than in news.",
        "Of course, social media carries additional problems not found in traditional media: we have to deal with huge amounts of data, the data is very noisy (both due to spam and due to spelling and grammar errors), and in the case of Twitter, documents are extremely short.",
        "There has been little effort in solving these problems for FSD.",
        "Arguably the main reason for this is the lack of a TDT-style corpus for Twitter that researchers could use to test their approaches.",
        "Here we build such a corpus and use it to measure the performance of TDT systems on Twitter.",
        "Our main contributions are: i) we create a first corpus of events on Twitter, ii) we show how to use paraphrases in FSD, and how to combine it with LSH to handle high-volume streams, iii) our unsupervised system that uses paraphrases achieves the highest reported results on the TDT5 corpus, beating both the supervised and unsupervised state of the art, while still keeping a constant per-document time complexity, and iv) we show that paraphrases also help in Twitter, although less than in TDT."

        "UMass 1000 is the run that was submitted as the official run in the TDT competition.6 We can see that using paraphrases improves the results over the unsupervised state of the art, regardless of which source of paraphrasing is used.",
        "However, it is clear that not all types of paraphrases are equally helpful.",
        "In particular, the automatically extracted paraphrases from Callison-Burch (2008) seem to be the most helpful, and by using them our unsupervised system is able to beat even the best known supervised FSD system.",
        "This is a very promising result because it indicates that we can use automatically extracted paraphrases and do not have to rely on hand-crafted resources like Wordnet as our source of paraphrases.",

        "et al (2010), but in practice it is somewhat slower because hashing the expanded documents takes more time.",

        "How does quality of paraphrases affect results?",
        "We have shown that using automatically obtained paraphrases to expand documents is beneficial in first story detection.",
        "Because there are different ways of extracting paraphrases, some of which are targeted more towards recall, and some towards precision, we want to know which techniques would be more suitable to extract paraphrases for use in FSD.",
        "Here, precision is the ratio between extracted word pairs that are actual paraphrases and all the word pairs extracted, and recall is the ratio between extracted word pairs that are actual paraphrases, and all the possible paraphrase pairs that could have been extracted.",
        "In this experiment we focus on the syntactic paraphrases which yielded the best results.",

        "there is an initial drop in performance when we remove the first 10% of paraphrases, but after that removing more paraphrases does not affect performance very much.",
        "On the other hand, changing the precision has a bigger impact on the results.",
        "For example, we can see that our system using a paraphrase corpus with 30% of pairs added at random performs even better than the system that uses the original corpus.",
        "On the other hand, adding 20% of random pairs performs substantially worse than the original corpus.",

        "We make some Twitter-specific modification to the baseline system that slightly improve the results.",

        "While removing links and @-mentions was also done in (Petrovic?",
        "et al, 2010), our preliminary experiments showed that keeping hashtags, only without the hash sign improves the results.",

        "Results for the different systems are shown in Table 3.",
        "First, we can see that not using stemming is much better than using it, which is the opposite from what is the case in TDT.",

        "Syntactic paraphrases and the MSR paraphrases do not help, whereas the paraphrases extracted from Wordnet did improve the results, although the gains are not as large as in TDT.",
        "A paired t-test revealed that none of the differences between the baseline system and the systems that use paraphrases were significant at p = 0.05.",
        "To gain more insight into why the results are different here, we look at the proportion of words in the documents that are being paraphrased, i.e., the coverage of the paraphrasing resource.",
        "We can see from Table 4 that the situation in TDT and Twitter is very different.",
        "Coverage of MSR and syntactic paraphrases was lower in Twitter than in TDT, whereas Wordnet coverage was better on Twitter.",

        "To illustrate how paraphrases help detect old tweets, consider the tweet According to Russian aviation officials, two passengers survived the crash, but are in critical condition.",
        "Before paraphrasing, the closest tweet returned by our system was Shaz-aad Hussein has died in Birmingham after being run over, two others are in critical condition, which is not very related.",
