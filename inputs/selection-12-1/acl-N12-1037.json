        "In a typical foreign language education classroom setting, teachers are presented with student essays that are often fraught with errors.",
        "These errors can be grammatical, semantic, stylistic, simple spelling errors, etc.",
        "One task of the teacher is to isolate these errors and provide feedback to the student with corrections.",
        "In this body of work, we address the possibility of augmenting this process with NLP tools and techniques, in the spirit of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL).",
        "We propose a stepwise approach in which a teacher first corrects an essay and then a computer program aligns their output with the original text and separates and classifies independent edits.",
        "With the program's analysis the teacher would be provided accurate information that could be used in effective lesson planning tailored to the students?",
        "strengths and weaknesses.",
        "This suggests a novel NLP task with two components: The first isolates individual corrections made by the teacher, and the second classifies these corrections into error types that the teacher would find useful.",
        "A suitable corpus for developing this program is the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).",
        "The CLC contains approximately 1200 essays with error corrections annotated in XML within sentences.",
        "Furthermore, these corrections are tagged with linguistically motivated error type codes.",
        "To the best of our knowledge our proposed task is unexplored in previous work.",
        "However, there is a significant amount of related work in automated grammatical error correction (Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Gamon, 2011; West et al., 2011).",
        "The Helping Our Own (HOO) shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) also explores this issue, with Rozovskaya et al.",
        "(2011) as the best performing system to date.",
        "While often addressing the problem of error type selection directly, previous work has dealt with the more obviously useful task of end to end error detection and correction.",
        "As such, their classification systems are crippled by poor recall of errors as well as the lack of information from the corrected sentence and yield very low accuracies for error detection and type selection, e.g. Gamon (2011).",
        "Our task is fundamentally different as we assume the presence of both the original and corrected text.",
        "While the utility of such a system is not as obvious as full error correction, we note two possible applications of our technique.",
        "The first, mentioned",
        "above, is as an analytical tool for language teachers.",
        "The second is as a complementary tool for automated error correction systems themselves.",
        "Just as tools such as BLAST (Stymne, 2011) are useful in the development of machine translation systems, our system can produce accurate summaries of the corrections made by automated systems even if the systems themselves do not involve such fine grained error type analysis.",
        "In the following, we describe our experimental methodology (Section 2) and then discuss the feature set we employ for classification (Section 3) and its performance.",
        "Next, we outline our application (Section 4), its heuristic correction detection strategy and empirical evaluation.",
        "We finish by discussing the implications for real world systems (Section 5) and avenues for improvement."

        "Sentences in the CLC contain one or more error corrections, each of which is labeled with one of 75 error types (Nicholls, 2003).",
        "Error types include countability errors, verb tense errors, word order errors, etc.",
        "and are often predicated on the part of speech involved.",
        "For example, the category AG (agreement) is augmented to form AGN (agreement of a noun) to tag an error such as ?here are some of my opinion?.",
        "For ease of analysis and due to the high accuracy of state-of-the-art POS tagging, in addition to the full 75 class problem we also perform experiments using a compressed set of 15 classes.",
        "This compressed set removes the part of speech components of the error types as shown in Figure 1.",
        "We create a dataset of corrections from the CLC by extracting sentence pairs (x, y) where x is the original (student?s) sentence and y is its corrected form by the teacher.",
        "We create multiple instances out of sentence pairs that contain multiple corrections.",
        "For example, consider the sentence ?With this letter I would ask you if you wuld change it?.",
        "This consists of two errors: ?ask?",
        "should be replaced with ?like to ask?",
        "and ?wuld?",
        "is misspelled.",
        "These are marked separately in the CLC, and imply the corrected sentence ?With this letter I would like to ask you if you would change it?.",
        "Here we extract two instances consisting of ?With this letter I would ask you if you would change it?",
        "and ?With this letter I would like to ask if you wuld change it?, each paired with the fully corrected sentence.",
        "As each correction in the CLC is tagged with an error type t, we then form a dataset of triples (x, y, t).",
        "This yields 45080 such instances.",
        "We use these data in cross-validation experiments with the feature based MaxEnt classifier in the Mallet (McCallum, 2002) software package."

        "), (Insert, ?to?",
        "), (Substitute, ?wuld?, ?would?",
        "), and (Equal, w, w) for all other words w. Our feature set consists of three main categories and a global category (See Figure 2).",

        "The most common confusion in the 15 class case is between D (Derivation), R (Replacement) and S (Spelling).",
        "These are mainly due to context-sensitive spelling corrections falling into the Replace category or noise in the mark-up of derivation errors.",
        "For the 75 class case the most common confusion is between agreement of noun (AGN) and form of noun (FN).",
        "This is unsurprising as we do not incorporate long distance features which would encode agreement.",
