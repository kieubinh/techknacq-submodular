        "Words exist independently of writing, as abstract entities shared among the speakers of a language.",
        "Those abstract entities have various representations, which in turn may have different realizations.",
        "Orthographic forms, phonetic transcriptions, alternative transliterations, and even sound-wave spectrograms are all related by referring to the same abstract word and they all convey information about its pronunciation.",
        "Figure 1 shows various representations of the word Dickens.",
        "The primary (canonical) orthographic representation of the word corresponds to the language to which the word belongs.",
        "The secondary orthographic representations in different writing scripts are transliterations of the word, which exhibit phono",
        "various word representations.",
        "The tasks on which we focus are shown in black.",
        "logical adaptation to the target language.",
        "The various phonetic transcriptions consist of sequences of phonemes representing the pronunciation of the word.",
        "Transcription schemes may differ in the number and coverage of various phonemes, as well as the choice of the underlying speech variety.",
        "The spoken pronunciation (represented by the waveform) presents a common latent influence on the representations.",
        "Several well-known NLP tasks involve matching, alignment, and conversion between different word representations.",
        "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) aims at generating a transcription of a word from its orthographic representation.",
        "The reverse task is phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (P2G).",
        "Machine transliteration (MTL) deals with conversion between orthographic representations in different writing scripts; forward transliteration proceeds from the primary representation to secondary representations, while the reverse task is called back-transliteration (BTL).",
        "The conversion between a sound and an orthography is the goal of text-to-speech synthesis",
        "(TTS) and speech recognition (SR), where transcriptions are often used as intermediate forms.",
        "Although both MTL and G2P take orthographic representations as input, the two tasks are rarely considered in conjunction.",
        "Traditionally, G2P has been investigated in the context of text-to-speech systems, while MTL is of interest to the information retrieval andmachine translation communities.",
        "In addition, unlike phonetic transcription schemes, which are often specific to a particular pronunciation lexicon, writing systems are well-standardized, with plenty of transliteration examples available in text corpora and on the Web (Kumaran et al., 2010b).",
        "While the goal of G2P is producing a maximally faithful representation of the pronunciation, transliterations are often influenced by other factors, such as the phonological constraints of the target language, the orthographic form in the source language, the morphological adaptations related to the translation process, and even the semantic connotations of the output in the case of lo-gographic scripts.",
        "In spite of those differences, both transcriptions and transliterations contain valuable information about the pronunciation of the word.",
        "In this paper, we show that it is possible to improve the accuracy of both G2P and MTL by incorporating supplemental representations of the word pronunciation.",
        "Our method is based on SVM reranking of the n-best output lists of a base transduction system, with features including similarity scores between representations and n-grams derived from accurate alignments.",
        "We describe a series of experiments in both G2P and MTL contexts, demonstrating substantial reductions in error rate for these base tasks when augmented with various supplemental representations.",
        "We then further test the effectiveness of the same approach for combining the results of two independent base systems."
