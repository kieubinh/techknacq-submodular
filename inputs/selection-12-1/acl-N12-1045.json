        "Nonparametric Bayesian modeling has recently become very popular in natural language processing (NLP), mostly because of its ability to provide pri-ors that are especially suitable for tasks in NLP (Teh, 2006).",
        "Using nonparametric priors enables to treat the size of the model as a random variable with its value to be induced during inference which makes its use very appealing in models that need to decide upon the number of states.",
        "The task of unsupervised parts-of-speech (POS) tagging has been under research in numerous papers, for overview see (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "Most of the POS induction models use the structure of hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989) that requires the knowledge about the number of hidden states (corresponding to the number of tags) in advance.",
        "According to our considerations, supplying this information is not desirable for two opposing reasons: 1) it injects into the system a piece of knowledge which in a truly unsupervised setting would be unavailable; and 2) the number of POS tags used is somewhat arbitrary anyway because there is no common consensus of what should be the true number of tags in each language and therefore it seems unreasonable to constrain the model with such a number instead of learning it from the data.",
        "Unsupervised morphology learning is another popular task that has been extensively studied by many authors.",
        "Here we are interested in learning concatenative morphology of words, meaning the substrings of the word corresponding to morphemes that, when concatenated, will give the lexical representation of the word type.",
        "For the rest of the paper we will refer to this task as (morphological) segmentation.",
        "Several unsupervised POS induction systems make use of morphological features (Blunsom and Cohn, 2011; Lee et al., 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Clark, 2003; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011) and this approach has been empirically proved to be helpful (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "In a similar fashion one could think that knowing POS tags could be useful for learning morphological segmentations and in this paper we will study this hypothesis.",
        "In this paper we will build a model that combines POS induction and morphological segmentation into one learning problem.",
        "We will show that the unsupervised learning of both of these tasks in the same",
        "model will lead to better results than learning both tasks separately with the gold standard data of the other task provided.",
        "We will also demonstrate that our model produces state-of-the-art results on POS tagging.",
        "As opposed to the compared methods, our model also induces the number of tags from data.",
        "In the following, section 2 gives the overview of the Dirichlet Processes, section 3 describes the model setup followed by the description of inference procedures in section 4, experimental results are presented in section 5, section 6 summarizes the previous work and last section concludes the paper."

        "Our segmentation model is in principle the same as the unigram word segmentation model and the main difference is that we are using blocked sampler while (Goldwater et al., 2009) uses point-wise Gibbs sampler by drawing the presence or absence of the word border between every two characters.",

        "In this paper we presented a joint unsupervised model for learning POS tags and morphological segmentations with hierarchical Dirichlet Process model.",
        "Our model induces the number of POS clusters from data and does not contain any hand-tuned parameters.",
        "We tested the model on many languages and showed that by introcing a likelihood scaling heuristic it produces state-of-the-art POS induction results.",
        "We believe that the tagging results could further be improved by adding additional features concerning punctuation, capitalization etc.",
        "which are heavily used in the other state-of-the-art POS induction systems but these features were intentionally left out in the current model for enabling to test the concept of joint modelling of two dependent tasks.",
        "We found some evidence that the tasks of POS induction and morphological segmentation are dependent by conducting semisupervised experiments where we gave the model gold standard tags and segmentations in turn and let it learn only segmentations or tags respectively and found that the results in fully unsupervised setting are better.",
        "Despite of that, the model failed to learn as good segmentations as the state-of-the-art morphological segmentation model Morfessor.",
        "One way to improve the segmentation results could be to use segment bigrams instead of unigrams.",
        "The model can serve as a basis for several further extensions.",
        "For example, one possibility would be to expand it into multilingual setting in a fashion of (Naseem et al., 2009), or it could be extended to add the joint learning of morphological paradigms of the words given their tags and segmentations in a manner described by (Dreyer and Eisner, 2011)."
