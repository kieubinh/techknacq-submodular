        "Then, the algorithm iterates over unlabeled sentences and asks only for a single bit of feedback, rather than a full parse tree.",
        "Specifically, given an example the algorithm outputs two possible parse trees and receives only a single bit indicating which of the two alternatives has more correct edges.",
        "There is no direct information about the correctness of any edge.",
        "We show on dependency parsing tasks in 14 languages that with only 1% of fully labeled data, and light-feedback on the remaining 99% of the training data, our algorithm achieves, on average, only 5% lower performance than when training with fully annotated training set.",

        "Supervised learning is a dominant paradigm in machine learning in which a prediction model is built based on examples, each of which is composed of inputs and a corresponding full annotation.",
        "In the task of parsing, examples are composed of sentences in some language and associated with full parse trees.",
        "These parse trees are often generated by human annotators.",
        "The annotation process is complex, slow and prone to mistakes as for each sentence a full correct feedback is required.",
        "We describe light-feedback learning which suits learning problems with complex or structured output, like parsing.",
        "After building an initial classifier, our algorithm reduces the work of the annotator from a full annotation of the input sentence to a single bit of information.",
        "Specifically, it provides the annotator with two alternative parses of the input sentence and asks for the single bit indicating which of the alternatives is better.",
        "In 95% of the sentences both alternatives are identical except for a single word.",
        "See Fig. 2 for an illustration.",
        "Thus, the work of the annotator boils down to deciding for some specific word in the sentence which of two possible words should be that word's head.",
        "We show empirically, through simulation, that using only 1% of the training set with full annotation, and the remaining 99% with light annotation, our algorithm achieves an average accuracy of about 80%, only 5% less than a parser built with full annotated training data.",
        "These results are averaged over 14 languages.",
        "With additional simple relaxations, our algorithm achieves average accuracy of 82.5%, not far from the performance of an algorithm observing full annotation of the data.",
        "We also evaluate our algorithm under few noise settings, showing that it is resistant to noise, with a decrease of only 1.5% in accuracy under about 10% feedback noise.",
        "We defer a discussion of related work to the end of the paper."

        "Many algorithms, including MSTParser, explicitly assume this kind of feedback.",
        "Supervised learning algorithms achieve good performance in dependency parsing, but they come with a price.",
        "Human annotators are required to fully parse each and every sentence in the corpora, a long, tedious and expensive process, which is also prone to mistakes.",
        "For example, the first phase of the famous penn tree bank project (Marcus et al., 1993) lasted three years, in which annotators corrected outputs of automated machines in a rate of 475 words per hour.",
        "For supervised learning to be successful, typically a large set of thousands instances is required, which translates to a long and expensive annotation phase.",
        "Binary or multi-class prediction tasks, such as spam filtering or document classification, are simple in the sense that the label associated with each instance or input is simple.",
        "It is either a single bit indicating whether the input email is spam or not, or one of few values from a fixed predefined set if topics.",
        "Dependency parsing is more complex as a decision is required for every word of the sentence, and additionally there is a global constraint of the parse being a tree.",
        "In binary classification or multi-class problems it is only natural to either annotate (or label) an example, or not, since the labels are atomic, they cannot be decomposed to smaller components.",
        "The situation is different in structured tasks such as dependency parsing (or sequence labeling) where each instance is constructed of many elements that each needs to be annotated.",
        "While there are relations and",
        "coupling between the elements it is possible to annotate an instance only partially, such as provide a dependency edge only to several words in a sentence.",
        "We take this approach to the extreme, and consider (for now) that for each sentence only a single bit of labeling will be provided.",
        "The choice of what bit to require is algorithm and example dependent.",
        "We propose using a light feedback scheme in order to significantly reduce annotation effort for dependency parsing.",
        "First, a base or initial model will be learned from a very small set of fully annotated examples, i.e. sentences with full dependency information known.",
        "Then, in a second training stage the algorithm works in rounds.",
        "On each round the algorithm is provided with a new non-annotated sentence which it annotates, hopefully making the right decision for most of the words.",
        "Then the algorithm chooses subset of the words (or segments) to be annotated by humans.",
        "These words are the ones that algorithm estimates to be the hardest, or that their true label would resolve any ambiguity that is currently existing with the parsing of the input sentence.",
        "Although such partial annotation task may be easier and faster to annotate, we realize that even partial annotation if not limited enough can require eventually similar effort as annotating the entire sentence.",
        "For example, if for a 25-words sentence annotation is requested for 5 words scattered over the entire sentence, providing this annotation may require the annotator to basically parse the entire sentence.",
        "We thus further restrict the possible feedback requested from the annotator.",
        "Specifically, given a new sentence our algorithm outputs two possible annotations, or parse trees, y?A and y?B , and asks for a single bit from the annotator, indicating whether parse A is better or parse B is better.",
        "We do not ask the annotator to parse the actual sentence, or decide what is the correct parse, but only to state which of the parses is quantitatively better.",
        "Formally, we say that parse y?A is better if it contains more correct edges than y?B .",
        "The annotator is asked for a single bit, and thus must state one of the two parses, even if both parses are equally good.",
        "We denote this labeling paradigm as binary, as the annotator provides binary feedback.",
        "The two parses our algorithms presents to the annotator are the highest ranking parse and the second highest ranking parse according to the current model.",
        "That is, the parse it would output for x and the best alternative.",
        "The feedback required from the annotator is only which of the two parses is better, the annotator does not explicitly indicate which of the edges are labeled correctly or incorrectly, and furthermore, the annotator does not provide any explicit information about the correct edge of any of the words.",
        "In general, the two alternative parses presented to the annotator may be significantly different from each other; they may disagree on the edges of many words.",
        "In this case the task of deciding which of them is better may be as hard as annotating the entire sentence, and then comparing the resulting annotation to both alternatives.",
        "In practice, however, due to our choice of features (as functions of the two words) and model (linear), and since our algorithm chooses the two parse-trees ranked highest and second highest, the difference between the two alternatives is very small.",
        "In fact, we found empirically that, on average, in 95% of the sentences, they differ in the labeling of only a single word.",
        "That is, both y?A and y?B agree on all words, except some word xi, for which the first alternative assigns to some word xj and the second alternative assign to other word xk.",
        "This is due to the fact that the score of the parses are additive in the edges.",
        "Therefore, the parse tree ranked second highest is obtained from the highest-ranked parse tree, where for a single word the edge is replaced, such that the difference between scores is minimized.",
        "For the remaining 5% of the sentences, replacing an edge as described causes a loop in the graph induced over words, and thus more than a single edge is modified.",
        "To minimize the potential labor of the annotator we simply ignore these cases, and present the annotator only two alternatives which are different in a single edge.",
        "We refer to this setting or scenario as single.",
