        "After describing our annotation scheme, we discuss the co-reference models we learn from multi-modal features.",
        "The usage of haptic-ostensive actions in a co-reference model is a novel contribution of our work."

        "Co-reference resolution has received a lot of attention.",
        "However, as Eisenstein and Davis (2006) noted, most research on co-reference resolution has focused on written text.",
        "This task is much more difficult in dialogue, especially in multi-modal dialogue contexts.",
        "First, utterances are informal, ungrammatical and disfluent.",
        "Second, people spontaneously use gestures and other body language.",
        "As noticed by Kehler (2000), Goldin-Meadow (2003), and Chen et al. (2011), in a multi-modal corpus, the antecedents of referring expressions are often introduced via gestures.",
        "Whereas the role played by pointing gestures in referring has been studied, the same is not true for other types of gestures.",
        "In this paper, alongside pointing gestures, we will discuss the role played by Haptic-Ostensive (H-O) actions, i.e., referring to an object by manipulating it in the world (Landragin et al., 2002; Foster et al., 2008).",
        "As far as we know, no computational models of co-reference have been developed that include HO actions: (Landragin et al., 2002) focused on perceptual salience and (Foster et al., 2008) on generation rather than interpretation.",
        "We should point out that at the time of writing we only focus on resolving third person pronouns and deictics.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe our multi-modal annotation scheme.",
        "In Section 3 we present the pronoun/deictic resolution system.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss experiments and results."

      "text": [
        "The dataset we use in this paper is a subset of the ELDERLY-AT-HOME corpus (Di Eugenio et al., 2010), a multi-modal corpus in the domain of elderly care.",
        "It contains 20 human-human dialogues.",
        "In each dialogue, a helper (HEL) and an elderly person (ELD) performed Activities of Daily Living (Krapp, 2002), such as getting up from chairs, finding pots, cooking pastas, in a realistic setting, a studio apartment used for teaching and research.",
        "The corpus contains videos and voice data in avi format, haptics data collected via instrumented gloves in csv format, and the transcribed utterances in xml format.",
        "We focused on specific subdialogues in this corpus, that we call Find tasks: a Find task is a continuous time span during which the two subjects were collaborating on finding objects.",
        "Find tasks arise naturally while helping perform ADLs such as preparing dinner.",
        "An excerpt from a Find task is shown below, including annotations for pointing gestures and for HO actions (annotations are per",
        "formed via the Anvil tool (Kipp, 2001)).",
        "ELD : Can you get me a pot?",
        "HEL: (opens cabinet, takes out pot, without saying a word) [Open(HEL,Cabinet1),Take-Out(HEL,Pot1)] ELD: Not that one, try over there.",
        "[Point(ELD,Cabinet5)] Because the targets of pointing gestures and HO actions are real life objects, we designed a referring index system to annotate them.",
        "The referring index system consists of compile time indices and run time indices.",
        "We give predefined indices to targets which cannot be moved, like cabinets, drawers, fridge.",
        "We assign run time indices to targets which can be moved, and exist in multiple copies, like cups, glasses.",
        "A referring index consists of a type and an index; the index increases according to the order of appearance in the dialogue.",
        "For example, ?Pot#1?",
        "means the first pot referred to in the dialogue.",
        "If a pointing gesture or HO action involved multiple objects, we used JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)1 Array to mark it.",
        "For example, [C#1, C#2] means Cabinet#1 and Cabinet#2.",
        "We define a pointing gesture as a hand gesture without physical contact with the target, whereas gestures that involve physical contact with an object are haptic-obstensive (H-O).2 We use four tracks in Anvil to mark these gestures, two for pointing gestures, and two for HO actions.",
        "In each pair of tracks, one track is used for HEL, one for ELD.",
        "For both types of gestures, we mark the start time, end time and the target(s) of the gesture using the referring index system we introduced above.",
        "Additionally we mark the type of an HO action: Touch, Hold, Take-Out (as in taking out an object from a cabinet or the fridge), Close, Open.3 Our co-reference annotation follows an approach similar to (Eisenstein and Davis, 2006).",
        "We mark the pronouns and deictics which need to be resolved, their antecedents, and the co-reference links between them.",
        "To mark pronouns, deictics and textual antecedents, we use the shallow parser from",
        "a pot with water: these actions are not included among the HO actions, and are annotated separately.",
        "Apache OpenNLP Tools 4 to chunk the utterances in each turn.",
        "We use heuristics rules to automatically mark potential textual antecedents and the phrases we need to resolve.",
        "Afterwards we use Anvil to edit the results of automatic processing.",
        "To annotate co-reference links, we first assign each of the textual antecedents, the pointing gestures and HO actions a unique markable index.",
        "Finally, we link referring expressions to their closest antecedent (if applicable) using the markable indices.",
        "Table 1 shows corpus and annotation statistics.",
        "We annotated 142 Find subtasks, whose total length is about 1 hour and 24 minutes.",
        "This sub-corpus comprises 1746 spoken turns, which include 8213 words.",
        "10% of the 8213 words (827 words) are pronouns or deictics.",
        "Note that for only 757/827 (92%) were the annotators able to determine an antecedent.",
        "Interestingly, 71% of those 757 pronouns or deictics refer to specific antecedents that are introduced exclusively by gestures, either pointing or HO actions.",
        "In the earlier example, only the type for the referent of that in No, not that one had been introduced textually, but not its specific antecedent pot1.",
        "Clearly, to be effective on such data any model of co-reference must include the targets of pointing gestures and HO actions.",
        "Our current model does not take into account the type provided by the de dicto interpretation of indefinites such as a pot above, but we intend to address this issue in future work.",
        "In order to verify the reliability of our annotations, we double coded 15% of the data for pointing gestures and HO actions, namely the dialogues from",
