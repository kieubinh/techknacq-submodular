        "Since its introduction, the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) method has been the most popular method used for parameter tuning in machine translation.",
        "Although MERT has nice properties such as simplicity, effectiveness and speed, it is known to not scale well for systems with large numbers of features.",
        "One alternative that has been used for large numbers of features is the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Chiang et al., 2008).",
        "MIRA works well with a large number of features, but the optimization problem is much more complicated than MERT.",
        "MIRA also involves some modifications to the decoder itself to produce hypotheses with high scores against gold translations.",
        "Hopkins and May (2011) introduced the method of pairwise ranking optimization (PRO), which casts the problem of tuning as a ranking problem between pairs of translation candidates.",
        "The problem is solved by doing a binary classification between ?correctly ordered?",
        "and ?incorrectly ordered?",
        "pairs.",
        "Hopkins and May (2011) use the maximum entropy classifier MegaM (Daume?",
        "III, 2004) to do the binary classification.",
        "Their method compares well to the results of MERT, scales better for high dimensional feature spaces, and is simpler than MIRA.",
        "In this paper, we use the same idea for tuning, but, instead of using a classifier, we use linear regression.",
        "Linear regression is simpler than maximum entropy based methods.",
        "The most complex computation that it needs is a matrix inversion, whereas maximum entropy based classifiers use iterative numerical optimization methods.",
        "We implemented a parameter tuning program with linear regression and compared the results to PRO's results.",
        "The results of our experiments are comparable to PRO, and in many cases (also on average) we get a better maximum BLEU score.",
        "We also observed that on average, our method reaches the maximum BLEU score in a smaller number of iterations.",
        "The contributions of this paper include: First, we show that linear regression tuning is an effective method for tuning, and it is comparable to tuning with a binary maximum entropy classifier.",
        "Second, we show linear regression is faster in terms of the number of iterations it needs to reach the best results.",
        "2 Tuning as Ranking The parameter tuning problem in machine translation is finding the feature weights of a linear translation model that maximize the scores of the candidate translations measured against reference translations.",
        "Hopkins and May (2011) introduce a tuning method based on ranking the candidate translation pairs, where the goal is to learn how to rank pairs of candidate translations using a gold scoring function.",
        "PRO casts the tuning problem as the problem of ranking pairs of sentences.",
        "This method iteratively generates lists of ?k-best?",
        "candidate translations for each sentence, and tunes the weight vector for those candidates.",
        "MERT finds the weight vector that maximizes the score for the highest scored candidate translations.",
        "In contrast, PRO finds the weight vector which classifies pairs of candidate translations into ?correctly ordered?",
        "and ?incorrectly ordered,?",
        "based on the gold scoring function.",
        "While MERT only considers the highest scored candidate to tune the weights, PRO uses the entire k-best list to learn the ranking between the pairs, which can help prevent overfitting.",
        "Let g(e) be a scoring function that maps each translation candidate e to a number (score) using a set of reference translations.",
        "The most commonly used gold scoring function in machine translation is the BLEU score, which is calculated for the entire corpus, rather than for individual sentences.",
        "To use BLEU as our gold scoring function, we need to modify it to make it decomposable for single sentences.",
        "One way to do this is to use a variation of BLEU called BLEU+1 (Lin and Och, 2004), which is a smoothed version of the BLEU score.",
        "We assume that our machine translation system scores translations by using a scoring function which is a linear combination of the features:",
        "where w is the weight vector and x is the feature vector.",
        "The goal of tuning as ranking is learning weights such that for every two candidate translations e1 and e2, the following inequality holds:",
        "This problem can be viewed as a binary classification problem for learning w, where each data point is the difference vector between the feature vectors of a pair of translation candidates, and the target of the point is the sign of the difference between their gold scores (BLEU+1).",
        "PRO uses the MegaM classifier to solve this problem.",
        "MegaM is a binary maximum entropy classifier which returns the weight vector w as a linear classifier.",
        "Using this method, Hopkins and May (2011) tuned the weight vectors for various translation systems.",
        "The results were close to MERT's and MIRA's results in terms of BLEU score, and the method was shown to scale well to high dimensional feature spaces."

        "One important difference between the linear regression method and PRO is that rather than using the signs of the gold score differences and doing a binary classification, we use the differences of the gold scores directly, which allows us to use the information about the magnitude of the differences."

        "Each pair is kept as a potential data point if their BLEU+1 score difference is bigger than 0.05 (t = 0.05).",

        "For each initial weight vector, we selected the iteration at which the BLEU score on the development set is highest, and then decoded using this weight vector on the test set.",

        "In comparison with MERT, PRO and linear regression are different in the sense that the latter two approaches take into account rankings of the k-best list, whereas MERT is only concerned with separating the top 1-best sentence from the rest of the k-best list.",
        "PRO and linear regression are similar in the sense that both are concerned with ranking the k-best list.",
        "Their difference lies in the fact that PRO only uses the information on the relative rankings and uses binary classification to rank the points; on the contrary, linear regression directly uses the information on the magnitude of the differences.",
        "This difference between PRO and linear regression explains why linear regression converges faster and also may explain the fact that linear regression achieves a somewhat higher BLEU score.",
        "In this sense, linear regression is also similar to MIRA since MIRA's loss function also uses the information on the magnitude of score difference.",
        "However, the optimization problem for linear regression is simpler, does not require any changes to the decoder, and therefore the familiar MERT framework can be kept.",
