        "Determining the reading level of children's literature is an important task for providing educators and parents with an appropriate reading trajectory through a curriculum.",
        "Automating this process has been a challenge addressed before in the computational linguistics literature, with most studies attempting to predict the particular grade level of a text.",
        "However, guided reading levels developed by educators operate at a more fine-grained level, with multiple levels corresponding to each grade.",
        "We find that ranking performs much better than classification at the fine-grained leveling task, and that features derived from the visual layout of a book are just as predictive as standard text features of level; including both sets of features, we find that we can predict the reading level up to 83% of the time on a small corpus of children's books."

        "Determining the reading level of a text has received significant attention in the literature, dating back to simple arithmetic metrics to assess the reading level based on syllable counts (Flesch, 1948).",
        "In the computational linguistics community, several projects have attempted to determine the grade level of a text (2nd/3rd/4th/etc).",
        "However, the education community typically makes finer distinctions in reading levels, with each grade being covered by multiple levels.",
        "Moreover, there are multiple scales within the educational community; for example 1st grade is approximately covered by levels 3?14 on the Reading Recovery scale,1 or levels C to H in the Fountas and Pinnell leveling system.2 For grade-level assessment, classification and regression approaches have been very promising.",
        "However, it is not clear that an increased number of classes will allow classification techniques to succeed with a more fine-grained leveling system.",
        "Similarly, regression techniques may have problems if the reading levels are not linearly distributed.",
        "In this work, we investigate a ranking approach to book leveling, and apply this to a fine-grained leveling problem for Kindergarten through 2nd grade books.",
        "The ranking approach also allows us to be more agnostic to the particular leveling system: for the vast majority of pairs of books, different systems will rank the levels of the books the same way, even if the exact differences in levels are not the same.",
        "Since most previous work uses classification techniques, we compare against an SVM multi-class classifier as well as an SVM regression approach.",
        "What has not received much attention in recent research is the visual layout of the page.",
        "Yet, if one walks into a bookstore and rummages through the children's section, it is very easy to tell the reading level of a book just by thumbing through the pages.",
        "Visual clues such as the number of text lines per page, or the area of text boxes relative to the illustrations, or the font size, give instant information to the reader about the reading level of the book.",
        "What is not clear is if this information is sensitive enough to deliver a fine-grained assessment of the book.",
        "While",
        "publishers may have standard guidelines for content providers on visual layout, these guidelines likely differ from publisher to publisher and are not available for the general public.",
        "Moreover, in the digital age teachers are also content providers who do not have access to these guidelines, so our proposed ranking system would be very helpful as they create reading materials such as worksheets, web pages, etc."

        "The predicted reading level of the target book then can be inferred from the reading levels of neighboring leveled books in the rank-ordered list of books (in our experiment, we take into account a window of three books above and below the target book with reading levels weighted by distance).",

        "In this experiment, we look at whether treating book leveling as a ranking problem is promising compared to using classification/regression techniques.",
        "Besides taking a whole book as input, we also experiment with partitioning each book uniformly into 2, 3, or 4 parts, treating each sub-book as an independent entity.",
        "We use a leave-n-out paradigm ?",
        "during each iteration of the training (iterated through all books), the system leaves out all n partitions corresponding to one book and then tests on all partitions corresponding to the held-out book.",
        "By averaging the results for the partitions of the held-out book, we can obtain its predicted reading level.",
        "For ranking, we use the SVMrank ranker (Joachims, 2006), which learns a (sparse) weight vector that minimizes the number of swapped pairs in the training set.",
        "The test book is inserted into the ordering of the training books by the ranking algorithm, and the level is assigned by averaging the levels of the books above and below the order.",
        "To compare the performance of our method with classifiers, we use both SVMmulticlass classifier (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) and SVMlight (with regression learning option) (Joachims, 1999) to determine the level of the book directly.",
        "All systems are given the same set of surface text-based and visual-based features (Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2) as input.",
        "and average error for different numbers of partitions We score the systems in two ways: first, we compute the accuracy of the system by claiming it is correct if the book level is within ?1 of the true level.",
        "The second scoring method is the absolute error of number of levels away from the true value, averaged over all of the books.",
        "As we can observe from Table 1, our ranking system constantly beats the other two approaches (the ranker is statistically significantly better than the classifier at p < 0.05 level ?",
        "figures in bold).",
        "One bit of interesting discovery is that SVM regression needs more data in order to have reliable results, as the performance is downgraded when the number of partitions goes up; the ranking approach benefits from averaging the increasing number of partitions.5 All three methods have the same style of learner (support vector learning), which suggests that the performance gain is due to using a ranking criterion in our method.",
        "Therefore we believe ranking is likely a more effective and accurate method than classification for this task.",
        "One might also wonder how a traditional measure of reading level (in this case, the Flesch-Kincaid (Flesch, 1948) and Spache (Spache, 1953) Grade Level) would hold up for this data.",
        "Flesch-Kincaid and Spache predictions are linearly converted from calculated grade levels to Fountas-Pinnell levels; all of the systems utilizing our full feature set outperform these two baselines by a significant amount on both ?1 accuracy and average leveling error.",
        "4Note that this is still rather fine-grained as there are multiple book levels per grade level.",
        "5We only partition the books up to 4 sub-books because the shortest book we have only contains 4 PDF pages (8 ?book?",
