        "It has been repeatedly shown that ?throwing more data at the problem?",
        "is effective in increasing SMT output quality, both for translation modeling (Dyer et al., 2008) and for language modeling (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we bring together two related research threads to gather parallel sentences for improved translation modeling: cross-lingual pairwise similarity to mine comparable documents and classification to identify sentence pairs that are mutual translations.",
        "Unlike most previous work, which sidesteps the computationally-intensive task of pairwise comparisons to mine comparable documents and instead relies on heuristics, we tackle the challenge head on.",
        "This paper describes a fully open-source, scalable MapReduce-based processing pipeline that is able to automatically extract large quantities of parallel sentences.",
        "Experiments examine the impact data size has on a state-of-the-art SMT system.",
        "We acknowledge that different components of this work are not novel and the general principles behind ?big data?",
        "MT are well known.",
        "However, when considered together with our previous work (Ture et al., 2011), to our knowledge this is the first exposition in which all the pieces have been ?put together?",
        "in an end-to-end pipeline that is accessible to academic research groups.",
        "The framework described in this paper is entirely open source, and the computational resources necessary to replicate our results are relatively modest.",
        "Starting from nothing more than two corpora in different languages (in German and English, in our case), we are able to extract bitext and improve translation quality by a significant margin (2.39 BLEU points), essentially ?for free?.",
        "By varying both the quantity and quality of the bitext, we characterize the tradeoffs between the amount of data, computational costs, and translation quality."

        "The idea of mining parallel sentences, particularly from the web, is of course not new.",
        "Most adopt a two step process: 1. identify comparable documents and generate candidate sentence pairs, and 2. filter candidate pairs to retain parallel sentences.",
        "The general solution to the first step involves computing pairwise similarities across multilingual corpora.",
        "As this is computationally intensive, most",
        "studies fall back to heuristics, e.g., comparing news articles close in time (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), exploiting ?inter-wiki?",
        "links in Wikipedia (Smith et al., 2010), or bootstrapping off an existing search engine (Resnik and Smith, 2003).",
        "In contrast, we adopt a more exhaustive approach by directly tackling the cross-lingual pairwise similarity problem, using MapReduce on a modest cluster.",
        "We perform experiments on German and English Wikipedia (two largest available), but our technique is general and does not depend on sparse, manually-created inter-wiki links.",
        "Thus, compared to those approaches, we achieve much higher recall.",
        "The second step (filtering candidate sentence pairs) is relatively straightforward, and we adopt the classification approach of Munteanu and Marcu (2005).",
        "However, unlike in previous work, we need to classify large volumes of data (due to higher recall in the first step).",
        "Therefore, we care about the relationship between classification accuracy and the speed of the classifier.",
        "Our two-stage approach gives us both high effectiveness (accuracy) and efficiency (speed).",
        "A recent study from Google describes a general solution to our problem that scales to web collections (Uszkoreit et al., 2010).",
        "The authors translate all documents from one language into another, thus transforming the problem into identifying similar monolingual document pairs.",
        "Nevertheless, our approach makes several additional contributions.",
        "First, we explore the effect of dataset size on results.",
        "Our conclusions are more nuanced than simply ?more data is better?, since there is a tradeoff between quality and quantity.",
        "Our experiments involve orders of magnitude less data, but we nevertheless observe significant gains over a strong baseline.",
        "Overall, our approach requires far less computational resources and thus is within the reach of academic research groups: we do not require running an MT system on one side of the entire collection, and we carefully evaluate and control the speed of sentence-classification.",
        "Finally, in support of open science, our code1 and data2 are available as part of Ivory, an open-source Hadoop toolkit for web-scale information retrieval (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "uary 2011.",
        "English and German Wikipedia were selected because they are the largest Wikipedia collections available, and we want to measure effects in a language for which we already have lots of bitext.",
        "In both collections, redirect pages and stub articles were discarded.",
        "To mine comparable documents, we used our previously described algorithm (Ture et al., 2011), based on local-sensitive hashing, also implemented in Hadoop MapReduce.",
        "The reader is referred to the paper for details.",
        "On a 16 node (96 core) cluster, we were able to extract 64m (de, df ) document pairs (with cosine similarity ?",
        "0.3) in 8.8 hours.",
        "For each of the (de, df ) pairs, the next processing step involves generating the Cartesian product of sentences in both documents as candidate sentence pairs: this itself is a non-trivial problem.",
        "Although in this particular case it may be possible to load both document collections in memory, we envision scaling up to collections in the future for which this is not possible.",
        "Therefore, we devised a scalable, distributed, out-of-memory solution using Hadoop.",
        "The algorithm works as follows: We map over (docid n, document d) pairs from both the German and English collections.",
        "In each mapper all (de, df ) similarity pairs are loaded in memory.",
        "If the input document is not found in any of these pairs, no work is performed.",
        "Otherwise, we extract all sentences and retain only those that have at least 5 terms and at least 3 unique terms.",
        "Sentences are converted into BM25-weighted vectors in the English term space; for German sentences, translation into English is accomplished using the technique proposed by Darwish and Oard (2003).",
        "For every (de, df ) pair that the input document is found in, the mapper emits the list of weighted sentence vectors, with the (de, df ) pair as the key.",
        "As all intermediate key-value pairs in MapReduce are grouped by their keys for reduce-side processing, the reducer receives the key (de, df ) and weighted sentence vectors for both the German and English articles.",
        "From there, we generate the Cartesian product of sentences in both languages.",
        "As an initial filtering step, we discard all pairs where",
        "the ratio of sentence lengths is more than two, a heuristic proposed in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005).",
        "Each of the remaining candidate sentences are then processed by two separate classifiers: a less accurate, fast classifier and a more accurate, slow classifier.",
        "This is described in the next section.",
        "This algorithm is a variant of what is commonly known as a reduce-side join in MapReduce (Lin and Dyer, 2010), where (de, df ) serves as the join key.",
        "Note that in this algorithm, sentence vectors are emitted multiple times, one for each (de, df ) pair that they participate in: this results in increased network traffic during the sort/shuffle phase.",
        "We experimented with an alternative algorithm that processes all foreign documents similar to the same English document together, e.g., processing (de, [df1, df2, .",
        ".",
        ".])",
        "together.",
        "This approach, counter-intuitively, was slower despite reduced network traffic, due to skew in the distribution of similar document pairs.",
        "In our experiments, half of the source collection was not linked to any target document, whereas 4% had more than 100 links.",
        "This results in reduce-side load imbalance, and while most of the reducers finish quickly, a few reducers end up performing substantially more computation, and these ?stragglers?",
        "increase end-to-end running time."
