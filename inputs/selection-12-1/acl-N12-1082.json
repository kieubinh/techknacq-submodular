        "Given an entity1 (the referent) and a set of competing entities (the set of distractors), the task of referring expression generation (REG) involves creating a mention to the referent so that, in the eyes of the reader, it is clearly distinguishable from any other entity in the set of distractors.",
        "In a traditional generation pipeline, referring expression generation happens at the sentence planning level.",
        "As a result, its output is not a textual nugget but a description employed later on by the surface realizer.",
        "In this paper, we consider the output of the REG system to ?To whom correspondence should be addressed.",
        "Email: pablo.duboue@gmail.com.",
        "1Or set of entities, but not in this work.",
        "be Definite Descriptions (DD) consisting of a set of positive triples and a set of negative triples, enumerating referent-related properties.",
        "Since the seminal work by Dale and Re-iter (1995), REG has received a lot of attention in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community.",
        "However, most of the early work on REG has been on traditional NLG systems, using custom-tailored ontologies.",
        "In recent years (Belz et al., 2010) there has been a shift towards what we term ?Open Domain Referring Expression Generation,?",
        "(OD REG), that is, a REG task where the properties come from a folksonomy, a large-scale volunteer-built ontology.",
        "In particular, we are interested in changing anaphoric references for entities appearing in sentences drafted from different documents, as done in multi-document summarization (Advaith et al., 2011).",
        "For example, consider the following summary excerpt2 as produced by Newsblaster (McKeown et al., 2002): Thousands of cheering, flag-waving Palestinians gave Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas an enthusiastic welcome in Ramallah on Sunday, as he told them triumphantly that a ?Palestinian spring?",
        "had been born following his speech to the United Nations last week.",
        "The president pressed Israel, in unusually frank terms, to reach a final peace agreement with the Palestinians, citing the boundaries in place on the eve of the",
        "gotiation about borders.4 Here the second sentence refers to U.S. president Barack Obama and a referring expression of the form ?U.S.",
        "president?",
        "should have been used.",
        "Such expressions depend on the set of distractors present in the text, a requirement that highlights the dynamic nature of the problem.",
        "Our experiments extracted thousands of complex cases (such as distinguishing one musician from a set of five) which we used to test existing algorithms against a folksonomy, dbPe-dia5 (Bizer et al., 2009).",
        "This folksonomy contains 1.7M triples (for its English version) and has been curated from Wikipedia.6 We performed two experiments: first we employed sets of distractors derived from a set of documents annotated with anaphora resolution information (Hasler et al., 2006).",
        "We found that roughly half of the entities annotated in the documents were present in the folksonomy, which speaks of the feasibility of using a folksonomy for OD REG, given the fact that Wikipedia has strict notability requirements for adding information.",
        "In the second experiment, we obtained sets of distractors from Wikinews,7 a service where volunteers submit news articles interspersed with Wikipedia links.",
        "We leveraged said links to assemble 40k referring expression tasks.",
        "For algorithms, we employed Dale and Re-iter (1995), Gardent (2002) and Full Brevity (FB) (Bohnet, 2007).",
        "Our results show that the first two algorithms produce results in a majority of the referring expression tasks, with the Dale and Reiter algorithm being the most efficient and resilient of the three.",
        "The results, however, are of mixed quality and more research is needed to overcome two problems we have identified in our experiments: dealing with undefined information in the folksonomy and the need to incorporate a rough user model in the form of information salience.",
        "In the next section we briefly summarize the three algorithms we employed in our experiments.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the data employed.",
        "Section 4 contains the results of our experiments and subsequent analysis.",
        "We conclude discussing future work.",
        "We picked three algorithms with the following desiderata: all the algorithms can deal with single entity referents (a significant amount of recent work went into multi-entity referents) and we wanted to showcase a classic algorithm (Dale and Reiter?s), an algorithm generating negations (Gardent?s) and an algorithm with a more exhaustive search of the solutions space (Full Brevity).",
        "We very briefly describe each of the algorithms in turn, where R is the referent, C is the set of distractors and P is a list of properties, triples in the form (entity, property, value), describing R: Dale and Reiter (1995).",
        "They assume the properties in P are ordered according to an established criteria.",
        "Then the algorithm iterates over P , adding each triple one at a time and removing from C all entities ruled out by the new triple.",
        "Triples that do not eliminate any new entities from C are ignored.",
        "The algorithm terminates when C is empty.",
        "Gardent (2002).",
        "The algorithm uses Constraint Satisfaction Programming to solve two basic constraints: find a set of positive properties P+ and negative properties P?, such that all properties in P+ are true for the referent and all in P?",
        "are false, and it is the smaller P+ ?",
        "P?",
        "such that for every c ?",
        "C there exist a property in P+ that does not hold for c or a property in P?",
        "that holds for c.8 Full Brevity (Bohnet, 2007).",
        "Starting from a state E of the form (L,C, P ) with L = ?",
        "(selected properties), it keeps these states into a queue, where it loops until C = ?.",
        "In each loop it generates new states (added to the end of the queue), as follows: given a state E = (L,C, P ) for each p ?",
        "P , if p removes elements rem from C, it adds (L?",

        "Gardent produced output for every run.",
        "We consider this an example of the increased expressive power of negative descriptions (it included a negation in 25% of the runs).",
        "For the other two algorithms, the lack of an unique triple differentiating one entity from the set of distractors seemed to be the main issue but there were multiple cases were FB ran out of memory for its queue of candidate nodes.",
        "With respect to execution timings, Dale and Reiter ran into some corner cases and took time comparable to Gardent's algorithm.",
        "FB was 16 times slower (we found this counter-intuitive, as Gardent's algorithm is more demanding).",
        "Therefore, two of these algorithms were able to produce results using large scale ontological information.",
        "As FB ran into problems both in terms of execution time and failure rates, we omitted it from the large scale experiments.",

        "As such, we do not report quality assessments on the pilot data.",
        "Wikinews.",
        "The tasks obtained from wikinews contained a large number of entities per task (an average of 12 people per task) and therefore span a large number of runs: 17,814 runs for people (from 4,230 tasks) and 44,080 for organizations (from 12,998 tasks).",
        "On these large runs, execution time differences are in line with our a priori expectations: the greedy approach of Dale and Reiter is very fast10 with Gar-dent's more comprehensive search taking about 40 times more time.",
        "Dale and Reiter failure rate was",
        "comparable or better than in the pilot (for organizations that are more mixed, it was slightly lower but for people it was as low 2.8%).",

        "Evaluating referring expressions is hard.",
        "Efforts to automate this task in NLG (Gatt et al., 2007) have taken an approach similar to machine translation BLEU scores (Papinini et al., 2001), for example, by asking multiple judges to produce referring expressions for a given scenario.",
        "These settings usually involve images of physical objects and relate to small ontologies.",
        "While such an approach could be adapted to the Open Domain case, a major problem is the need for the judges to be acquainted with some of the less popular entities in the training set.",
        "At this point in our research, we decided to analyze the quality of a sample of the output ourselves.",
        "This process involved consulting information about each entity to determine the soundness of the result.",

        "of 60% for annotating DD results and 79% for determining whether the folksonomy had enough information to build a satisfactory DD.",
        "We then extended the evaluation to 60 runs and annotated them by one author.",
        "We found that Dale and Reiter produced a satisfactory DD in 41.6% of the cases and Gardent in 43.4% of the cases and that the folksonomy contained enough information 81.6% of the time.",

        "From the evaluation we learned that the default ordering strategy employed by Dale and Reiter is not stable across different types of people (compare: politicians vs. musicians) or organizations.",
        "We also saw that Gardent's algorithm in many cases selected a single triple with very little practical value (an obscure fact about the entity) or a negative piece of information which is actually true for the referent but it is a missing piece of information.",
        "The first two problems can be solved by either further subdividing the taxonomies of entities or (more interestingly) by incorporating some measure about the salience of each piece of information, a possibility which we will discuss next.",
        "The last issue can be addressed by having some form of meaningful default value.",
        "The negations produced by Gardent's algorithm highlighted errors on the folksonomy.",
        "For example, when referring to China with distractors Peru and Taiwan, it will produce ?the place where they do not speak Chinese,?",
        "as China has the different Chinese dialects spelled out on the folksonomy (and some Peruvians do speak Chinese).",
