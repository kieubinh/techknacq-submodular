        "The terms ?sentiment analysis?",
        "and ?opinion mining?",
        "cover a wide body of research on and development of systems that can automatically infer emotional states from text (after Pang and Lee (2008) we use the two names interchangeably).",
        "Sentiment analysis plays a large role in business, politics, and is itself a vibrant research area (Bollen et al., 2010).",
        "Effective sentiment analysis for texts such as newswire depends on the ability to extract who (source) is saying what (target).",
        "Fine-grained sentiment analysis requires identifying the sources and targets directly relevant to sentiment bearing expressions (Ruppenhofer et al., 2008).",
        "For example, consider the following sentence from a major information technology (IT) business journal: Lloyd Hession, chief security officer at BT Radianz in New York, said that virtualization also opens up a slew of potential network access control issues.",
        "There are three entities in the sentence that have the capacity to express an opinion: Lloyd Hession, BT Radianz, and New York.",
        "These are potential opinion sources.",
        "There are also a number of mentioned concepts that could serve as the topic of an opinion in the sentence, or target.",
        "These include all the sources, but also ?virtualization?, ?network access control?, ?network?, and so on.",
        "The challenging task is to discriminate between these mentions and choose the ones that are relevant to the user.",
        "Furthermore, such a system must also indicate the content of the opinion itself.",
        "This means that we are actually searching for all triples {source, target, opinion} in this sentence (Kim and Hovy, 2006) and throughout each document in the corpus.",
        "In this case, we want to identify that Lloyd Hession is the source of an opinion, ?slew of network issues,?",
        "about a target, virtualization.",
        "Providing such fine-grained annotations would enrich information extraction, question answering, and corpus exploration applications by letting users see who is saying what with what opinion (Wilson et al., 2005; Stoy-anov and Cardie, 2006).",
        "We motivate the need for a grammatically-focused approach to fine-grained opinion mining and situate it",
        "within the context of existing work in Section 2.",
        "We propose a supervised technique for learning opinion-target relations from dependency graphs in a way that preserves syntactic coherence and semantic compo-sitionality.",
        "In addition to being theoretically sound ?",
        "a lacuna identified in many sentiment systems1 ?",
        "such approaches improve downstream sentiment tasks (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007).",
        "There are multiple types of downstream tasks that potentially require the retrieval of {source, target, opinion} relations on a sentence-by-sentence basis.",
        "An increasingly significant application area is in the use of large corpora in social science.",
        "This area of research requires the exploration and aggregation of data about the relationships between discourses, organizations, and people.",
        "For example, the IT business press data that we use in this work belongs to a larger research program (Tsui et al., 2009; Sayeed et al., 2010) of exploring industry opinion leadership.",
        "IT business press text is one type of text in which many entities and opinions can appear intermingled with one another in a small amount of text.",
        "Another application for fine-grained sentiment relation retrieval of this type is paraphrasing, where attribution of which opinion belongs to which entities may be important for producing useful and accurate output, since source and target identification errors can change the entire meaning of an output text.",
        "Unlike previous approaches that ignore syntax, we use a sentence's syntactic structure to build a probabilistic model that encodes whether a word is opinion bearing as a latent variable.",
        "We build a data structure we call a ?syntactic relatedness trie?",
        "(Section 3) that serves as the skeleton for a graphical model over the sentiment relevance of words (Section 4).",
        "This approach allows us to learn features that predict opinion bearing constructions from grammatical structures.",
        "Because of a dearth of resources for this fine-grained task, we also develop new crowdsourcing techniques for labeling word-level, syntactically informed sen-1Alm (2011) recently argued that work on sentiment analysis needs to de-emphasize the goal of building systems that are ?high-performing?",
        "by traditional measures, because the field risks sacrificing ?opportunities that may lead to a more thorough understanding of language uses and users?",
        "in relation to subjective phenomena.",
        "The work we present in this paper therefore focuses on extracting meaningful features as an investment in future work that directly improves retrieval performance.",
        "timent (Section 5).",
        "We use inference techniques to uncover grammatical patterns that connect opinion-expressing words and target entities (Section 6) performing better than using syntactically uninformed methods.",
        "2 Background and existing work We call opinion mining ?fine-grained?",
        "when it retrieves many different {source, target, opinion} triples per document.",
        "This is particularly challenging when there are multiple triples even within a sentence.",
        "There is considerable work on identifying the source of an opinion.",
        "However, it is much harder to find obvious features that tell us whether ?virtualization?",
        "is the target of an opinion.",
        "The most recent target identification techniques use machine learning to determine the presence of a target from known opinionated language (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010).",
        "Even when targets are identified we must decide if an opinion is expressed, since not all target mentions will necessarily be accompanied by opinion expressions.",
        "Returning to the first example sentence, we could say that the negative opinion about virtualization is expressed by the words ?slew?",
        "and ?issues?.",
        "A system that could automatically make this discovery must draw on grammatical relationships between targets and the opinion bearing words.",
        "Parsers reveal these relationships, but the relationships are often indirect.",
        "The variability of language prevents a complete enumeration of all intervening items that make the relationships indirect, but examples include negation and intensifiers, which change opinion, and sentiment-neutral words, which fill syntactic or stylistic needs.",
        "In this paper, we cope with the variability of expression by using supervised machine learning to generalize across observations and learn which features best enable us to identify opinionated language.",
        "Existing work in this area often uses semantic frames and role labeling (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Choi et al., 2006), but resources typically used in these tasks (e.g. FrameNet) are not exhaustive.",
        "More general approaches (Ruppenhofer et al., 2008) describe semantic and discourse contexts of opinion sources and targets cannot recognize them.",
        "When techniques do identify targets via syntax, they often only use grammar as a feature in an otherwise syntax-agnostic model.",
        "Some work of this",
        "nature merely identifies targets without providing the syntactic evidence necessary to find domain-relevant opinionated language (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010), relying on lists of opinion keywords.",
        "There is also work (Qiu et al., 2011) that uses predefined heuristics over dependency parses to identify both targets and opinion keywords but does not acquire new syntactic heuristics.",
        "Other work (Nakagawa et al., 2010) is similar to ours in that it uses factor graph modeling over a dependency parse formalism, but it assumes that opinionated language is known a priori and focuses on polarity classification, while our work tackles the more fundamental problem of identifying the opinionated language itself.",
        "Little work has been done to perform target and opinion-expression extraction jointly, especially in a way that extracts features for downstream processing.",
        "This dearth persists despite evidence that such information improves sentiment analysis (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007).",
        "An advantage of our proposed approach is that we can use dependency paths in order to capture situations where the relations are non-compositional or semantically motivated.",
        "In Section 5, we describe a data set that has the additional property that opinion is expressed in ways that require external pragmatic knowledge of the domain.",
        "An advantage of arbitrary, non-local dependencies is that we can treat this knowledge as part of the model we learn via long-distance chains, which can capture pragmatics."

        "We present a sampling of possible feature-factor combinations in table 1 in order to show trends in the performance of the system.",
        "Unsurprisingly, the invariant-respecting baseline had very high precision but low recall.",
        "Simply including the node-only g factor with all features increases the recall while hurting precision.",
        "On removing word features, recall increases without changing precision.",
        "This suggests that some words in some SRTs are associated with flow labels in the training data, but not as much in the testing data.",
        "Including parent-node f features with the g features yields higher precision and lower recall, suggesting that parent-node word features support precision.",
        "Including all features on all factors (f , g, and h) preserves most of the precision but improves recall.",
        "Excluding h features increases recall slightly more than it hurts precision.",
        "Excluding both word features for all factors and role h features hurts all measures.",
        "The accuracy measure, however, does show overall improvement with the inclusion of more feature-factor combinations.",
        "In particular, the node-child h factor does appear to have an effect on the performance.",
        "The presence of some combinations of child word, POS tags, and roles appear to provide some indication of the flow labeling of some of the nodes.",
        "The best models in terms of accuracy include all or",
        "almost all of the features.",
        "Our non-invariant-respecting baseline unsurprisingly was nearly 50% on all measures.",
        "Including the node-only features dramatically increases recall, less if we exclude word features.",
        "The word features appear to have an effect on recall just as in the invariant-respecting case with node-only features.",
        "With all features, precision is dramatically improved, but with a large cost to recall.",
        "However, it underperforms the equivalent invariant-respecting model in recall, F-measure, and accuracy.",
        "Though these invariant-violating models are unconstrained in the way they label the graph, our invariant-respecting models still outperform them.",
        "A coherent path contains more information than an incoherent one; it is important to find negating and intensifying elements in context.",
        "Our SRT invariant allows us to achieve better performance and will be more useful to downstream tasks.",
        "Finally, it appears that using more factors and linguistic features promotes stability in performance and decreases sensitivity to the initial setting."

        "; the labels immediately following them in the SRT could be a variety of types, creating potential data sparsity issues.",
        "This problem could be resolved by making some features transparent to the learner.",
        "For example, if node q has an incoming conj and dependency edge label, then q's parent could also be directly connected to q's children, as a conjunction should be linguistically transparent to the status of the children in the sentiment flow.",
        "There are many fewer incidents of inert labels being classified as flow.",
        "There are paths through an SRT where a flow candidate word is the ancestor of an inert candidate word from the set of crowdsourced candidates.",

        "Considering that recall is already fairly low, attempts to address this problem risks making the model too conservative.",

        "In this work, we have applied machine learning to produce a robust modeling of syntactic structure for an information extraction application.",

        "We have shown that we can mine these relationships without being overcome by the data-sparsity issues that typically stymie learning over complex linguistic structure.",
        "The limitations on these techniques ultimately find their root in the difficulty in modeling complex syntactic structures that simultaneously exclude irrelevant portions of the structure while maintaining connected relations.",
        "Our technique uses a structure-labelling scheme that enforces connectedness.",
        "Enforcing connected structure is not only necessary to produce useful results but also to improve accuracy.",
        "Further performance gains might be possible by enriching the feature set.",
        "For example, the POS tagset used by the Stanford parser contains multiple verb tags that represent different English tenses and numbers.",
        "For the purpose of sentiment relations, it is possible that the differences between verb tags are too small to matter and are causing data sparsity issues.",
