        "The assessment of learners?",
        "language abilities is a significant part in language learning.",
        "In conventional assessment, the problem of limited teacher availability has become increasingly serious with the population increase of language learners.",
        "Fortunately, with the development of computer techniques and machine learning techniques (natural language processing and automatic speech recognition), Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems help people to learn language by themselves.",
        "One form of CALL is evaluating the speech of the learner.",
        "Efforts in speech assessment usually focus on the integrality, fluency, pronunciation, and prosody (Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Neumeyer et al., 2000; Maier et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010) of the speech, which are highly predictable like the exam form of the read-aloud text passage.",
        "Another form of CALL is textual assessment.",
        "This work is also named AES.",
        "Efforts in this area usually focus on the content, arrangement and language usage (Landauer et al., 2003; Ishioka and Kameda, 2004; Kakkonen et al., 2005; Attali and Burstein, 2006; Burstein et al., 2010; Persing et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2010; Attali, 2011; Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) of the text written by the learner under a certain form of examination.",
        "In this paper, our evaluation objects are the oral English picture compositions in English as a Second Language (ESL) examination.",
        "This examination requires students to talk about four successive pictures with at least five sentences in one minute, and the beginning sentence is given.",
        "This examination form combines both of the two forms described above.",
        "Therefore, we need two steps in the scoring task.",
        "The first step is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), in which we get the speech scoring features as well as the textual transcriptions of the speeches.",
        "Then, the second step could grade the text-free transcription in an (conventional) AES system.",
        "The present work is mainly about the AES system under the certain situation as the examination grading criterion is more concerned about the integrated content of the speech (the reason will be given in subsection 3.1).",
        "There are many features and techniques which are very powerful in conventional AES systems, but",
        "applying them in this task will cause two different problems as the scoring objects are the ASR output results.",
        "The first problem is that the inevitable recognition errors of the ASR will affect the performance of the feature extractions and scoring system.",
        "The second problem is caused by the special characteristic of the ASR result.",
        "As all these methods are designed under the normal AES situation that they are not suitable for the characteristic.",
        "The impact of the first problem can be reduced by either perfecting the results of the ASR system or building the AES system which is not sensitive to the ASR errors.",
        "Improving the performance of the ASR is not what we concern about, so building an error insensitive AES system is what we care about in this paper.",
        "This makes many conventional features no longer useful in the AES system, such as spelling errors, punctuation errors and even grammar errors.",
        "The second problem is caused by applying the bag-of-words (BOW) techniques to score the ASR transcription.",
        "The BOW are very useful in measuring the content features and are usually robust even if there are some errors in the scoring transcription.",
        "However, the robustness would not exist anymore because of the characteristic of the ASR result.",
        "It is known that better performance of ASR (reduce the word error rate in ASR) usually requires a strong constrain Language Model (LM).",
        "It means that more meaningless parts of the oral speeches would be recognized as the words quite related to the topic content.",
        "These words will usually be the key words in the BOW methods, which will lead to a great distur-brance for the methods.",
        "Therefore, the conventional BOW methods are no longer appropriate because of the characteristic of the ASR result.",
        "To tackle the two problems described above, we apply the FST (Mohri, 2004).",
        "As the evaluating objects are from an oral English picture composition examination, it has two important features that make the FST algorithm quite suitable.",
        "?",
        "Picture composition examinations require students to speak according to the sequence of the pictures, so there is strong sequentiality in the speech.",
        "?",
        "The sentences for describing the same picture are very identical in expression, so there is a hierarchy between the word sequences in the sentences (the expression) and the sense for the same picture.",
        "FST is designed to describe a structure mapping two different types of information sequences.",
        "It is very useful in expressing the sequences and the hierarchy in picture composition.",
        "Therefore, we build a FST-based model to extract features related to the transcription assessment in this paper.",
        "As the FST-based model is similar to the BOW metrics, it is also an error insensitive model.",
        "In this way, the impact of the first problem could be reduced.",
        "The FST model is very powerful in delivering the sequence information that a meaningless sequence of words related to the topic content will get low score under the model.",
        "Therefore, it works well concerning the second problem.",
        "In a word, the FST model can not only be insensitive to the recognition error in the ASR system, but also remedy the weakness of BOW methods in ASR result scoring.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, the related work of conventional AES methods is addressed in section 2.",
        "The details of the speech corpus and the examination grading criterion are introduced in section 3.",

        "The extension can complete the FST model, and achieve better performance in the CRR transcription.",
        "The future work may focus on three facets.",
        "First, as the extension of the FST model is a preliminary study, there is much work that can be done, such as calculating the similarity more accurately without manual intervention, or finding a balance between the original FST model and the extended one to improve the performance in ASR transcription.",
        "Second, as the task is speech evaluation, considering the acoustic features may give more information to the automated scoring system.",
        "Therefore, the features at the acoustic level could be introduced to complete the scoring model.",
        "Third, the decline of the performance in ASR transcription is derived from the recognition error of ASR system.",
        "Therefore, improving the performance of the ASR system or making full use of the N-best lists may give more accurate transcription for the AES system."
