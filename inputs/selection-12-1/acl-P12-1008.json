        "In the realm of discourse annotation, the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) separates itself by adopting a lexically grounded approach: Discourse relations are lexically anchored by discourse connectives (e.g., because, but, therefore), which are viewed as predicates that take abstract objects such as propositions, events and states as their arguments.",
        "In the absence of explicit discourse connectives, the PDTB asks the annotator to fill in a discourse connective that best describes the discourse relation between these two sentences, instead of selecting from an inventory of predefined discourse relations.",
        "By keeping the discourse annotation lexically grounded even in the case of implicit discourse relations, the PDTB appeals to the annotator's judgment at an intuitive level.",
        "This is in contrast with an approach in which the set of discourse relations are predetermined by linguistic experts and the role of the annotator is just to select from those choices (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al., 2003).",
        "This lexically grounded approach led to consistent and reliable discourse annotation, a feat that is generally hard to achieve for discourse annotation.",
        "The PDTB team reported inter-annotator agreement in the lower 90% for explicit discourse relations (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper we describe a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese that adopts this lexically grounded approach while making adaptations when warranted by the linguistic and statistical properties of Chinese text.",
        "This scheme is shown to be practical and effective in the annotation experiment.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the key aspects of the PDTB annotation scheme under discussion in this paper.",
        "In Section 3, we first show that some key features of Chinese make adaptations necessary in Section 3.1, and then in Section 3.2, we present our systematic adaptations that follow from the differences outlined in Section 3.1.",
        "In Section 4, we present the preliminary annotation results we have so far.",
        "And finally in Section 5, we conclude the paper."

        "more tokens of implicit relation than explicit relation to deal with.",
        "According to a rough count on 20 randomly selected files from Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), 82% are tokens of implicit relation, compared to 54.5% in the PDTB 2.0.",
        "Given the overwhelming number of implicit relations, we re-examine where it could make an impact in the annotation scheme.",
        "There are three such areas.",
        "3.2.1 Procedural division between explicit and implicit discourse relation In the PDTB, explicit and implicit relations are annotated separately.",
        "This is probably partly because explicit connectives are quite abundant in English, and partly because the project evolved in stages, expanding from the more canonical case of explicit relation to implicit relation for greater coverage.",
        "When annotating Chinese text, maintaining this procedural division makes much less sense: the landscape of discourse relation (or at least the key elements of it) has already been mapped out by the PDTB work and to set up a separate task to cover 18% of the data does not seem like a worthwhile bother without additional benefits for doing so.",
        "So the question now is how to annotate explicit and implicit relations in one fell swoop?",
        "In Chinese text, the use of a discourse connective is almost always accompanied by a punctuation or two (usually period and/or comma), preceding or flanking it.",
        "So a sensible solution is to rely on punctuations as the denominator between explicit and implicit relations;and in the case of explicit relation, the connective will be marked up as an attribute of the discourse relation.",
        "This unified approach simplifies the annotation procedure while preserving the explicit/implicit distinction in the process.",
        "One might question, at this point, whether such an approach can still call itself ?lexically grounded?.",
        "Certainly not if one interprets the term literally ; but in a broader sense, our approach can be seen as an instantiation of a generalized version of it, much the same way that the PDTB is an, albeit different, instantiation of it for English.",
        "The thrust of the lexically grounded approach is that discourse annotation should be a data-driven, bottom-up process, rather than a top-down one, trying to fit data into a prescriptive system.",
        "Once the insight that a discourse connective functions like a predicate with two arguments is generalized to cover all discourse relations, there is no fundamental difference between explicit and implicit discourse relations: both work like a predicate whether or not there is a lexicalization of it.",
        "As to what role this distinction plays in the annotation procedure, it is an engineering issue, depending on a slew of factors, among which are cross-linguistic variations.",
        "In the case of Chinese, we think it is more economical to treat explicit and implicit relations alike in the annotation process.",
        "To treat explicit and implicit relations alike actually goes beyond annotating them in one pass; it also involves how they are annotated, which we discuss next.",
        "3.2.2 Annotation of implicit discourse relations In the PDTB, treatment of implicit discourse relations is modeled after that of explicit relations, and at the same time, some restrictions are put on implicit, but not explicit, relations.",
        "This is quite understandable: implicit discourse relations tend to be vague and elusive, so making use of explicit relations as a prototype helps pin them down, and restrictions are put in place to strike a balance between high reliability and good coverage.",
        "When implicit relations constitute a vast majority of the data as is the case with Chinese, both aspects need to be re-examined to strike a new balance.",
        "In the PDTB, annotators are asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between two adjacent discourse units; when no such connective expression is appropriate, the implicit discourse relation is further distinguished as ?AltLex?, ?EntRel?, and ?NoRel?.",
        "The inserted connectives and those marked as ?AltLex?, along with explicit discourse connectives, are further annotated with respect to their senses.",
        "When a connective needs to be inserted in a majority of cases, the difficulty of the task really stands out.",
        "In many cases, it seems, there is a good reason for not having a connective present and because of it, the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a connective).",
        "So to try to insert a connective expression may very well be too hard a task for annotators, with little to show for their effort in the end.",
        "Furthermore, the inter-annotator agreement for providing an explicit connective in place of an implicit one is computed based on the type of explicit connectives (e.g. cause-effect relations, temporal relations, contrastive relations, etc.",
        "), rather than based on their identity (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "This suggests that a reasonable degree of agreement for such a task may only be reached with a coarse classification scheme.",
        "Given the above two considerations, our solution is to annotate implicit discourse relations with their senses directly, bypassing the step of inserting a connective expression.",
        "It has been pointed out that to train annotators to reason about predefined abstract relations with high reliability might be too hard a task (Prasad et al., 2007).",
        "This difficulty can be overcome by associating each semantic type with one or two prototypical explicit connectives and asking annotators to consider each to see if it expresses the implicit discourse relation.",
        "This way, annotators have a concrete aid to reason about abstract relations without having to choose one connective from a set expressing roughly the same relation or having to worry about whether insertion of the connective is somehow awkward.",
        "It should be noted that annotating implicit relations directly with their senses means that sense annotation is no longer restricted to those that can be lexically expressed, but also includes those that cannot, notably those labeled ?EntRel/NoRel?",
        "in the PDTB.2 In other words, we annotate senses of discourse relations, not just connectives and their lexical alternatives (in the case of AltLex).",
        "This expansion is consistent with the generalized view of the lexically grounded approach discussed in Section 3.2.1.",
        "With respect to restrictions on implicit relation, we will adopt them as they prove to be necessary in the annotation process, with one exception.",
        "The exception is the restriction that implicit relations between adjacent clauses in the same sentence not separated by a semicolon are not annotated.",

        "This introduces two steps, at which agreement can each be measured: First, the annotator needs to make the judgment, at each instance of the punctuations, whether there is a discourse relation (a step we call ?relation identification?",
        "); second, once a discourse relation is identified, the annotator needs to classify the type as one of ?Explicit?, ?Implicit?, or ?AltLex?",

        "The third adaptation is to define Arg1 and Arg2 semantically for each sense.",

        "In the first three, explicit and implicit relations are calculated separately (although they are actually annotated in the same process) to make our results comparable to the published PDTB results.",
        "Each argument span is treated as an independent token and either exact or partial match (i.e. if two spans share one boundary) counts as 1.",
        "The fourth measure is less stringent than exact match and more stringent than partial match: It groups explicit and implicit relation together and treats each boundary as an independent token.",
        "Typically, an argument span has two boundaries, but it can have four (or more) boundaries when an argument span is interrupted by a connective and/or an AltLex item.",
        "Evidently, determining argument span is the most challenging aspect of discourse annotation.",

        "Aside from including EntRel and NoRel (the reason and significance of which have been discussed in Section 3.2.2), the revision was by and large not motivated by Chinese-specific features, so we do not address it in detail in this paper.",
        "Second, in making the comparison with the PDTB result, the 12-value structure is collapsed into 5 values: TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY, COMPARISON, EXPANSION, and EntRel/NoRel, which must be different from the 5 values in Miltsakaki et al. (2004), judging from the descriptions.",

        "We have presented a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese that adopts the lexically ground approach of the PDTB while making systematic adaptations motivated by characteristics of Chinese text.",
        "These adaptations not only work well in practice, as evidenced by the results from our annotation experiment, but also embody a more generalized view of the lexically ground approach to discourse annotation: Discourse relations are predication involving two arguments; the predicate can be either covert (i.e.",
        "Implicit) or overt, lexicalized as discourse connectives (i.e.",
        "Explicit) or their more polymorphous counterparts (i.e. AltLex).",
        "Consistent with this generalized view is a more semantically motivated sense annotation scheme: Senses of discourse relations (as opposed to just connectives) are annotated; and the two arguments of the discourse relation are semantically defined, allowing the sense structure to be more general and less connective-dependent.",
        "These framework-level generalizations can be applied to discourse annotation of other languages."
