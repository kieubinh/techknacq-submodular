        "It has long been a vision of science fiction writers and scientists to be able to universally communicate in all languages.",
        "In these visions, even previously unknown languages can be learned automatically from analyzing foreign language input.",
        "In this work, we attempt to learn statistical translation models from only monolingual data in the source and target language.",
        "The reasoning behind this idea is that the elements of languages share statistical similarities that can be automatically identified and matched with other languages.",
        "This work is a big step towards large-scale and large-vocabulary unsupervised training of statistical translation models.",
        "Previous approaches have faced constraints in vocabulary or data size.",
        "We show how ?Author now at Google Inc., amauser@google.com.",
        "to scale unsupervised training to real-life translation tasks and how large-scale experiments can be done.",
        "Monolingual data is more readily available, if not abundant compared to true parallel or even just translated data.",
        "Learning from only monolingual data in real-life translation tasks could improve especially low resource language pairs where few or no parallel texts are available.",
        "In addition to that, this approach offers the opportunity to decipher new or unknown languages and derive translations based solely on the available monolingual data.",
        "While we do tackle the full unsupervised learning task for MT, we make some very basic assumptions about the languages we are dealing with: 1.",
        "We have large amounts of data available in source and target language.",
        "This is not a very strong assumption as books and text on the internet are readily available for almost all languages.",
        "2.",
        "We can divide the given text in tokens and sentence-like units.",
        "This implies that we know enough about the language to tokenize and sentence-split a given text.",
        "Again, for the vast majority of languages, this is not a strong restriction.",
        "3.",
        "The writing system is one-dimensional left-to-right.",
        "It has been shown (Lin and Knight, 2006) that the writing direction can be determined separately and therefore this assumption does",
        "not pose a real restriction.",
        "Previous approaches to unsupervised training for SMT prove feasible only for vocabulary sizes up to around 500 words (Ravi and Knight, 2011) and data",
        "sets of roughly 15,000 sentences containing only about 4 tokens per sentence on average.",
        "Real data as it occurs in texts such as web pages or news texts does not meet any of these characteristics.",
        "In this work, we will develop, describe, and evaluate methods for large vocabulary unsupervised learning of machine translation models suitable for real-world tasks.",

        "The main difference of our work is, that it allows for much larger vocabulary sizes and more data to be used than previous work while at the same time not being dependent on seed lexica and/or any other knowledge of the languages.",
        "Close to the methods described in this work, Ravi and Knight (2011) treat training and translation without parallel data as a deciphering problem.",
        "Their best performing approach uses an EM-Algorithm to train a generative word based translation model.",
        "They perform experiments on a Spanish/English task with vocabulary sizes of about 500 words and achieve a performance of around 20 BLEU compared to 70 BLEU obtained by a system that was trained on parallel data.",
        "Our work uses the same training criterion and is based on the same generative story.",
        "However, we use a new training procedure whose critical parts have constant time and memory complexity with respect to the vocabulary size so that our methods can scale to much larger vocabulary sizes while also being faster.",
        "In a different approach, Koehn and Knight (2002) induce a bilingual lexicon from only non-parallel data.",
        "To achieve this they use a seed lexicon which they systematically extend by using orthographic as well as distributional features such as context, and frequency.",
        "They perform their experiments on non-parallel German-English news texts, and test their mappings against a bilingual lexicon.",
        "We use a greedy method similar to (Koehn and Knight, 2002) for extending a given lexicon, and we implicitly also use the frequency as a feature.",
        "However, we perform fully unsupervised training and do not start with a seed lexicon or use linguistic features.",
        "Similarly, Haghighi et al. (2008) induce a one-to-one translation lexicon only from non-parallel monolingual data.",
        "Also starting with a seed lexicon, they use a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis to systematically extend the lexicon using context as well as spelling features.",
        "They evaluate their method on a variety of tasks, ranging from inherently parallel data (EUROPARL) to unrelated corpora (100k sentences of the GIGAWORD corpus).",
        "They report F-measure scores of the induced entries between 30 to 70.",

        "We presented a method for learning statistical machine translation models from non-parallel data.",
        "The key to our method lies in limiting the translation model to a limited set of translation candidates and then using the EM algorithm to learn the probabilities.",
        "Based on the translations obtained with this model we obtain new translation candidates using a context vector approach.",
        "This method increased the training speed by a factor of 10-20 compared to methods known in literature and also resulted in a 1.6 BLEU point increase compared to previous approaches.",
        "Due to this efficiency improvement we were able to tackle larger tasks, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus having a nearly 10 times larger vocabulary.",
        "We also had a look at first results of our method on an even larger Task, incorporating a vocabulary of 60,000 words.",
        "We have shown that, using a limited set of translation candidates, we can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the learning task.",
        "This work serves as a big step towards large-scale unsupervised training for statistical machine translation systems."
