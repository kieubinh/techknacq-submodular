        "Infants acquiring their first language confront two difficult cognitive problems: building a lexicon of word forms, and learning basic phonetics and phonology.",
        "The two tasks are closely related: knowing what sounds can substitute for one another helps in clustering together variant pronunciations of the same word, while knowing the environments in which particular words can occur helps determine which sound changes are meaningful and which are not (Feldman",
        "(a) intended: /ju want w2n/ /want e kUki/ (b) surface: [j@ waP w2n] [wan @ kUki] (c) unsegmented: [j@waPw2n] [wan@kUki] (d) idealized: /juwantw2n/ /wantekUki/ Figure 1: The utterances you want one?",

        "Lines (c) and (d) remove the word boundaries (but not utterance boundaries) from (b) and (a), respectively.",
        "et al, 2009).",
        "For instance, if an infant who already knows the word [ju] ?you?",
        "encounters a new word [j@], they must decide whether it is a new lexical item or a variant of the word they already know.",
        "Evidence for the correct conclusion comes from the pronunciation (many English vowels are reduced to [@] in unstressed positions) and the context?if the next word is ?want?, ?you?",
        "is a plausible choice.",
        "To date, most models of infant language learning have focused on either lexicon-building or phonetic learning in isolation.",
        "For example, many models of word segmentation implicitly or explicitly build a lexicon while segmenting the input stream of phonemes into word tokens; in nearly all cases the phonemic input is created from an orthographic transcription using a phonemic dictionary, thus abstracting away from any phonetic variability (Brent, 1999; Venkataraman, 2001; Swingley, 2005; Goldwater et al., 2009, among others).",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, these models attempt to infer line (a) from line (d).",
        "However, (d) is an idealization: real speech has variability, and behavioral evidence suggests that infants are still learning about the phonetics and phonology of their language even after beginning to segment words, rather than learning to neutralize",
        "the variations first and acquiring the lexicon afterwards (Feldman et al., 2009, and references therein).",
        "Based on this evidence, a more realistic model of early language acquisition should propose a method of inferring the intended forms (Figure 1a) from the unsegmented surface forms (1c) while also learning a model of phonetic variation relating the intended and surface forms (a) and (b).",
        "Previous models with similar goals have learned from an artificial corpus with a small vocabulary (Driesen et al., 2009; Ra?sa?nen, 2011) or have modeled variability only in vowels (Feldman et al., 2009); to our knowledge, this paper is the first to use a naturalistic infant-directed corpus while modeling variability in all segments, and to incorporate word-level context (a bigram language model).",
        "Our main contribution is a joint lexical-phonetic model that infers intended forms from segmented surface forms; we test the system using input with either gold standard word boundaries or boundaries induced by an existing unsupervised segmentation model (Goldwater et al., 2009).",
        "We show that in both cases modeling variability improves the accuracy of the learned lexicon over a system that assumes each intended form has a unique surface form.",
        "Our model is conceptually similar to those used in speech recognition and other applications: we assume the intended tokens are generated from a bigram language model and then distorted by a noisy channel, in particular a log-linear model of phonetic variability.",
        "But unlike speech recognition, we have no ?intended-form, surface-form?",
        "training pairs to train the phonetic model, nor even a dictionary of intended-form strings to train the language model.",
        "Instead, we initialize the noise model using feature weights based on universal linguistic principles (e.g., a surface phone is likely to share articulatory features with the intended phone) and use a bootstrapping process to iteratively infer the intended forms and retrain the language model and noise model.",
        "While we do not claim that the particular inference mechanism we use is cognitively plausible, our positive results further support the claim that infants can and do acquire phonetics and the lexicon in concert."

        "They extend a model for clustering acoustic tokens into phonetic categories (Vallabha et al., 2007) by adding a lexical level that simultaneously clusters word tokens (which contain the acoustic tokens) into lexical entries.",
        "Including the lexical level improves the model's phonetic categorization, and a follow-up study on artificial language learning (Feldman, 2011) supports the claim that human learners use lexical knowledge to distinguish meaningful from unimportant phonetic contrasts.",
        "Feldman et al. (2009) use a real-valued representation for vowels (formant values), but assume no variability in consonants, and treat each word token independently.",
        "In contrast, our model uses a symbolic representation for sounds, but models variability in all segment types and incorporates a bigram word-level language model.",
        "To our knowledge, the only other lexicon-building systems that also learn about phonetic variability are those of Driesen et al. (2009) and Ra?sa?nen (2011).",

        "(Ra?sa?nen, 2011).",
        "Here, we use a naturalistic corpus, demonstrating that lexical-phonetic learning is possible in this more general setting and that word-level context information is important for doing so.",
        "Several other related systems work directly from the acoustic signal and many of these do use naturalistic corpora.",
        "However, they do not learn at both the lexical and phonetic/acoustic level.",
        "For example, Park and Glass (2008), Aimetti (2009), Jansen et al. (2010), and McInnes and Goldwater (2011) present lexicon-building systems that use hard-coded acoustic similarity measures rather than learning about variability, and they only extract and cluster a few frequent words.",

        "However, they do not cluster segmented",
