        "One of the problems faced by automatic speech recognition, especially of conversational speech, is that of modeling the mapping between words and their possible pronunciations in terms of sub-word units such as phones.",
        "While pronouncing dictionaries provide each word's canonical pronunciation(s) in terms of phoneme strings, running speech often includes pronunciations that differ greatly from the dictionary.",
        "For example, some pronunciations of ?probably?",
        "in the Switchboard conversational speech database are [p r aa b iy], [p r aa l iy], [p r ay], and [p ow ih] (Greenberg et al., 1996).",
        "While some words (e.g., common words) are more prone to such variation than others, the effect is extremely general: In the phonetically transcribed portion of Switchboard, fewer than half of the word tokens are pronounced canonically (Fosler-Lussier, 1999).",
        "In addition, pronunciation variants sometimes include sounds not present in the dictionary at all, such as nasalized vowels (?can't?",
        "?",
        "[k ae n n t]) or fricatives introduced due to incomplete consonant closures (?legal?",
        "?",
        "[l iy g fr ix l]).1 This variation makes pronunciation modeling one of the major challenges facing speech recognition (McAllaster et al., 1998; Jurafsky et al., 2001; Sarac?lar and Khu-danpur, 2004; Bourlard et al., 1999).",
        "2 Most efforts to address the problem have involved either learning alternative pronunciations and/or their probabilities (Holter and Svendsen, 1999) or using phonetic transformation (substitution, insertion, and deletion) rules, which can come from linguistic knowledge or be learned from data (Riley et al., 1999; Hazen et al., 2005; Hutchinson and Droppo, 2011).",
        "These have produced some improvements in recognition performance.",
        "However, they also tend to cause additional confusability due to the introduction of additional homonyms (Fosler",
        "problem, in which pronunciations are predicted from a word's spelling; here, we assume the availability of a dictionary of canonical pronunciations as is usual in speech recognition.",
        "Lussier et al., 2002).",
        "Some other alternatives are articulatory pronunciation models, in which words are represented as multiple parallel sequences of articulatory features rather than single sequences of phones, and which outperform phone-based models on some tasks (Livescu and Glass, 2004; Jyothi et al., 2011); and models for learning edit distances between dictionary and actual pronunciations (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998; Filali and Bilmes, 2005).",
        "All of these approaches are generative?i.e., they provide distributions over possible pronunciations given the canonical one(s)?and they are typically trained by maximizing the likelihood over training data.",
        "In some recent work, discriminative approaches have been proposed, in which an objective more closely related to the task at hand is optimized.",
        "For example, (Vinyals et al., 2009; Korkmazskiy and Juang, 1997) optimize a minimum classification error (MCE) criterion to learn the weights (equivalently, probabilities) of alternative pronunciations for each word; (Schramm and Beyerlein, 2001) use a similar approach with discriminative model combination.",
        "In this work, the weighted alternatives are then used in a standard (generative) speech recognizer.",
        "In other words, these approaches optimize generative models using discriminative criteria.",
        "We propose a general, flexible discriminative approach to pronunciation modeling, rather than dis-criminatively optimizing a generative model.",
        "We formulate a linear model with a large number of word-level and subword-level feature functions, whose weights are learned by optimizing a discriminative criterion.",
        "The approach is related to the recently proposed segmental conditional random field (SCRF) approach to speech recognition (Zweig et al., 2011).",
        "The main differences are that we optimize large-margin objective functions, which lead to sparser, faster, and better-performing models than conditional random field optimization in our experiments; and we use a large set of different feature functions tailored to pronunciation modeling.",
        "In order to focus attention on the pronunciation model alone, our experiments focus on a task that measures only the mapping between words and subword units.",
        "Pronunciation models have in the past been tested using a variety of measures.",
        "For generative models, phonetic error rate of generated pronunciations (Venkataramani and Byrne, 2001) and phone-or frame-level perplexity (Riley et al., 1999; Jyothi et al., 2011) are appropriate measures.",
        "For our discriminative models, we consider the task of lexical access; that is, prediction of a single word given its pronunciation in terms of sub-word units (Fissore et al., 1989; Jyothi et al., 2011).",
        "This task is also sometimes referred to as ?pronunciation recognition?",
        "(Ristad and Yianilos, 1998) or ?pronunciation classification?",
        "(Filali and Bilmes, 2005).)",
