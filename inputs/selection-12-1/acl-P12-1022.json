        "The integration of Multiword Expressions (MWE) in real-life applications is crucial because such expressions have the particularity of having a certain level of idiomaticity.",
        "They form complex lexical units which, if they are considered, should significantly help parsing.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, the integration of multiword expressions in the parsing procedure has been studied for different formalisms: Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Copestake et al., 2002), Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schuler and Joshi, 2011), etc.",
        "From an empirical point of view, their incorporation has also been considered such as in (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) for dependency parsing and in (Arun and Keller, 2005) in constituency parsing.",
        "Although experiments always relied on a corpus where the MWEs were perfectly pre-identified, they showed that pre-grouping such expressions could significantly improve parsing accuracy.",
        "Recently, Green et al. (2011) proposed integrating the multiword expressions directly in the grammar without pre-recognizing them.",
        "The grammar was trained with a reference treebank where MWEs were annotated with a specific non-terminal node.",
        "Our proposal is to evaluate two discriminative strategies in a real constituency parsing context: (a) pre-grouping MWE before parsing; this would be done with a state-of-the-art recognizer based on Conditional Random Fields; (b) parsing with a grammar including MWE identification and then reranking the output parses thanks to a Maximum Entropy model integrating MWE-dedicated features.",
        "(a) is the direct realistic implementation of the standard approach that was shown to reach the best results (Arun and Keller, 2005).",
        "We will evaluate if real MWE recognition (MWER) still positively impacts parsing, i.e., whether incorrect MWER does not negatively impact the overall parsing system.",
        "(b) is a more innovative approach to MWER (despite not being new in parsing): we select the final MWE segmentation after parsing in order to explore as many parses as possible (as opposed to method (a)).",
        "The experiments were carried out on the French Treebank (Abeille?",
        "et al, 2003) where MWEs are annotated.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: section 2 is an overview of the multiword expressions and their identification in texts; section 3 presents the two different strategies and their associated models; section 4 describes the resources used for our experiments (the corpus and the lexical resources); section 5 details the features that are incorporated in the models; section 6 reports on the results obtained."

        "Multiword expressions are lexical items made up of multiple lexemes that undergo idiosyncratic constraints and therefore offer a certain degree of idiomaticity.",
        "They cover a wide range of linguistic phenomena: fixed and semi-fixed expressions, light verb constructions, phrasal verbs, named entities, etc.",
        "They may be contiguous (e.g. traffic light) or discontinuous (e.g. John took your argument into account).",
        "They are often divided into two main classes: multiword expressions defined through linguistic idiomaticity criteria (lexicalized phrases in the terminology of Sag et al. (2002)) and those defined by statistical ones (i.e. simple collocations).",
        "Most linguistic criteria used to determine whether a combination of words is a MWE are based on syntactic and semantic tests such as the ones described in (Gross, 1986).",
        "For instance, the utterance at night is a MWE because it does display a strict lexical restriction (*at day, *at afternoon) and it does not accept any inserting material (*at cold night, *at present night).",
        "Such linguistically defined expressions may overlap with collocations which are the combinations of two or more words that cooccur more often than by chance.",
        "Collocations are usually identified through statistical association measures.",
        "A detailed description of MWEs can be found in (Baldwin and Nam, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we focus on contiguous MWEs that form a lexical unit which can be marked by a part-of-speech tag (e.g. at night is an adverb, because of is a preposition).",
        "They can undergo limited morphological and lexical variations ?",
        "e.g. traffic (light+lights), (apple+orange+...) juice ?",
        "and usually do not allow syntactic variations1 such as inserts (e.g. *at 1Such MWEs may very rarely accept inserts, often limited to single word modifiers: e.g. in the short term, in the very short cold night).",
        "Such expressions can be analyzed at the lexical level.",
        "In what follows, we use the term compounds to denote such expressions."

        "The idiomaticity property of MWEs makes them both crucial for Natural Language Processing applications and difficult to predict.",
        "Their actual identification in texts is therefore fundamental.",
        "There are different ways for achieving this objective.",
        "The simpler approach is lexicon-driven and consists in looking the MWEs up in an existing lexicon, such as in (Silberztein, 2000).",
        "The main drawback is that this procedure entirely relies on a lexicon and is unable to discover unknown MWEs.",
        "The use of collocation statistics is therefore useful.",
        "For instance, for each candidate in the text, Watrin and Franc?ois (2011) compute on the fly its association score from an external ngram base learnt from a large raw corpus, and tag it as MWE if the association score is greater than a threshold.",
        "They reach excellent scores in the framework of a keyword extraction task.",
        "Within a validation framework (i.e. with the use of a reference corpus annotated in MWEs), Ramisch et al. (2010) developped a Support Vector Machine classifier integrating features corresponding to different collocation association measures.",
        "The results were rather low on the Genia corpus and Green et al. (2011) confirmed these bad results on the French Treebank.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that such a method does not make any distinctions between the different types of MWEs and the reference corpora are usually limited to certain types of MWEs.",
        "Furthermore, the lexicon-driven and collocation-driven approaches do not take the context into account, and therefore cannot discard some of the incorrect candidates.",
        "A recent trend is to couple MWE recognition with a linguistic ana-lyzer: a POS tagger (Constant and Sigogne, 2011) or a parser (Green et al., 2011).",

        "They showed that this formalism was more relevant to MWER than PCFG (71% F-score vs. 69.5%).",
        "Both methods have the advantage of being able to discover new MWEs on the basis of lexical and syntactic contexts.",
