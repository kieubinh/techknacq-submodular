      "text": [
        "Verb classification is a fundamental topic of computational linguistics research given its importance for understanding the role of verbs in conveying semantics of natural language (NL).",
        "Additionally, generalization based on verb classification is central to many NL applications, ranging from shallow semantic parsing to semantic search or information extraction.",
        "Currently, a lot of interest has been paid to two verb categorization schemes: VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), which has also fostered production of many automatic approaches to predicate argument extraction.",
        "Such work has shown that syntax is necessary for helping to predict the roles of verb arguments and consequently their verb sense (Gildea and Juras-fky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Gildea and Palmer, 2002).",
        "However, the definition of models for optimally combining lexical and syntactic constraints is still far for being accomplished.",
        "In particular, the exhaustive design and experimentation of lexical and syntactic features for learning verb classification appears to be computationally problematic.",
        "For example, the verb order can belongs to the two VerbNet classes: ?",
        "The class 60.1, i.e., order someone to do something as shown in: The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .",
        "?",
        "The class 13.5.1: order or request something like in: ... Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .",
        "Clearly, the syntactic realization can be used to discern the cases above but it would not be enough to correctly classify the following verb occurrence: .. ordered the lunch to be delivered .. in Verb class 13.5.1.",
        "For such a case, selectional restrictions are needed.",
        "These have also been shown to be useful for semantic role classification (Zapirain et al., 2010).",
        "Note that their coding in learning algorithms is rather complex: we need to take into account syntactic structures, which may require an exponential number of syntactic features (i.e., all their possible substructures).",
        "Moreover, these have to be enriched with lexical information to trig lexical preference.",
        "In this paper, we tackle the problem above by studying innovative representations for automatic verb classification according to VerbNet and FrameNet.",
        "We define syntactic and semantic structures capturing essential lexical and syntactic properties of verbs.",
        "Then, we apply similarity between",
        "such structures, i.e., kernel functions, which can also exploit distributional lexical semantics, to train automatic classifiers.",
        "The basic idea of such functions is to compute the similarity between two verbs in terms of all the possible substructures of their syntactic frames.",
        "We define and automatically extract a lexicalized approximation of the latter.",
        "Then, we apply kernel functions that jointly model structural and lexical similarity so that syntactic properties are combined with generalized lexemes.",
        "The nice property of kernel functions is that they can be used in place of the scalar product of feature vectors to train algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs).",
        "This way SVMs can learn the association between syntactic (sub-) structures whose lexical arguments are generalized and target verb classes, i.e., they can also learn selectional restrictions.",
        "We carried out extensive experiments on verb class and frame detection which showed that our models greatly improve on the state-of-the-art (up to about 13% of relative error reduction).",
        "Such results are nicely assessed by manually inspecting the most important substructures used by the classifiers as they largely correlate with syntactic frames defined in VerbNet.",
        "In the rest of the paper, Sec. 2 reports on related work, Sec. 3 and Sec. 4 describe previous and our models for syntactic and semantic similarity, respectively, Sec. 5 illustrates our experiments, Sec. 6 discusses the output of the models in terms of error analysis and important structures and finally Sec. 7 derives the conclusions."

        "Our target task is verb classification but at the same time our models exploit distributional models as well as structural kernels.",
        "The next three subsections report related work in such areas.",
        "Verb Classification.",
        "The introductory verb classification example has intuitively shown the complexity of defining a comprehensive feature representation.",
        "Hereafter, we report on analysis carried out in previous work.",
        "It has been often observed that verb senses tend to show different selectional constraints in a specific argument position and the above verb order is a clear example.",
        "In the direct object position of the example sentence for the first sense 60.1 of order, we found commission in the role PATIENT of the predicate.",
        "It clearly satisfies the +ANIMATE/+ORGANIZATION restriction on the PATIENT role.",
        "This is not true for the direct object dependency of the alternative sense 13.5.1, which usually expresses the THEME role, with unrestricted type selection.",
        "When properly generalized, the direct object information has thus been shown highly predictive about verb sense distinctions.",
        "In (Brown et al., 2011), the so called dynamic dependency neighborhoods (DDN), i.e., the set of verbs that are typically collocated with a direct object, are shown to be more helpful than lexical information (e.g., WordNet).",
        "The set of typical verbs taking a noun n as a direct object is in fact a strong characterization for semantic similarity, as all the nounsm similar to n tend to collocate with the same verbs.",
        "This is true also for other syntactic dependencies, among which the direct object dependency is possibly the strongest cue (as shown for example in (Dligach and Palmer, 2008)).",
        "In order to generalize the above DDN feature, distributional models are ideal, as they are designed to model all the collocations of a given noun, according to large scale corpus analysis.",
        "Their ability to capture lexical similarity is well established in WSD tasks (e.g. (Sch√ºtze, 1998)), thesauri harvesting (Lin, 1998), semantic role labeling (Croce et al., 2010)) as well as information retrieval (e.g. (Furnas et al., 1988)).",
        "Distributional Models (DMs).",
        "These models follow the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957) and characterize lexical meanings in terms of context of use, (Wittgenstein, 1953).",
        "By inducing geometrical notions of vectors and norms through corpus analysis, they provide a topological definition of semantic similarity, i.e., distance in a space.",
        "DMs can capture the similarity between words such as delegation, deputation or company and commission.",
        "In case of sense 60.1 of the verb order, DMs can be used to suggest that the role PATIENT can be inherited by all these words, as suitable Organisations.",
        "In supervised language learning, when few examples are available, DMs support cost-effective lexical generalizations, often outperforming knowledge based resources (such as WordNet, as in (Pantel et al., 2007)).",
        "Obviously, the choice of the context",
        "type determines the type of targeted semantic properties.",
        "Wider contexts (e.g., entire documents) are shown to suggest topical relations.",
        "Smaller contexts tend to capture more specific semantic aspects, e.g. the syntactic behavior, and better capture paradigmatic relations, such as synonymy.",
        "In particular, word space models, as described in (Sahlgren, 2006), define contexts as the words appearing in a n-sized window, centered around a target word.",
        "Co-occurrence counts are thus collected in a words-bywords matrix, where each element records the number of times two words co-occur within a single window of word tokens.",
        "Moreover, robust weighting schemas are used to smooth counts against too frequent co-occurrence pairs: Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scores (Turney and Pantel, 2010) are commonly adopted.",
        "Structural Kernels.",
        "Tree and sequence kernels have been successfully used in many NLP applications, e.g., parse reranking and adaptation, (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Shen et al., 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004; Kudo et al., 2005; Titov and Henderson, 2006), chunking and dependency parsing, e.g., (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003; Daume?",

        "SPTK improves on the state-of-the-art by about 2.08 absolute percent points, which, given the high accuracy of the baseline, corresponds to 13.5% of relative error reduction.",
        "We carried out similar experiments for frame classification.",
        "One interesting difference is that SK improves BOW by only 0.70, i.e., 4 times less than in the VerbNet setting.",
        "This suggests that word order around the predicate is more important for deriving the VerbNet class than the FrameNet frame.",
        "Additionally, LCT or GRCT seems to be invariant for both PTK and SPTK whereas the lexical similarity still produces a relevant improvement on PTK, i.e., 13% of relative error reduction, for an absolute accuracy of 93.78%.",
        "The latter improves over the state",
        "of-the-art, i.e., 92.63% derived in (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006), by using STK on CT on 133 frames.",
        "We also carried out experiments to understand the role of the none class.",
        "Table 3 reports on the VerbNet classification without its instances.",
        "This is of course an unrealistic setting as it would assume that the current VerbNet release already includes all senses for English verbs.",
        "In the table, we note that the overall accuracy highly increases and the difference between models reduces.",
        "The similarities play no role anymore.",
        "This may suggest that SPTK can help in complex settings, where verb class characterization is more difficult.",
        "Another important role of SPTK models is their ability to generalize.",
        "To test this aspect, Figure 4 illustrates the learning curves of SPTK with respect to BOW and the accuracy achieved by BR (with a constant line).",
        "It is impressive to note that with only 40% of the data SPTK can reach the state-of-the-art."

        "This class also causes data imbalance.",
        "Most errors are also due to lack of lexical information available to the SPTK kernel: (i) in 30% of the errors, the argument heads were proper nouns for which the lexical generalization provided by the DMs was not",
        "available; and (ii) in 76% of the errors only 2 or less argument heads are included in the extracted tree, therefore tree kernels cannot exploit enough lexical information to disambiguate verb senses.",
        "Additionally, ambiguity characterizes errors where the system is linguistically consistent but the learned selectional preferences are not sufficient to separate verb senses.",
        "These errors are mainly due to the lack of contextual information.",

        "Table 4 and 5 report the tree structures characterizing the most informative training examples of the two senses of the verb order, i.e. the VerbNet classes 13.5.1 (make a request for something) and 60 (give instructions to or direct somebody to do something with authority).",
        "In line with the method discussed in (Pighin and Moschitti, 2009b), these fragments are extracted as they appear in most of the support vectors selected during SVM training.",
        "As easily seen, the two classes are captured by rather different patterns.",
        "The typical accusative form with an explicit direct object emerges as characterizing the sense 13.5.1, denoting the THEME role.",
        "All fragments of the sense 60 emphasize instead the sentential complement of the verb that in fact expresses the standard PROPOSITION role in VerbNet.",
        "Notice that tree fragments correspond to syntactic patterns.",
        "The a posteriori",
        "analysis of the learned models (i.e. the underlying support vectors) confirm very interesting grammatical generalizations, i.e. the capability of tree kernels to implicitly trigger useful linguistic inductions for complex semantic tasks.",
        "When SPTK are adopted, verb arguments can be lexically generalized into word classes, i.e., clusters of argument heads (e.g. commission vs. delegation, or gift vs. present).",

      "text": [
        "We have proposed new approaches to characterize verb classes in learning algorithms.",
        "The key idea is the use of structural representation of verbs based on syntactic dependencies and the use of structural kernels to measure similarity between such representations.",
        "The advantage of kernel methods is that they can be directly used in some learning algorithms, e.g., SVMs, to train verb classifiers.",
        "Very interestingly, we can encode distributional lexical similarity in the similarity function acting over syntactic structures and this allows for generalizing selection restrictions through a sort of (supervised) syntactic and semantic co-clustering.",
        "The verb classification results show a large improvement over the state-of-the-art for both VerbNet and FrameNet, with a relative error reduction of about 13.5% and 16.0%, respectively.",
        "In the future, we plan to exploit the models learned from FrameNet and VerbNet to carry out automatic mapping of verbs from one theory to the other.",
