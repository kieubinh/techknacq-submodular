        "In order to reliably learn a myriad of parameters in these models, we propose an expected BLEU score-based utility function with KL regularization as the objective, and train the models on a large parallel dataset.",
        "For training, we derive growth transformations for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities to iteratively improve the objective.",
        "The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system.",
        "In IWSLT 2011 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction Discriminative training is an active area in statistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., Och et al., 2002, 2003, Liang et al., 2006, Blunsom et al., 2008, Chiang et al., 2009, Foster et al. 2010, Xiao et al. 2011).",
        "Och (2003) proposed using a log-linear model to incorporate multiple features for translation, and proposed a minimum error rate training (MERT) method to train the feature weights to optimize a desirable translation metric.",
        "While the log-linear model itself is discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation features, which are among the most important components of SMT, are derived from either generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003, Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Moreover, the parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation models are estimated by relative frequency or maximizing joint likelihood, which may not correspond closely to the translation measure, e.g., bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Therefore, it is desirable to train all these parameters to directly maximize an objective that directly links to translation quality.",
        "However, there are a large number of parameters in these models, making discriminative training for them non-trivial (e.g., Liang et al., 2006, Chiang et al., 2009).",
        "Liang et al. (2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-Speech features and trained the model weights associated with these features using perceptron.",
        "Since many of the reference translations are non-reachable, an empirical local updating strategy had to be devised to fix this problem by picking a pseudo reference.",
        "Many such non-desirable heuristics led to moderate gains reported in that work.",
        "Chiang et al. (2009) improved a syntactic SMT system by adding as many as ten thousand syntactic features, and used Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) to train the feature weights.",
        "However, the number of parameters in common phrase and lexicon translation models is much larger.",
        "In this work, we present a new, highly effective discriminative learning method for phrase and lexicon translation models.",
        "The training objective is an expected BLEU score, which is closely linked to translation quality.",
        "Further, we apply a Kullback?Leibler (KL) divergence regularization to prevent over-fitting.",
        "For effective optimization, we derive updating formulas of growth transformation (GT) for phrase and lexicon translation probabilities.",
        "A GT is a transformation of the probabilities that guarantees strict non-decrease of the objective over each GT iteration unless a local maximum is reached.",
        "A",
        "similar GT technique has been successfully used in speech recognition (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1991, Povey, 2004, He et al., 2008).",
        "Our work demonstrates that it works with large scale discriminative training of SMT model as well.",
        "Our work is based on a phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Experiments on the Europarl German-to-English dataset show that the proposed method leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a strong baseline.",
        "The proposed method is also successfully evaluated on the IWSLT 2011 benchmark test set, where the task is to translate TED talks (www.ted.com).",
        "Our experimental results on this open-domain spoken language translation task show that the proposed method leads to significant translation performance improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline, and the system using the proposed method achieved the best single system translation result in the Chinese-to-English MT track.",
        "2.",
        "Related Work One best known approach in discriminative training for SMT is proposed by Och (2003).",
        "In that work, multiple features, most of them are derived from generative models, are incorporated into a log-linear model, and the relative weights of them are tuned discriminatively on a small tuning set.",
        "However, in practice, this approach only works with a handful of parameters.",
        "More closely related to our work, Liang et al. (2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-Speech features in addition to the phrase translation model.",
        "Weights of these features are trained using perceptron on a training set of 67K sentences.",
        "In that paper, the authors pointed out that forcing the model to update towards the reference translation could be problematic.",
        "This is because the hidden structure such as phrase segmentation and alignment could be abused if the system is forced to produce a reference translation.",
        "Therefore, instead of pushing the parameter update towards the reference translation (a.k.a.",
        "bold updating), the author proposed a local updating strategy where the model parameters are updated towards a pseudo-reference (i.e., the hypothesis in the n-best list that gives the best BLEU score).",
        "Experimental results showed that their approach outperformed a baseline by 0.8 BLEU point when using monotonic decoding, but there was no significant gain over a stronger baseline with a full-distortion model.",
        "In our work, we use the expectation of BLEU scores as the objective.",
        "This avoids the heuristics of picking the updating reference and therefore gives a more principal way of setting the training objective.",
        "As another closely related study, Chiang et al. (2009) incorporated about ten thousand syntactic features in addition to the baseline features.",
        "The feature weights are trained on a tuning set with 2010 sentences using MIRA.",
        "In our work, we have many more parameters to train, and the training is conducted on the entire training corpora.",
        "Our GT based optimization algorithm is highly parallelizable and efficient, which is the key for large scale discriminative training.",
        "As a further related work, Rosti et al. (2011) have proposed using differentiable expected BLEU score as the objective to train system combination parameters.",
        "Other work related to the computation of expected BLEU in common with ours includes minimum Bayes risk approaches (Smith and Eisner 2006, Tromble et al., 2008) and lattice-based MERT (Macherey et al., 2008).",
        "In these earlier work, however, the phrase and lexicon translation models used remained unchanged.",
        "Another line of research that is closely related to our work is phrase table refinement and pruning.",
        "Wuebker et al. (2010) proposed a method to train the phrase translation model using Expectation-Maximization algorithm with a leave-one-out strategy.",
        "The parallel sentences were forced to be aligned at the phrase level using the phrase table and other features as in a decoding process.",
        "Then the phrase translation probabilities were estimated based on the phrase alignments.",
        "To prevent overfitting, the statistics of phrase pairs from a particular sentence was excluded from the phrase table when aligning that sentence.",
        "However, as pointed out by Liang et al(2006), the same problem as in the bold updating existed, i.e., forced alignment between a source sentence and its reference translation was tricky, and the proposed alignment was likely to be unreliable.",
        "The method presented in this paper is free from this problem.",
        "3.",

      "heading": "5.3 Experiments on the IWSLT2011 benchmark As the second evaluation task, we apply our new method described in this paper to the 2011 IWSLT Chinese-to-English machine translation benchmark (Federico et al., 2011). The main focus of the IWSLT2011 Evaluation is the translation of TED talks (www.ted.com). These talks are originally given in English. In the Chinese-to-English translation task, we are provided with human translated Chinese text with punctuations inserted. The goal is to match the human transcribed English speech with punctuations. This is an open-domain spoken language translation task. The training data consist of 110K sentences in the transcripts of the TED talks and their translations, in English and Chinese, respectively. Each sentence consists of 20 words on average. Two development sets are provided, namely, dev2010 and tst2010. They consist of 934 sentences and 1664 sentences, respectively. We use dev2010 for ? tuning and tst2010 for validation. The test set tst2011 consists of 1450 sentences. In our system, a primary phrase table is trained from the 110K TED parallel training data, and a 3-gram LM is trained on the English side of the parallel data. We are also provided additional out-of-domain data for potential usage. From them, we train a secondary 5-gram LM on 115M sentences of supplementary English data, and a secondary phrase table from 500K sentences selected from the supplementary UN corpus by the method proposed by Axelrod et al. (2011). In carrying out the maximum expected BLEU training, we use 100-best list and tune the regularization factor to the optimal value of ? = 1?10?? . We only train the parameters of the primary phrase table. The secondary phrase table and LM are excluded from the training process since the out-of-domain phrase table is less relevant to the TED translation task, and the large LM slows down the N-best generation process significantly. At the end, we perform one final MERT to tune the relative weights with all features including the secondary phrase table and LM. The translation results are presented in Table 4. The baseline is a phrase-based system with all features including the secondary phrase table and LM. The new system uses the same features except that the primary phrase table is discriminatively",

        "First, we propose a new objective function (Eq.",
        "9) for training of large-scale translation models, including phrase and lexicon models, with more parameters than all previous methods have attempted.",
        "The objective function consists of 1) the utility function of expected BLEU score, and 2) the regularization term taking the form of KL divergence in the parameter space.",
        "The expected BLEU score is closely linked to translation quality and the regularization is essential when many parameters are trained at scale.",
        "The importance of both is verified experimentally with the results presented in this paper.",
        "Second, through non-trivial derivation, we show that the novel objective function of Eq.",
        "(9) is amenable to iterative GT updates, where each update is equipped with a closed-form formula.",
        "Third, the new objective function and new optimization technique are successfully applied to two important machine translation tasks, with implementation issues resolved (e.g., training schedule and hyper-parameter tuning, etc.).",
        "The superior results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",
        "Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Chris Quirk, Mei-Yuh Hwang, and Bowen Zhou for the assistance with the MT system and/or for the valuable discussions."
