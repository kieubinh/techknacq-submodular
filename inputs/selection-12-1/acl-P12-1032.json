        "Table 3 shows the performance of our consensus-based re-ranking and decoding on the IWSLT data set.",
        "To perform consensus-based re-ranking, we first use the baseline decoder to get the n-best list for each sentence of development and test data, then we create graph using the n-best lists and training data as we described in section 5.1, and perform semi-supervised training as mentioned in section 4.3.",
        "As we can see from Table 3, our consensus-based re-ranking (G-Re-Rank) outperforms the baseline significantly, not only for the development data, but also for the test data.",
        "Instead of using graph-based consensus confidence as features in the log-linear model, we perform structured label propagation (Struct-LP) to re-rank the n-best list directly, and the similarity measures for source sentences and translation candidates are symmetrical sentence level BLEU (equation (10)).",

        "supervised training to calculate graph-based consensus features, and tune the weights for all the features we used.",
        "In Table 3, we can see that our consensus-based decoding (G-Decode) is much better than baseline, and also better than consensus-based re-ranking method.",
        "That is reasonable since the neighbor/local similarity features not only re-rank the final n-best output, but also the spans during decoding.",
        "To test the contribution of each kind of features, we first remove all the local consensus features and perform consensus-based re-ranking and decoding (G-Re-Rank-GC and G-Decode-GC), and then we remove all the graph-based consensus features to test the contribution of local consensus features (G-Re-Rank-LC and G-Decode-LC).",
        "Without the graph-based consensus features, our consensus-based re-ranking and decoding is simplified into a consensus re-ranking and consensus decoding system, which only re-rank the candidates according to the consensus information of other candidates in the same n-best list.",

        "We perform modified label propagation with the separate graphs to get the graph-based consensus for n-best list of each sentence, and the graph-based consensus will be recorded for the MERT to tune the weights.",
        "From Table 4, we can see that, Struct-LP improves the performance slightly, but not significantly.",
