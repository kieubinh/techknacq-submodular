        "The transliteration model is a joint source channel model (Li et al., 2004).",
        "The non-transliteration model assumes no correlation between source and target word characters, and independently generates a source and a target word using two fixed unigram character models.",
        "We use Expectation Maximization (EM) to learn parameters maximizing the likelihood of the interpolation of both sub-models.",
        "At test time, we label word pairs as transliterations if they have a higher probability assigned by the transliteration sub-model than by the non-transliteration sub-model.",
        "We extend the unsupervised system to a semi-supervised system by adding a new S-step to the EM algorithm.",
        "The S-step takes the probability estimates from unlabelled data (computed in the M-step) and uses them as a backoff distribution to smooth probabilities which were estimated from labelled data.",
        "The smoothed probabilities are then used in the next E-step.",
        "In this way, the parameters learned by EM are constrained to values which are close to those estimated from the labelled data.",
        "We evaluate our unsupervised and semi-supervised transliteration mining system on the datasets available from the NEWS 2010 shared task on transliteration mining (Kumaran et al., 2010b).",
        "We call this task NEWS10 later on.",
        "Compared with a baseline unsupervised system our unsupervised system achieves up to 5% better F-measure.",
        "On the NEWS10 dataset, our unsupervised system achieves an F-measure of up to 95.7%, and on three language pairs, it performs better than all systems which participated in NEWS10.",
        "We also evaluate our semi-supervised system which additionally uses the NEWS10 labelled data for training.",
        "It achieves an improvement of up to 3.7% F-measure over our unsupervised system.",
