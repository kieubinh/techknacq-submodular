        "Semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Juraf-sky, 2002) involves predicting predicate argument structure, i.e. both the identification of arguments and their assignment to underlying semantic roles.",

        "(a) [A0Peter] blamed [A1Mary] [A2for planning a theft].",

        "Though syntactic representations are often predictive of semantic roles (Levin, 1993), the interface between syntactic and semantic representations is far from trivial.",
        "Lack of simple deterministic rules for mapping syntax to shallow semantics motivates the use of statistical methods.",
        "Most of the current statistical approaches to SRL are supervised, requiring large quantities of human annotated data to estimate model parameters.",

        "We expect that both linguistic relatedness and variability can serve to improve semantic parses in individual languages: while the former can provide additional evidence, the latter can serve to reduce uncertainty in ambiguous cases.",
        "For example, in our sentences (a) and (b) representing so-called blame alternation (Levin, 1993), the same information is conveyed in two different ways and a successful model of semantic role labeling needs to learn the corresponding linkings from the data.",

        "Unsupervised learning in crosslingual setting has been an active area of research in recent years.",
        "However, most of this research has focused on induction of syntactic structures (Kuhn, 2004; Snyder et al., 2009) or morphologic analysis (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) and we are not aware of any previous work on induction of semantic representations in the crosslingual setting.",
        "Learning of semantic representations in the context of monolingual weakly-parallel data was studied in Titov and Kozhevnikov (2010) but their setting was semi-supervised and they experimented only on a restricted domain.",
        "Most of the SRL research has focused on the supervised setting, however, lack of annotated resources for most languages and insufficient coverage provided by the existing resources motivates the need for using unlabeled data or other forms of weak supervision.",
        "This includes methods based on graph alignment between labeled and unlabeled data (Fu?rstenau and Lapata, 2009), using unlabeled data to improve lexical generalization (Deschacht and Moens, 2009), and projection of annotation across languages (Padó and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011).",
        "Semi-supervised and weakly-supervised techniques have also been explored for other types of semantic representations but these studies again have mostly focused on restricted domains (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2009; Goldwasser et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2011).",
        "Early unsupervised approaches to the SRL task include (Swier and Stevenson, 2004), where the VerbNet verb lexicon was used to guide unsupervised learning, and a generative model of Grenager and Manning (2006) which exploits linguistic priors on syntactic-semantic interface.",
        "More recently, the role induction problem has been studied in Lang and Lapata (2010) where it has been reformulated as a problem of detecting alternations and mapping non-standard linkings to the canonical ones.",
        "Later, Lang and Lapata (2011a) proposed an algorithmic approach to clustering argument signatures which achieves higher accuracy and outperforms the syntactic baseline.",
        "In Lang and Lapata (2011b), the role induction problem is formulated as a graph partitioning problem: each vertex in the graph corresponds to a predicate occurrence and edges represent lexical and syntactic similarities between the occurrences.",
        "Unsupervised induction of semantics has also been studied in Poon and Domin-gos (2009) and Titov and Klementiev (2011) but the induced representations are not entirely compatible with the PropBank-style annotations and they have been evaluated only on a question answering task for the biomedical domain.",
        "Also, a related task of unsupervised argument identification has been considered in Abend et al. (2009)."
