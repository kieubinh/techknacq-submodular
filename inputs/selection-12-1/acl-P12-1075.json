        "Relation extraction (RE) is the task of determining semantic relations between entities mentioned in text.",
        "RE is an essential part of information extraction and is useful for question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), textual entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004) and many other applications.",
        "A common approach to RE is to assume that relations to be extracted are part of a predefined ontology.",
        "For example, the relations are given in knowledge bases such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) or DBpedia (Bizer et al., 2009).",
        "However, in many applications, ontologies do not yet exist or have low coverage.",
        "Even when they do exist, their maintenance and extension are considered to be a substantial bottleneck.",
        "This has led to considerable interest in unsupervised relation discovery (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Bollegala et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011).",
        "Here, the relation extractor simultaneously discovers facts expressed in natural language, and the ontology into which they are assigned.",
        "Many relation discovery methods rely exclusively on the notion of either shallow or syntactic patterns that appear between two named entities (Bollegala et al., 2010; Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "Such patterns could be sequences of lemmas and Part-of-Speech tags, or lexicalized dependency paths.",
        "Generally speaking, relation discovery attempts to cluster such patterns into sets of equivalent or similar meaning.",
        "Whether we use sequences or dependency paths, we will encounter the problem of polysemy.",
        "For example, a pattern such as ?A beat B?",
        "can mean that person A wins over B in competing for a political position, as pair ?",
        "(Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jonathan Tasini)?",
        "in ?Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton beats rival Jonathan Tasini for Senate.?",
        "It can also indicate that an athlete A beat B in a sports match, as pair ?",
        "(Dmitry Tur-sunov, Andy Roddick)?",
        "in ?Dmitry Tursunov beat the best American player Andy Roddick.?",
        "Moreover, it can mean ?physically beat?",
        "as pair ?(Mr.",
        "Harris, Mr. Simon)?",
        "in ?On Sept. 7, 1999, Mr. Harris fatally beat Mr.",
        "Simon.?",
        "This is known as poly-semy.",
        "If we work with patterns alone, our extractor will not be able to differentiate between these cases.",
        "Most previous approaches do not explicitly address this problem.",
        "Lin and Pantel (2001) assumes only one sense per path.",
        "In (Pantel et al., 2007), they augment each relation with its selectional pref",
        "erences, i.e. fine-grained entity types of two arguments, to handle polysemy.",
        "However, such fine grained entity types come at a high cost.",
        "It is difficult to discover a high-quality set of fine-grained entity types due to unknown criteria for developing such a set.",
        "In particular, the optimal granularity of entity types depends on the particular pattern we consider.",
        "For example, a pattern like ?A beat B?",
        "could refer to A winning a sports competition against B, or a political election.",
        "To differentiate between these senses we need types such as ?Politician?",
        "or ?Athlete?.",
        "However, for ?A, the parent of B?",
        "we only need to distinguish between persons and organizations (for the case of the sub-organization relation).",
        "In addition, there are senses that just cannot be determined by entity types alone: Take the meaning of ?A beat B?",
        "where A and B are both persons; this could mean A physically beats B, or it could mean that A defeated B in a competition.",
        "In this paper we address the problem of polysemy, while we circumvent the problem of finding fine-grained entity types.",
        "Instead of mapping entities to fine-grained types, we directly induce pattern senses by clustering feature representations of pattern contexts, i.e. the entity pairs associated with a pattern.",
        "This allows us to employ not only local features such as words, but also global features such as the document and sentence themes.",
        "To cluster the entity pairs of a single relation pattern into senses, we develop a simple extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Once we have our pattern senses, we merge them into clusters of different patterns with a similar sense.",
        "We employ hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a similarity metric that considers features such as the entity arguments, and the document and sentence themes.",
        "We perform experiments on New York Times articles and consider lexicalized dependency paths as patterns in our data.",
        "In the following we shall use the term path and pattern exchangeably.",
        "We compare our approach with several baseline systems, including a generative model approach, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between senses, and our approach with different features.",
        "We perform both automatic and manual evaluations.",
        "For automatic evaluation, we use relation instances in Freebase as ground truth, and employ two clustering metrics, pairwise F-score and B3 (as used in cofer-ence).",
        "Experimental results show that our approach improves over the baselines, and that using global features achieves better performance than using entity type based features.",
        "For manual evaluation, we employ a set intrusion method (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "The results also show that our approach discovers relation clusters that human evaluators find coherent."
