        "The majority of systems designed to tackle this task make use of textual information in a bag-of-words manner.",
        "They use little temporal information, generally only using document metadata, such as the document creation time (DCT).",
        "The few systems that do make use of temporal information (such as the now discontinued Google timeline), only extract absolute, full dates (that feature a day, month and year).",
        "In our corpus, described in Section 3.1, we found that only 7% of extracted temporal expressions are absolute dates.",
        "We distinguish our work from that of previous researchers in that we have focused primarily on extracted temporal information as opposed to other textual content.",
        "We show that using linguistic temporal processing helps extract important events in texts.",
        "Our system extracts a maximum of temporal information and uses only this information to detect salient dates for the construction of event timelines.",
        "Other types of content are used for initial thematic document retrieval.",
        "Output is a list of dates, ranked from most important to least important with respect to the given topic.",
        "Each date is presented with a set of relevant sentences.",
        "We can see this work as a new, easily evaluable task of ?date extraction?, which is an important component of timeline summarization.",

        "Section 3 presents the resources used and gives an overview of the system.",
        "The system used for temporal analysis is described in Section 4, and the strategy used for indexing and finding salient dates, as well as the results obtained, are given in Section 51."
