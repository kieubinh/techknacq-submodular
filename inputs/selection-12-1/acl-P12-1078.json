        "Many scientific subjects, such as psychology, learning sciences, and biology, have adopted computational approaches to discover latent patterns in large scale datasets (Chen and Lombardi, 2010; Baker and Yacef, 2009).",
        "In contrast, the primary methods for historical research still rely on individual judgement and reading primary and secondary sources, which are time consuming and expensive.",
        "Furthermore, traditional human-based methods might have good precision when searching for relevant information, but suffer from low recall.",
        "Even when language technologies have been applied to historical problems, their focus has often been on information retrieval (Gotscharek et al., 2009), to improve accessibility of texts.",
        "Empirical methods for analysis and interpretation of these texts is therefore a burgeoning new field.",
        "Court opinions form one of the most important parts of the legal domain, and can serve as an excellent resource to understand both legal and political history (Popkin, 2007).",
        "Historians often use court opinions as a primary source for constructing interpretations of the past.",
        "They not only report the proceedings of a court, but also express a judges?",
        "views toward the issues at hand in a case, and reflect the legal and political environment of the region and period.",
        "Since there exists many thousands of early court opinions, however, it is difficult for legal historians to manually analyze the documents case by case.",
        "Instead, historians often restrict themselves to discussing a relatively small subset of legal opinions that are considered decisive.",
        "While this approach has merit, new technologies should allow extraction of patterns from large samples of opinions.",
        "Latent variable models, such as latent Dirichlet al location (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999), have been used in the past to facilitate social science research.",
        "However, they have numerous drawbacks, as many topics are uninterpretable, overwhelmed by uninformative words, or represent background language use that is unrelated to the dimensions of analysis that qualitative researchers are interested in.",
        "SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011a), a recently proposed sparse additive generative model of language, addresses many of the drawbacks of LDA.",
        "SAGE assumes a background distribution of language use, and enforces sparsity in individual topics.",
        "Another advantage, from a social science perspective, is that SAGE can be derived from a standard logit random-utility model of judicial opinion writing, in contrast to LDA.",
        "In this work we extend SAGE to the supervised case of joint region and time period prediction.",
        "We formulate the resulting sparse mixed-effects (SME) model as being made up of mixed effects that not only contain random effects from sparse topics, but also mixed effects from available metadata.",
        "To do this we augment SAGE with two sparse latent variables that model the region and time of a document, as well as a third sparse latent",
        "variable that captures the interactions among the region, time and topic latent variables.",
        "We also introduce a multiclass perceptron-style weight estimation method to model the contributions from different sparse latent variables to the word posterior probabilities in this predictive task.",
        "Importantly, the resulting distributions are still sparse and can therefore be qualitatively analyzed by experts with relatively little noise.",
        "In the next two sections, we overview work related to qualitative social science analysis using latent variable models, and introduce our slavery-related early United States court opinion data.",
        "We describe our sparse mixed-effects model for joint modeling of region, time, and topic in section 4.",
        "Experiments are presented in section 5, with a robust analysis from qualitative and quantitative standpoints in section 5.2, and we discuss the conclusions of this work in section 6."

        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for automatically understanding and identifying key information in historical data have not yet been explored until recently.",
        "Related research efforts include using the LDA model for topic modeling in historical newspapers (Yang et al., 2011), a rule-based approach to extract verbs in historical Swedish texts (Pettersson and Nivre, 2011), a system for semantic tagging of historical Dutch archives (Cybulska and Vossen, 2011).",
        "Despite our historical data domain, our approach is more relevant to text classification and topic modelling.",
        "Traditional discriminative methods, such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression, have been very popular in various text categorization tasks (Joachims, 1998; Wang and McKeown, 2010) in the past decades.",
        "However, the main problem with these methods is that although they are accurate in classifying documents, they do not aim at helping us to understand the documents.",
        "Another problem is lack of expressiveness.",
        "For example, SVM does not have latent variables to model the subtle differences and interactions of features from different domains (e.g. text, links, and date), but rather treats them as a ?bag-of-features?.",
        "Generative methods, by contrast, can show the causes to effects, have attracted attentions in recent years due to the rich expressiveness of the models and competitive performances in predictive tasks (Wang et al., 2011).",
        "For example, Nguyen et al.",
        "(2010) study the effect of the context of interaction in blogs using a standard LDA model.",

        "Eisenstein et al. (2010) use a latent variable model to predict geolocation information of Twitter users, and investigate geographic variations of language use.",
        "Temporally, topic models have been used to show the shift in language use over time in online communities (Nguyen and Rose?, 2011) and the evolution of topics over time (Shub-hankar et al., 2011).",
        "When evaluating understandability, however, dense word distributions are a serious issue in many topic models as well as other predictive tasks.",
        "Such topic models are often dominated by function words and do not always effectively separate topics.",
        "Recent work have shown significant gains in both pre-dictiveness and interpretatibility by enforcing sparsity, such as in the task of discovering sociolinguistic patterns of language use (Eisenstein et al., 2011b).",
        "Our proposed sparse mixed-effects model balances the pros and cons the above methods, aiming at higher classification accuracies using the SME model for joint geographic and temporal aspects prediction, as well as richer interaction of components from metadata to enhance historical analysis in legal opinions.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to discover region and time specific topical patterns jointly in historical texts."

        "The fugitive slave conflicts of the mid-19th century that led to the civil war were precisely about this aversion of the northern states to having to return runaway slaves to the Southern states.",

        "We then compare these to the relative frequencies of Wahl's categorization in the states that overlap with our Region 2 in Figure 6 and do a ?2 test for goodness of fit, which allows us to reject difference at 0.1% confidence.",

        "We jointly model those observed labels as well as unsupervised topic modelling.",
        "In our experiments, we have shown that the resulting model jointly predicts the region and the time of a given court document.",
        "Across vocabulary sizes and number of topics, we have achieved better system accuracy than state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models of text.",
        "Our quantitative analysis shows that early US state supreme court opinions are predictable, and contains distinct views towards slave-related topics, and the shifts among opinions depending on different periods of time.",
        "In addition, our model has been shown to be effective for qualitative analysis of historical data, revealing patterns that are consistent with the history of the period.",
        "This approach to modelling text is not limited to the legal domain.",
        "A key aspect of future work will be to extend the Sparse Mixed-Effects paradigm to other problems within the social sciences where metadata is available but qualitative analysis at a large scale is difficult or impossible.",
        "In addition to historical documents, this can include humanities texts, which are often sorely lacking in empirical justifications, and analysis of online communities, which are often rife with available metadata but produce content far faster than it can be analyzed by experts."
