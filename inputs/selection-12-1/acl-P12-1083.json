        "The Chinese comma, which looks graphically very similar to its English counterpart, is functionally quite different.",
        "It has attracted a significant amount of research that studied the problem from the viewpoint of natural language processing.",
        "For example, Jin et al( 2004) and Li et al( 2005) view the disambiguation of the Chinese comma as a way of breaking up long Chinese sentences into shorter ones to facilitate parsing.",
        "The idea is to split a long sentence into multiple comma-separated segments, parse them individually, and reconstruct the syntactic parse for the original sentence.",
        "Although both studies show a positive impact of this approach, comma disambiguation is viewed merely as a convenient tool to help achieve a more important goal.",
        "Xue and Yang ( 2011) point out that the very reason for the existence of these long Chinese sentences is because the Chinese comma is ambiguous and in some context, it identifies the boundary of a sentence just as a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark does.",
        "The disambiguation of comma is viewed as a necessary step to detect sentence boundaries in Chinese and it can benefit a whole range of downstream NLP applications such as syntactic parsing and Machine Translation.",
        "In Machine Translation, for example, it is very typical for ?one?",
        "Chinese sentence to be translated into multiple English sentences, with each comma-separated segment corresponding to one English sentence.",
        "In the present work, we expand this view and propose to look at the Chinese comma in the context of discourse analysis.",
        "The Chinese comma is viewed as a delimiter of elementary discourse units (EDUs), in the sense of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Carlson et al., 2002; Mann et al., 1988).",
        "It is also considered to be the anchor of discourse relations, in the sense of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDT) (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "Disambiguating the comma is thus necessary for the purpose of discourse segmentation, the identification of EDUs, a first step in building up the discourse structure of a Chinese text.",
        "Developing a supervised or semi-supervised model of discourse segmentation would require ground truth annotated based on a well-established representation scheme, but as of right now no such annotation exists for Chinese to the best of our knowledge.",
        "However, syntactically annotated treebanks often contain important clues that can be used to infer discourse-level information.",
        "We present",
        "a method of automatically deriving a preliminary form of discourse structure anchored by the Chinese comma from the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005), and using this information to train and test supervised models.",
        "This discourse information is formalized as a classification of the Chinese comma, with each class representing the boundary of an elementary discourse unit as well as the anchor of a coarse-grained discourse relation between the two discourse units that it delimits.",
        "We then develop two comma classification methods.",
        "In the first method, we replace the part-of-speech (POS) tag of each comma in the CTB with a derived discourse category and retrain a state-of-the-art Chinese parser on the relabeled data.",
        "We then evaluate how accurately the commas are classified in the parsing process.",
        "In the second method, we parse these sentences and extract lexical and syntactic information as features to predict these new discourse categories.",
        "The second approach gives us more control over what features to extract and our results show that it compares favorably against the first approach.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present our approach to automatically extract discourse information from a syntactically annotated treebank and present our classification scheme.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our supervised learning methods and the features we extracted.",
        "Section 4 presents our experiment setup and experimental results.",

        "There are many ways to conceptualize the discourse structure of a text (Mann et al., 1988; Prasad et al., 2008), but there is more of a consensus among researchers about the fundamental building blocks of the discourse structure.",
        "For the Rhetorical Discourse Theory, the building blocks are Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs).",
        "For the PDT, the building blocks are abstract objects such as propositions, facts.",
        "Although they are phrased in different ways, syntactically these discourse units are generally realized as clauses or built on top of clauses.",

        "In (1), for example, Comma [1] marks the boundary of a discourse unit while Comma [2] does not.",
        "This is reflected in its English translation: while the first comma corresponds to an English comma, the second comma is not translated at all, as it marks the boundary between a subject and its predicate, where no comma is needed in English.",

        "In the syntactic annotation of the sentence, illustrated in (a), it is clear that while the first comma in the sentence marks the boundary of a clause, the second one marks the demarcation between the subject NP and the predicate VP and thus is not an indicator of a discourse boundary.",
        "In addition to a binary distinction of whether a comma marks the boundary of a discourse unit, the CTB annotation also allows the extraction of a more elaborate classification of commas based on coordination and subordination relations of comma-separated clauses.",
