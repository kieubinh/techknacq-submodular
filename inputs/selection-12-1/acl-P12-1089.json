        "Information extraction (IE) systems recover structured information from text.",
        "Template filling is an IE task where the goal is to populate the fields of a target relation, for example to extract the attributes of a job posting (Califf and Mooney, 2003) or to recover the details of a corporate acquisition event from a news story (Freitag and McCallum, 2000).",
        "This task is challenging due to the wide range of cues from the input documents, as well as non-textual background knowledge, that must be considered to find the best joint assignment for the fields of the extracted relation.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows an extraction from CMU seminar announcement corpus (Freitag and McCallum, 2000).",
        "Here, the goal is to perform mention detection and extraction, by finding all of the text spans, or mentions,",
        "tions are highlighted in the text, grouped by color.",
        "that describe field values, unify these mentions by grouping them according to target field, and normalizing the results within each group to provide the final extractions.",
        "Each of these steps requires significant knowledge about the target relation.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the mention ?3:30?",
        "appears three times and provides the only reference to a time.",
        "We must infer that this is the starting time, that the end time is never explicitly mentioned, and also that the event is in the afternoon.",
        "Such inferences may not hold in more general settings, such as extraction for medical emergencies or related events.",
        "In this paper, we present a joint modeling and learning approach for the combined tasks of mention detection, unification, and template filling, as described above.",
        "As we will see in Section 2, previous work has mostly focused on learning tagging",
        "models for mention detection, which can be difficult to aggregate into a full template extraction, or directly learning template field value extractors, often in isolation and with no reasoning across different fields in the same relation.",
        "We present a simple, feature-rich, discriminative model that readily incorporates a broad range of possible constraints on the mentions and joint field assignments.",
        "Such an approach allows us to learn, for each target relation, an integrated model to weight the different extraction options, including for example the likely lengths for events, or the fact that start times should come before end times.",
        "However, there are significant computation challenges that come with this style of joint learning.",
        "We demonstrate empirically that these challenges can be solved with a combination of greedy beam decoding, performed directly in the joint space of possible mention clusters and field assignments, and structured Perceptron-style learning algorithm (Collins, 2002).",
        "We report experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets in different genres, the CMU seminar announcements and corporate acquisitions (Freitag and McCallum, 2000).",
        "In each case, we evaluated both template extraction and mention detection performance.",
        "Our joint learning approach provides consistently strong results across every setting, including new state-of-the-art results.",
        "We also demonstrate, through ablation studies on the feature set, the need for joint modeling and the relative importance of the different types of joint constraints."

        "Research on the task of template filling has focused on the extraction of field value mentions from the underlying text.",
        "Typically, these values are extracted based on local evidence, where the most likely entity is assigned to each slot (Roth and Yih, 2001; Siefkes, 2008).",
        "There has been little effort towards a comprehensive approach that includes mention unification, as well as considers the structure of the target relational schema to create semantically valid outputs.",
        "Recently, Haghighi and Klein (2010) presented a generative semi-supervised approach for template filling.",
        "In their model, slot-filling entities are first generated, and entity mentions are then realized in text.",
        "Thus, their approach performs coreference at slot level.",
        "In addition to proper nouns (named entity mentions) that are considered in this work, they also account for nominal and pronominal noun mentions.",
        "This work presents a discriminative approach to this problem.",
        "An advantage of a discriminative framework is that it allows the incorporation of rich and possibly overlapping features.",
        "In addition, we enforce label consistency and semantic coherence at record level.",
        "Other related works perform structured relation discovery for different settings of information extraction.",
        "In open IE, entities and relations may be inferred jointly (Roth and Yih, 2002; Yao et al., 2011).",
        "In this IE task, the target relation must agree with the entity types assigned to it; e.g., born-in relation requires a place as its argument.",
        "In addition, extracted relations may be required to be consistent with an existing ontology (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "Compared with the extraction of tuples of entity mention pairs, template filling is associated with a more complex target relational schema.",
        "Interestingly, several researchers have attempted to model label consistency and high-level relational constraints using state-of-the-art sequential models of named entity recognition (NER).",
        "Mainly, predetermined word-level dependencies were represented as links in the underlying graphical model (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "Finkel et al. (2005) further modelled high-level semantic constraints; for example, using the CMU seminar announcements dataset, spans labeled as start time or end time were required to be semantically consistent.",
        "In the proposed framework we take a bottom-up approach to identifying entity mentions in text, where given a noisy set of candidate named entities, described using rich semantic and surface features, discriminative learning is applied to label these mentions.",
        "We will show that this approach yields better performance on the CMU seminar announcement dataset when evaluated in terms of NER.",
        "Our approach is complimentary to NER methods, as it can consolidate noisy overlapping predictions from multiple systems into coherent sets."
