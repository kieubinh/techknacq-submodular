        "However, bilingual corpora are only available in very limited domains and building bilingual resources in a new domain is usually very expensive.",
        "It is an interesting question whether a model that is trained on an existing large bilingual corpus in a specific domain can be adapted to another domain for which little parallel data is present.",

        "Common techniques for model adaptation adapt two main components of contemporary state-of-the-art SMT systems: the language model and the translation model.",
        "However, language model adaptation is a more straightforward problem compared to translation model adaptation, because various measures such as perplexity of adapted language models can be easily computed on data in the target domain.",
        "As a result, language model adaptation has been well studied in various work (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997; Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1997; Bacchiani and Roark, 2003; Eck et al., 2004) both for speech recognition and for machine translation.",
        "It is also easier to obtain monolingual data in the target domain, compared to bilingual data which is required for translation model adaptation.",
        "In this paper, we focused on adapting only the translation model by fixing a language model for all the experiments.",
        "We expect domain adaptation for machine translation can be improved further by combining orthogonal techniques for translation model adaptation combined with language model adaptation.",
        "In this paper, a new approach for adapting the translation model is proposed.",
        "We use a novel system combination approach called ensemble decoding in order to combine two or more translation models with the goal of constructing a system that outperforms all the component models.",
        "The strength of this system combination method is that the systems are combined in the decoder.",
        "This enables the decoder to pick the best hypotheses for each span of the input.",
        "The main applications of ensemble models are domain adaptation, domain mixing and system combination.",

        "This enables us to experiment with a number of different operations as opposed to sticking to only one combination method.",
        "Finally, by avoiding increasing the number of features we can add as many translation models as we need without serious performance drop.",
        "In addition, MERT would not be an appropriate optimizer when the number of features increases a certain amount (Chiang et al., 2008).",
        "Our approach differs from the model combination approach of DeNero et al. (2010), a generalization of consensus or minimum Bayes risk decoding where the search space consists of those of multiple systems, in that model combination uses forest of derivations of all component models to do the combination.",
        "In other words, it requires all component models to fully decode each sentence, compute n-gram expectations from each component model and calculate posterior probabilities over translation derivations.",
        "While, in our approach we only use partial hypotheses from component models and the derivation forest is constructed by the ensemble model.",
        "A major difference is that in the model combination approach the component search spaces are conjoined and they are not intermingled as opposed to our approach where these search spaces are intermixed on spans.",
        "This enables us to generate new sentences that cannot be generated by component models.",
        "Furthermore, various combination methods can be explored in our approach.",
        "Finally, main techniques used in this work are orthogonal to our approach such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding, using n-gram features and tuning using MERT.",
        "Finally, our work is most similar to that of Liu et al. (2009) where max-derivation and max-translation decoding have been used.",
        "Max-derivation finds a derivation with highest score and max-translation finds the highest scoring translation by summing the score of all derivations with the same yield.",
        "The combination can be done in two levels: translation-level and derivation-level.",
        "Their derivation-level max-translation decoding is similar to our ensemble decoding with wsum as the mixture operation.",
        "We did not restrict ourself to this particular mixture operation and experimented with a number of different mixing techniques and as Table 3 shows we could improve over wsum in our experimental setup.",
        "Liu et al. (2009) used a modified version of MERT to tune max-translation decoding weights, while we use a two-step approach using MERT for tuning each component model separately and then using CONDOR to tune component weights on top of them."

        "In this paper, we presented a new approach for domain adaptation using ensemble decoding.",
        "In this approach a number of MT systems are combined at decoding time in order to form an ensemble model.",
        "The model combination can be done using various mixture operations.",
        "We showed that this approach can gain up to 2.2 BLEU points over its concatenation baseline and 0.39 BLEU points over a powerful mixture model.",
        "Future work includes extending this approach to use multiple translation models with multiple language models in ensemble decoding.",
        "Different mixture operations can be investigated and the behaviour of each operation can be studied in more details.",
        "We will also add capability of supporting syntax-based ensemble decoding and experiment how a phrase-based system can benefit from syntax information present in a syntax-aware MT system.",
        "Furthermore, ensemble decoding can be applied on domain mixing settings in which development sets and test sets include sentences from different domains and genres, and this is a very suitable setting for an ensemble model which can adapt to new domains at test time.",
        "In addition, we can extend our approach by applying some of the techniques used in other system combination approaches such as consensus decoding, using n-gram features, tuning using forest-based MERT, among other possible extensions."
