        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is needed as a preprocessor for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as parsing, named entity recognition (NER), and text chunking.",
        "Since POS tagging is normally performed in the early step of NLP tasks, the errors in POS tagging are critical in that they affect subsequent steps and often lower the overall performance of NLP tasks.",
        "Previous studies on POS tagging have shown high performance with machine learning techniques (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Brants, 2000; Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Among the types of machine learning approaches, supervised machine learning techniques were commonly used in early studies on POS tagging.",
        "With the characteristics of a language (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Kudo et al., 2004) and informative features for POS tagging (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), the state-of-the-art supervised POS tagging achieves over 97% of accuracy (Shen et al., 2007; Manning, 2011).",
        "This performance is generally regarded as the maximum performance that can be achieved by supervised machine learning techniques.",
        "There have also been many studies on POS tagging with semi-supervised (Subramanya et al., 2010; S?gaard, 2011) or unsupervised machine learning methods (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Das and Petrov, 2011) recently.",
        "However, there still exists room to improve supervised POS tagging in terms of error differentiation.",
        "It should be noted that not all errors are equally important in POS tagging.",
        "Let us consider the parse trees in Figure 1 as an example.",
        "In Figure 1(a), the word ?plans?",
        "is mistagged as a noun where it should be a verb.",
        "This error results in a wrong parse tree that is severely different from the correct tree shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "The verb phrase of the verb ?plans?",
        "in Figure 1(b) is discarded in Figure 1(a) and the whole sentence is analyzed as a single noun phrase.",
        "Figure 1(c) and (d) show another tagging error and its effect.",
        "In Figure 1(c), a noun is tagged as a NNS (plural noun) where its correct tag is NN (singular or mass noun).",
        "However, the error in Figure 1(c) affects only locally the noun phrase to which ?physics?",
        "belongs.",
        "As a result, the general structure of the parse tree in Figure 1(c) is nearly the same as",
        "the correct one in Figure 1(d).",
        "That is, a sentence analyzed with this type of error would yield a correct or near-correct result in many NLP tasks such as machine translation and text chunking.",
        "The goal of this paper is to differentiate the serious POS tagging errors from the minor errors.",
        "POS tagging is generally regarded as a classification task, and zero-one loss is commonly used in learning classifiers (Altun et al., 2003).",
        "Since zero-one loss considers all errors equally, it can not distinguish error types.",
        "Therefore, a new loss is required to incorporate different error types into the learning machines.",
        "This paper proposes two gradient loss functions to reflect differences among POS tagging errors.",
        "The functions assign relatively small cost to minor errors, while larger cost is given to serious errors.",
        "They are applied to learning multiclass support vector machines (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) which is trained to minimize the serious errors.",
        "Overall accuracy of this SVM is not improved against the state-of-the-art POS tagger, but the serious errors are significantly reduced with the proposed method.",
        "The effect of the fewer serious errors is shown by applying it to the well-known NLP task of text chunking.",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher F1-score compared to other POS taggers.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the related studies on POS tagging.",
        "In Section 3, serious and minor errors are defined, and it is shown that both errors are observable in a general corpus.",

        "In early studies, rich linguistic features and supervised machine learning techniques are applied by using annotated corpora like the Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "For instance, Ratnaparkhi (1996) used a maximum entropy model for POS tagging.",
        "In this study, the features for rarely appearing words in a corpus are expanded to improve the overall performance.",

        "Due to the high accuracy of supervised approaches for POS tagging, it has been deemed that there is no room to improve the performance on POS tagging in supervised manner.",
        "Thus, recent studies on POS tagging focus on semi-supervised (Spoustova?",

        "Most previous studies on POS tagging have focused on how to extract more linguistic features or how to adopt supervised or unsupervised approaches based on a single evaluation measure, accuracy.",
        "However, with a different viewpoint for errors on POS tagging, there is still some room to improve the performance of POS tagging for subsequent NLP tasks, even though the overall accuracy can not be much improved.",
        "In ordinary studies on POS tagging, costs of errors are equally assigned.",
        "However, with respect to the performance of NLP tasks relying on the result of POS tagging, errors should be treated differently.",
        "In the machine learning community, cost sensitive learning has been studied to differentiate costs among errors.",
        "By adopting different misclassification costs for each type of errors, a classifier is optimized to achieve the lowest expected cost (Elkan, 2001; Cai and Hofmann, 2004; Zhou and Liu, 2006)."

        "Our POS experiment has shown that if these loss functions are applied to multiclass SVMs, they could significantly reduce inter-category errors.",
        "Through the text chunking experiment, it is shown that the multiclass SVMs trained with the proposed loss functions which generate fewer inter-category errors achieve higher performance than existing POS taggers.",
        "We have shown that cost sensitive learning can be applied to POS tagging only with multiclass SVMs.",
        "However, the proposed loss functions are general enough to be applied to other existing POS taggers.",
        "Most supervised machine learning techniques are optimized on their loss functions.",
        "Therefore, the performance of POS taggers based on supervised machine learning techniques can be improved by applying the proposed loss functions to learn their classifiers."
