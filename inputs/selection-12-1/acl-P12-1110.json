        "We propose the first joint model for word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing for Chinese.",
        "Based on an extension of the incremental joint model for POS tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2011), we propose an efficient character-based decoding method that can combine features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing models.",
        "We also describe our method to align comparable states in the beam, and how we can combine features of different characteristics in our incremental framework.",
        "In experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB), we show that the accuracies of the three tasks can be improved significantly over the baseline models, particularly by 0.6% for POS tagging and 2.4% for dependency parsing.",
        "We also perform comparison experiments with the partially joint models."

        "In processing natural languages that do not include delimiters (e.g. spaces) between words, word segmentation is the crucial first step that is necessary to perform virtually all NLP tasks.",
        "Furthermore, the word-level information is often augmented with the POS tags, which, along with segmentation, form the basic foundation of statistical NLP.",
        "Because the tasks of word segmentation and POS tagging have strong interactions, many studies have been devoted to the task of joint word segmentation and POS tagging for languages such as Chinese (e.g. Kruengkrai et al. (2009)).",
        "This is because some of the segmentation ambiguities cannot be resolved without considering the surrounding grammatical constructions encoded in a sequence of POS tags.",
        "The joint approach to word segmentation and POS tagging has been reported to improve word segmentation and POS tagging accuracies by more than 1% in Chinese (Zhang and Clark, 2008).",
        "In addition, some researchers recently proposed a joint approach to Chinese POS tagging and dependency parsing (Li et al., 2011; Hatori et al., 2011); particularly, Hatori et al. (2011) proposed an incremental approach to this joint task, and showed that the joint approach improves the accuracies of these two tasks.",
        "In this context, it is natural to consider further a question regarding the joint framework: how strongly do the tasks of word segmentation and dependency parsing interact?",
        "In the following Chinese sentences: S?",
        "?sV 's ?",
        "'s current peace-prize and peace operation related The current peace prize and peace operations are related.",
        "S?",
        "'s V 's ?",
        "'s ?S current peace award peace operation related group The current peace is awarded to peace-operation-related groups.",
        "the only difference is the existence of the last word ?S; however, whether or not this word exists changes the whole syntactic structure and segmentation of the sentence.",
        "This is an example in which word segmentation cannot be handled properly without considering long-range syntactic information.",
        "Syntactic information is also considered beneficial to improve the segmentation of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Unlike languages such as Japanese that use a distinct character set (i.e. katakana) for foreign words, the transliterated words in Chinese, many of which are OOV words, frequently include characters that are also used as common or function words.",
        "In the current systems, the existence of these characters causes numerous over-segmentation errors for OOV words.",
        "Based on these observations, we aim at building a joint model that simultaneously processes word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing, trying to capture global interaction among",
        "these three tasks.",
        "To handle the increased computational complexity, we adopt the incremental parsing framework with dynamic programming (Huang and Sagae, 2010), and propose an efficient method of character-based decoding over candidate structures.",
        "Two major challenges exist in formalizing the joint segmentation and dependency parsing task in the character-based incremental framework.",
        "First, we must address the problem of how to align comparable states effectively in the beam.",
        "Because the number of dependency arcs varies depending on how words are segmented, we devise a step alignment scheme using the number of character-based arcs, which enables effective joint decoding for the three tasks.",
        "Second, although the feature set is fundamentally a combination of those used in previous works (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Huang and Sagae, 2010), to integrate them in a single incremental framework is not straightforward.",
        "Because we must perform decisions of three kinds (segmentation, tagging, and parsing) in an incremental framework, we must adjust which features are to be activated when, and how they are combined with which action labels.",
        "We have also found that we must balance the learning rate between features for segmentation and tagging decisions, and those for dependency parsing.",
        "We perform experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB) corpora, demonstrating that the accuracies of the three tasks can be improved significantly over the pipeline combination of the state-of-the-art joint segmentation and POS tagging model, and the dependency parser.",
        "We also perform comparison experiments with partially joint models, and investigate the tradeoff between the running speed and the model performance."

        "In Chinese, Luo (2003) proposed a joint constituency parser that performs segmentation, POS tagging, and parsing within a single character-based framework.",
        "They reported that the POS tags contribute to segmentation accuracies by more than 1%, but the syntactic information has no substantial effect on the segmentation accuracies.",
        "In contrast, we built a joint model based on a dependency-based framework, with a rich set of structural features.",
        "Using it, we show the first positive result in Chinese that the segmentation accuracies can be improved using the syntactic information.",
        "Another line of work exists on lattice-based parsing for Semitic languages (Cohen and Smith, 2007; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008).",
        "These methods first convert an input sentence into a lattice encoding the morphological ambiguities, and then conduct joint morphological segmentation and PCFG parsing.",
        "However, the segmentation possibilities considered in those studies are limited to those output by an existing morphological analyzer.",
        "In addition, the lattice does not include word segmentation ambiguities crossing boundaries of space-delimited tokens.",
        "In contrast, because the Chinese language does not have spaces between words, we fundamentally need to consider the lattice structure of the whole sentence.",
        "Therefore, we place no restriction on the segmentation possibilities to consider, and we assess the full potential of the joint segmentation and dependency parsing model.",
        "Among the many recent works on joint segmentation and POS tagging for Chinese, the linear-time incremental models by Zhang and Clark (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2010) largely inspired our model.",
        "Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed an incremental joint segmentation and POS tagging model, with an effective feature set for Chinese.",
        "However, it requires to computationally expensive multiple beams to compare words of different lengths using beam search.",
        "More recently, Zhang and Clark (2010) proposed an efficient character-based decoder for their word-based model.",
        "In their new model, a single beam suffices for decoding; hence, they reported that their model is practically ten times as fast as their original model.",
        "To incorporate the word-level features into the character-based decoder, the features are decomposed into substring-level features, which are effective for incomplete words to have comparable scores to complete words in the beam.",
        "Because we found that even an incremental approach with beam search is intractable if we perform the word-based decoding, we take a character-based approach to produce our joint model.",
        "The incremental framework of our model is based on the joint POS tagging and dependency parsing model for Chinese (Hatori et al., 2011), which is an extension of the shift-reduce dependency parser with dynamic programming (Huang and Sagae, 2010).",
        "They specifically modified the shift action so that it assigns the POS tag when a word is shifted onto the stack.",
        "However, because they regarded word segmentation as given, their model did not consider the interaction between segmentation and POS tagging."

        "Because 33 tags are defined in the CTB tag set (Xia, 2000), our model exploits a total of 36 actions.",
        "To train the model, we use the averaged percep-tron with the early update (Collins and Roark, 2004).",

        "Consequently, for the beam search to function effectively, all states with the same index must be comparable, and all terminal states should have the same step index.",
        "We can first think of using the number of shifted characters as the step index, as Zhang and Clark (2010) does.",
        "However, because RL/RR actions can be performed without incrementing the step index, the decoder tends to prefer states with more dependency arcs, resulting more likely in premature choice of ?reduce?",
        "actions or oversegmentation of words.",
        "Alternatively, we can consider using the number of actions that have been applied as the step index, as Hatori et al. (2011) does.",
        "However, this results in inconsistent numbers of actions to reach the terminal states: some states that segment words into larger chunks reach a terminal state earlier than other states with smaller chunks.",
        "For these reasons, we have found that both approaches yield poor models that are not at all competitive with the baseline (pipeline) models1.",
        "To address this issue, we propose an indexing scheme using the number of character-based arcs.",
        "We presume that in addition to the word-to-word dependency arcs, each word (of length M ) implicitly has M ?",
        "1 inter-character arcs, as in: AxBxC , AxB x C , and A x B x C (each rectangle denotes a word).",
        "Then we can define the step index as the sum of the number of shifted characters and the total number of (inter-word and intra-word) dependency arcs, which thereby meets all the following conditions:",

        "Figure 1 portrays how the states are aligned using the proposed scheme, where a subtree is denoted as a rectangle with its partial index shown inside it.",
        "In our framework, because an action increases the step index by 1 (for SH(t) or RL/RR) or 2 (for A), we need to use two beams to store new states at each step.",
