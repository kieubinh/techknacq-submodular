        "Unsupervised grammar induction is a fundamental challenge of statistical natural language processing (Lari and Young, 1990; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Carroll and Charniak, 1992).",
        "The constituent context model (CCM) for inducing constituency parses (Klein and Manning, 2002) was the first unsupervised approach to surpass a right-branching baseline.",
        "However, the CCM only effectively models short sentences.",
        "This paper shows that a simple re-parameterization of the model, which ties together the probabilities of related events, allows the CCM to extend robustly to long sentences.",
        "Much recent research has explored dependency grammar induction.",
        "For instance, the dependency model with valence (DMV) of Klein and Manning (2004) has been extended to utilize multilingual information (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010; Cohen et al., 2011), lexical information (Headden III et al., 2009), and linguistic universals (Naseem et al., 2010).",
        "Nevertheless, simplistic dependency models like the DMV do not contain information present in a constituency parse, such as the attachment order of object and subject to a verb.",
        "Unsupervised constituency parsing is also an active research area.",
        "Several studies (Seginer, 2007; Reichart and Rappoport, 2010; Ponvert et al., 2011) have considered the problem of inducing parses over raw lexical items rather than part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "Additional advances have come from more complex models, such as combining CCM and DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004) and model-ing large tree fragments (Bod, 2006).",
        "The CCM scores each parse as a product of probabilities of span and context subsequences.",
        "It was originally evaluated only on unpunctuated sentences up to length 10 (Klein and Manning, 2002), which account for only 15% of the WSJ corpus; our experiments confirm the observation in (Klein, 2005) that performance degrades dramatically on longer sentences.",
        "This problem is unsurprising: CCM scores each constituent type by a single, isolated multinomial parameter.",
        "Our work leverages the idea that sharing information between local probabilities in a structured unsupervised model can lead to substantial accuracy gains, previously demonstrated for dependency grammar induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "Our model, Log-Linear CCM (LLCCM), shares information between the probabilities of related constituents by expressing them as a log-linear combination of features trained using the gradient-based learning procedure of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010).",
        "In this way, the probability of generating a constituent is informed by related constituents.",
        "Our model improves unsupervised constituency parsing of sentences longer than 10 words.",
        "On sentences of up to length 40 (96% of all sentences in the Penn Treebank), LLCCM outperforms CCM by 13.9% (unlabeled) bracketing F1 and, unlike CCM, outperforms a right-branching baseline on sentences longer than 15 words."

        "Conditioned on the constituency or distituency of each span in the parse, CCM generates both the complete sequence of terminals it contains and the terminals in the surrounding context.",
        "Formally, the CCM is a probabilistic model that jointly generates a sentence, s, and a bracketing, B, specifying whether each contiguous subsequence is a constituent or not, in which case the span is called a distituent.",
        "Each subsequence of POS tags, or SPAN, ?, occurs in a CONTEXT, ?, which is an ordered pair of preceding and following tags.",

        "1As mentioned in (Klein and Manning, 2002), the CCM model is deficient because it assigns probability mass to yields and spans that cannot consistently combine to form a valid sentence.",
        "Our model does not address this issue, and hence it is similarly deficient.",
        "The Log-Linear CCM (LLCCM) reparameterizes the distributions in the CCM using intuitive features to address the limitations of CCM while retaining its predictive power.",
        "The set of proposed features includes a BASIC feature for each parameter of the original CCM, enabling the LLCCM to retain the full expressive power of the CCM.",
        "In addition, LLCCM contains a set of coarse features that activate across distinct spans.",
