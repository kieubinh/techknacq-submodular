        "Chiang's hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation model utilizes synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) for translation derivation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) and has been widely adopted in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Typically, such models define two types of translation rules: hierarchical (translation) rules which consist of both terminals and non-terminals, and glue (grammar) rules which combine translated phrases in a monotone fashion.",
        "Due to lack of linguistic knowledge, Chiang's HPB model contains only one type of non-terminal symbol X , often making it difficult to select the most appropriate translation rules.1 What is more, Chiang's HPB model suffers from limited phrase reordering combining translated phrases in a monotonic way with glue rules.",
        "In addition, once a 1Another non-terminal symbol S is used in glue rules.",
        "glue rule is adopted, it requires all rules above it to be glue rules.",
        "One important research question is therefore how to refine the non-terminal category X using linguistically motivated information: Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) (SAMT) e.g. use (partial) syntactic categories derived from CFG trees while Zollmann and Vogel (2011) use word tags, generated by either POS analysis or unsupervised word class induction.",
        "Almaghout et al. (2011) employ CCGbased supertags.",
        "Mylonakis and Sima?an (2011) use linguistic information of various granularities such as Phrase-Pair, Constituent, Concatenation of Constituents, and Partial Constituents, where applicable.",
        "Inspired by previous work in parsing (Char-niak, 2000; Collins, 2003), our Head-Driven HPB (HD-HPB) model is based on the intuition that linguistic heads provide important information about a constituent or distributionally defined fragment, as in HPB.",
        "We identify heads using linguistically motivated dependency parsing, and use their POS to refine X.",
        "In addition HD-HPB provides flexible reordering rules freely mixing translation and reordering (including swap) at any stage in a derivation.",
        "Different from the soft constraint modeling adopted in (Chan et al., 2007; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Shen et al., 2009; He et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2011), our approach encodes syntactic information in translation rules.",
        "However, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive, as we could also include a set of syntax-driven features into our translation model.",

        "Like Chiang (2005) and Chiang (2007), our HD-HPB translation model adopts a synchronous context free grammar, a rewriting system which generates source and target side string pairs simultaneously using a context-free grammar.",
        "Instead of collapsing all non-terminals in the source language into a single symbol X as in Chiang (2007), given a word sequence f ij from position i to position j, we first find heads and then concatenate the POS tags of these heads as f ij's non-terminal symbol.",
        "Specifically, we adopt unlabeled dependency structure to derive heads, which are defined as: Definition 1.",
        "For word sequence f ij , word fk (i ?",
        "k ?",
        "j) is regarded as a head if it is dominated by a word outside of this sequence.",
        "Note that this definition (i) allows for a word sequence to have one or more heads (largely due to the fact that a word sequence is not necessarily linguistically constrained) and (ii) ensures that heads are always the highest heads in the sequence from a dependency structure perspective.",
        "For example, the word sequence ouzhou baguo lianming in Figure 1 has two heads (i.e., baguo and lianming, ouzhou is not a head of this sequence since its headword baguo falls within this sequence) and the non-terminal corresponding to the sequence is thus labeled as NN-AD.",
        "It is worth noting that in this paper we only refine non-terminal X on the source side to head-informed ones, while still usingX on the target side.",
        "According to the occurrence of terminals in translation rules, we group rules in the HD-HPB model into two categories: head-driven hierarchical rules (HD-HRs) and non-terminal reordering rules (NRRs), where the former have at least one terminal on both source and target sides and the later have no terminals.",
        "For rule extraction, we first identify initial phrase pairs on word-aligned sentence pairs by using the same criterion as most phrase-based translation models (Och and Ney, 2004) and Chiang's HPB model (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).",
        "We extract HD-HRs and NRRs based on initial phrase pairs, respectively."

        "This is the same as the hierarchical rules defined in Chiang's HPB model (Chiang, 2007), except that we use head POS-informed non-terminal symbols in the source language.",
        "We look for initial phrase pairs that contain other phrases and then replace sub-phrases with POS tags corresponding to their heads.",
        "Given the word alignment in Figure 1, Table 1 demonstrates the difference between hierarchical rules in Chiang (2007) and HD-HRs defined here.",
        "Similar to Chiang's HPB model, our HD-HPB model will result in a large number of rules causing problems in decoding.",
        "To alleviate these problems, we filter our HD-HRs according to the same constraints as described in Chiang (2007).",
