        "Relation extraction aims to identify semantic relations of entities in a document.",
        "Although many supervised machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to relation extraction tasks (Ze-lenko et al., 2003; Kambhatla, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006), applications of these approaches are still limited because they require a sufficient number of training examples to obtain good extraction results.",
        "Several datasets that provide manual annotations of semantic relationships are available from MUC (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) and ACE (Doddington et al., 2004) projects, but these datasets contain labeled training examples in only a few major languages, including English, Chinese, and Arabic.",
        "Although these datasets encourage the development of relation extractors for these major languages, there are few labeled training samples for learning new systems in other languages, such as Korean.",
        "Because manual annotation of semantic relations for such resource-poor languages is very expensive, we instead consider weakly supervised learning techniques (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006) to learn the relation extractors without significant annotation efforts.",
        "But these techniques still face cost problems when preparing quality seed examples, which plays a crucial role in obtaining good extractions.",
        "Recently, some researchers attempted to use external resources, such as treebank (Banko et al., 2007) and Wikipedia (Wu and Weld, 2010), that were not specially constructed for relation extraction instead of using task-specific training or seed examples.",
        "We previously proposed to leverage parallel corpora as a new kind of external resource for relation extraction (Kim et al., 2010).",
        "To obtain training examples in the resource-poor target language, this approach exploited a cross-lingual annotation projection by propagating annotations that were generated by a relation extraction system in a resource-rich source language.",
        "In this approach, projected annotations were determined in a single pass process by considering only alignments between entity candidates; we call this action direct projection.",
        "In this paper, we propose a graph-based projection approach for weakly supervised relation extraction.",
        "This approach utilizes a graph that is con-stucted with both instance and context information and that is operated in an iterative manner.",
        "The goal of our graph-based approach is to improve the robustness of the extractor with respect to errors that are generated and accumulated by preprocessors.",

        "These studies adopted a simple direct projection strategy that propagates the annotations in the source language sentences to word-aligned target sentences, and a target system can bootstrap from these projected annotations.",

        "Although some noise reduction strategies for projecting semantic relations were proposed (Kim et al., 2010), the direct projection approach is still vulnerable to erroneous inputs generated by submodules.",
        "We note two main causes for this limitation: (1) the direct projection approach considers only alignments between entity candidates, and it does not consider any contextual information; and, (2) it is performed by a single pass process.",
