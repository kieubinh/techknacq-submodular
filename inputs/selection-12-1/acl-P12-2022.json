        "We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for estimating tree insertion grammars (TIG), building upon recent work in Bayesian inference of tree substitution grammars (TSG) via Dirichlet processes.",
        "Under our general variant of TIG, grammars are estimated via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses a context free grammar transformation as a proposal, which allows for cubic-time string parsing as well as tree-wide joint sampling of derivations in the spirit of Cohn and Blun-som (2010).",
        "We use the Penn treebank for our experiments and find that our proposal Bayesian TIG model not only has competitive parsing performance but also finds compact yet linguistically rich TIG representations of the data."

        "There is a deep tension in statistical modeling of grammatical structure between providing good ex-pressivity ?",
        "to allow accurate modeling of the data with sparse grammars ?",
        "and low complexity ?",
        "making induction of the grammars and parsing of novel sentences computationally practical.",
        "Recent work that incorporated Dirichlet process (DP) nonparametric models into TSGs has provided an efficient solution to the problem of segmenting training data trees into elementary parse tree fragments to form the grammar (Cohn et al., 2009; Cohn and Blunsom, 2010; Post and Gildea, 2009).",
        "DP inference tackles this problem by exploring the space of all possible segmentations of the data, in search for fragments that are on the one hand large enough so that they incorporate the useful dependencies, and on the other small enough so that they recur and have a chance to be useful in analyzing unseen data.",
        "The elementary trees combined in a TSG are, intuitively, primitives of the language, yet certain linguistic phenomena (notably various forms of modification) ?split them up?, preventing their reuse, leading to less sparse grammars than might be ideal.",
        "For instance, imagine modeling the following set of structures: ?",
        "[NP the [NN [NN [NN president] of the university] who resigned yesterday]] ?",
        "[NP the [NN former [NN [NN president] of the university]]] ?",
        "[NP the [NN [NN president] who resigned yesterday]] A natural recurring structure here would be the structure ?",
        "[NP the [NN president]]?, yet it occurs not at all in the data.",
        "TSGs are a special case of the more flexible grammar formalism of tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975).",
        "TAG augments TSG with an adjunction operator and a set of auxiliary trees in addition to the substitution operator and initial trees of TSG, allowing for ?splicing in?",
        "of syntactic fragments within trees.",
        "In the example, by augmenting a TSG with an operation of adjunction, a grammar that hypothesizes auxiliary trees corresponding to adjoining ?",
        "[NN former NN ]?, ?",
        "[NN NN of the university]?, and ?",
        "[NN NN who resigned yesterday]?",
        "would be able to reuse the basic structure ?",
        "[NP the [NN president]]?.",
        "Unfortunately, TAG's expressivity comes at the cost of greatly increased complexity.",
        "Parsing complexity for unconstrained TAG scales as O(n6), im",
        "One left insertion (at NN) and two simultaneous right insertions (at NP).",
        "practical as compared to CFG and TSG's O(n3).",
        "In addition, the model selection problem for TAG is significantly more complicated than for TSG since one must reason about many more combinatorial options with two types of derivation operators.1 This has led researchers to resort to heuristic grammar extraction techniques (Chiang, 2000; Carreras et al., 2008) or using a very small number of grammar categories (Hwa, 1998).",
        "Hwa (1998) first proposed to use tree-insertion grammars (TIG), a kind of expressive compromise between TSG and TAG, as a substrate on which to build grammatical inference.",
        "TIG constrains the adjunction operation so that spliced-in material falls completely to the left or completely to the right of the splice point.",
        "By restricting the form of possible auxiliary trees to only left or right auxiliary trees in this way, TIG remains within the realm of context-free formalisms (with cubic complexity) while still modeling rich linguistic phenomena (Schabes and Waters, 1995).",
        "Figure 1 depicts some examples of TIG derivations.",

        "along the spine of an auxiliary tree are identical.",
        "In this paper we explore a Bayesian nonparametric model for estimating a far more expressive version of TIG, and compare its performance against TSG and the restricted TIG0 variant.",
        "Our more general formulation avoids these limitations by supporting the following features and thus relaxing four of",
        "the five restrictions of TIG0.",

        "The increased expressivity of our TIG variant is motivated both linguistically and practically.",
        "From a linguistic point of view: Deeper auxiliary trees can help model large patterns of insertion and potential correlations between lexical items that extend over multiple levels of tree.",
        "Combining left and right auxiliary trees can help model modifiers of the same node from left and right (combination of adjectives 2Throughout the paper, we will refer to the depth of an auxiliary tree to indicate the length of its spine.",
        "and relative clauses for instance).",
        "Simultaneous insertion allows us to deal with multiple independent modifiers for the same constituent (for example, a series of adjectives).",
        "From a practical point of view, we show that an induced TIG provides modeling performance superior to TSG and comparable with TIG0.",
