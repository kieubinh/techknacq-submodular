        "Unsupervised semantic role induction has gained significant interest recently (Lang and Lapata, 2011b) due to limited amounts of annotated corpora.",
        "A Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system should provide consistent argument labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb (Palmer et al., 2005), as in (a.)",
        "[ Mark ]A0 drove [ the car ]A1 (b.)",
        "[ The car ]A1 was driven by [ Mark ]A0 This simple example also shows that while certain local syntactic and semantic features could provide clues to the semantic role label of a constituent, non-local features such as predicate voice could provide information about the expected semantic role sequence.",
        "Sentence a is in active voice with sequence (A0, PREDICATE, A1) and sentence b is in passive voice with sequence (A1, PREDICATE, A0).",
        "Additional global preferences, such as arguments A0 and A1 rarely repeat in a frame (as seen in the corpus), could also be useful in addition to local features.",
        "Supervised SRL systems have mostly used local classifiers that assign a role to each constituent independently of others, and only modeled limited correlations among roles in a sequence (Toutanova et al., 2008).",
        "The correlations have been modeled via role sets (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), role repetition constraints (Punyakanok et al., 2004), language model over roles (Thompson et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2005), and global role sequence (Toutanova et al., 2008).",
        "Unsupervised SRL systems have explored even fewer correlations.",

        "the predicate.",
        "Grenager and Manning (2006) use an ordering of the linking of semantic roles and syntactic relations.",
        "However, as the space of possible linkings is large, language-specific knowledge is used to constrain this space.",
        "Similar to Toutanova et al. (2008), we propose to use global role ordering preferences but in a generative model in contrast to their discriminative one.",
        "Further, unlike Grenager and Manning (2006), we do not explicitly generate the linking of semantic roles and syntactic relations, thus keeping the parameter space tractable.",
        "The main contribution of this work is an unsupervised model that uses global role ordering and repetition preferences without assuming any language-specific constraints.",
        "Following Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), previous work has typically broken the SRL task into (i) argument identification, and (ii) argument classification (Ma`rquez et al., 2008).",

        "We assume the roles to be predicate-specific.",
        "We begin by introducing a few terms: Primary Role (PR) For every predicate, we assume the existence of K primary roles (PRs) denoted by P1, P2, ..., PK .",
        "These roles are not allowed to repeat in a frame and serve as ?anchor points?",
        "in the global role ordering.",
        "Intuitively, the model attempts to choose PRs such that they occur with high frequency, do not repeat, and their ordering influences the positioning of other roles.",
        "Note that a PR may correspond to either a core role or a modifier role.",
        "For ease of explication, we create 3 additional PRs: START denoting the start of the role sequence, END denoting its end, and PRED denoting the predicate.",
        "Secondary Role (SR) The roles that are not PRs are called secondary roles (SRs).",
        "Given N roles in total, there are (N ?K) SRs, denoted by S1, S2, ..., SN?K .",
        "Unlike PRs, SRs are not constrained to occur only once in a frame and do not participate in the global role ordering.",
        "Interval An interval is a sequence of SRs bounded by PRs, for instance (P2, S3, S5, PRED).",
        "Ordering An ordering is the sequence of PRs observed in a frame.",
        "For example, if the complete role",
        "sequence is (START ,P2, S1, S1, PRED, S3, END), the ordering is defined as (START , P2, PRED, END).",
        "Features We have explored 1 frame level (global) feature (i) voice: active/passive, and 3 argument level (local) features (i) deprel: dependency relation of an argument to its head in the dependency parse tree, (ii) head: head word of the argument, and (iii) pos-head: Part-of-Speech tag of head.",
        "Algorithm 1 describes the generative story of our model and Figure 1 illustrates it graphically.",
        "Given a predicate and its voice, an ordering is selected from a multinomial.",
        "This ordering gives us the sequence of PRs (PR1, PR2, ..., PRN ).",
        "Each pair of consecutive PRs, PRi, PRi+1, in an ordering corresponds to an interval Ii.",
        "For each such interval, we generate 0 or more SRs (SRi1, SRi2, ...SRiM ) as follows.",
        "Generate an indicator variable: CONTINUE/STOP from a binomial distribution.",
        "If CONTINUE, generate a SR from the multinomial corresponding to the interval.",
        "Generate another indicator variable and continue the process till a STOP has been generated.",
        "In addition to the interval, the indicator variable also depends on whether we are generating the first SR (adj = 0) or a subsequent one (adj = 1).",
        "For each role, primary as well as secondary, we now generate the corresponding constituent by generating each of its features independently (F1, F2, ..., FT ).",
        "Given a frame instance with predicate p and voice vc, Figure 2 gives (i) Eq.",
        "1: the joint distribution of the ordering o, role sequence r, and constituent sequence f , and (ii) Eq.",
        "2: the marginal distribution of an instance.",

        "denote the SR sequence and feature sequence in interval I .",
        "fi,t denotes the value of feature t at position i.",
        "This particular choice of model is inspired from different sources.",
        "Firstly, making the role ordering dependent only on PRs aligns with the observation by Pradhan et al. (2005) and Toutanova et al.",
        "(2008) that including the ordering information of only core roles helped improve the SRL performance as opposed to the complete role sequence.",
        "Although our assumption here is softer in that we assume the existence of some roles which define the ordering which may or may not correspond to core roles.",
        "Secondly, generating the SRs independently of each other given the interval is based on the intuition that knowing the core roles informs us about the expected non-core roles that occur between them.",
        "This intuition is supported by the statistics in the annotated data, where we found that if we consider the core roles as PRs, then most of the intervals tend to have only a few types of SRs and a given SR tends to occur only in a few types of intervals.",
        "The concept of intervals is also related to the linguistic theory of topological fields (Diderich-sen, 1966; Drach, 1937).",
        "This simplifying assumption that given the PRs at the interval boundary, the SRs in that interval are independent of the other roles in the sequence, keeps the parameter space limited, which helps unsupervised learning.",
        "Thirdly, not allowing some or all roles to repeat has been employed as a useful constraint in previous work (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Lang and Lapata, 2011b), which we use here for PRs.",
        "Lastly, conditioning the (STOP/CONTINUE) indicator variable on the adjacency value (adj) is inspired from the DMV model (Klein and Manning, 2004) for unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "We found in the annotated corpus that if we map core roles to PRs, then most of the time the intervals do not generate any SRs at all.",
        "So, the probability to STOP should be very high when generating the first SR. We use an EM procedure to train the model.",
        "In the E-step, we calculate the expected counts of all the hidden variables in our model using the Inside-Outside algorithm (Baker, 1979).",
        "In the M-step, we add the counts corresponding to the Bayesian priors to the expected counts and use the resulting counts to calculate the MAP estimate of the parameters."

        "The evaluation measures are also the same: (i) Purity (PU) that measures how well an induced cluster corresponds to a single gold role, (ii) Collocation (CO) that measures how well a gold role corresponds to a single induced cluster, and (iii) F1 which is the harmonic mean of PU and CO.",

        "Increasing the number of PRs beyond 1 leads to a gradual increase in purity and decline in collocation, with the best F1 score at 2 PRs.",
        "This behavior could be explained by the fact that increasing the number of PRs also increases the number of intervals, which makes the probability distributions more sparse.",
        "In the extreme case, where all the roles are PRs and there are no SRs, the model would just learn the complete sequence of roles, which would make the parameter space too large to be tractable.",
