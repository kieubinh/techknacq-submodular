      "heading": "3.1 Training Data In our experiments, we extracted Wikipedia hypertext to page title pairs as in Figure 1. We performed all work on an Arabic Wikipedia dump from April 2010, which contained roughly 150,000 articles. In all, we extracted 11.47 million hypertext-title pairs. From them, we attempted to find word pairs that were morphologically related. From the example in Figure 1, given the hypertext ???????????? (bAlbrtgAlyp ? in Portuguese) and the page title that it points to ??? ????????? (lgp brtgAlyp ? Portuguese language) we needed to extract the pairs ???????????? (bAlbrtgAlyp) and ????????? (brtgAlyp). We assumed that a word in the hypertext and another in Wikipedia title were morphologically related using the following criteria: ? The words share the first 2 letters or the last 2 letters. This was intended to increase precision. ? The edit distance between the two words must be <= 3. The choice of 3 was motivated by the fact that Arabic prefixes and suffixes are typically 1, 2, or 3 letters long. ? The edit distance was less than 50% of the length of the shorter of the two words. This was important to insure that short words that share common letters but are in fact different are filtered out.",

        "To apply a machine translation analogy, we treated words as sentences and the letters from which were constructed as tokens.",
        "The alignment produced letter sequence mappings.",
        "Source character sequence lengths were restricted to 3 letters.",
        "Generating related stems/words: We treated the problem of generating morphologically related stems (or words) like a transliteration mining problem akin to that in Udupa et al. (2009).",
        "Briefly, the miner used character segment mappings to generate all possible transformations while constraining generation to the existing tokens (either stems or words) in a list of unique tokens in the retrieval test collection.",
        "Basically, given a query token, all possible segmentations, where each segment has a maximum length of 3 characters, were produced along with their associated mappings.",
        "Given all mapping combinations, combinations producing valid target tokens were retained and sorted according to the product of their mapping probabilities.",

      "heading": "4.1 Experimental Setup We used extrinsic IR evaluation to determine the quality of the related stems that were generated. We performed experiments on the TREC 2001/2002 cross language track collection, which contains 383,872 Arabic newswire articles and 75 topics with their relevance judgments (Oard and Gey, 2002). This is presently the best available large Arabic information retrieval test collection. We used Mean Average Precision (MAP) as the measure of goodness for this retrieval task. Going down from the top a retrieved ranked list, Average Precision (AP) is the average of precision values computed at every relevant document found. MAP is just the mean of the AP's for all queries. All experiments were performed using the Indri retrieval toolkit, which uses a retrieval model that combines inference networks and language modeling and implements advanced query operators (Metzler and Croft, 2004). We used a paired 2-tailed t-test with p-value less than 0.05 to determine if a set of retrieval results was better than another. We replaced each query tokens with all the related stems that were generated using a weighted synonym operator (Wang and Oard, 2006), where the weights correspond to the product of the mapping probabilities for each related word. With the weighted synonym operator, we did not need to threshold the generated related stems as ones with low probabilities were demoted. Probabilities were normalized by the score of the original query word. For example, given the stem ????? (SnAE) it was replaced with: #wsyn(1.000 SnAE 0.029 SnAEy 0.013 SnE 0.006 SnAEA 0.003 mSnwE).
