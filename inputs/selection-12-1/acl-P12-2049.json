        "Learner corpora have been playing an increasingly important role in both Second Language Acquisition and Foreign Language Teaching research (Granger, 2004; Nesi et al., 2004).",
        "These corpora contain texts written by non-native speakers of the language (Granger et al., 2009); many also annotate text segments where there are errors, and the corresponding error categories (Nagata et al., 2011).",
        "In addition, some learner corpora contain pairs of sentences: a sentence written by a learner of English as a second language (ESL), paired with its correct version produced by a native speaker (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011).",
        "These datasets are intended to support the training of automatic text correction systems (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011).",
        "Less attention has been paid to how a language learner produces a text.",

        "These drafts include lab reports, data analysis, argumentative essays, and article summaries.",
        "There are 3760 distinct essays, most of which consist of two to four successive drafts.",
        "Each draft has on average 44.2 sentences, and the average length of a sentence is 13.3 words.",
        "In total, the corpus contains 7.9 million words.",
        "Understanding the dynamics of this process would benefit not only language teachers, but also the design of writing assistance tools that provide automatic feedback (Burstein and Chodorow, 2004).",

        "Regarding content, it has been observed that teachers spend a disproportionate amount of time on identifying word-level errors, at the expense of those at higher levels, such as coherence (Furneaux et al., 2007; Zamel, 1985).",

        "has hardly been investigated.",
        "One reason for this gap in the literature is the lack of corpus data: none of the existing learner corpora (Izumi et al., 2004; Granger et al., 2009; Nagata et al., 2011; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011) contains drafts written by non-native speakers that led to the ?final version?.",
