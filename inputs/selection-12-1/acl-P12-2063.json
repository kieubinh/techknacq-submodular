        "If unsupervised morphological segmenters could approach the effectiveness of supervised ones, they would be a very attractive choice for improving machine translation (MT) performance in low-resource inflected languages.",
        "An example of particular current interest is Arabic, whose various colloquial dialects are sufficiently different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in lexicon, orthography, and morphology, as to be low-resource languages themselves.",
        "An additional advantage of Arabic for study is the availability of high-quality supervised segmenters for MSA, such as MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005), for performance comparison.",
        "The MT gain for supervised MSA segmenters on dialect establishes a lower bound, which the unsupervised segmenter must exceed if it is to be useful for dialect.",
        "And comparing the gain for supervised and unsupervised segmenters on MSA tells us how useful the unsupervised segmenter is, relative to the ideal case in which a supervised segmenter is available.",
        "In this paper, we show that an unsupervised segmenter can in fact rival or surpass supervised MSA segmenters on MSA itself, while at the same time providing superior performance on dialect.",
        "Specifically, we compare the state-of-the-art morphological analyzer of Lee et al. (2011) with two leading supervised analyzers for MSA, MADA and Sakhr1, each serving as an alternative preprocessor for a state-of-the-art statistical MT system (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "We measure MSA performance on NIST MT-08 (NIST, 2010), and dialect performance on a Levantine dialect web corpus (Zbib et al., 2012b).",
        "To improve performance, we apply maximum marginal decoding (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009) (MM) to combine multiple runs of the Lee segmenter, and show that this dramatically reduces the variance and noise in the segmenter output, while yielding an improved segmentation accuracy that exceeds the best published scores for unsupervised segmentation on Arabic Treebank (Naradowsky and Toutanova, 2011).",
        "We also show that it yields MT08 BLEU scores that are higher than those obtained with MADA, a leading supervised MSA segmenter.",
        "For Levantine, the segmenter increases BLEU score by 18% over the unsegmented baseline."

        "Machine translation systems that process highly inflected languages often incorporate morphological analysis.",
        "Some of these approaches rely on morphological analysis for pre-and post-processing, while others modify the core of a translation system to incorporate morphological information (Habash, 2008; Luong et al., 2010; Nakov and Ng, 2011).",
        "For instance, factored translation Models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) parametrize translation probabilities as factors encoding morphological features.",
        "The approach we have taken in this paper is an instance of a segmented MT model, which divides the input into morphemes and uses the derived morphemes as a unit of translation (Sadat and Habash, 2006; Badr et al., 2008; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011).",
        "This is a mainstream architecture that has been shown to be effective when translating from a morphologically rich language.",
        "A number of recent approaches have explored the use of unsupervised morphological analyzers for MT (Virpioja et al., 2007; Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011; Mermer and Ak?n, 2010; Mermer and Saraclar, 2011).",
        "Virpioja et al. (2007) apply the unsupervised morphological segmenter Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), and apply an existing MT system at the level of morphemes.",
        "The system does not outperform the word baseline partially due to the insufficient accuracy of the automatic morphological analyzer.",
        "The work of Mermer and Ak?n (2010) and Mermer and Saraclar (2011) attempts to integrate morphology and MT more closely than we do, by incorporating bilingual alignment probabilities into a Gibbs-sampled version of Morfessor for Turkish-to-English MT.",
        "However, the bilingual strategy shows no gain over the monolingual version, and neither version is competitive for MT with a supervised Turkish morphological segmenter (Oflazer, 1993).",
        "By contrast, the unsupervised analyzer we report on here yields MSA-to-English MT performance that equals or exceed the performance obtained with a leading supervised MSA segmenter,"

        "to Reduce Variance and Noise Maximum marginal decoding (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009) (MM) is a technique which assigns to each latent variable the value with the highest marginal probability, thereby maximizing the expected number of correct assignments (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "Johnson and Goldwater (2009) extend MM to Gibbs sampling by drawing a set of N independent Gibbs samples, and selecting for each word the most frequent segmentation found in them.",
        "They found that MM improved segmentation accuracy over the mean, consistent with its maximization criterion.",
        "However, for our setting, we find that MM provides several other crucial advantages as well.",
        "First, MM dramatically reduces the output variance of Gibbs sampling (GS).",
        "Table 1 documents the severity of this variance for the MT-08 lexicon, as measured by the average exact-match accuracy and segmentation F-measure between different runs.",
        "It shows that on average, 13% of the word tokens, and 25% of the word types, are segmented differently from run to run, which obviously makes the input to MT highly unstable.",
        "By contrast the ?MM?",
        "column of Table 1 shows that two different runs of MM, each derived by combining separate sets of 25 GS runs, agree on the segmentations of over 95% of the word token ?",
        "a dramatic improvement in stability.",
        "Second, MM reduces noise from the spurious affixes that the unsupervised segmenter induces for large lexicons.",
        "As Table 2 shows, the segmenter",
        "the ATB lexicon, we show statistics for the Lee segmenter with regular Gibbs sampling (GS).",
        "For the MT08 lexicon, we also show the output of the Lee segmenter with maximum marginal decoding (MM).",
        "In addition, we show statistics for Morfessor.",
        "induces 130 prefixes and 261 suffixes for MT-08 (statistics for Morfessor are similar).",
        "This phenomenon is fundamental to Bayesian nonparametric models, which expand indefinitely to fit the data they are given (Wasserman, 2006).",
        "But MM helps to alleviate it, reducing unique prefixes and suffixes for MT-08 by 28% and 21%, respectively.",
        "It also reduces the number of unique prefixes/suffixes which account for 95% of the prefix/suffix tokens (Top-95).",
        "Finally, we find that in our setting, MM increases accuracy not just over the mean, but over even the best-scoring of the runs.",
        "As shown in Table 3, MM increases segmentation F-measure from 86.2% to 88.2%.",
        "This exceeds the best published results on ATB (Naradowsky and Toutanova, 2011).",
        "These results suggest that MM may be worth considering for other GS applications, not only for the accuracy improvements pointed out by Johnson and Goldwater (2009), but also for its potential to provide more stable and less noisy results.",
