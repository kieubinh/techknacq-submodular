        "Recent work in document summarization do not only extract sentences but also compress sentences.",
        "Sentence compression enables summarizers to reduce the redundancy in sentences and generate informative summaries beyond the extractive summarization systems (Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "Conventional approaches to sentence compression exploit various linguistic properties based on lexical information and syntactic dependencies (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010).",
        "In contrast, our approach utilizes another property based on semantic roles (SRs) which improves weaknesses of syntactic dependencies.",
        "Syntactic dependencies are not sufficient to compress some complex sentences with coordination, with passive voice, and with an auxiliary verb.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example with a coordination structure.",

        "However, Harari is not dependent on became and we are hence unable to utilize a dependency relation between Harari and became directly.",
        "SRs allow us to model the relations between a predicate and its arguments in a direct fashion.",
        "SR constraints are also advantageous in that we can compress sentences with semantic information.",
        "In Figure 1, became has three arguments, Harari as A1, businessman as A2, and shortly afterward as AM-TMP.",
        "As shown in this example, shortly afterword can be omitted (shaded boxes).",
        "In general, modifier arguments like AM-TMP or AM-LOC are more likely to be reduced than complement cases like A0-A4.",
        "We can implement such properties by SR constraints.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2010) suggests that SR features contribute to generating more readable sentence in machine translation.",
        "We expect that SR features also help our system to improve readability in sentence compression and summarization.",

        "We divided them into three: 55 documents are used for training (1106 sentences); 10 for development (184 sentences); 17 for testing (339 sentences).",
        "Our investigation was held in training data.",
        "There are 3137 verbal predicates and 7852 unique arguments.",
        "We performed SR labeling by LTH (Johansson and Nugues, 2008), an SR labeler for CoNLL2008 shared task.",
        "Based on the SR labels annotated by LTH, we investigated that, for all predicates in compression, how many their arguments were also in.",
        "Table 1 shows the survival ratio of main arguments in compression.",
        "Labels A0, A1, and A2 are complement case roles and over 85% of them survive with their predicates.",
        "On the other hand, for modifier arguments (AM-X), survival ratios are down to lower than 65%.",
        "Our SR constraints implement the difference of survival ratios by SR labels.",
        "Note that dependency labels SBJ and OBJ generally correspond to SR labels A0 and A1, respectively.",
        "But their total numbers are 777 / 919 (SBJ) and 918 / 1211 (OBJ) and much fewer than A0 and A1 labels.",
        "Thus, SR labels can connect much more arguments to their predicates."
