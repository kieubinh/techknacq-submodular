        "In the last decade, automatic text summarization has been dominated by extractive approaches that rely purely on shallow statistics.",
        "In the latest evaluation campaign of the Text Analysis Conference1 (TAC), the top systems were considered only ?barely acceptable?",
        "by human assessment (Owczarzak and Dang, 2011).",
        "The field is also getting saturated near what appears to be a ceiling in performance.",
        "Systems that claim to be very different from one another have all become statistically indistinguishable in evaluation results.",
        "An experiment (Genest et al., 2009) found a performance ceiling to pure sentence extraction that is very low compared to regular (abstractive) human summaries, but not that much better than the current best automatic systems.",
        "Abstractive summarization has been explored to some extent in recent years: sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2000) (Cohn and Lapata, 2009), sentence fusion (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005) or revision (Tanaka et al., 2009), and a generation-based approach that could be called sentence splitting (Genest and Lapalme, 2011).",
        "They are all",
        "rewriting techniques based on syntactical analysis, offering little improvement over extractive methods in the content selection process.",
        "We believe that a fully abstractive approach with a separate process for the analysis of the text, the content selection, and the generation of the summary has the most potential for generating summaries at a level comparable to human.",
        "For the foreseeable future, we think that such a process for full abstraction is impossible in the general case, since it is almost equivalent to perfect text understanding.",
        "In specific domains, however, an approximation of full abstraction is possible.",
        "This paper shows that full abstraction can be accomplished in the context of guided summarization.",
        "We propose a methodology that relies on Information Extraction and Natural Language Generation, and discuss our early results."

        "Guided summarization categories and aspects define an information need, and using Information Extraction (IE) seems appropriate to address it.",
        "The idea to use an IE system for summarization can be traced back to the FRUMP system (DeJong, 1982), which generates brief summaries about various kinds of stories; (White et al., 2001) also wrote abstractive summaries using the output of an IE system applied to events such as natural disasters.",
        "In both cases, the end result is a generated summary from the information available.",
        "A lot of other work has instead used IE to improve the performance of extraction-based systems, like (Barzilay and Lee, 2004) and (Ji et al., 2010).",
        "What is common to all these approaches is that the IE system is designed for a specific purpose, separate from summarization.",
        "However, to properly address each aspect requires a system designed specifically for that task.",
        "To our knowledge, tailoring IE to the needs of abstractive summarization has not been done before.",
        "Our methodology uses a rule-based, custom-designed IE module, integrated with Content Selection and Generation in order to write short, well-written abstractive summaries.",
        "Before tackling these, we perform some preprocessing on the cluster of documents.",
        "It includes: cleaning up and normalization of the input using regular expressions, sentence segmentation, tokenization and lemmatization using GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), syntactical parsing and dependency parsing (collapsed) using the Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006), and Named Entity Recognition using Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "We have also developed a date resolution engine that focuses on days of the week and relative terms."

        "Our architecture is based on Abstraction Schemes.",
        "An abstraction scheme consists of IE rules, content selection heuristics and one or more generation patterns, all created by hand.",
        "Each abstraction scheme is designed to address a theme or subcategory.",
        "Thus, rules that extract information for the same aspect within the same scheme will share a similar meaning.",
        "An abstraction scheme aims to answer one or more aspects of its category, and more than one scheme can be linked to the same aspect.",
        "Figure 2 shows two of the schemes that we have created.",
        "For the scheme killing, the IE rules would match X as the perpetrator and Y as a victim for all of the following phrases: X killed Y, Y was assassinated by X, and the murder of X by Y.",
        "Other schemes have similar structure and purpose, such as wounding, abducting, damaging and destroying.",
        "To create extraction rules for a scheme, we must find several verbs and nouns sharing a similar meaning and identify the syntactical position of the roles we are interested in.",
        "Three resources have helped us in designing extraction rules: a thesaurus to find semantically related nouns and verbs; VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2006), which provides amongst other things the semantic roles of the syntactical dependents of verbs; and a hand-crafted list of aspect-relevant word stems provided by the team that made CLASSY (Conroy et al., 2010).",
        "Schemes and their extraction rules can also be quite different from this first example, as shown with the scheme event.",
        "This scheme gathers the basic information about the attack event: WHAT category of attack, WHEN and WHERE it occurred.",

        "As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985).",
        "Ours consists of an ordering of the schemes.",
        "For example, an Attack summary begins with the scheme event.",
        "This ordering also determines which scheme to favor in the case of redundancy, e.g. given that a building was both damaged and destroyed, only the fact that is was destroyed will be mentioned."

        "Our system, which is meant as a proof of concept, can generate useful summaries for the Attack category, as can be seen in Figure 3.",
        "The key elements of information are present in each case, stated in a way that is easy to understand.",
        "These short summaries have a high density of information, in terms of how much content from the source documents they cover for a given number of words.",
        "For example, using the most widely used content metric, Pyramid (Nenkova et al., 2007), the two sentences generated for the cluster D1001AA contain 8 Semantic Content Units (SCU) for a weighted total of 30 out of a maximum of 56, for a raw Pyramid score of 0.54.",

        "Note that the summaries that we compare against contain up to 100 words, whereas ours is only 21 words long.",
        "We conclude that our method has the potential for creating summaries with much greater information density than the current state of the art.",
        "In fact, our approach does not only have the potential to increase a summary's coverage, but also its linguistic quality and the reader satisfaction as well, since the most relevant information now appears at the beginning of the summary."

        "We have developed and implemented a fully abstractive summarization methodology in the context of guided summarization.",
