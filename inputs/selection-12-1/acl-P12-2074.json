        "The task of tokenization is hardly counted among the grand challenges of NLP and is conventionally interpreted as breaking up ?natural language text [...] into distinct meaningful units (or tokens)?",
        "(Kaplan, 2005).",
        "Practically speaking, however, tokenization is often combined with other string-level pre-processing?for example normalization of punctuation (of different conventions for dashes, say), disambiguation of quotation marks (into opening vs. closing quotes), or removal of unwanted mark-up?",
        "where the specifics of such preprocessing depend both on properties of the input text as well as on assumptions made in downstream processing.",
        "Applying some string-level normalization prior to the identification of token boundaries can improve (or simplify) tokenization, and a subtask like the disambiguation of quote marks would in fact be hard to perform after tokenization, seeing that it depends on adjacency to whitespace.",
        "In the following, we thus assume a generalized notion of tokenization, comprising all string-level processing up to and including the conversion of a sequence of characters (a string) to a sequence of token objects.1 1Obviously, some of the normalization we include in the tokenization task (in this generalized interpretation) could be left to downstream analysis, where a tagger or parser, for example, could be expected to accept non-disambiguated quote marks (so-called straight or typewriter quotes) and disambiguate as Arguably, even in an overtly ?separating?",
        "language like English, there can be token-level ambiguities that ultimately can only be resolved through parsing (see ?",
        "3 for candidate examples), and indeed Waldron et al. (2006) entertain the idea of downstream processing on a token lattice.",
        "In this article, however, we accept the tokenization conventions and sequential nature of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) as a useful point of reference?",
        "primarily for interoperability of different NLP tools.",
        "Still, we argue, there is remaining work to be done on PTB-compliant tokenization (reviewed in?",

        "Besides improvements in tokenization accuracy and adaptability to diverse use cases, in ?",
