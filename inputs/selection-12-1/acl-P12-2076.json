        "The conversion approach requires pairs of the learner's and the correct sentences.",
        "However, collecting a sufficient number of pairs is expensive.",
        "To avoid this problem, we use additional corpus consisting of pseudo-error sentences automatically generated from correct sentences that mimic the real-errors (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b).",
        "Furthermore, we apply a domain adaptation technique that regards the pseudo-errors and the real-errors as the source and the target domain, respectively, so that the pseudo-errors better match the real-errors."
