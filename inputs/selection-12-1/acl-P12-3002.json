        "retrieve texts whose own metaphors are consonant with those of the searcher, and which elaborate upon the same talking points.",
        "This requires a computer to understand the user's metaphor, to appreciate how other metaphors might convey the same affective viewpoint, and to understand the different guises these metaphors might assume in a text.",
        "IR extends the reach of its retrieval efforts by expanding the query it is given, in an attempt to make explicit what the user has left implicit.",
        "Meta-phors, like underspecified queries, have rich meanings that are, for the most part, implicit: they imply and suggest much more than they specify.",
        "An expansionist approach to metaphor meaning, in which an affective metaphor is interpreted by generating the space of related metaphors and talking points that it implies, is thus very much suited to a more creative vision of IR, as e.g. suggested by Veale (2011).",
        "To expand a metaphorical query (like ?company-X is a cult?",
        "or ?company-Y is a dinosaur?",
        "or ?Z was a tyrant?",
        "), a system must first expand the metaphor itself, into a set of plausible construals of the metaphor (e.g. a company that is viewed as a dinosaur will likely be powerful, but also bloated, lumbering and slow).",
        "The system described in this paper, Metaphor Magnet, demonstrates this expansionist approach to metaphorical inference.",
        "Users express queries in the form of affective metaphors or similes, perhaps using explicit + or ?",
        "tags to denote a positive or negative spin on a given concept.",
        "For instance, ?Google is as ?powerful as Microsoft?",
        "does not look for documents that literally contain this simi-le, but documents that express viewpoints that are implied by this simile, that is, documents that discuss the negative implications of Google's power, where these implications are first understood in relation to Microsoft.",
        "The system does this by first considering the metaphors that are conventionally used to describe Microsoft, focusing only on those metaphors that evoke the property powerful, and which cast a negative light on Microsoft.",
        "The implications of these metaphors (e.g., dinosaur, bully, monopoly, etc.)",
        "are then examined in the context of Google, using the metaphors that are typically used to describe Google as a guide to what is most apt.",
        "Thus, since Google is often described as a giant in web texts, the negative properties and behaviors of a stereotypical giant ?",
        "like lumbering and sprawling ?",
        "will be considered apt and highlighted.",
        "To perform this kind of analysis reliably, for a wide range of metaphors and an even wider range of topics, requires a robustly shallow approach.",
        "We exploit the fact that the Google n-grams (Brants and Franz, 2006) contains a great many copula metaphors of the form ?X is a Y?",
        "to understand how X is typically viewed on the web.",
        "We further exploit a large dictionary of affective stereotypes to provide an understanding of the +/- properties and behaviors of each source concept Y.",
        "Combining these resources allows the Metaphor Magnet system to understand the implications of a metaphorical query ?X as Z?",
        "in terms of the qualities that are typically considered salient for Z and which have been corpus-attested as apt for X.",
        "We describe the construction of our lexicon of affective stereotypes in section 2.",
        "Each stereotype is associated with a set of typical properties and behaviors (like sprawling for giant, or inspiring for guru), where the overall affect of each stereotype depends on which subset of qualities is activated in a given context (e.g., giant can be construed positively or negatively, as can baby, soldier, etc.).",
        "We describe how Metaphor Magnet exploits these stereotypes in section 3, before providing a worked example in section 4 and screenshots in section 5.",
        "2 An Affective Lexicon of Stereotypes We construct the lexicon in two stages.",
        "In the first stage, a large collection of stereotypical descriptions is harvested from the Web.",
        "As in Liu et al. (2003), our goal is to acquire a lightweight com-mon-sense representation of many everyday con-cepts.",
        "In the second stage, we link these common-sense qualities in a support graph that captures how they mutually support each other in their co-description of a stereotypical idea.",
        "From this graph we can estimate positive and negative valence scores for each property and behavior, and default averages for the stereotypes that exhibit them.",
        "Similes and stereotypes share a symbiotic rela-tionship: the former exploit the latter as reference points for an evocative description, while the latter are perpetuated by their constant reuse in similes.",
        "Expanding on the approach in Veale (2011), we use two kinds of query for harvesting stereotypes from the web.",
        "The first, ?as ADJ as a NOUN?, acquires typical adjectival properties for noun con-cepts; the second, ?VERB+ing like a NOUN?",
        "and ?VERB+ed like a NOUN?, acquires typical verb behaviors.",
        "Rather than use a wildcard * in both",
        "positions (ADJ and NOUN, or VERB and NOUN), which yields limited results with a search engine like Google, we generate fully instantiated similes from hypotheses generated via the Google n-grams.",
        "Thus, from the 3-gram ?a drooling zombie?",
        "we generate the query ?drooling like a zombie?, and from the 3-gram ?a mindless zombie?",
        "we generate ?as mindless as a zombie?.",
        "Only those similes whose queries retrieve one or more web documents via Google are considered to contain promising associations.",
        "But this still gives us over 250,000 web-validated simile associations for our stereotypical model.",
        "We quickly filter these candidates manually, to ensure that the contents of the lexicon are of the highest quality.",
        "As a result, we obtain rich descriptions for many stereotypical ideas, such as Baby, which is described via 163 typical properties and behaviors like crying, drooling and guileless.",
        "After this filtering phase, the stereotype lexicon maps 9,479 stereotypes to a set of 7,898 properties and behaviors, to yield more than 75,000 pairings.",
        "We construct the second level of the lexicon by automatically linking these properties and behav-iors to each other in a support graph.",
        "The intuition here is that properties which reinforce each other in a single description (e.g. ?as lush and green as a jungle?",
        "or ?as hot and humid as a sauna?)",
        "are more likely to have a similar affect than properties which do not support each other.",
        "We first gather all Google 3-grams in which a pair of stereotypical properties or behaviors X and Y are linked via co-ordination, as in ?hot and humid?",
        "or ?kicking and screaming?.",
        "A bidirectional link between X and Y is added to the support graph if one or more stereotypes in the lexicon contain both X and Y.",
        "If this is not so, we consider whether both descriptors ever reinforce each other in web similes, by posing the web query ?as X and Y as?.",
        "If this query has non-zero hits, we also add a link between X and Y.",
        "Let N denote this support graph, and N(p) denote the set of neighboring terms to p, that is, the set of properties and behaviors that can mutually support p. Since every edge in N represents an affective context, we can estimate the likelihood that a property p is ever used in a positive or negative context if we know the positive or negative affect of enough members of N(p).",
        "So if we label enough vertices of N as + or -, we can interpolate a posi-tive/negative valence score for all vertices p in N. To do this, we build a reference set R of typically negative words, and a set +R of typically positive words.",
        "Given a few seed members of R (such as sad, disgusting, evil, etc.)",
        "and a few seed members of +R (such as happy, wonderful, etc.",
        "), we find many other candidates to add to +R and R by considering neighbors of these seeds in N. After three iterations in this fashion, we populate +R and R with approx.",
        "2000 words each.",
        "For a property p we can now define N+(p) and N-(p) as follows: (1) N+(p) = N(p) ?",
        "+R (2) N-(p) = N(p) ?",
        "-R We can now assign positive and negative valence scores to each vertex p by interpolating from reference values to their neighbors in N: (3) pos(p) = |N+(p) ||N+(p) ?",
        "N-(p) |(4) neg(p) = 1 - pos(p) If a term S denotes a stereotypical idea and is described via a set of typical properties and behaviors typical(S) in the lexicon, then: (5) pos(S) = ?p?typical(S) pos(p) |typical(S)| (6) neg(S) = 1 - pos(S) Thus, (5) and (6) calculate the mean affect of the properties and behaviors of S, as represented via typical(S).",
        "We can now use (3) and (4) to separate typical(S) into those elements that are more negative than positive (putting a negative spin on S) and into those that are more positive than negative (putting a positive spin on S): (7) posTypical(S) = {p |p ?",
        "typical(S) ?",
        "pos(p) > 0.5} (8) negTypical(S) = {p |p ?",
        "typical(S) ?",
        "neg(p) > 0.5} 2.1 Evaluation of Stereotypical Affect In the process of populating +R and -R, we identify a reference set of 478 positive stereotypes (such as saint and hero) and 677 negative stereotypes (such as tyrant and monster).",
        "When we use these reference points to test the effectiveness of (5) and (6) ?",
        "and thus, indirectly, of (3) and (4) and of the 9 stereotype lexicon itself ?",
        "we find that 96.7% of the positive stereotypes in +R are correctly assigned a positivity score greater than 0.5 (pos(S) > neg(S)) by (5), while 96.2% of the negative stereotypes in R are correctly assigned a negativity score greater than 0.5 (neg(S) > pos(S)) by (6).",
        "3 Expansion/Interpretation of Metaphors The Google n-grams are a rich source of affective metaphors of the form Target is Source, such as ?politicians are crooks?, ?Apple is a cult?, ?racism is a disease?",
        "and ?Steve Jobs is a god?.",
        "Let src(T) denote the set of stereotypes that are commonly used to describe T, where commonality is defined as the presence of the corresponding copula metaphor in the Google n-grams.",
        "To find metaphors for proper-named entities like ?Bill Gates?, we also analyze n-grams of the form stereotype First [Middle] Last, such as ?tyrant Adolf Hitler?.",
        "Thus: src(racism) = {problem, disease, joke, sin, poi-son, crime, ideology, weapon} src(Hitler) = {monster, criminal, tyrant, idiot, madman, vegetarian, racist, ?}",
        "We do not try to discriminate literal from non-literal assertions, nor do we even try to define liter-ality.",
        "We simply assume each putative metaphor offers a potentially useful perspective on a topic T. Let srcTypical(T) denote the aggregation of all properties ascribable to T via metaphors in src(T): (9) srcTypical (T) = M?src(T)typical(M) We can also use the posTypical and negTypical variants in (7) and (8) to focus only on metaphors that project positive or negative qualities onto T. (9) is especially useful when the source S in the metaphor T is S is not a known stereotype in the lexicon, as happens when one describes Apple as Scientology.",
        "When the set typical(S) is empty, src-Typical(S) may not be, so srcTypical(S) can act as a proxy representation for S in these cases.",
        "The properties and behaviors that are salient to the interpretation of T is S are given by: (10) salient (T,S) = |srcTypical(T) ?",
        "typical(T) |?",
        "|srcTypical(S) ?",
        "typical(S) |In the context of T is S, the metaphorical stereotype",
        "src(Google) = {king, engine, threat, brand, giant, leader, celebrity, religion ?}",
        "So the following qualities are aggregated for each: srcTypical(Microsoft) = {trusted, menacing, ruling, threatening, overbearing, admired, commanding, ?}",
        "srcTypical(Google) = {trusted, lurking reigning, ruling, crowned, shining, determined, admired ?}",
        "Now, the salient qualities highlighted by the meta-phor, namely salient(Google, Microsoft), are: {celebrated, menacing, trusted, challenging, estab-lished, threatening, admired, respected, ?}",
        "Thus, interpretation(Google, Microsoft) contains: {king, criminal, master, leader, bully, threatening, giant, threat, monopoly, pioneer, dinosaur, ?}",
        "Suppose we focus on the metaphorical expansion ?Google is king?, since king is the most highly ranked element of the interpretation.",
        "Now, sali-ent(king, Google, Microsoft) contains: {celebrated, revered, admired, respected, ruling, arrogant, commanding, overbearing, reigning, ?}",
        "These properties and behaviors are already implicit in our perception of Google, insofar as they are salient aspects of the stereotypes to which Google is frequently compared.",
        "The metaphor ?Google is Microsoft?",
        "?",
        "and its expansion ?Google is king?",
        "?",
        "simply crystalizes these qualities, from perhaps different comparisons, into a single act of ideation.",
        "Consider the metaphor ?Google is -Microsoft?.",
        "Since Microsoft is used to impart a negative spin (+ would impart a positive spin), negTypical is here used in place of typical in (9) and (10).",

        "5 The Metaphor Magnet Web App Metaphor Magnet is designed to be a lightweight web application that provides both HTML output (for humans) and XML (for client applications).",

        "and category assignments from Wikipedia.",
        "The interpretation of the simile/query ?Google is as powerful as Microsoft?",
        "thus highlights a selection of affective viewpoints on the source concept, Microsoft, and picks out an apt selection of viewpoints on the target Google.",

        "a combination of an apt stereotype and a salient quality ?",
