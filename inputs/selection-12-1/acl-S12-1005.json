        "Sentence clustering aims at grouping sentences with similar meanings into clusters.",
        "Commonly, vector similarity measures, such as cosine, are used to define the level of similarity over bag-of-words encoding of the sentences.",
        "Then, standard clustering algorithms can be applied to group sentences into clusters (see Steinbach et al. (2000) for an overview).",
        "The most common practice is representing the sentences as vectors in term space and applying the K-means clustering algorithm (Shen et al. (2011); Pasquier (2010); Wang et al. (2009); Nomoto and Matsumoto (2001); Boros et al. (2001)).",
        "An alternative approach involves partitioning a sentence connectivity graph by means of a graph clustering algorithm (Erkan and Radev (2004); Zha (2002)).",
        "The main challenge for any sentence clustering approach is language variability, where the same meaning can be phrased in various ways.",
        "The shorter the sentences are, the less effective becomes exact matching of their terms.",
        "Compare the following newspaper sentence ?The bank is phasing out the EZ Checking package, with no monthly fee charged for balances over $1,500, and is instead offering customers its Basic Banking account, which carries a fee?",
        "with two tweets regarding the same event: ?Whats wrong.. charging $$ for checking a/c?",
        "and ?Now they want a monthly fee!?.",
        "Though each of the tweets can be found similar to the long sentence by exact term matching, they do not share any single term.",
        "Yet, knowing that the words fee and charge are semantically related would allow discovering the similarity between the two tweets.",
        "External resources can be utilized to provide such kind of knowledge, by which sentence representation can be enriched.",
        "Traditionally, WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) has been used for this purpose (She-hata (2009); Chen et al. (2003); Hotho et al. (2003); Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2001)).",
        "Yet, other resources",
        "of semantically-related terms can be beneficial, such as WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004), statistical resources like that of Lin (1998) or DIRECT (Kotlerman et al., 2010), thesauri, Wikipedia (Hu et al., 2009), ontologies (Suchanek et al., 2007) etc."

        "In Section 2 we listed a number of lexical resources providing pairs of semantically-related terms.",
        "Within the suggested scheme, any combination of resources may be utilized.",
        "Often resources contain terms, which are semantically-related only in certain contexts.",
        "E.g., the words visa and passport are semantically-related when talking about tourism, but cannot be considered related in the banking domain, where visa usually occurs in its credit card sense.",
        "In order to discard irrelevant terms, filtering procedures can be employed.",
        "E.g., a simple filtering applicable in most cases of sentence clustering in a specific domain would discard candidate related terms, which do not occur sufficiently frequently in a target-domain corpus.",
        "In the example above, this procedure would allow avoiding the insertion of passport as related to visa, when considering the banking domain.",
        "Clustering the graph nodes.",
        "Once the term graph is constructed, a graph clustering algorithm is applied resulting in a partition of the graph nodes (terms) into clusters.",
        "The choice of a particular algorithm is a parameter of the scheme.",
        "Many clustering algorithms consider the graph's edge weights.",
        "To address this trait, different edge weights can be assigned, reflecting the level of confidence that the two terms are indeed validly related and the reliability of the resource, which suggested the corresponding edge (e.g. WordNet synonyms are commonly considered more reliable than statistical thesauri)."
