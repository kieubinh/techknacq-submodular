        "We model our algorithm after Yarowsky's (1995) algorithm for unsupervised WSD: Given a set of documents that contain a certain ambiguous word, the goal is to label each instance of that word as some particular sense.",
        "A seed set of collocations that strongly indicate one of the senses is initially used to label a subset of the data.",
        "Yarowsky then finds new collocations in the labelled data that are strongly associated with one of the current labels and applies these to unlabelled data.",
        "This process repeats iteratively, building a decision list of collocations that indicate a particular sense with a certain confidence.",
        "In our algorithm (Algorithm 1), we have a document collection D of images relevant to an ambiguous keyword k with senses s1 and s2 (though the algorithm is extensible to more than two senses).",
        "Such a collection might result from an internet image search using an ambiguous word such as ?mouse?.",

        "Our seed sets consist of the words in the definitions of s1 and s2 from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Any document whose caption contains more words from one sense definition than the other is initially labelled with that sense.",
        "We then iterate between two steps that (i) find additional words associated with s1 or s2 in currently labelled data, and (ii) relabel all data using the word sense associations discovered so far.",
        "We let V be the entire vocabulary of words across all documents.",
        "We run experiements both with and without visual words, but when we use visual words, they are included in V .",
        "In the first step, we compute a confidence Ci for each word Vi.",
        "This confidence is a log-ratio of the probability of seeing Vi in documents labelled as s1 as opposed to documents labelled as s2.",
