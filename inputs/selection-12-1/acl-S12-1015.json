        "Typologocial classifications have a long tradition in linguistics.",
        "For example, typologies based on syntactic categories have been proposed e.g. by Greenberg (1961), leading a.o.",
        "to ?word order?",
        "categorizations of natural languages as belonging to SVO, VSO, etc.",
        "types.",
        "Relatedly, genealogical classification systems based on phonological and morphological similarities date back at least to the comparatists of the nineteenth centuries, among them Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), Rasmus Rask (1787-1832), and Karl Verner (1846-1896).",
        "Typological investigations into (lexical) semantic relations across languages have, in contrast, attracted little attention.",
        "Still, some results have been established such as classifications based upon treatment of animal concepts and corresponding meat concepts (see the excellent introduction to lexical typologies by Koch, 2001).",
        "As further exceptions, based on computational principles, may be considered Mehler et al. (2011), who analyze conceptual networks derived from the Wikipedia topic classification systems for different languages; Gaume et al. (2008), who propose (but do not realize, to the best of our knowledge) to compare distances between selected word pairs such as meat/animal, child/fruit, door/mouth across language-specific monolingual dictionaries in order to categorize the associated languages and, partly, Cooper (2008), who computes semantic distances between languages based on the curvature of translation histograms in bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Recently, Sejane and Eger (2012) have outlined a novel approach to establishing semantic typologies based upon the language-specific polysemy relation of lexical units which entails language-dependent ?lexical semantic association networks?.",
        "To illustrate, French b?uf has two meanings, which we may gloss as ?cow?",
        "and ?beef?",
        "in English.",
        "Similarly, French langue and Spanish lingua mean both ?language?",
        "and ?tongue?, whereas Chinese hua` means both ?language?",
        "and ?picture?.",
        "Sejane and Eger's (2012) key idea is then that this language-specific polysemy can be made observable via the translation relation implied e.g. by a bilingual dictionary.",
        "For instance, using a Chinese-English dictionary, one might be able to uncover the polysemy of hua` by assessing its two English translations, as given above.",
        "More formally, one might create a link (in a network) between two English words if they have a common translation in Chinese (cf. Eger and Sejane, 2010); doing the same with a Spanish-English and French-English dictionary, one would obtain three different lexical semantic association networks, all encoded in the English language, the tertium comparationis or reference language in this case.",
        "In the English networks based upon Spanish",
        "and French ?",
        "Sejane and Eger (2012) call these networks the Spanish and French versions of English, respectively ?",
        "?language?",
        "and ?tongue?",
        "would have a link, whereas in the Chinese version of English, ?language?",
        "and ?picture?",
        "would have a link (see also Figure 1 where we illustrate this idea for English and Latin versions of German).",
        "Then, comparing these networks across languages may allow establishing a typology of lexical semantic associations.",
        "In the current paper, we deliberate on Sejane and Eger's (2012) idea, suggesting ways to adequately formalize their approach (Section 2) and propose data sources suitable for their framework (Section 3).",
        "Moreover, in Section 4 we shortly discuss how network versions of a given reference language can be formally contrasted and suggest solutions for the tertium comparationis problem.",
        "In Section 5, we conclude.",
        "2 Formal approach to lexical semantic association networks We propose the following mathematical framework for representing lexical semantic association networks.",

        "The disadvantage with using bilingual dictionaries is of course that they are scarcely available (and much less freely available); moreover, for the above described semantic association networks, it may be of crucial importance to have comparable data sources; e.g. using a general-purpose dictionary in one case and a technical dictionary in the other, or using dictionaries of vastly different sizes may severely affect the quality of results.1 We more generally propose to use bilingual corpora for the problem of inducing semantic association networks, where we particularly have e.g. sentence-aligned corpora like the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) in mind (see also the study of Rama and Borin (2011) on cognates, with Europarl as the data basis).",
        "Then, translation relations Ti may be induced from these corpora by applying a statistical machine translation approach such as the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",

        "both of which have (1) as special cases.",

        "Reprinted from Sejane and Eger (2012).",
        "Using the Europarl corpus would both address the problem of size and comparability raised above; moreover, corpora may better reflect actual language use than dictionaries, which oftentimes document idiosyncractic, normative or assumed language conditions.",
        "A problem with the Europarl corpus is that it covers just a very small (and selected) subset of the world's languages, whereas it might be of particular interest for (semantic) typology to contrast large, heterogeneous classes of languages.",

        "Such distance measures may be derived from general network statistics such as the number of edges, the diameters of the networks, network density, graph entropy via information functionals (cf. Dehmer, 2008) or clustering coefficients (cf. Watts and Strogatz, 1998).",
        "We believe, however, that such abstract measures can be useful only for a preliminary examination of the data.",

        "For example, we could ask about the lexical semantic difference between French and Chinese with respect to the lexical unit ?language?.",
        "One way of realizing such an analysis would be by making use of shortest distances between network vertices.",
        "To be more precise, let Gi and Gj be two lexical semantic network versions of a reference language R. Assume thatGi andGj have the same number,N , of vertices, with the same labels (i.e. names of vertices such as ?language?).",
        "Let uk, 1 ?",
        "k ?",
        "N , be the k-th vertex in both graphs, with identical label across the two graphs.",

        "l ?",
        "N , is given as the shortest distance between vertex uk and vertex ul in graphs Gi and Gj , respectively,",
        "uk and ul in Gi, and analogously for sj(uk).",
        "We could then define the difference between network version Gi and Gj with respect to vertex uk as e.g. the Euclidean distance between these two vectors, ?si(uk)?",
        "sj(uk)?",
        ".",
        "However, as useful as shortest distances may be, they do not seem to fully capture the topological structure of a network.",
        "For example, they do not indicate whether there are many or few (short) paths between two vertices, etc.",
        "(see also the discussion",
        "in Gaume et al., 2008).",
        "Therefore, we propose a Page-rank like (see Brin and Page, 1998; Gaume and Mathieu, 2012) procedure to compare network vertices of networks Gi and Gj .",
        "To this end, let pi(uk), a vector of dimension N , denote the probability distribution that if, starting from vertex uk, one may reach any of the other vertices of network Gi (and analogously for network Gj), under the following rules.",

        "close to 1, may then neatly represent topological properties of network Gi, from the ?perspective?",
        "of vertex uk.",

        "?uk(Gi, Gj).",
        "(3) If, as mentioned above, we have weighted graphs, we slightly modify the random surfer's behavior.",
        "Instead of passing with uniform probability from vertex v to a neighbor vertex w of v, the surfer passes to w with probability proportional to the weight between v and w; the larger the weight the higher is the probability that the surfer ends up at w. Then, once distance metric values ?ij are given, an n ?",
        "n distance matrix D may be defined whose entry (i, j) is precisely ?ij , Dij = ?ij .",
        "On D, standard e.g. hierarchical clustering algorithms may be applied in order to deduce a lexical semantic typology.",
        "Finally, we address the tertium comparationis problem: Given a set of languages, which one should be chosen as reference language?",
        "It might be tempting to believe that the choice of the reference language should not matter much for the resulting lexical semantic association networks, but the reference language may certainly have some impact.",
        "For example, if English is the reference language, the Chinese version of English might not only have a link between ?language?",
        "and ?picture?",
        "but also between ?language?",
        "and ?tongue?, because of the polysemy of ?tongue?",
        "in English.",

        "and Sprache ?language?",
        "because Zunge, in German, does not mean ?language?",
        "(any more).",

        ", Ln, Ln+1}; in other words, we specify the distance between languages i and j as the average distance over all possible reference languages, which excludes languages i and j themselves.",
