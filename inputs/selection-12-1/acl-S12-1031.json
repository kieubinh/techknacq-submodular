        "Most start-of-the-art natural language parsers (Char-niak, 2000; Clark and Curran, 2004; Collins, 1997) use lexicalised features for parse ranking.",
        "These are important to achieve optimal parsing accuracy, and yet these are also the features which by their nature suffer from data-sparseness problems in the training data.",
        "In the absence of reliable fine-grained statistics for a given token, various strategies are possible.",
        "There will often be statistics available for coarser categories, such as the POS of the particular token.",
        "However, it is possible that these coarser representations discard too much, missing out information which could be valuable to the parse ranking.",
        "An intermediate level of representation could provide valuable additional information here.",

        "Such distinctions are difficult for a parser to make when the training data is sparse, but imagine we had seen examples such as the following in the training corpus:",
        "(3) Kim saw a eucalypt with his binoculars (4) Sandy observed a willow with plentiful foliage",
        "There are few lexical items in common, but in each case the prepositional phrase attachment follows the same pattern: in (3) it attaches to the verb, and in (4) to the noun.",
        "A conventional lexicalised parser would have no knowledge of the semantic similarity between eucalypt and tree, willow and tree, binoculars and telescope, or foliage and leaves, so would not be able to make any conclusions about the earlier examples on the basis of this training data.",
        "However if the parse ranker has also been supplied with information about synonyms or hypernyms of the lexemes in the training data, it could possibly have generalised, to learn that PPs containing nouns related to seeing instruments often modify verbs relating to observation (in preference to nouns denoting inanimate objects), while plant flora can often be modified by PPs relating to appendages of plants such as leaves.",
        "This is not necessarily applicable only to PP attachment, but may help in a range of other syntactic phenomena, such as distinguishing between complements and modifiers of verbs.",
        "The synonyms or hypernyms could take the form of any grouping which relates word forms with semantic or syntactic commonality ?",

        "Additionally, perhaps the changes we applied in this work to the parse ranking could possibly have been more effective with features based on semantic dependences as used by Fujita et al. (2007), although we outlined reasons why we wished to avoid this approach.",
        "This work is preliminary and there is room for more exploration in this space.",
        "There is scope for much more feature engineering on the semantic annotations, such as using different levels of the semantic hierarchy, or replacing the purely lexical features instead of augmenting them.",
        "Additionally, more error analysis would reveal whether this approach was more useful for avoiding certain kinds of parser errors (such as PP-attachment)."
