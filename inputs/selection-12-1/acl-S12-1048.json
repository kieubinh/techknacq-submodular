        "This SemEval2012 shared task is based on a recently introduced spatial annotation scheme called Spatial Role Labeling.",
        "The Spatial Role Labeling task concerns the extraction of main components of the spatial semantics from natural language: trajectors, landmarks and spatial indicators.",
        "In addition to these major components, the links between them and the general-type of spatial relationships including region, direction and distance are targeted.",
        "The annotated dataset contains about 1213 sentences which describe 612 images of the CLEF IAPR TC-12 Image Benchmark.",

      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "One of the essential functions of natural language is to talk about spatial relationships between objects.",
        "The sentence ?Give me the book on AI on the big table behind the wall.?",
        "expresses information about the spatial configuration of the objects (book, table, wall) in some space.",
        "Particularly, it explains the region occupied by the book with respect to the table and the direction (orientation) of the table with respect to the wall.",
        "Understanding such spatial utterances is a problem in many areas, including robotics, navigation, traffic management, and query answering systems (Tappan, 2004).",
        "Linguistic constructs can express highly complex, relational structures of objects, spatial relations between them, and patterns of motion through space relative to some reference point.",
        "Compared to natural language, formal spatial models focus on one particular spatial aspect such as orientation, topology or distance and specify its underlying spatial logic in detail (Hois and Kutz, 2008).",
        "These formal models enable spatial reasoning that is difficult to perform on natural language expressions.",
        "Learning how to map natural language spatial information onto a formal representation is a challenging problem.",
        "The complexity of spatial semantics from the cognitive-linguistic point of view on the one hand, the diversity of formal spatial representation models in different applications on the other hand and the gap between the specification level of the two sides has led to the present situation that no well-defined framework for automatic spatial information extraction exists that can handle all of these aspects.",
        "In a previous paper (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010b), we introduced the task of spatial role labeling (SpRL) and proposed an annotation scheme that is language-independent and practically facilitates the application of machine learning techniques.",
        "Our framework consists of a set of spatial roles based on the theory of holistic spatial semantics (Zlat-evl, 2007) with the intent of covering the main aspects of spatial concepts at a course level, including both static and dynamic spatial semantics.",
        "This shared task is defined on the basis of that annotation scheme.",
        "Since this is the first shared task on the spatial information and this particular data, we proposed a simplified version of the original scheme.",
        "The intention of this simplification was to make this practice feasible in the given timeframe.",
        "However,",
        "the current task is very challenging particularly for learning the spatial links and relations.",
        "The core problem of SpRL is: i) the identification of the words that play a role in describing spatial concepts, and ii) the classification of the relational role that these words play in the spatial configuration.",
        "For example, consider again the sentence ?Give me the book on AI on the big table behind the wall.?.",
        "The phrase headed by the token book is referring to a trajector object.",
        "The trajector (TR) is an entity whose location is described in the sentence.",
        "The phrase headed by the token table is referring to the role of a landmark (LM).",
        "The landmark is a reference object for describing the location of a trajector.",
        "These two spatial entities are related by the spatial expression on denoted as spatial indicator (SP).",
        "The spatial indicator (often a preposition in English, but sometimes a verb, noun, adjective, or adverb) indicates the existence of spatial information in the sentence and establishes the type of a spatial relation.",
        "The spatial relations that can be extracted from the whole sentence are <onSP bookTR tableLM> and <behindSP tableTR wallLM>.",
        "One could also use spatial reasoning to infer that the statement <behind book wall> holds, however, such inferred relations are not considered in this task.",
        "Although the spatial indicators are mostly prepositions, the reverse may not hold-for example, the first preposition on only states the topic of the book, so <on book AI> is not a spatial relation.",
        "For each of the true spatial relations, a general type is assigned.",
        "The <onSP bookTR tableLM> relation expresses a kind of topological relationship between the two objects and we assign it a general type named region.",
        "The <behindSP tableTR wallLM> relation expresses directional information and we assign it a general type named direction.",
        "In general we assume two main abstraction layers for the extraction of spatial information (Bateman, 2010; Kordjamshidi et al., 2010a; Kordjamshidi et al., 2011a): (a) a linguistic layer, corresponding to the annotation scheme described above, which starts with unrestricted natural language and predicts the existence of spatial information at the sentence level by identifying the words that play a particular spatial role as well as their spatial relationship; (b) a formal layer, in which the spatial roles are mapped onto a spatial calculus model (Galton, 2009).",
        "For example, the linguistic layer recognizes that the spatial relation (on) holds between book and table, and the formal layer maps this to a specific, formal spatial representation, e.g., a logical representation like AboveExternallyConnected(book, table) or a formal qualitative spatial representation like EC (externally connected) in the RCC model (Regional Connection Calculus) (Cohn and Renz, 2008).",
        "In this shared task we focus on the first (linguistic) level which is a necessary step for mapping natural language to any formal spatial calculus.",
        "The main roles that are considered here are trajector, landmark, spatial indicator, their links and the general type of their spatial relation.",
        "The general type of a relation can be direction, region or distance."

      "heading": "2 Motivation and related work",
      "text": [
        "Spatial role labeling is a key task for applications that are required to answer questions or reason about spatial relationships between entities.",
        "Examples include systems that perform text-to-scene conversion, generation of textual descriptions from visual data, robot navigation tasks, giving directional instructions, and geographical information systems (GIS).",
        "Recent research trends (Ross et al., 2010; Hois et al., 2011; Tellex et al., 2011) indicate an increasing interest in the area of extracting spatial information from language and mapping it to a formal spatial representation.",
        "Although cognitive-linguistic studies have investigated this problem extensively, the computational aspect of making this bridge between language and formal spatial representation (Hois and Kutz, 2008) is still in its elementary stages.",
        "The possession of a practical and appropriate annotation scheme along with data is the first requirement.",
        "To obtain this one has to investigate and schematize both linguistic and spatial ontologies.",
        "This process needs to cover the necessary information and semantics on the one hand, and to maintain the practical feasibility of the automatic annotation of unobserved data on the other hand.",
        "In recent research on spatial information and natural language, several annotation schemes have been proposed such as ACE, GUM, GML, KML, TRML which are briefly described and compared to Spa-tialML scheme in (MITRE Corporation, 2010).",
        "But",
        "to our knowledge, the main obstacles for employing machine learning in this context and the very limited usage of this effective approach have been (a) the lack of an agreement on a unique semantic model for spatial information; (b) the diversity of formal spatial relations; and consequently (c) the lack of annotated data on which machine learning can be employed to learn and extract the spatial relations.",
        "The most systematic work in this area includes the SpatialML (Mani et al., 2008) scheme which focuses on geographical information, and the work of (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2009) in which the pivot of the spatial information is the spatial verb.",
        "The most recent and active work is the ISO-Space scheme (Pustejovsky et al., 2011) which is based on the above two schemes.",
        "The ideas behind ISO-Space are closely related to our annotation scheme in (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010b), however it considers more detailed and fine-grained spatial and linguistic elements which makes the preparation of the data for machine learning more difficult.",
        "Spatial information is directly related to the part of the language that can be visualized.",
        "Thus, the extraction of spatial information is useful for mul-timodal environments.",
        "One advantage of our proposed scheme is that it considers this dimension.",
        "Because it abstracts the spatial elements that could be aligned with the objects in images/videos and used for annotation of audiovisual descriptions (Butko et al., 2011).",
        "This is useful in the multimodal environments where, for example, natural language instructions are given to a robot for finding the way or objects.",
        "Not much work exists on using annotations for learning models to extract spatial information.",
        "Our previous work (Kordjamshidi et al., 2011c) is a first step in this direction and provides a domain independent linguistic and spatial analysis to this problem.",
        "This shared task invites interested research groups for a similar effort.",
        "The idea behind this task is firstly to motivate the application of different machine learning approaches, secondly to investigate effective features for this task, and thirdly to reveal the practical problems in the annotation schemes and the annotated concepts.",
        "This will help to enrich the data and the annotation in parallel with the machine learning practice."

        "Moreover, the links between the three roles are annotated as a spatial Relation.",

        "In spatial information theory the relations and properties are usually grouped into the domains of topological, directional, and distance relations and also shape (Stock,",
        "1997).",
        "Accordingly, we propose a mapping between the extracted spatial triplets to the coarse-grained type of spatial relationships including region, direction or distance.",
        "We call these types as general-type of the spatial relations and briefly describe these below: Region.",

        "Direction.",
        "denotes a direction along the axes provided by the different frames of reference, in case the trajector of motion is not characterized in terms of its relation to the region of a landmark, e.g. ?the vase is on the left?.",
        "Distance.",
        "states information about the spatial distance of the objects and could be a qualitative expression such as close, far or quantitative such as 12 km, e.g. ?the kids are close to the blackboard?.",
        "The general-type of the relation in the example is annotated as region.",
        "After extraction of these relations a next fine-grained step will be to map each general spatial relationship to an appropriate spatial calculi representation.",
        "This step is not intended for this task and the additional tags in the scheme will be considered in the future shared tasks.",
        "For example Region Connection Calculus RCC-8 (Cohn and Renz, 2008) representation reflects region-based topological relations.",
        "Topological or region-based spatial information has been researched in depth in the area of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning.",
        "We assume that the trajectors and landmarks can often be interpreted as spatial regions and, as a consequence, their relation can be annotated with a specific RCC-8 relation.",
        "The RCC type in the above example is specifically annotated as the PP (proper part).",
        "Similarly, the direction and distance relations are mapped to more specific formal representations.",
        "Two additional annotations are about motion verbs and dynamism.",
        "Dynamic spatial information are associated with spatial movements and spatial changes.",
        "In dynamic spatial relations mostly motion verbs are involved.",
        "Motion verbs carry spatial information and influence the spatial semantics.",
        "In the above example the spatial indicator over is related to a motion verb walking.",
        "Hence the spatial relation is dynamic and walking is annotated as the motion.",
        "In contrast to the dynamic spatial relations, the static ones explain a static spatial configuration such as the example of the previous section <onSP bookTR tableLM> .",
        "In the case of dynamic spatial information a path is associated with the location of the trajector.",
        "In our scheme the path is characterized by the three values of beginning, middle, end and zero.",
        "The frame of reference can be intrinsic, relative or absolute and is typically relevant for directional relations.",

        "Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results of the three runs in the standard setting of the shared task using the train/test split.",
        "In this evaluation setting the UTDSPRL-SUPERVISED2 run achieves the highest performance on the test set, with F1 of 0.573 for the full triplet identification task, and an F1 of 0.566 for additionally classifying the triplet's general-type",
        "SUPERVISED2 evaluated with 10-fold cross validation correctly.",
        "It also consistently outperforms both the UTDSPRL-SUPERVISED1 run and the KUL-SKIPCHAIN-CRF system on each of the individual trajector, landmark and spatial-indicator extraction.",
        "The dataset was relatively small, so we released the test data and the two systems were additionally evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.",
        "The results of this cross-validation are shown in Table 5.",
        "The UTDSPRL-SUPERVISED2 run achieves a higher precision, while the KUL-SKIP-CHAINCRF system achieves a higher recall.",
        "It should be mentioned the 10-fold splits used by KUL and UTD are not the same.",
        "This implies that the results with exactly the same cross-folds may vary slightly from these reported in Table 5.",
        "Using 10-fold cross validation, we also evaluated the classification of the general-type of a relation given the manually annotated positive triplets.",
        "The UTDSPRL-SUPERVISED2 system achieved F1= 0.974, and similar experiments using SMO-SVM in (Kordjamshidi et al., 2011b; Kordjamshidi et al., 2011a) achieved F1= 0.973.",
        "Thus it appears that identifying the general-type of a relation is a relatively easy task on this data.",
        "Discussion.",
        "Since the feature sets of the two systems are different and given the evaluation results in the two evaluation settings, it is difficult to assert which model is better in general.",
        "Obviously using joint features potentially inputs richer information to the model.",
        "However, it can increase the sparsity in one hand and overfitting on the training data on the other hand.",
        "Another problem is that finding heuristics for high recall that are sufficiently general to be used in every domain is not an easy task.",
        "By increasing the number of candidates the dataset imbalance will increase dramatically.",
        "This can cause a lower performance of a joint model based on a binary classification setting when applied on different data sets.",
        "It seems that this task might require a more elaborated structured output prediction model which can consider the joint features and alleviate the problem of huge negatives in that framework while considering the correlations between the output components."
