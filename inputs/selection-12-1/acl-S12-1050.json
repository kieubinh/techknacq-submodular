        "Semantic analysis is a long-term goal of Natural Language Processing, and as such, has been researched for several decades.",
        "A number of tasks for encoding semantic information have been developed over the years, such as entity type recognition and word sense disambiguation.",
        "Recently, sentence-level semantics ?",
        "in particular, semantic role label-ing ?",
        "has received increasing attention.",
        "However, some problems concerning the semantic representation method used in semantic role labeling continue",
        "to exist (Xue and Palmer, 2005).",
        "1.",
        "Semantic role labeling only considers predicate-argument relations and ignores the semantic relations between a noun and its modifier.",
        "2.",
        "The meaning of semantic roles is related to special predicates.",
        "Therefore, there are infinite se",
        "mantic roles to be learned, as the number of predicates is not fixed.",
        "Although the Prop-Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2003) normalizes these semantic roles into certain symbols, such as Arg0-Arg5, the same symbol can have different semantic meanings when paired with different predicates, and thus cannot be learned well.",
        "Semantic dependency parsing is therefore proposed to solve the two problems above for Chinese.",
        "Firstly, the proposed method analyzes all the words?",
        "semantic roles in a sentence and specifies the concrete semantic relation of each word pair.",
        "After-ward, this work analyzes and summarizes all the possible semantic roles, obtaining over 100 of them, and then uses these semantic roles to specify the semantic relation for each word pair.",
        "Dependency parsing (Ku?bler et al., 2009) is based on dependency grammar.",
        "It has several advantages, such as concise formalization, easy comprehension, high efficiency, and so on.",
        "Dependency parsing has been studied intensively in recent decades, with most related work focusing on syntactic structure.",
        "Many research papers on Chinese linguistics demonstrate the remarkable difference between semantics and syntax (Jin, 2001; Zhou and Zhang, 2003).",
        "Chinese is a meaning-combined language with very flexible syntax, and semantics are more stable than syntax.",
        "The word is the basic unit of semantics, and the structure and meaning of a sentence consists mainly of a series of semantic dependencies between individual words (Li et al., 2003).",
        "Thus, a reasonable endeavor is to exploit dependency parsing for semantic analysis of Chinese languages.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of Chinese semantic dependency parsing.",
        "parsing looks very similar to traditional syntax-dominated dependency parsing.",
        "Below is a comparison between the two tasks, dealing with three main points:",
        "1.",
        "Semantic relations are more fine-grained than syntactic ones: the syntactic subject can either be the agent or experiencer, and the syntactic object can be the content, patient, possession, and so on.",
        "On the whole, the number of semantic relations is at least twice that of syntactic relations.",
        "2.",
        "Semantic dependency parsing builds the depen",
        "dency structure of a sentence in terms of semantics, and the word pairs of a dependency should have a direct semantic relation.",
        "This criterion determines many sizeable differences between semantics and syntax, especially in phrases formed by ?XP+DEG?, ?XP+DEV?",
        "and prepositional phrases.",
