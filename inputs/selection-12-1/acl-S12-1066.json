        "Lexical Simplification revolves around replacing words by their simplest synonym in a context aware fashion.",
        "It is similar in many respects to the task of Lexical Substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) in that it involves elements of selectional preference on the basis of a central predefined criterion (simplicity in the current case), as well as sensitivity to context.",
        "Lexical Simplification envisages principally a human target audience, and can greatly benefit children, second language learners, people with low literacy levels or cognitive disabilities, and in general facilitate the dissemination of knowledge to wider audiences.",
        "We experimented with a number of features that we posited might be inherently linked with textual simplicity and selected the three that seemed the most promising on an evaluation with the trial dataset.",
        "These include contextual and psycholinguistic components.",
        "When combined using an SVM 1Developed by co-organizers of the shared task ranker to build a model, such a model provides results that offer a statistically significant improvement over a very strong context-independent baseline.",
        "The system ranked first overall on the Lexical Simplification task."
