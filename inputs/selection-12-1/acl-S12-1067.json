        "Lexical simplification is a subtask of the more general text simplification task which attempts at reducing the cognitive complexity of a text so that it can be (better) understood by a larger audience.",
        "Text simplification has a wide range of applications which includes applications for the elderly, learners of a second language, children or people with cognitive deficiencies, etc.",
        "Works on text simplification mostly focus on reducing the syntactic complexity of the text (Sid-dharthan, 2011; Siddharthan, 2006) and only little work has addressed the issue of lexical simplification (Devlin, 1999; Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "The Lexical Simplification Task (Specia et al., 2012) proposed within the SemEval-2012 is the first attempt to explore the nature of the lexical simplification more systematically.",
        "This task requires participating systems, given a context and a target word, to automatically generate a ranking of substitutes, i.e. lexical forms conveying similar meanings to the target word, such that cognitively simpler lexical forms are ranked higher than more difficult ones.",
        "In this paper, we describe the system we submitted to the SemEval-2012 Lexical Simplification Task.",
        "In order to rank the candidate substitutes of a lexical form in descending order of simplicity, our system (mmSystem) combines word frequency with decompositional semantics criteria based on syntactic structure.",
        "The mmSystem achieved an average ranking if compared with the other participating systems and the baselines.",

        "Given a short text C called the context and which generally corresponds to a sentence, a target word T and a list LS of candidate substitutes for T , i.e. a list of quasi-synonyms of the target word, the task for a system consists in providing a ranking on LS such that the original list of substitutes is sorted over simplicity, from the cognitively simplest to the cognitively most difficult lexical form.",
        "As the examples from (1) to (3) show, the Lexical Simplification Task includes substitutes of different syntactic complexity which might vary from simple one-word substitutes as in (1) (the lexical forms that",
        "can function as substitutes include content words, i.e. nouns (n), verbs (v), adjectives (a) and adverbs (r)) to collocations, negated forms as in (2) or even definition-like paraphrases as for instance wind and knock the breath out of in example (3).",

        "To produce a gold standard, 5 human annotators manually ranked the list of substitutes associated to each context.",
        "Finally, a scoring algorithm is provided for computing agreement between the output of the system and the manually ranked gold standard.",

        "The idea behind our framework is the following.",
        "We build on previous work (De-vlin, 1999; Carroll et al., 1999) that approximate simplicity with word frequency, such that the cognitively simpler lexical form is the one that is more frequent in the language.",

        "Our approach builds on the baseline definition of simplicity based on word frequency and integrates it with (de)compositional semantics considerations.",

        "Step 2: Relevance Rules In the second step, depending on the syntactic representation of the substitutes, the system selects a relevance rule that identifies the one-word lexical form that will be used for representing the meaning of the whole substitute.",

        "In this step, we rely on the SenseRelate::TargetWord package (Pat-wardhan et al., 2005) and use the Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) for word sense disambiguation.",
        "Step 4: Substitute Ranking Following (Carroll et al., 1999) that pointed out that rare words generally have only one sense, in order to associate a frequency index to each candidate substitute (wi), we use the number of senses associated by WordNet to a lexical item of a given part of speech, as an approximation of its frequency (fi).",
        "Further, we extract from WordNet the frequency of the word sense (fwnsi) associated to the lexical item wi at step 3.",

        "This can be explained with the fact that the decompositional semantics of these category is better accounted for by our rules.",
