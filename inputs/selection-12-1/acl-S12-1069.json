        "One of the systems performs second-best (statistically significant) and another one performs third-best out of 9 systems and 3 baselines.",
        "Notably, the third-best system is very close to the second-best, and at the same time much more resource-light in comparison."

        "Lexical simplification (described in (Specia et al., 2012)) is a newer problem that has arisen following a recent surge in interest in the related task of lexical substitution (McCarthy et al., 2007).",
        "While lexical substitution aims at making systems generate suitable paraphrases for a target word in an instance, which do not necessarily have to be simpler versions of the original, it has been speculated that one possible use of the task could be lexical simplification, in particular in the realm of making educational text more readable for non-native speakers.",
        "The task of lexical simplification, which thus derives from lexical substitution, uses the same data set, and has been introduced at the 6th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SEMEVAL 2012), in conjunction with the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2012).",
        "Instead of asking systems to provide substitutes, the task provides the systems with all substitutes and asks them to be ranked.",
        "The task provides several instances of triplets of a context C, a target word T , and a set of gold standard substitutes S. The systems are supposed to rank the substitutes si ?",
        "S from the simplest to the most difficult, and match their predictions against the provided human annotations.",
        "The organizers define simple loosely as words that can be understood by a wide variety of people, regardless of their literacy and cognitive levels, age, and regional backgrounds.",
        "The task is novel in that so far most work has been done on syntactic simplification and not on lexical simplification.",

        "al.",
