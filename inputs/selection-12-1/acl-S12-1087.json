        "We propose an approach to Semantic Textual Similarity based on distributional models of words, where the geometrical metaphor of meaning is exploited.",
        "Distributional models are grounded on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968), according to which the meaning of a word is determined by the set of textual contexts in which it appears.",
        "These models represent words as vectors in a high dimensional vector space.",
        "Word vectors are built from a large corpus in such a way that vector dimensions reflect the different uses (or contexts) of a word in the corpus.",
        "Hence, the meaning of a word is defined by its use, and words used in similar contexts are represented by vectors near in the space.",
        "In this way, semantically related words like ?basketball?",
        "and ?volleyball?, which occur frequently in similar contexts, say with words ?court, play, player?, will be represented by near points.",
        "Different definitions of contexts give rise to different (semantic) spaces.",
        "A context can be a document, a sentence or a fixed window of surrounding words.",
        "Contexts and words can be stored through a co-occurrence matrix, whose columns correspond to contexts, and rows to words.",
        "Therefore, the strength of the semantic association between words can be computed as the cosine similarity of their vector representations.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990), BEAGLE (Jones and Mewhort, 2007), Random Indexing (Kanerva, 1988), Hyperspace Analogue to Language (Burgess et al., 1998), WordSpace (SchÃ¼tze and Pedersen, 1995) are all techniques conceived to build up semantic spaces.",
        "However, all of them intend to represent semantics at a word scale.",
        "Although vectors addition and multiplication are two well defined operations suitable for composing words in semantic spaces, they miss taking into account the underlying syntax, which regulates the compositionality of words.",
        "Some efforts toward this direction are emerging (Clark and Pulman, 2007; Clark et al., 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010; Basile et al., 2011; Clarke, 2012), which resulted in theoretical work corroborated by empirical evaluation on how small fragments of text compose (e.g. noun-noun, adjective-noun, and verb-noun pairs)."
