        "In STS the participating systems must examine the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences.",
        "The goal of this task is to create a unified framework for the evaluation of semantic textual similarity modules and to characterize their impact on NLP applications.",
        "STS is related to Textual Entailment (TE) and Paraphrase tasks.",
        "The main difference is that STS 1 Integration of Semantic Resource based on WordNet.",
        "assumes bidirectional graded equivalence between the pair of textual snippets.",
        "In the case of TE the equivalence is directional (e.g. a student is a person, but a person is not necessarily a student).",
        "In addition, STS differs from TE and Paraphrase in that, rather than being a binary yes/no decision, STS is a similarity-graded notion (e.g. a student and a person are more similar than a dog and a person).",
        "This bidirectional gradation is useful for NLP tasks such as Machine Translation,",
        "sentence pairs obtained from a segmented corpus.",
        "For each sentence pair, s1 and s2, all participants had to quantify how similar s1 and s2 were, providing a similarity score.",
