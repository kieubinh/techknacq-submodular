        "Recognizing textual entailment (TE) is a key task for many natural language processing (NLP) problems.",

        "The notation T ?",
        "H says that the meaning of H can be inferred from T, in order words, H does not introduce any novel information with respect to T. Even though RTE challenges lead to many approaches for finding textual entailment, fewer authors exploited the directional character of the entailment relation.",
        "Due to the fact that the entailment relation, unlike the equivalence relation, is not symmetric, if T ?",
        "H , it is less likely that the reverse H ?",
        "T can also hold (Tatar et al., 2009).",
        "The novel Cross-Lingual Text Entailment (CLTE) approach increases the complexity of the traditional TE task in two way, both of which have been only partially researched and have promise for great potential (Negri et al., 2012): ?",
        "the two texts are no longer written in the same language (cross-linguality); ?",
        "the entailment needs to be queried in both directions (content synchronization).",

        "The semantic similarity formula from (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) defines the similarity of a pair of documents differently depending on with respect to which text it is computed.",
        "The formula involves only the set of open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) from each text.",
        "Based on this text-to-text similarity metric, Tatar et al. (2009) have derived a textual entailment recognition system.",
        "The paper demonstrated that in the case when T ?",
        "H holds, the following relation will take place:",
        "however, the opposite of this statement is not always true, nevertheless it is likely.",
        "In (Tatar et al., 2007)",
        "a simpler version for the calculus of sim(T,H)T is used: namely the only case of similarity is the identity (a symmetric relation) and/or the occurrence of a word from a text in the synset of a word in the other text (not symmetric relation).",
        "Perini and Tatar (2009) used the earlier semantic similarity formula (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) to derive a formula for directional text relatedness score as follows:",

        "The application was implemented in the Java programming language.",
        "XML input and output was performed using the DocumentBuilder and the DOM parser from Java.",
        "The first step was to tag both the English and the foreign language sentence using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), which had the advantage that it was fast and it supported all the languages required by this task by providing it with the necessary parameter file, and also had a nice Java wrapper for it (an-nolab, 2011).",
        "The output of the tagger was used to obtain the necessary POS information needed to distinguish the set of open-class words for each sentence.",
        "Because the tagset used for each language was different, it was necessary to adapt all the different variants to the four generic classes: noun, verb, adjective and adverb.",
        "The translation step followed for the foreign language sentence, which took words only from these classes and translated them using two dictionaries in some cases.",
        "The base dictionary used for word lookup was the FreeDict (FreeDictProject, 2012), for which it was possible to download the language files and use them locally with the help of a server (ktulu, 2006) and a Java client (SourceForge, 2001).",
        "The disadvantage of this dictionary was that it had rather few headwords mainly for the Italian and Spanish languages.",
        "A later improvement was to use an additional online dictionary as a fall-back, WordReference.com (WordReference.com, 2012), which had a very good headword count for the Italian and French languages, it also provided a very nice JSON API to access it and there was a ready-to-use Java API (SourceForge, 2011) for it that supported caching the results.",
        "Although the number of queries per hour was limited, it was very helpful that they approved the caching of the results for the duration of the development.",
        "The dictionary lookup process attached to each foreign word that was found the set of English meanings, corresponding to each sense that was found.",
        "The penultimate step was to compute the text relatedness scores with respect to each sentence, rel(T,H)T and rel(T,H)H , by applying (2).",
        "The only modification compared to the original formula was that in the case of the translated word, all the obtained meanings were used and the one producing the maximum relatedness was kept.",

        "recall and F-measure values of the different judgments.",
        "TreeTagger tool (Schmid, 1995).",
        "In case the word was still not found, but the language was French or Italian and the word contained apostrophe, a lookup was attempted for the part following it.",
        "Run 3 added another slight improvement for German, in case there was still no match for the word, tried to see if the word was a composite containing two parts found in the dictionary, and if so, used the first one.",
        "The first two runs were only using the FreeDict (FreeDictProject, 2012) dictionary, while starting with run 3, Italian and French language words, in case not found, could also be searched in the WordReference (WordReference.com, 2012) online dictionary.",

        "The system was a good example of how an approach for monolingual text entailment can be adapted to the new dimension of cross-linguality.",
        "It would have been possible to use a MT tool and then do the entailment detection steps all in English as was the original approach, however we expected that that would introduce more possibility for error than translating and comparing words with the same POS.",
        "The overall best result for each language that we have obtained was around the median of all the system runs that were submitted to the CLTE task.",
        "The best accuracy obtained by our system was for the French-English pair with 38.4%, but well below the accuracy of the best systems.",
        "Generally the results involving German and French were somewhat better than the other two languages.",
        "In the case of Spanish this could easily be caused by the significantly smaller dictionary that was available, while for Italian, after relying also on WordReference.com this was no longer the case.",
        "A possiblity is that some language particularities were affecting the results (e.g. high usage of apostrophe) but perhaps the entailment heuristic thresholds were not the best either.",
        "Finally, there are several possible improvements.",
        "Firstly, in case the dictionary provides POS information for the translation, that could be used to retain only those senses that have the same POS as the original word.",
        "For some languages, particularly for Spanish, it would be helpful to rely on dictionaries with more headwords.",
        "Secondly, we can use the inverse document frequency counts for words, obtained either from the CLTE development corpus or from web searches, because currently that was simply one.",
        "Thirdly, both the empirically obtained conditions can be further tuned, manually or by means of learning, separately for each language pair.",
        "Fourthly, when computing the word relatedness scores, the weights of the WordNet relations could be further adjusted for each language, empirically, or again by learning."
