        "It is a characteristic of natural language that a large proportion of running words in a corpus corresponds to a very small fraction of the vocabulary.",
        "An analysis of the Brown Corpus has shown that the hundred most frequent words account for 42% of the corpus, while only 0.1% in the vocabulary.",
        "On the other hand, words occurring only once account merely 5.7% in the corpus but 58% in the vocabulary (Bell et al. 1990).",
        "This phenomenon can be explained in terms of Zipf's Law, which states that the product of word ranks and their frequencies approximates a constant, i.e. word-frequency plot is close to a hyperbolic function, and hence the few top ranked words would account for a great portion of the corpus.",
        "Also, it appears that the top ranked words are mainly function words.",
        "For instance, the eight most frequent words in the Brown Corpus are the, of, and, to, a, in, that and is (Bell et al. 1990).",
        "It is a common practice in Information Retrieval (IR) to filter the most frequent words out from processed documents (which are referred to as stop words), as these function words are semantically non-informative and constitute weak indexing terms.",
        "By removing this great amount of stop words, not only space and time complexities can be reduced, but document content can be better discriminated by the remaining content words (Fox, 1989; Rijsbergen, 1979; Zou et al., 2006; Dolamic & Savoy 2009).",
        "Inspired by the concept of stop word removal in Information Retrieval, in this work we study the feasibility of stop word removal in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "Different from Information Retrieval, that ranks or classifies documents; SMT hypothesizes sentences in target language.",
        "Therefore, without explicitly removing frequent words from the documents, we proposed to ignore such words in the target language vocabulary, i.e. by replacing those words with a null token.",
        "We term this process as ?relaxation?",
        "and the omitted words as ?relaxed words?.",
        "Relaxed SMT here refers to a translation task in which target vocabulary words are intentionally omitted from the training dataset for reducing translation complexity.",
        "Since the most frequent words are targeted to be relaxed, as a result, there will be vast amount of null tokens in the output text, which later shall be recovered in a post processing stage.",
        "The idea of relaxation in SMT is motivated by one of our experimental findings, in which the perplexity measured over a test set decreases when most frequent words are relaxed.",
        "For instance, a 15% of perplexity reduction is observed when the twenty most frequent words are relaxed in the English EPPS dataset.",
        "The reduction of perplexity allows us to conjecture",
        "about the decrease of confusion in the text, from which a SMT system might be benefited.",
        "After applying relaxed SMT, the resulting null tokens in the translated sentences have to be replaced by the corresponding words from the set of relaxed words.",
        "As relaxed words are chosen from the top ranked words, which possess high occurrences in the corpus, their n-gram probabilities could be reliably trained to serve for word prediction.",
        "Also, these words are mainly function words and, from the human perspective, function words are usually much easier to predict from their neighbor context than content words.",
        "Consider for instance the sentence the house of the president is very nice.",
        "Function words like the, of, and is, are certainly easier to be predicted than content words such as house, president, and nice.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized into four sections.",
        "In section 2, we discuss the relaxation strategy implemented for a SMT system, which generates translation outputs that contain null tokens.",
        "In section 3, we present the word prediction mechanism used to recover the null tokens occurring in the relaxed translation outputs.",
        "In section 4, we present and discuss the experimental results.",

        "In this paper, relaxation refers to the replacement of the most frequent words in text by a null token.",

        "For example, lets the relaxation order be two and the two words on the top rank are the and is.",
        "By relaxing the sample sentence previously presented in the introduction, the following relaxed sentence will be obtained: NULL house of NULL President NULL very beautiful.",
        "From some of our preliminary experimental results with the EPPS dataset, we did observe that a relaxation order of twenty leaded to a perplexity reduction of about a 15%.",
        "To see whether this contributes to improving the translation performance, we trained a translation system by relaxing the top ranked words in the vocabulary of the target language.",
        "In this way, there will be a large number of words in the source language that will be translated to a null token.",
        "For example: la (the in Spanish) and es (is in Spanish) will be both translated to a null token in English.",
        "This relaxation of terms is only applied to the target language vocabulary, and it is conducted after the word alignment process but before the extraction of translation units and the computation of model probabilities.",
        "The main objective of this relaxation procedure is twofold: on the one hand, it attempts to reduce the complexity of the translation task by reducing the size of the target vocabulary while affecting a large proportion of the running words in the text; on the other hand, it should also help to reduce model sparseness and improve model probability estimates.",
        "Of course, different from the Information Retrieval case, in which stop words are not used at all along the search process, in the considered machine translation scenario, the removed words need to be recovered after decoding in order to produce an acceptable translation.",
        "The relaxed word replacement procedure, which is based on an n-gram based predictor, is implemented as a post-processing step and applied to the relaxed machine translation output in order to produce the final translation result.",
        "Our bet here is that the gain in the translation step, which is derived from the relaxation strategy, should be enough to compensate the error rate of the word prediction step, producing, in overall, a significant improvement in translation quality with respect to the non-relaxed baseline procedure.",
