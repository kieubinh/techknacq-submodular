        "State-of-the-art phrase-based SMT (Koehn, 2010a) is the most successful MT approach in many large scale evaluations, such as WMT,1 IWSLT2 etc.",
        "At the same time, work continues in the area of EBMT.",
        "TrEx (Dandapat et al., 2010).",
        "The success of an SMT system often depends on the amount of parallel training corpora available for the particular language pair.",
        "However, low translation accuracy has been observed for language pairs with limited training resources (Islam et al., 2010; Khalilov et al., 2010).",
        "SMT systems effectively discard the actual training data once the models (translation model and language model) have been estimated.",
        "This can lead to their inability to guarantee good quality translation for sentences closely matching those in the training corpora.",
        "By contrast, EBMT systems usually maintain a linked relationship between the full sentence pairs in source and target texts.",
        "Because of this EBMT systems can often capture long range dependencies and rich morphology at runtime.",
        "In contrast to SMT, however, most EBMT models lack a well-formed probability model, which restricts the use of statistical information in the translation process.",
        "Keeping these in mind, our objective is to develop a good quality MT system choosing the best approach for each input in the form of a hybrid SMT-EBMT approach.",
        "It is often the case that an EBMT system produces a good translation where SMT systems fail and vice versa (Dandapat et al., 2011).",
        "An EBMT system relies on past translations to derive the target output for a given input.",
        "Runtime EBMT approaches generally do not include any training stage, which has the advantage of not having to depend on time-consuming preprocessing.",
        "On the other hand, their runtime complexity can be considerable.",
        "This is due to the time-consuming matching stage at runtime that finds the example",
        "(or set of examples) which most closely matches the source-language sentence to be translated.",
        "This matching step often uses some variation of string edit-distance measures (Levenshtein, 1965) which has quadratic time complexity.3 This is quite time-consuming even when a moderate amount of training examples are used for the matching procedure.",
        "We adopt two alternative approaches to tackle the above problem.",
        "First we use heuristics which are often useful to avoid some of the computations.",
        "For a input sentence, in the matching process, we may not need to compute the string edit distance with all sentences in the example base.",
        "In order to prune some of the computation, we rely on the fact that the input sentence and its closest match sentence from the example-base are likely to have a similar sentence length.",
        "Search engine indexing is an effective way of storing data for fast and accurate retrieval of information.",
        "During retrieval, a set of documents are extracted based on their similarity to the input query.",
        "In our second approach, we use this concept to efficiently retrieve a potential set of suitable candidate sentences from the example-base to find the closest match.",
        "We index the entire example-base considering each source-side sentence as a document for the indexer.",
        "We show that improvements can be made with our approach in terms of time complexity without affecting the translation quality.",

        "We find that the EBMTTM system has a lower accuracy on its own compared to baseline SMT for both the language pairs (Table 2).",
        "Nevertheless, there are sentences which are better translated by the EBMTTM approach compared to SMT, although the overall document translation score is higher with SMT.",
        "Thus, we combined the two systems based on different features and found that the combined system performs better.",
        "The highest relative improvements in BLEU score are 3.47% and 1.05% respectively for En?Tr and En?Fr translation.",
        "We found that if an input has a high fuzzy match score (FMS) with the example-base, then the EBMTTM system does better compared to SMT.",
        "With our current experimental setup, we found that an FMS over 0.8 showed an improvement for En?Tr and a FMS over 0.6 showed improvement for En?Fr over the SMT system.",
        "Figure 2 shows the effect in the translation",
        "quality when different FMS thresholds were used to combine the two systems.",
        "However, FMS might not be the only factor for triggering the EBMTTM system.",
        "We considered EqUs as another factor which showed improvement for En?Tr but showed negative effect for En?Fr.",
        "Though an FMS over 0.7 for En?Tr shows no improvement in overall system accuracy, inclusion of the EqUs feature along with FMS shows improvement.",
        "Thus, the EBMTTM system is sometimes more effective when the number of unmatched segment matches in s, sc and tc.",
        "These observations show the effective use of our EBMT approach in terms of translation quality.",
        "However, we found that the EBMTTM system has a very considerable runtime complexity.",
        "In order to translate 414 test sentences from English into Turkish, the basic EBMT system takes 295.9 seconds.",
        "The situation becomes worse when using the large example-base for En?Fr translation.",
        "Here, we found that the system takes around 38 hours to translate 10k source English sentences into French.",
        "This is a significant time complexity by any standard for a runtime approach.",
        "However, both grouping and indexing reduce the time complexity of the approach considerably.",
        "The time reduction with grouping depends on the number of bins considered to find the closest sentence during the matching stage.",
        "Systems with a lower number of bins take less time but cause more of a drop in translation quality.",
        "The effect is more prominent with the En?Fr system which uses a larger example-base.",
        "We found a drop of absolute 1.32 BLEU points while considering a single bucket whose length is equal to the length of the test sentence.",
        "This configuration takes 63 minutes to translate 10k English sentences into French.",
        "There is only a drop of 0.03 BLEU points when considering the 5 nearest bins (?2) for a given test sentence.",
        "Nevertheless, there is not much of a reduction but it increases the run time to 5 hours for the translation of 10k sentences.",
        "Thus, the group-based method is not effective enough to balance system accuracy and run time.",
        "Incorporation of the indexing technique into the matching stage of EBMT shows the highest efficiency gains in run time.",
        "Translating 10k sentences from English into French takes only 158 seconds.",
        "It is also interesting to note that with indexing, the BLEU score remained the same or even increased.",
        "This is due to the fact that, compared to FMS-based matching, a different closest-matching sentence sc is selected for some of the input sentences while using indexing, thus resulting in a different outcome to the system.",
        "Figure 3 compares the number of times the EBMTTM + SMT + index system is used in the hybrid system and the number of same closest-matching sentences selected by EBMTTM + SMT + index systems under different conditions for En?Tr.",
