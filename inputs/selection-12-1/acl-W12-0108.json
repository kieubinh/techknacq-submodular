        "The PRESEMT project constitutes a novel approach to the machine translation task.",
        "This approach is characterised by (a) introducing cross-disciplinary techniques, mainly borrowed from the machine learning and computational intelligence domains, in the MT paradigm and (b) using relatively inexpensive language resources.",
        "The aim is to develop a language-independent methodology for the creation of a flexible and adaptable MT system, the features of which ensure easy portability to new language pairs or adaptability to particular user requirements and to specialised domains with minimal effort.",
        "PRESEMT falls within the Corpus-based MT (CBMT) paradigm, using a small bilingual parallel corpus and a large TL monolingual corpus.",
        "Both these resources are collected as far as possible over the web, to simplify the development of resources for new language pairs.",
        "The main aim of PRESEMT has been to alleviate the reliance on specialised resources.",
        "In comparison, Statistical MT requires large parallel corpora for the source and target languages.",
        "PRESEMT relaxes this requirement by using a small parallel corpus, augmented by a large TL monolingual corpus."

        "The PRESEMT system is distinguished into three stages, as shown in Figure 1: 1.",
        "Pre-processing stage: This is the stage where the essential resources for the MT system are compiled.",
        "It consists of four discrete modules: (a) the Corpus creation & annotation module, being responsible for the compilation of monolingual and bilingual corpora over the web and their annotation; (b) the Phrase aligner module, which processes a bilingual corpus to perform phrasal level alignment within a language pair; (c) the Phrasing model generator that elicits an SL phrasing model on the basis of the aforementioned alignment and employs it as a parsing tool during the translation process; (d) the Corpus modelling module, which creates semantics-based TL models used for disambiguation purposes during the translation process.",
        "2.",
        "Main translation engine: The translation in PRESEMT is a top-down two-phase process, distinguished into the Structure selection module, where the constituent phrases of an SL sentence are reordered according to the TL, and the Translation equivalent selection module where translation disambiguation is resolved and word order within phrases is established.",
        "Closely integrated to the translation engine, but not part of the main translation process, is the Optimisation module, which is responsible for automatically improving the performance of the two translation phases by fine-tuning the values of the various system parameters.",
        "3.",
        "Post-processing stage: The third stage is user-oriented and comprises (i) the Post-processing and (ii) the User Adaptation modules.",
        "The first module allows the user to modify the system-generated translations towards their requirements.",
        "The second module enables PRESEMT to adapt to this input so that it learns to generate translations closer to the users?",
        "requirements.",
        "The post-processing stage represents work in progress to be reported in future publications, the present article focussing on the actual strategy for generating the translation.",
        "3.",
        "Processing of the bilingual corpus",
        "The bilingual corpus contains literal translations, to allow the extrapolation of mapping information from SL to TL, though this may affect the translation quality.",
        "The Phrase aligner module (PAM) performs offline SL ?",
        "TL word and phrase alignment within this corpus.",
        "PAM serves as a language-independent method for mapping corresponding terms within a language pair, by circumventing the problem of achieving compatibility between the outputs of two different parsers, one for the SL and one for the TL.",
        "PAM relies on a single parser for the one language and generates an appropriate phrasing model for the other language in an automated manner.",
        "The phrases are assumed to be flat and linguistically valid.",
        "As a parser, any available tool may be used (the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) is used in the present implementation for English).",
        "PAM processes a bilingual corpus of SL ?",
        "TL sentence pairs, taking into account the parsing information in one language (in the current implementation the TL side) and making use of a bilingual lexicon and information on potential phrase heads; the output being the bilingual corpus aligned at word, phrase and clause level.",
        "Thus, at a phrasal level, the PAM output indicates how an SL structure is transformed into the TL.",
        "For instance, based on a sentence pair from the parallel corpus, the SL sentence with structure A-B-C-D is transformed into A?-C?-D?-B?, where X is a phrase in SL and X?",
        "is a phrase in TL.",
        "Further PAM details are reported in Tambouratzis et al. (2011).",
        "The PAM output in terms of SL phrases is then handed over to the Phrasing model generator (PMG), which is trained to determine the phrasal structure of an input sentence.",
        "PMG reads the SL phrasing as defined by PAM and generates an SL phrasing model using a probabilistic methodology.",
        "This phrasing model is then applied in segmenting any arbitrary SL text being input to the PRESEMT system for translation.",
        "PMG is based on the Conditional Random Fields model (Lafferty et al., 1999) which has been found to provide the highest accuracy.",
        "The SL text segmented into phrases by PMG is then input to the 1st translation phase.",
        "For a new language pair, the PAM-PMG chain is implemented without any manual correction of outputs."

        "Typically, a monolingual corpus contains 3 billion words, 108 sentences and approximately 109 phrases.",
        "Since the models for the TL phrases need to be accessed in real-time to allow word reordering within each phrase, the module uses the phrase indexed representation of the monolingual corpus.",
        "This phrase index is created based on four criteria: (i) phrase type, (ii) phrase head lemma, (iii) phrase head PoS tag and (iv) number of tokens in the phrase.",
        "Indexing is performed by extracting all phrases from the monolingual corpus, each of which is transformed to the java object instance used within the PRESEMT system.",
        "The phrases are then organised in a hash map that allows multiple values for each key, using as a key the 4 aforementioned criteria.",
        "Statistical information about the number of occurrences of each phrase in the corpus is also included.",
        "Finally, each map is serialised and stored in the appropriate file in the PRESEMT path, with each file being given a suitable name for easy retrieval.",

        "Both phases involve searching for suitable matching patterns at two different levels of granularity, the first (coarse-grained) aiming at defining a TL-compatible ordering of phrases in the sentence and the second (fine-grained) determining the internal structure of phrases.",
        "While the first phase utilises the small bilingual corpus, the second phase makes use of the large monolingual corpus.",
