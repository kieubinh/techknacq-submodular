        "Their translation often depends on the exact relation signaled in context, a feature that current SMT systems were not designed to capture, hence their frequent mistranslations of connectives (see Section 2 below).",
        "In this paper, we present a series of experiments that aim to use, in SMT systems, data with automatically labeled discourse connectives.",
        "Section 3 first presents the data sets used in our experiments.",
        "We designed classifiers that attempt to assign sense labels to ambiguous discourse connectives, and their scores compare favorably with the state-of-the-art for this task, as shown in Section 4.",
        "In particular, we consider WordNet relations and temporal expressions as well as candidate translations of connectives as additional features (Section 4.2).",
        "However, our main goal is not the disambiguation of connectives per se, but the use of the labels assigned to connectives as additional input to an SMT system.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our experiments are the first attempts to combine connective disambiguation and SMT.",
        "Three solutions to this combination are compared in Section 5: modifying phrase tables, and training on data labeled manually, or automatically, with senses of connectives.",
        "We further show that a modified SMT system is best used when the confidence for a given label is high (Section 6).",

        "Despite less training data, in terms of BLEU, the difference to the respective baseline system (scores not shown in Table 3) is similar in both experimental settings: 19.78 vs. 20.11 for experiment 6 (automated annotation), compared to 22.43 vs. 22.76 for experiment 4 (manual annotation).",
        "Finally, we carried out two experiments (7 and 8) with Classifier PT+, which uses as additional features the translation candidates and has a higher accuracy than PT (Section 4.2).",
        "As a result, the translation of connectives (?Connectives) is indeed improved compared (respectively) to experiments 5 and 6, as it appears from lines 7?8 of Table 3.",
        "Also, the BLEU scores of the corresponding SMT systems are increased in experiments 7 vs. 5 and in 8 vs. 6, and are now equal to the baseline ones (for experiment 8: 20.14 vs. 20.11, or, bootstrapped, 21.55 vs. 21.55).",
        "The results of experiments 7/8 vs. 5/6 indicate that improved classifiers for connectives also improve SMT output as measured by ?Connectives, with BLEU remaining fairly constant, and therefore are worth investigating in more depth in the future.",
        "When comparing manual (experiments 3/4) vs. automated annotation (experiments 5/6/7/8) and their use in SMT, the differences in the scores (BLEU and ?Connectives) highlight a trade-off: manually annotated data used for training leads to better scores, but noisier and larger training data that is annotated automatically is an acceptable solution when manual annotations are not available."

        "As the PDTB was not completed at that time, the data sets and labels are not exactly identical to the ones that we used above (see Section 4).",
        "The disambiguation of senses signaled by discourse connectives can be seen as a word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem for functional words (as opposed to WSD for content words, which is more frequently studied).",

        "This is similar to our use of translation candidates as an additional feature for classification in Section 4.2.",
        "Then, the output of several classifiers based on linguistic features was weighed against the translation candidates output by the baseline SMT system.",

        "Ma et al. (2011) use a Maximum Entropy model to POS tag English collocational particles (e.g. come down/by, turn against, inform of ) more specifically than a usual POS tag-ger does (where only one label is given to all particles).",
