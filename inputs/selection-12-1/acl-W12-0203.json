      "text": [
        "In the last twenty years, distributional models of semantics have become the standard way of modeling lexical semantics in statistical NLP.",
        "These models, aka Semantic Vector Spaces (SVSs) or Word Spaces, capture word meaning in terms of frequency distributions of words over co-occurring context words in a large corpus.",
        "The basic assumption of the approach is that words occurring in similar contexts will have a similar meaning.",
        "Speficic implementations of this general idea have been developed for a wide variety of computational linguistic tasks, including Thesaurus extraction and Word Sense Disambiguation, Question answering and the modeling of human behavior in psycholinguistic experiments (see Turney and Pantel (2010) for a general overview of applications and speficic models).",
        "In recent years, Semantic Vector Spaces have also seen applications in more traditional domains of linguistics, like diachronic lexical studies (Sagi et al., 2009; Cook and Stevenson, 2010; Rohrdantz et al., 2011) , or the study of lexical variation (Peirsman et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we want to show how Semantic Vector Spaces can further aid the linguistic analysis of lexical semantics, provided that they are made accessible to lexicologists and lexicographers through a visualization of their output.",
        "Although all applications mentioned above assume that distributional models can capture word meaning to some extent, most of them use SVSs only in an indirect, black-box way, without an-alyzing which semantic properties and relations actually manifest themselves in the models.",
        "This is mainly a consequence of the task-based evaluation paradigm prevalent in Computational Linguistics: the researchers address a specific task for which there is a predefined gold standard; they implement a model with some new features, that usually stem from a fairly intuitive, common-sense reasoning of why some feature might benefit the task at hand; the new model is then tested against the gold standard data and there is an evaluation in terms of precision, recall and F-score.",
        "In rare cases, there is also an error analysis that leads to hypotheses about semantic characteristics that are not yet properly modeled.",
        "Yet hardly ever, there is in-depth analysis of which semantics the tested model actually captures.",
        "Even though task-based evaluation and shared test data sets are vital to the objective comparison of computational approaches, they are, in our opinion, not sufficient to assess whether the phenomenon of lexical semantics is modeled adequately from a linguistic perspective.",
        "This lack of linguistic insight into the functioning of SVSs is also bemoaned in the community itself.",
        "For example, Baroni and Lenci (2011) say that ?To gain a real insight into the",
        "abilities of DSMs (Distributional Semantic Models, A/N) to address lexical semantics, existing benchmarks must be complemented with a more intrinsically oriented approach, to perform direct tests on the specific aspects of lexical knowledge captured by the models?.",
        "They go on to present their own lexical database that is similar to Word-Net, but includes some additional semantic relations.",
        "They propose researchers test their model against the database to find out which of the encoded relations it can detect.",
        "However, such an analysis still boils down to checking whether a model can replicate predefined structuralist semantic relations, which themselves represent a quite impoverished take on lexical semantics, at least from a linguistic perspective.",
        "In this paper, we want to argue that a more linguistically adequate investigation of how SVSs capture lexical semantics, should take a step back from the evalution-against-gold-standard paradigm and do a direct and unbiased analysis of the output of SVS models.",
        "Such an analysis should compare the SVS way of structuring semantics to the rich descriptive and theoretic models of lexical semantics that have been developed in Linguistics proper (see Geeraerts (2010b) for an overview of different research traditions).",
        "Such an in-depth, manual analyis has to be done by skilled lexicolo-gists and lexicographers.",
        "But would linguists, that are traditionally seen as not very computationally oriented, be interested in doing what many Computational Linguists consider to be tedious manual analysis?",
        "The answer, we think, is yes.",
        "The last decade has seen a clear empirical turn in Linguistics that has led linguists to embrace advanced statistical analyses of large amounts of corpus data to substantiate their theoretical hypotheses (see e.g. Geeraerts (2010a) and other contributions in Glynn and Fischer (2010) on research in semantics).",
        "SVSs would be an ideal addition to those linguists?",
        "methodological repertoire.",
        "This creates the potential for a win-win situation: Computational linguists get an in-depth evaluation of their models, while theoretical linguists get a new tool for doing large scale empirical analyses of word meaning.",
        "Of course, one cannot just hand over a large matrix of word sim-ilaties (the raw output of an SVS) and ask a lexicologist what kind of semantics is ?in there?.",
        "Instead, a linguist needs an intuitive interface to explore the semantic structure captured by an SVS.",
        "In this paper, we aim to present exactly that: an interactive visualization of a Semantic Vector Space Model that allows a lexicologist or lexicographer to inspect how the model structures the uses of words."

        "SVSs can model lexical semantics on two levels: 1. the type level: aggregating over all occurrences of a word, giving a representation of a word's general semantics.",
        "2. the token level: representing the semantics of each individual occurrence of a word.",
        "The type-level models are mostly used to retrieve semantic relations between words, e.g. synonyms in the task of thesaurus extraction.",
        "Token-level models are typically used to distinguish between the different meanings within the uses of one word, notably in the task of Word Sense Disambiguation or Word Sense Induction.",
        "Lexicological studies on the other hand, typically combine both perspectives: their scope is often defined on the type level as the different words of a lexical field or the set of near-synonyms referring to the same concept, but they then go on to do a fine-grained analysis on the token level of the uses of these words to find out how the semantic space is precisely structured.",
        "In our study, we will also take a concept-centered perspective and use as a starting point the 218 sets of Dutch near-synonymous nouns that Ruette et al. (2012) generated with their type-level SVS.",
        "For each synset, we then implement our own token-level SVS to model the individual occurrences of the nouns.",
        "The resulting token-by-token similarity matrix is then visualized to show how the occurrences of the different nouns are distributed over the semantic space that is defined by the synset's concept.",
        "Because Dutch has two national varieties (Belgium and the Netherlands) that show considerable lexical variation, and because this is typically of interest to lexicologists, we will also differentiate the Netherlandic and Belgian tokens in our SVS models and their visualization.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In the next section we present the corpus and the near-synonym sets we used for our study.",
        "Section 4 presents the token-level SVS implemented for modeling the occurrences of the nouns",
        "in the synsets.",

        "The token-level SVS we used is an adaptation the approach proposed by Schu?tze (1998).",
        "He models the semantics of a token as the frequency distribution over its so-called second order co-occurrences.",
        "These second-order co-occurrences are the type-level context features of the (first-order) context words co-occuring with the token.",
        "This way, a token's meaning is still modeled by the ?context?",
        "it occurs in, but this context is now modeled itself by combining the type vectors of the words in the context.",
        "This higher order modeling is necessary to avoid data-sparseness: any token only occurs with a handful of other words and a first-order co-occurrence vector would thus be too sparse to do any meaningful vector comparison.",
        "Note that this approach first needs to construct a type-level SVS for the first-order context words that can then be used to create a second-order token-vector.",
        "In our study, we therefore first constructed a type-level SVS for the 573,127 words in our corpus with a frequency higher than 2.",
        "Since the focus of this study is visualization rather than finding optimal SVS parameter settings, we chose settings that proved optimal in our previous studies (Peirsman et al., 2008; Heylen et al., 2008; Peirsman et al., 2010).",
        "For the context features of this SVS, we used a bag-of-words approach with a window of 4 to the left and right around the targets.",
        "The context feature set was restricted to the 5430 words, that were the among the 7000 most frequent words in the corpus, (minus a stoplist of 34 high-frequent function words) AND that occurred at least 50 times in both the Netherlandic and Belgian part of the corpus.",
        "The latter was done to make sure that Netherlandic and Belgian type vectors were not dissimilar just because of topical bias from proper names, place names or words relating to local events.",
        "Raw co-occurrence frequencies were weighted with Pointwise Mutual Information and negative PMI's were set to zero.",
        "In a second step, we took a random sample of 100 Netherlandic and a 100 Belgian newspaper issues from the corpus and extracted all occurrences of each of the 476 nouns in the synsets described above.",
        "For each occurrence, we built a token-vector by averaging over the type-vectors of the words in a window of 5 words to the left",
        "and right of the token.",
        "We experimented with two averaging functions.",
        "In a first version, we followed Schu?tze (1998) and just summed the type vectors of a token's context words, normalizing by the number of context words for that token:",
        "where ~owi is the token vector for the i th occurrence of noun w and Cwi is the set of n type vectors ~cj for the context words in the window around that ith occurrence of noun w. However, this summation means that each first order context word has an equal weight in determining the token vector.",
        "Yet, not all first-order context words are equally informative for the meaning of a token.",
        "In a sentence like ?While walking to work, the teacher saw a dog barking and chasing a cat?, bark and cat are much more indicative of the meaning of dog than say teacher or work.",

        "In constructing the token vector ~owi for the ith occurrence of noun w , we now multiply the type vector ~cj of each context word with the PMI weight pmiwcj , and then normalize by the sum of the pmi-weights:",
        "The token vectors of all nouns from the same synset were then combined in a token by second-order-context-feature matrix.",
        "Note that this matrix has the same dimensionality as the underlying type-level SVS (5430).",

Our visualisation software package (see below) forced us to restrict ourselves to a 2 dimensional MDS solution for now, even tough stress levels were generally quite high (0.25 to 0.45).",
        "Future implementation may use 3D MDS solutions.",
        "Of course, other dimension reduction techniques than MDS exist: PCA is used in Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Du-mais, 1997) and has been applied by Sagi et al. (2009) for modeling token semantics.",

        "This usage-in-context allows the lexicologist to interpret the precise meaning of the occurrence of the noun.",
        "The plot itself is a 2D representation of the semantic distances between all tokens (as measured with a token-level SVS) and reflects how the synonyms are distributed over the ?semantic space?.",

        "Hovering over the bubbles and looking at the contexts, we can see that they indeed all refer to the concept COMPUTER SCREEN (See example contexts 1 to 3 in Table 2).",

        "We can make this stratification visible by changing the color coding of the bubbles to COUNTRY in the top right-hand drop-down menu.",

        "Indeed the youth leader meaning of monitor is only familiar to speakers of Belgian Dutch.",
        "Changing the color coding to the variable NEWSPAPER shows that the youth leader meaning is also typical for the popular, working class newspapers Het Laatste Nieuws (LN) and Het Nieuwsblad (NB) and is not prevelant in the Belgian highbrow newspapers.",

        "Our aim is not just to make SVS output easier to analyze for computer linguists.",
        "We also want to make SVSs accessible for lexicolo-gists and lexicographers with an interest in quantitative, empirical data analysis.",
        "Such cooperation brings mutual benefits: Computer linguists get access to expert evaluation of their models.",
        "Lexicologists and lexicographers can use SVSs to identify preliminary semantic structure based on large quantities of corpus data, instead of heaving to sort through long lists of unstructured examples of a word's usage (the classical concordances).",
        "To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first attempts to visualize Semantic Vector Spaces and make them accessible to a non-technical audience.",
        "Of course, this is still largely work in progress and a number of improvements and extensions are still possible.",
        "First of all, the call-outs for the bubbles in the Google Motion Charts were not designed to contain large stretches of text.",
        "Current corpus contexts are therefore to short to analyze the precise meaning of the tokens.",
        "One option would be to have pop-up windows with larger contexts appear by clicking on the call-outs.",
        "Secondly, we didn't use the motion feature that gave the charts its name.",
        "However, if we have diachronic data, we could e.g. track the centroid of a word's tokens in the semantic space through time and at the same time show the dispersion of tokens around that centroid8.",
        "Thirdly, in the current implementation, one important aspect of the black-box quality of SVSs is not dealt with: it's not clear which context features cause tokens to be similar in the SVS output, and, consequently, the interpreation of the distances in the MDS plot remains quite obscure.",
        "One option would be to use the cluster solutions, that are already available as color codable variables, and indicate the highest scoring context features that the tokens in each cluster have in common.",
        "Another option for bringing out sense-distinguishing context words was proposed by Rohrdantz et al. (2011) who use Latent Dirich-let Allocation to structure tokens.",
        "The loadings on these latent topics could also be color-coded in the chart.",
        "Fourthly, we already indicated that two dimensional MDS solutions have quite high stress values and a three dimensional solution would be better to represent the token-by-token similarities.",
        "This would require the 3D Charts, which are not currently offered by the Google Chart Tools.",
        "However both R and Matlab do have interactive 3D plotting functionality.",
        "Finally, and most importantly, the plots currently do not allow any input from the user.",
        "If we want the plots to be the starting point of an in-depth semantic analysis, the lexicologist should be able to annotate the occurrences with variables of their own.",
        "For example, they might want to code whether the occurrence refers to a laptop screen, a desktop screen or cell phone screen, to find out whether their is a finer-grained division of labor among the synonyms.",
        "Additionally, an evaluation of the SVS's performance might include moving wrongly positioned tokens in the plot and thus regroup tokens, based on the lexicologist's insights.",
        "Tracking these corrective movements might then be valuable input for the computer linguists to improve their models.",
