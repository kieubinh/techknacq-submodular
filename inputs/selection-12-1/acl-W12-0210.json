        "In the last few decades, dialectometry has emerged as a field of linguistics that investigates the application of statistical and mathematical methods in dialect research.",

        "The work presented here aims to apply dialec-tometric analysis and visualization techniques to a different type of raw data.",
        "We argue that classical dialectological survey data are word-aligned by design, whereas our data set, a comparable multidialectal corpus, has to be word-aligned by automatic algorithms.",
        "We proceed in two steps.",
        "First, we present a cognate identification algorithm that allows us to extract cognate word pairs from the corpus.",
        "Then, we measure how many of these cognate word pairs are identical.",
        "This ratio gives us a measure of dialectal distance between two texts that is then shown to correlate well with geographic distance.",
        "The visualization of the resulting data allows us to recover certain characteristics of the Swiss German dialect landscape.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, the multidialectal corpus is presented.",
        "We then discuss how this corpus differs from classical dialectological data, and how we can use techniques from machine translation to extract the relevant data (Section 3).",
        "In Section 4, we define dialect distance as a function of the number of cognate word pairs and identical word pairs.",
        "Both types of word pairs are in turn defined by different thresholds of normalized Levenshtein distance.",
        "Section 5 deals with the evaluation and visualization of the resulting data, the latter in terms of clustering and multidimensional scaling.",

        "Figures 5 and 6 show the values of each data point in grey levels for the two first dimensions obtained by multidimensional scaling.",
        "One observes that the localization of data points in Figure 4 closely corresponds to their geographic location (as illustrated in Figure 3): the major North-South divisions as well as some East-West divisions are clearly recovered.",
        "More surprisingly, the two main dimensions of multidimensional scaling correspond to diagonals in geographic terms.",
        "The first dimension (Figure 5) allows to distinguish Northwestern from Southeastern variants, while the second dimension (Figure 6) distinguishes Northeastern from Southwestern variants.",
        "Instead of +-shaped dialect divisions put forward by traditional dialectology, our approach rather finds X-shaped dialect divisions."

        "The resulting distance matrix has been analyzed with correlation measures, and visualized with clustering and multidimensional scaling techniques.",
        "The visualizations represent the main characteristics of the Swiss German dialect landscape in a surprisingly faithful way.",
        "The close relation obtained among texts from the same canton may suggest that the distance measure is biased towards proper nouns.",
        "For example, two Zurich German texts are more likely to use toponyms from the Zurich region than a Bernese German text.",
        "If there are many of these (likely identically pronounced) toponyms, the similarity value will increase.",
        "However, manual inspection of the relevant texts did not show such an effect.",
        "Region-specific toponyms are rare.",
        "The results suggest that a more fine-grained variant of Levenshtein distance might be useful.",
        "In the following paragraphs, we present several improvements for future work.",
        "The results suggest that a more fine-grained variant of Levenshtein distance might improve the precision and recall of the cognate detection algorithm.",
        "Notably, it has been found that vowels change more readily than consonant in closely related language varieties.",
        "In consequence, changing one vowel by another should be penalized less than changing a vowel by a consonant (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001).",
        "The same holds for accented vs. non-accented characters.",
        "Complex graphemes representing a single phoneme appear rather frequently in the Dieth transcription system (e.g. for long vowels) and should also be treated separately.",
        "We should also mention that the proposed method likely faces a problem of scale.",
        "Indeed, each word of each text has to be compared with each word of each text.",
        "This is only manageable with a small corpus like ours.",
        "We conclude by pointing out a limitation of this approach: the automatic alignment process based on the concept of cognate pairs obviously only works for phonetically related word pairs.",
        "This contrasts with other dialectometric approaches based on lexical differences, in whose data sets different lemmas have been aligned.",
        "Future work on the Archimob corpus shall add normalization and lemmatization layers.",
        "This information could be useful to improve word alignment beyond cognate pairs."
