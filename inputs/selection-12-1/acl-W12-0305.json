        "The main goal of the LELIE project is to produce an analysis and a piece of software based on language processing and artificial intelligence that detects and analyses potential risks of different kinds (first health and ecological, but also social and economical) in technical documents.",
        "We concentrate on procedural documents and on requirements (Hull et al. 2011) which are, by large, the main types of technical documents used in companies.",
        "Given a set of procedures (e.g., production launch, maintenance) over a certain domain produced by a company, and possibly given some domain knowledge (ontology, terminology, lexical), the goal is to process these procedures and to annotate them wherever potential risks are identified.",
        "Procedure authors are then invited to revise these documents.",
        "Similarly, requirements, in particular those related to safety, often exhibit complex structures (e.g., public regulations, to cite the worse case): several embedded conditions, negation, pronouns, etc., which make their use difficult, especially in emergency situations.",
        "Indeed, procedures as well as safety requirements are dedicated to action: little space should be left to personal interpretations.",
        "Risk analysis and prevention in LELIE is based",
        "on three levels of analysis, each of them potentially leading to errors made by operators in action: 1.",
        "Detection of inappropriate ways of writing:",
        "complex expressions, implicit elements, complex references, scoping difficulties (connectors, conditionals), inappropriate granularity level, involving lexical, semantic and pragmatic levels, inappropriate domain style, 2.",
        "Detection of domain incoherencies in procedures: detection of unusual ways of realizing an action (e.g., unusual instrument, equipment, product, unusual value such as temperature, length of treatment, etc.)",
        "with respect to similar actions in other procedures or to data extracted from technical documents, 3.",
        "Confrontation of domain safety requirements with procedures to check if the required safety constraints are met.",
        "Most industrial areas have now defined authoring recommendations on the way to elaborate, structure and write procedures of various kinds.",
        "However, our experience with technical writers shows that those recommendations are not very strictly followed in most situations.",
        "Our objective is to develop a tool that checks ill-formed structures with respect to these recommendations and general style considerations in procedures and requirements when they are written.",
        "In addition, authoring guidelines do not specify all the aspects of document authoring: our investigations on author practices have indeed identified a number of recurrent errors which are linguistic or conceptual which are usually not specified in authoring guidelines.",
        "These errors are basically identified from the comprehension difficulties encountered by technicians in operation using these documents to realize a task or from technical writers themselves which are aware of the errors they should avoid."

        "Risk management and prevention is now a major issue.",
        "It is developed at several levels, in particular via probabilistic analysis of risks in complex situations (e.g., oil storage in natural caves).",
        "Detecting potential risks by analyzing business errors on written documents is a relatively new approach.",
        "It requires the taking into account of most of the levels of language: lexical, grammatical and style and discourse.",
        "Authoring tools for simplified language are not a new concept; one of the first checkers was developed at Boeing1, initially for their own simplifyed English and later adapted for the ASD Simplified Technical English Specification2.",
        "A more recent language checking system is Acrolinx IQ by Acrolinx3.",
        "Some technical writing environments also include language checking functionality, e.g., MadPak4.",
        "Ament (2002) and Weiss (2000) developed a number of useful methodological elements for authoring technical documents and error identification and correction.",
        "The originality of our approach is as follows.",
        "Authoring recommendations are made flexible and context-dependent, for example if negation is not allowed in instructions in general, there are, however, cases where it cannot be avoided because the positive counterpart cannot so easily be formulated, e.g., do not dispose of the acid in the sewer.",
        "Similarly, references may be allowed if the referent is close and non-ambiguous.",
        "However, this requires some knowledge.",
        "Following observations in cognitive ergonomics in the project, a specific effort is realized concerning the well-formedness (following grammatical and cognitive standards) of discourse structures and their regularity over entire documents (e.g., instruction or enumerations all written in the same way).",
        "The production of procedures includes some controls on contents, in particular action verb arguments, as indicated in the second objective above, via the Arias domain knowledge base, e.g., avoiding typos or confusions among syntactically and semantically well-identified entities such as instruments, products, equipments, values, etc.",
        "There exists no real requirement analysis system based on language that can check the quality and the consistency of large sets of authoring recommendations.",
        "The main products are IBM Doors and Doors Trek5, Objecteering6, and Re-qtify7, which are essentially textual databases with advanced visual and design interfaces, query facilities for retrieving specific requirements, and some traceability functions carried out via predefined attributes.",
        "These three products also include a formal language (essentially based on attribute-value pairs) that is used to check some simple forms of coherence among large sets of requirements.",
        "The authoring tool includes facilities for French-speaking authors who need to write in English, supporting typical errors they make via ?language transfer?",
        "(Garnier, 2011).",
        "We will not address this point here.",
        "This project, LELIE, is based on the TextCoop system (Saint-Dizier, 2012), a system dedicated to language analysis, in particular discourse (including the taking into account of long-distance dependencies).",
        "This project also includes the Arias action knowledge base that stores prototypical actions in context, and can update them.",
        "It also includes an ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver 8 to check for various forms of incoherence and incompleteness.",
        "The kernel of the system is written in SWI Prolog, with interfaces in Java.",
        "The project is currently realized for French, an English version is under development.",
        "The system is based on the following principles.",
        "First, the system is parameterized: the technical writer may choose the error types he wants to be checked, and the severity level for each error type when there are several such levels (e.g., there are several levels of severity associated with fuzzy terms which indeed show several levels of fuzziness).",
        "Second, the system simply tags elements identified as errors, the correction is left to the author.",
        "However, some help or guidelines are offered.",
        "For example, guidelines for reformulating a negative sentence into a positive one are proposed.",
        "Third, the way errors are displayed can be customized to the writer's habits.",
        "We present below a kernel system that deals",
        "with the most frequent and common errors made by technical writers independently of the technical domain.",
        "This kernel needs an in-depth customization to the domain at stake.",
        "For example, the verbs used or the terminological preferences must be implemented for each industrial context.",
        "Our system offers the control operations, but these need to be associated with domain data.",
        "Finally, to avoid the variability of document formats, the system input is an abstract document with a minimal number of XML tags as required by the error detection rules.",
        "Managing and transforming the original text formats into this abstract format is not dealt with here."

        "errors found in technical documents In spite of several levels of human proofreading and validation, it turns out that texts still contain a large number of situations where recommendations are not followed.",

        "?",
        "Lexical aspects: fuzzy terms, inappropriate terms such as deverbals, light verb constructions or modals in instructions, detection of terms which cannot be associated, in particular via conjunctions.",
        "This requires typing lexical data.",
        "?",
        "Grammatical complexity: the system checks for various forms of negation, referential forms, sequences of conditional expressions, long sequences of coordination, complex noun complements, and relative clause embeddings.",

        "When a text is analyzed, the system annotates the original document (which is in our current implementation a plain text, a Word or an XML document): revisions are only made by technical writers.",
        "Besides tags which must be as explicit as possible, colors indicate the severity level for the error considered (the same error, e.g., use of fuzzy term, can have several severity levels).",
        "The most severe errors must be corrected first.",
        "At the moment, we propose four levels of severity: ERROR Must be corrected.",
        "AVOID Preferably avoid this usage, think about an alternative, CHECK this is not really bad, but it is recommended to make sure this is clear; this is also used to make sure that argument values are correct, when a non-standard one is found.",
        "ADVICE Possibly not the best language realization, but this is probably a minor problem.",
        "It is not clear whether there are alternatives.",
