        "The aim is to provide general linguistic patterns as used in objective written media and subjective speeches and blog posts, to help construct domain-independent templates for information extraction and opinion mining.",
        "Our hybrid approach combines statistical data along with linguistic knowledge to filter out irrelevant patterns.",
        "As resources for subjective classification are still limited for Portuguese, we use a parallel corpus and tools developed for English to build our subjective spoken corpus, through annotations produced for English projected onto a parallel corpus in Portuguese.",
        "A measure for the saliency of n-grams is used to extract relevant linguistic patterns deemed ?objective?",
        "and ?subjective?.",
        "Perhaps unsurprisingly, our contrastive approach shows that, in Portuguese at least, subjective texts are characterized by markers such as descriptive, reactive and opinionated terms, while objective texts are characterized mainly by the absence of subjective markers."

        "During the last few years there has been a growing interest in the automatic extraction of elements related to feelings and emotions in texts, and to provide tools that can be integrated into a more global treatment of languages and their subjective aspect.",
        "Most research so far has focused on English, and this is mainly due to the availability of resources for the analysis of subjectivity in this language, such as lexicons and manually annotated corpora.",
        "In this paper, we contrast the subjective and the objective aspects of language for Portuguese.",
        "Essentially, our approach will extract linguistic patterns (hopefully ?objective?",
        "for newspaper news items and ?subjective?",
        "for parliamentary speeches and blog posts) by comparing frequencies against a reference corpus.",
        "Our method is relevant for hybrid approaches as it combines linguistic and statistic information.",
        "Our reference corpus, the Reference Corpus of Contemporary Portuguese (CRPC)1, is an electronically based linguistic corpus of around 310 million tokens, taken by sampling from several types of written texts (literature, newspapers, science, economics, law, parliamentary debates, technical and didactic documents), pertaining to national and regional varieties of Portuguese.",
        "A random selection of 10,000 texts from the entire CRPC will be used for our experiment.",
        "The experiment flowchart is shown in Figure 1.",
        "We define as objective short news items from newspapers that reports strictly a piece of news, without comments or analysis.",
        "A selection of blog post items and short verbal exchanges between member of the European parliament will serve as subjective texts."

        "The task of extracting linguistic patterns for data mining is not new, albeit most research has so far dealt with English texts.",
        "Extracting subjective patterns represents a more recent and challenging task.",
        "For example, in the Text Analy",
        "sis Conference (TAC 2009), it was decided to withdraw the task of creating summaries of opinions, present at TAC 2008, the organizers having agreed on the difficulty of extracting subjective elements of a text and organize them appropriately to produce a summary.",
        "Yet, there is already some relevant work in this area which may be mentioned here.",
        "For opinions, previous studies have mainly focused in the detection and the gradation of their emotional level, and this involves three main subtasks.",
        "The first subtask is to distinguish subjective from objectives texts (Yu and Hatzi-vassiloglou, 2003).",
        "The second subtask focuses on the classification of subjective texts into positive or negative (Turney, 2002).",
        "The third level of refinement is trying to determine the extent to which texts are positive or negative (Wilson et al., 2004).",
        "The momentum for this type of research came through events such as TREC Blog Opinion Task since 2006.",
        "It is also worth mentioning recent efforts to reintroduce language and discursive approaches (e.g. taking into account the modality of the speaker) in this area (Asher and Mathieu, 2008).",
        "The approaches developed for automatic analysis of subjectivity have been used in a wide variety of applications, such as online monitoring of mood (Lloyd et al., 2005), the classification of opinions or comments (Pang et al., 2002) and their extraction (Hu an Liu, 2004) and the semantic analysis of texts (Esuli and Sebas-tiani, 2006).",
        "In (Mihalcea et al., 2007), a bilingual lexicon and a manually translated parallel corpus are used to generate a sentence classifier according to their level of subjectivity for Romanian.",
        "Although many recent studies in the analysis of subjectivity emphasize sentiment (a type of subjectivity, positive or negative), our work focuses on the recognition of subjectivity and objectivity in general.",
        "As stressed in some work (Banea et al., 2008), researchers have shown that in sentiment analysis, an approach in two steps is often beneficial, in which we first distinguish objective from subjective texts, and then classify subjective texts depending on their polarity (Kim and Hovy, 2006).",
        "In fact, the problem of distinguishing subjective versus objective texts has often been the most difficult of the two steps.",
        "Improvements in the first step will therefore necessarily have a beneficial impact on the second, which is also shown",
        "To build our subjective spoken corpus (more than 2,000 texts), we used a parallel corpus of English-Portuguese speeches2 and a tool to automatically classify sentences in English as objective or subjective (OpinionFinder (Riloff et al., 2003)).",
        "We then projected the labels obtained for the sentences in English on the Portuguese sentences.",
        "The original parallel corpus is made of 1,783,437 pairs of parallel sentences, and after removing pervasive short sentences (e.g. ?the House adjourned at ...?)",
        "or pairs of sentences with the ratio of their respective lengths far away from one (a sign of alignment or translation error), we are left with 1,153,875 pairs.",
        "A random selection of contiguous 20k pairs is selected for the experiment.",
        "The English sentences are submitted to OpinionFinder, which labels each of them as ?unknown?, ?subjective?",
        "or ?objective?.",
        "OpinionFinder has labelled 11,694 of the 20k sentences as ?subjective?.",
        "As our experiment aims at comparing frequencies between texts, we have automatically created segments of texts showing lexical similarities using Textiling (Hearst, 1997), leading to 2,025 texts.",
        "We haven't made any attempt to improve or evaluate OpinionFinder and Textiling performance.",
        "This strategy is sensible as parliamentary speeches are a series of short opinionated interventions by members on specific",
        "themes.",
        "The 11,694 subjective labels have been projected on each of the corresponding sentences of the Portuguese corpus to produce our final spoken corpus3.",
        "Note that apart from a bridge (here a parallel corpus) between the source language (here English) and the target language (here Portuguese), our approach does not require any manual annotation.",
        "Thus, given a bridge between English and the target language, this approach can be applied to other languages.",
        "The considerable amount of work involved in the creation of these resources for English can therefore serve as a leverage for creating similar resources for other languages.",
        "We decided to include a collection of blog posts as an additional source of subjective texts.",
        "We gathered a corpus of 1,110 blog posts using Boot-Cat4, a tool that allows the harvesting and cleaning of web pages on the basis of a set of seed terms5.",
        "For our treatment of objectivity and how news are reported in Portuguese newspapers, we have collected and cleaned a corpus of nearly 1500 articles from over a dozen major websites (Jornal de Not?",
        "?cias, Destak, Visa?o, A Bola, etc.).",
        "After tokenizing and POS-tagging all sentences, we collected all n-grams (n = 1, 2 and 3) along with their corresponding frequency for each corpus (reference (CRPC), objective (news items) and subjective (parliamentary speeches and blog posts)), each gram being a combination of a token with its part-of-speech tag (e.g. falar V,",
        "Portuguese as can be, we constraint BootCat to extract pages written in Portuguese from the following web domains: communidades.net, blogspot.com, wordpress.",
        "com and myspace.com.",
        "We used the following seed words, more or less strongly related to the Portuguese culture: ribatejo, camo?es, queijo, vinho, cavaco, europa, sintra, praia, porto, fado, pasteis, bacalhau, lisboa, algarve, alen-tejo and coelho."

        "This kind of analysis aims essentially at the identification of salient expressions (with high log-odds ratio scores).",
        "The log-odds ratio method (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004) compares the frequency of occurrence of each n-gram in a specialized corpus (news, parliamentary speeches or blogs) to its frequency of occurrence in a reference corpus (CRPC).",
        "Applying this method solely on POS, we found that objective texts used predominantly verbs with an emphasis on past participles (PPT/PPA, adotado, ?adopted?",
        "), which is consistent with the nature of reported news.",
        "In general, we observed that subjective texts have a higher number of adjectives (ADJ, o?timo, ?optimum?",
        "): parliamentary speeches also include many infinitives (INF, fe-licitar ?congratulate?",
        "), while blogs make use of interjections (ITJ, uau, ?wow?).",
        "Tables 1, 2 and 3 show salient expressions for each type of texts.",
        "These expressions do not always point to a distinction between subjectivity and objectivity, but also to topics normally associated with each type of texts, a situation particularly acute in the case of parliamentary speeches.",
        "Nevertheless, we can make some very general observations.",
        "There is no clear pattern in news items, except for a slight tendency towards the use of a quantitative terminology (?save?, ?spend?).",

        "This is the approach taken in (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) for English.",
        "In Riloff and Wiebe (2003), the patterns for English involved a very detailed linguistic analysis, such as the detection of grammatical functions as well",

        "Without the proper resources needed to produce sophisticated linguistic annotations for Portuguese, we decided to simplify matters slightly by not making distinction of grammatical function or voice.",
        "That is, only NPs would matter for our analysis.",
        "We used the NP-chunker Yamcha6 trained on 1,000 manually annotated (NPs and POS-tags) sentences.",
        "The main idea here remains the same and is to find a set of syntactic patterns that are relevant to each group of texts, as we did for n-grams previously, each NP becoming a single 1-gram for this purpose.",
        "It is worth mentioning that NP-chunking becomes particularly challenging in the case of blogs, which are linguistically heterogeneous and noisy.",
        "Finally, log-odds ratio once again serves as a discriminative measure to highlight relevant patterns around NPs.",
