        "The linking process must thereafter evaluate which readings are the most probable, based on the most likely entity matches inferred from a similarity measure with the context.",
        "NER has been widely addressed by symbolic, statistical as well as hybrid approaches.",
        "Its major part in information extraction (IE) and other NLP applications has been stated and encouraged by several editions of evaluation campaigns such as MUC (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1998), the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) or ACE (Doddington et al., 2004), where NER systems show near-human performances for the English language.",
        "Our system aims at benefitting from both symbolic and statistical NER techniques, which have proven efficient",
        "but not necessarily over the same type of data and with different precision/recall tradeoff.",
        "NER considers the surface form of entities; some type disambiguation and name normalization can follow the detection to improve the result precision but do not provide referential information, which can be useful in IE applications.",
        "EL achieves the association of NER results with uniquely identified entities, by relying on an entity repository, available to the extraction system and defined beforehand in order to serve as a target for mention linking.",
        "Knowledge about entities is gathered in a dedicated knowledge base (KB) to evaluate each entity's similarity to a given context.",
        "After the task of EL was initiated with Wikipedia-based works on entity disambiguation, in particular by Cucerzan (2007) and Bunescu and Paşca (2006), numerous systems have been developed, encouraged by the TAC 2009 KB population task (McNamee and Dang, 2009).",
        "Most often in EL, Wikipedia serves both as an entity repository (the set of articles referring to entities) and as a KB about entities (derived from Wikipedia infoboxes and articles which contain text, metadata such as categories and hyperlinks).",
        "Zhang et al. (2010) show how Wikipedia, by providing a large annotated corpus of linked ambiguous entity mentions, pertains efficiently to the EL task.",
        "Evaluated EL systems at TAC report a top accuracy rate of 0.80 on English data (McNamee et al., 2010).",
        "Entities that are unknown to the reference database, called out-of-base entities, are also considered by EL, when a given mention refers to an entity absent from the available Wikipedia articles.",
        "This is addressed by various methods, such as setting a threshold of minimal similarity for an entity selection (Bunescu and Paşca, 2006), or training a separate binary classifier to judge whether the returned top candidate is the actual denotation (Zheng et al., 2010).",
        "Our approach of this issue is closely related to the method of Dredze et al. in (2010), where the out-of-base entity is considered as another entry to rank.",
        "Our task differs from EL configurations outlined previously, in that its target is entity extraction from raw news wires from the news agency Agence France Presse (AFP), and not only linking relying on gold NER annotations: the input of the linking system is the result of an automatic NER step, which will produce errors of various kinds.",

        "Therefore, the results of our system are comparable to previous work when considering a setting where the NER output is in fact the gold annotation of our evaluation data, i.e., when all mention queries should be linked to an entity.",
        "Without modifying the parameters of our system (i.e., no deactivation of false matches predictions), we obtain an accuracy of 0.76, in comparison with a TAC top accuracy of 0.80 and a median accuracy of 0.70 on English data.8 It is important to observe that our data consists only in journalistic content, as opposed to the TAC dataset which included various types of corpora.",

        "This comes among other things from the fact that a small number of popular entities constitute the majority of NE mention occurrences.",
        "In most systems, EL is performed over noisy 8As explained previously, these figures, as well as the ones presented later on, cannot be compared with the 0.90 score obtained by the naive linker which we used for the entity KB acquisition.",
        "This score is obtained only on mentions identified by the SXPipe/NP system with the correct span and type, whereas our system does not consider the mention type as a contraint for the linking process, and on correct identification of a match in or outside of Aleda.",
        "NER output and participates to the final decisions about NEs extractions.",
        "Therefore the ability of our system to correctly detect entity mentions in news content is estimated by computing its precision, recall and f-measure.",
        "The EL accuracy, i.e., the rate of correctly linked mentions, is measured over the subset of mentions whose reading was adequately selected by the final ranking.",
