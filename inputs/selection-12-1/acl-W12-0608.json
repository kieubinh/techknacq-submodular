        "Social media has enabled web users to interact through social platforms, express their opinions, comment and review various products/items.",
        "Such user-generated content has been analysed from a social as well as content-oriented point of view.",
        "For instance, social network analysis techniques have been used to identify user roles (Agarwal et al., 2008; Domingos and Richardson, 2001; Fisher et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007) and text or opinion mining techniques have been applied to identify positive/negative tendencies within user online review comments (Ding and Liu, 2007; Ghose et al., 2007; Hu and Liu, 2004; Leskovec et al., 2010).",
        "In the applicative context, recommender systems (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005) make use of the opinion information (such as in star-rating systems) and recommend items (movies, products, news articles, etc.)",
        "or social elements (i.e. propositions to connect with other people or communities), that are likely to be of interest to a specific user.",
        "Typically, a recommender system compares a user profile with some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the ?preference?",
        "or ?rating?",
        "that a user would give to an item not yet considered.",
        "These characteristics may be part of the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach).",
        "Comments published on social networking or review web sites are sometimes used by recommender systems (Aciar et al., 2007; Jakob et al., 2009) in order to find out similarities between users that comment on the same items in the same way.",
        "However, extracting explicit semantic information carried out in these comments (e.g. ?this printer is slow?)",
        "is of great interest in order to detect what a user has liked or disliked about a given topic (e.g. the speed of the printer) and consequently take it into account to make recommendations.",
        "In this paper, we propose the extraction of opinions and suggestions from user reviews or free text and their use as input information to improve recommender systems.",
        "This technique could be used on top of standard recommender techniques in order to further fine-grain the recommendation according to the user comments.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no existing approach takes advantage of the fine-grained opinions or suggestions the user explicitly expresses using natural language within a review or a free text.",
        "As aforementioned, some works consider the product reviews as a means to get user opinions on certain products and use this information for recommendation purposes.",
        "Nevertheless, they all assign a polarity (?negative?",
        "or ?positive?)",
        "to",
        "the review or they update the rating (e.g. giving a value from 1 to 5) without going further down exploiting the exact phrases.",
        "More particularly they do not detect what aspects of the product have been appreciated or not.",
        "For example, no approach considers using the user-stated phrase ?I would prefer a lighter camera?",
        "in order to recommend to a user a camera that satisfies all the desired features and on top of this being lighter than the reviewed one.",
        "The paper continues with a state-of-the art discussion.",
        "Section 3 is divided into two parts; a description of the methodology followed in order to extract opinion information from reviews through NLP techniques and a description of how this information is used for recommending product items.",
        "Section 4 shows an example and Section 5 presents a first attempt of an evaluation.",

        "Identifying the opinion of customer reviews has concerned different research communities.",
        "Some significant works infer opinion polarities based on comparisons with a predefined seed-list of adjectives (Ding and Liu, 2007; Hu and Liu, 2004) or implicitly through observing the changes in the respective product prices of reputation systems (Ghose et al., 2007).",
        "An attempt of extracting suggestions (and not just opinions) from customer reviews has also been presented in (Vishwanath and Aishwarya, 2011), in which ontologies and feedback rules are used for this purpose.",
        "Combining knowledge of opinions extracted from reviews and recommender systems has also some applications.",
        "For example, (Jakob et al., 2009), have analysed opinions of movie reviews.",
        "They use predefined categories of movie features (acting, production, soundtrack, cinematography and storyline), and they assign polarities (negative or positive) to each category according to the per-feature opinion words expressed for each review.",
        "For example, if a movie review contains the sentence ?the acting is flat?, they assign a negative polarity to the category ?acting?",
        "and they just avoid recommending the specific movie to the users.",
        "They do not explicitly use the opinion information in order to make comparisons with similar movies and propose one ?less flat?",
        "to the user.",
        "Similarly to (Jakob et al., 2009), most research works that use opinion information for recommendation purposes consider only the polarity and not the explicit semantics of the opinions.",
        "For instance, in (Aciar et al., 2007) or (Poirier, 2011) they assign a kind of ?rating?",
        "on each review regarding the product.",
        "Comparisons are not included.",
        "(Sun et al., 2009) include opinion-based and feature-based comparisons in order to recommend products to users.",
        "Their approach takes into account a whole set of reviews (as opposed to individual ones) and it involves no NLP parsing.",
        "The opinions are aggregated into a sentiment value and this value points out mainly whether a product feature is better or not when it comes to comparing different models of the same product.",
        "NLP techniques have, in some cases, been used for recommendation.",
        "As an example, in the paper of (Chai et al., 2002) the user can ?chat?",
        "with the system in order to describe what type of product she desires, receiving in return a list of recommended products.",
        "Although, in this case, comparisons between products take place in the database, opinion identification is not included.",
        "The user neither expresses a complaint nor she suggests an improvement, thus, no opinion detection takes place."

        "These semantic relations are intermediary steps to instantiate the five place predicates which are compliant with the aforementioned model.",

        "This means that the content of a review, even if it is spam, will not be used in order to provide recommendations for another review."
