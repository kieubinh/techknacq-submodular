        "TMs are ?the new Latent Semantic Analysis?",
        "(LSA), (Deerwester et al., 1990), and it has been shown that generative models like pLSI and LDA not only have a better mathematical foundation rooted in probability theory, but also outperform LSA in document retrieval and classification, e.g. (Hof-mann, 2001; Blei et al., 2003; Biro et al., 2008).",
        "To estimate the model parameters in LDA, the exact computation that was straightforward in LSA (matrix factorization) is replaced by a randomized Monte-Carlo sampling procedure (e.g. variational Bayes or Gibbs sampling).",
        "Aside from the main parameter, the number of topics or dimensions, surprisingly little attention has been spent to understand the interactions of hyperparameters, the number of sampling iterations in model estimation and interference, and the stability of topic assignments across runs using different random seeds.",
        "While progress in the field of topic modeling is mainly made by adjusting prior distributions (e.g. (Sato and Nakagawa, 2010; Wallach et al., 2009)), or defining more complex model mixtures (Heinrich, 2011), it seems unclear whether improvements, reached on intrinsic measures like perplexity or on application-based evaluations, are due to an improved model structure or could originate from suboptimal parameter settings or literally ?bad luck?",
        "due to the randomized nature of the sampling process.",
        "In this paper, we address these issues by systematically sweeping the parameter space.",
        "For this, we pick LDA since it is the most commonly used TM in the field of NLP.",
        "To evaluate the contribution of the TM, we choose the task of TS: this task has received considerable interest from the NLP community, standard datasets and evaluation measures are available for testing, and it",
        "has been shown that this task considerably benefits from the use of TMs, see (Misra et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2008; Eisenstein, 2009).",
        "This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we present related work regarding text segmentation using topic models and topic model parameter evaluations.",
        "Section 3 defines the Top-icTiling text segmentation algorithm, which is a simplified version of TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), and makes direct use of topic assignments.",
        "Its simplicity allows us to observe direct consequences of LDA parameter settings.",
        "Further, we describe the experimental setup, our application-based evaluation methodology including the data set and the LDA parameters we vary in Section 4.",
        "Results of our experiments in Section 5 indicate that a) there is an optimal range for the number of topics, b) there is considerable variance in performance for different runs for both model estimation and inference, c) increasing the number of sampling iterations stabilizes average performance but does not make TMs more robust, but d) combining the output of several independent sampling runs does, and additionally leads to large error rate reductions.",
        "Similar results are obtained by e) the mode method with less computational costs using the most frequent topic ID that is assigned during different inference iteration steps.",
        "In the conclusion, we give recommendations to add stability and robustness for TMs: aside from optimization of the hyperparameters, we recommend combining the topic assignments of different inference iterations, and/or of different independent inference runs."

        "should be optimized for the task at hand, as the utility of the topic model is very sensitive to this parameter.",
        "?",
        "While the number of iterations for model estimation and inference needed for convergence is depending on the number of topics, the size of the sampling unit (document) and the collection, it should be noted that after convergence the variance between different sampling runs does not decrease for a larger number of iterations.",
        "Equipped with the insights gained from experiments on single parameter variation, we were able to implement a very simple algorithm for text segmentation that improves over the state of the art on a standard dataset by a large margin.",
        "At this, the combination of the optimal ?, and a high number of inference repetitions r and the mode method (d = true) produced slightly more errors than a high r alone.",
        "While the purpose of this paper was mainly to address robustness and stability issues of topic models, we are planning to apply the segmentation algorithm to further datasets.",
        "The most important takeaway, however, is that especially for small sampling units like sentences, tremendous improvements in applications can be obtained when looking at multiple inference assignments and using the most frequently assigned topic ID in subsequent processing ?",
        "either across diffeent inference steps or across diffeent inference runs.",
        "These two new strategies seem to be able to offset suboptimal hyperparameters to a certain extent.",
        "This scheme is not only applicable to Text Segmentation, but in all applications where performance crucially depends on stable topic ID assignments per token.",
        "Extensions to this scheme, like ignoring tokens with a high topic variability (stop words or general terms) or dynamically deciding to conflate several topics because of their per-token co-occurrence, are left for future work."
