      "text": [
        "There has been considerable discussion about the challenges imposed by Multiword Expressions (MWEs) which in addition to crossing word boundaries act as a single lexical unit at some levels of linguistic analysis (Calzolari et al., 2002; Sag et al., 2002; Fillmore, 2003).",
        "They include a wide range of grammatical constructions such as verb-particle constructions (VPCs), idioms, compound nouns and listable word configurations, such as terminology and formulaic linguistic units (Wray, 2009).",
        "Depending on the definition, they may also include less traditional sequences like copy of in They gave me a copy of the book (Fillmore et al., 1988), greeting formulae like how do you do?, and lexical bundles such as I dont know whether or memorized poems and familiar phrases from TV commercials (Jackendoff, 1997).",
        "These expressions may have reduced syntactic flexibility, and be semantically more opaque so that their semantics may not be easily inferred from their component words.",
        "For instance, to play down X means to (try to) make X seem less important than it really is and not literally a playing event.",
        "These expressions may also breach general syntactic rules, sometimes spanning phrasal boundaries and often having a high degree of lex-icalisation and conventionality.",
        "They form a complex of features that interact in various, often untidy, ways and represent a broad continuum between non-compositional (or idiomatic) and compositional groups of words (Moon, 1998).",
        "In addition, they are usually sequences or groups of words that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance, and have been argued to appear in the same order of magnitude in a speaker's lexicon as the simplex words (Jackendoff, 1997).",
        "In terms of language acquisition difficulties may arise as the interpretation of these expressions often demands more knowledge than just about (1) unitary words and (2) word-to-word relations.",
        "This introduces a distinction between what a learner is able to computationally disambiguate or figure out automatically from language and what must be explicitly stored/memorized and retrieved whole from memory at the time of",
        "use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar (Wray, 2009, p. 9).",
        "Yet, according to Fillmore et al. (1988), in an ideal learning environment, most of the knowledge about how to use a language should be computable while explicitly memorized sequences should be kept to a minimum.",
        "Due to these idiosyncrasies they have been noted as easily phonetically mislearned: e.g. by and large mistaken for by in large, to all intents and purposes for to all intensive purposes, and an arm and a leg for a nominal egg (Fillmore, 2003).",
        "For second language (L2) learners in particular (Wray, 2002) MWEs are indeed a well-known cause of problems and less likely to be used by them than by native speakers in informal spoken contexts (Siyanova and Schmitt, 2007).",
        "Even if L2 learners may be capable of producing a large number of MWEs, their underlying intuitions and fluency do not match those of native speakers (Siyanova and Schmitt, 2008) and they may produce marked combinations that are not conventionally used together (e.g. plastic surgery/?operation, strong/?powerful tea) (Pearce, 2002; Siyanova and Schmitt, 2007).",
        "Given the potential additional sources of complexity of MWEs for learning, in this paper we investigate whether children shy away from using them when they communicate.",
        "We focus on a particular type of MWEs, VPCs, which present a wide range of syntactic and semantic idyosin-crasies examining whether children produce proportionally less VPCs than adults.",
        "In addition, we analyze whether any potential added processing costs for VPCs are reflected in a reduced choice of VPCs or verbs to form these combinations in child-produced sentences compared to adult usage.",
        "Finally, given the possibility of flexible word orders in VPCs with the verb and particle not only occurring adjacently but also with an NP object between them, we compare these two groups in terms of distances between the verb and the particle in these combinations, to determine whether there is a preference for a joint or a split configuration and if children and adults adopt distinct strategies for their usage.",
        "By profiling the VPC usage by children our aim is to provide the basis for a computational modeling of the acquisition of these constructions.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: in section 2 describes VPCs and related works; section 3 presents the resources and methods used in this paper.",
        "The analyses of VPCs in children and adults sentences are in section 4.",
        "We finish with conclusions and possibilities of future works."

        "VPCs are combinations of verbs and prepositional (up, down, ...), adverbial (away, back,...), adjectival (short,...) or verbal (go, be,...) particles, and in this work we focus on VPCs with prepositional or adverbial particles like put off and move on.",
        "From a language acquisition perspective, the complexity of VPCs arises from their wide syntactic as semantic variability.",
        "Syntactically, like simplex verbs, VPCs can occur in different subcategorisation frames (e.g. intransitive in break down and transitive in print NP up).",
        "However, the type of verb and the number of arguments of a VPC seem to have an impact in learning as both children with typical development and with specific language impairments (SLI) seem to use obligatory arguments and inflectional morphology more consistently with general all purpose verbs, like make, go, do, put, than with more specific verbs.",
        "Moreover, as the number of obligatory arguments increases children with SLI seem to produce more general and fewer specific verbs (Boynton-Hauerwas, 1998).",
        "Goldberg (1999b) refers to these verbs as light verbs, suggesting that due to their frequency of use, they are acquired earlier by children, and subsequently act as centers of gravity from which more specific instances can be learnt.",
        "These verbs are very common and frequent in the everyday communication, that could be used in place of more specialized instances (e.g. make instead of build).",
        "In transitive VPCs there is the additional difficulty of the particle appearing in different word orders in relation to the verb: in a joint configuration, adjacent to the verb (e.g. make up NP) or in a split configuration after the NP complement (make NP up) (Lohse et al., 2004).",
        "While some VPCs can appear in both configurations, others are inseparable (run across NP), and a learner has to successfully account for these.",
        "Gries (2002) using a multifactorial analysis to investigate 25 variables that could be linked to particle placement like size of the direct object (in syllables and words), type of NP (pronoun or lexical), type of determiner (indefinite or definite).",
        "For a set",
        "of 403 VPCs from the British National Corpus he obtains 84% success in predicting (adult) native speakers?",
        "choice.",
        "Lohse et al. (2004) propose that these factors can be explained by considerations of processing efficiency based on the size of the object NP and on semantic dependencies among the verb, the particle, and the object.",
        "In a similar study for children Diessel and Tomasello (2005) found that the type of the NP (pronoun vs lexical NP) and semantics of the particle (spatial vs non-spatial) were good predictors of placement on child language data.",
        "Semantically, one source of difficulties for learners comes from the wide spectrum of compo-sitionality that VPCs present.",
        "On one end of the spectrum some combinations like take away compositionally combine the meaning of a verb with the core meaning of a particle giving a sense of motion-through-location (Bolinger, 1971).",
        "Other VPCs like boil up are semi-idiomatic (or aspec-tual) and the particle modifies the meaning of the verb adding a sense of completion or result.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, idiomatic VPCs like take off, meaning to imitate have an opaque meaning that cannot be straightforwardly inferred from the meanings of each of the components literally.",
        "Moreover, even if some verbs form combinations with almost every particle (e.g., get, fall, go,...), others are selectively combined with only a few particles (e.g., book and sober with up), or do not combine well with them at all (e.g., know, want, resemble,...) (Fraser, 1976).",
        "Although there are some semi-productive patterns in these combinations, like verbs of cooking and the aspectual up (cook up, boil up, bake up), and stative verbs not forming VPCs, for a learner it may not be clear whether an unseen combination of verb and particle is indeed a valid VPC that can be produced or not.",
        "Sawyer (1999) longitudinal analysis of VPCs in child language found that children seem to treat aspectual and compositional combinations differently, with the former being more frequent and employing a larger variety of types than the latter.",
        "The sources of errors also differ and while for compositional cases the errors tend to be lexical, for aspectuals there is a predominance of syntactic errors such as object dropping, which accounts for 92% of the errors in split configuration for children under 5 (Sawyer, 1999).",
        "Children with SLI tended to produce even more object dropping errors for VPCs than children with typical development, despite both groups producing equivalent numbers of VPCs (Juhasz and Grela, 2008).",
        "Given that compositionality seems to have an impact on learning, to help reduce avoidance of phrasal verbs Sawyer (2000) proposes a semantic driven approach for second language learning where transparent compositional cases would be presented first to help familiarization with word order variation, semi-idiomatic cases would be taught next in groups according to the contribution of the particle (e.g telicity or completive-ness), and lastly the idiomatic cases that need to be memorized.",
        "In this paper we present a wide coverage examination of VPC distributions in child produced and child-directed sentences, comparing whether children reproduce the linguistic environment to which they are exposed or whether they present distinct preferences in VPC usage."

        "For these candidates with non-alphabetic characters, like @ in a@l up, were removed as were those that did not involve verbs (e.g. di, dat,), using the Comlex Lexicon as reference for verb validity (Macleod and Grishman, 1998).",

        "The analyses reported in this paper use these sentences, and the distribution of VPCs per children age group is shown in table 2.",

        "For these, the individual frequencies of the verb, the particle and the VPC are collected separately in the children set and in the adult set, using the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010).",
        "acquisition of VPCs is reflected in their reduced presence in child-produced than in child-directed sentences, we compare the proportion of VPCs in the Children and Adults Sets, table 3.",
        "In absolute terms adults produced more than double the number of VPCs that children did.",
        "However, given the differences in size of the two sets, in relative terms there was a similar proportion of VPC usage in these corpora for each of the groups: 7.95% of the sentences produced by children contained VPCs vs 8.38% of those by adults.",
        "Moreover, the frequencies with which these VPCs are used by both children and adults reflects the Zipfian distribution found for the use of words in natural languages, with a large part of the VPCs occurring just once in the data, table 4.",
        "In addition, in terms of frequency, children's production of VPCs resembles that of the adults.",
        "Another possible source of divergence between children and adults is in the lexical variety found in VPCs.",
        "The potential difficulties with VPCs may be manifested in children producing a reduced repertoire of VPCs or using a smaller set of verbs to form these combinations.",
        "As shown in table 3, adults, as expected, employ a larger VPC vocabulary with 1.56 more types than children.",
        "However, an examination of the distributions of types reveals that they only differ by a scale.",
        "As a result when children frequencies are multiplied by a factor of 2.16, which corresponds to the ratio between VPC tokens used by adults and children (table 3), the resulting distribution has a very",
        "good match with the adult distribution, see figure 1.",
        "Therefore, the lower number of VPC types used by children can be explained totally by the lower number of sentences they produced, and the hypothesis that difficulties in VPCs would lead to their avoidance is not confirmed by the data.",
        "Nonetheless, there is a discrepancy between the distributions found for the higher frequency VPCs.",
        "Children have a more uniform distribution and adults tend to repeat more often the higher frequency combinations (top left corner of figure 1).",
        "An evidence that this discrepancy is particular for high frequency VPCs, and not their constituent verbs, is shown in figure 2.",
        "This figure displays the rank plot for the verbs present in the VPCs, for both adults and children.",
        "The same scale factor used in figure 1 is applied to compensate for the lower number of VPC sentences in the children set.",
        "This time the match is extraordinary, spanning the whole vocabulary.",
        "It is important to verify if the same VPCs and verbs are present in the both vocabularies, and further if their orders in the ranks are similar.",
        "The two groups have very similar preferences for VPC usage, with a Kendall ?",
        "score of 0.63 which indicates that they are highly correlated, as Kendall ?",

        "We examined (a) if children's VPC ranks followed their verb ranks, (b) if adults VPC ranks followed their verb ranks and (c) if children's VPC ranks followed adults?",
        "verb ranks.",
        "The resulting Kendall scores were around 0.2 for all three cases.",
        "Moreover, if the lower frequency VPCs are removed to avoid potential cases of noise, the Kendall ?",
        "score for VPCs by adults and children increases with the threshold, second line from the top in Figure 3, while it remains constant for all the other cases.",
        "As an example, the top 10 VPC types used by children and adults are listed in table 5.",
        "From these, 9 out of the 10 are the same differing only in the order in which they appear.",
        "Most of these combinations are listed in one of the dictionaries used for evaluation: 72% for adults and 75.87% for children.",
        "When a threshold of at least 5 counts is applied these values go up to 87.72% for adults and 79.82% for children, as would be expected.",
        "This indicates that besides any possible lack of coverage for child-directed VPCs in the lexicons or noise, it is in the lower frequency combinations that novel and domains specific non-standard usages can be found.",
        "Some",
        "of the combinations not found in these dictionaries include crawl in and creep up by adults and erase off and crash down by children.",
        "Finally, despite adults having a larger verb vocabulary used in VPCs than children, the two groups have similar ratios of verb per VPCs: 2.81 VPCs for children and 2.79 for adults, table 6.",
        "The top verbs used in VPCs types are also responsible for very frequent VPC tokens (e.g. go, get, come, take, put, make and move) accounting for 5.83% VPC types and 43.76% tokens for adults and 7.02% of the types and 47.81% of the tokens for children, confirming the discrepancy discussed earlier.",
        "These are very general verbs and some of the most frequent in the data, reported among the first to be learned (Goldberg, 1999a) which may facilitate their acquisition and use in VPCs.",
        "Comparing VPC types used by children and by adults, this trend is confirmed: a large proportion (72.32%) of the VPC types that children use is also used by adults, Children ?",
        "Adult in table 6.",
        "When low frequency VPCs types are removed, this proportion increases (89.48%).",
        "Moreover, when the VPCs used only by the adults are considered, most of these (93.44%) occur with frequency lower than 5.",
        "This suggests that children tend to follow quite closely the combinations employed by adults, and the lower frequency cases may not yet be incorporated in their active vocabulary.",
        "In terms of the distance between verb and particle, there is a strong preference in the data for joint combinations for both children and adults, table 7.",
        "For the split cases, the majority contains only one word between the verb and the particle.",
