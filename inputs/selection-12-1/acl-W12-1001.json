        "Processing tools as well as linguistic studies of historical language need language resources, which have to be developed separately for each language, and manually annotated or validated.",
        "The two basic resource types are hand-annotated corpora and lexica for historical language, which should contain (at least) information about the modern-day equivalent of a word form and its lemma and part-of-speech (PoS).",
        "The first of these is useful for easier reading of historical texts, as well as for enabling already developed modern-day PoS tagging and lemmatisation models to be applied to historical texts.",
        "PoS tags make for a better environment for linguistic exploration and enable further levels of annotation, such as treebanking.",
        "They also facilitate lemmatisation, which is especially useful for highly inflecting languages as it abstracts away from the inflectional variants of words, thereby enabling better text searching.",
        "To develop such resources, a good editor is needed that caters to the peculiarities of historical texts.",
        "Preferably it would combine the production of annotated corpora and corpus-based lexica.",
        "This paper presents CoBaLT, a Web-based editor which has already been used for developing language resources for several languages.",
        "We describe it within the framework of developing a gold-standard annotated reference corpus (Erjavec, 2012) and a large lexicon of historical Slovene.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: in the next section we describe the implementation and functionality of CoBaLT.",
        "In Section 3 we present the input and output corpus and lexicon formats, in particular from the perspective of our project.",
        "In Section 4 we compare existing tools serving a similar purpose to CoBaLT and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the CoBaLT environment.",
        "The last section summarizes and lists our conclusions."

        "The left side of the middle part shows the (selected) historical word forms with their corpus frequencies.",

        "Finally, on the right-hand side, all the possible lexical annotations of the word form are given; those in bold have been validated.",
        "3.",
        "The separator between the middle and lower parts shows who has worked last on the selected word form, and gives icons for sorting the word forms in context in the lower part according to a number of criteria: word form, right and left context, analysis and verification.",

        "The tool currently accepts plain text and a parameterisation of TEI P5 XML (TEI Consortium, 2007).",
        "The latter option is more interesting for our case, as TEI files can already be structurally and linguistically annotated.",
        "Zip files are also supported, which enables uploading large datasets with many separate files.",

        "Such annotation is imported into CoBaLT but not displayed or modified, and appears again only in the export.",

        "The difference between normalised and cited forms is that cited forms are the exact word forms as they appear in the corpus, while the normalised ones are lower-cased, and, in the case of Slovene, have vowel diacritics removed as these are not used in contemporary Slovene and are furthermore very inconsistently used in historical texts.",

        "The export script can be limited as to how many usage examples get exported, as in the case of a fully annotated corpus the number of attestations for high-frequency words (typically function words) can easily go into the thousands, and there is little point in including all of them in the",

      "text": [
        "First, it should be noted that CoBaLT is not limited to working with corpora of historical language ?",
        "it could also be used for non-standard language varieties (e.g. tweets) or for standard contemporary language, by slightly modifying the import/export and the parsing of the word annotation in the editor.",
        "Nevertheless, it incorporates several features that make it particularly suitable for handling historical texts: ?",
        "CoBaLT supports both corpus annotation and corpus-based lexicon construction; extensive lexica are, at least from the point of view of good processing of historical language, much more important than annotated corpora.",
        "?",
        "The texts of historical corpora are typically first produced by optical character recognition (OCR) software and then manually corrected.",
        "In spite of corrections, some errors will invariably remain in the text and will be, for the most part, noticed during the annotation process.",
        "While not meant for major editing of the transcription, CoBaLT does offer the possibility to correct the transcription of individual words.",
        "This is a rare functionality in other annotation editors, which typically take the base text as read-only.",
        "The current version of CoBaLT offers support for editing, splitting, and joining word tokens.",
        "Deleting word forms altogether, however, is not supported ?",
        "an option that should be added in the future.",
        "?",
        "Related to the previous point is CoBaLT's feature to display the facsimile of a particular page, making it possible to check the transcription or OCR result against the original image of the page.",
        "As regards the functioning of the tool, it is important to note that almost all linguistic processing occurs outside of CoBaLT making it more lightweight as well as more language independent.",
        "In previous work (Erjavec et al., 2010) a different editor was used which had linguistic processing built in and proved to be more difficult to adapt to Slovene than CoBaLT.",
        "In this particular project we decided to organise the files around the concept of a facsimile page.",
        "This has a number of advantages, in particular a straightforward mapping between files and facsimile images, a simple unit of sampling for the corpus, and small files, which makes it easier to manage the work of annotators.",
        "However, this",
        "arrangement causes some problems from a linguistic point of view, namely that the page will often start or end in the middle of a paragraph, sentence or even word.",
        "We decided to start and end each page with a paragraph or sentence boundary, while split words are marked by a special PoS tag.",
        "It should be noted that this is used only at page-breaks ?",
        "split words at line-breaks are joined before importing the texts into CoBaLT.",
        "From a user-interface perspective, a distinguishing feature of CoBaLT is that there is a single editor window, with keyboard shortcuts making the jumps between the parts of the screen faster than moving a mouse, allowing for quick and efficient editing.",
        "Adding or deleting a number of analyses is also just a click away.",
        "This again makes the tool very efficient but also means that the user has to be quite careful not to accidentally destroy already existing annotations ?",
        "this proved to be a problem in the annotation round.",
        "From an implementation standpoint, we should note that the level of security offered by CoBaLT is limited.",
        "Only a user name is needed to log in and have access to the data.",
        "While this can be easily circumvented by placing the entire interface behind a secure page, a higher level of security, e.g. just adding passwords to the login procedure, should be implemented in the future.",
        "On the other hand, access should not be too restricted, as simple access does allow for easy crowdsourcing."

        "However, human annotators usually have a hard time working in XML directly to revise word-level annotations and transcription errors.",
