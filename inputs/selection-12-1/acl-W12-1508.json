        "Personality describes characteristics which are central to human behaviour, and has implications for social interactions: It can affect performance on collaborative processes, and can increase engagement when incorporated within virtual agents (Hernault et al., 2008).",
        "In addition, personality has also been shown to influence linguistic style, both in written and spoken language (Pennebaker and King, 1999; Gill and Oberlander, 2002).",
        "Whilst individuals often possess individual styles of self-expression, such as those influenced by personality, in a conversation they may align or match the linguistic style of their partner: For example, by entraining, or converging, on a mutual vocabulary.",
        "Such alignment is associated with increased familiarity, trust, and task success (Shepard et al., 2001).",
        "People also adjust their linguistic styles when interacting with computers, and this affects their perceptions of the interaction (Porzel et al., 2006).",
        "However, when humans ?",
        "or machines ?",
        "are faced with a choice of matching the language of their conversational partner, this often raises a conflict: matching the language of an interlocutor may mean subduing one's own linguistic style.",
        "Better understanding these processes relating to language choice and interpersonal perception can inform our knowledge of human behaviour, but also have important implications for the design of dialogue systems and user interfaces.",
        "In this paper, we present and evaluate novel automated natural language generation techniques, via the Critical Agent Dialogue system version 2 (CRAG 2), which enable us to generate dynamic, short-term alignment effects along with stable, long-term personality effects.",
        "We use it to investigate the following questions: Can personality be accurately judged from short, automatically generated dialogues?",
        "What are the effects of alignment between characters?",
        "How is the quality of the characters?",
        "relationship perceived?",
        "Additionally, in our evaluation study we examine perceptions of the different forms of alignment present in the dialogues, for example at the word, phrase or polarity levels.",
        "In the following we review relevant literature, before describing the CRAG 2 system and experimental method, and then presenting our results and discussion."

      "text": [
        "Researchers from several traditions have studied aspects of similarity in dialogue, naming it: entrainment, alignment, priming, accommodation, coordination or convergence.",
        "For current purposes, we gloss over some important differences, and borrow the term ?alignment?, because we will go on to adopt Pickering and Garrod's theoretical mechanisms in our system.",
        "Alignment usually means that if something has happened once in a dialogue (for instance, referring to an object as a vase), it is likely to happen again?and hence, alternatives become less likely (for instance, referring to the same object as a jug) (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).",
        "From this view, interlocutors align the representations they use in production and comprehension and the process is an automatic, labour-saving device, but there are of course limits to periods over which alignment processes operate; in corpus studies long-term adaptation predicts communicative success (Reitter, 2008).",
        "Alternative approaches view similarity as a process of negotiation leading to the establishment of common ground (Brennan and Clark, 1996), or a relatively conscious process resulting from attraction (Shepard et al., 2001).",
        "Although increased similarity (convergence) is generally regarded positively, it can sometimes arise during disagreement (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002), with cultural differences influencing both convergence and perceptions of others (Bortfeld and Brennan, 1997).",
        "Wizard-of-Oz studies have also shown convergence with a natural language interface (Brennan, 1996; Porzel et al., 2006).",
        "Embodied conversational agents (Cassell et al., 2000) are implemented computer characters that exhibit multimodal behaviour; the technology can be exploited to give life to automatically generated scripted dialogues and to make them more engaging (van Deemter et al., 2008; Hernault et al., 2008).",
        "Aspects of the agents?",
        "personalities and their interests can be preconfigured and affect their dialogue strategies; the generation is template-based.",
        "A common way to describe personality is using the Big Five traits: Extraversion (preference for, and behav-ior in, social situations); Neuroticism (tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings); Openness (reflects openness to new ideas); Agreeableness (how we tend to interact with others); and Conscientiousness (how organised and persistent we are in pursuing our goals).",
        "Relationships between personality dimensions and language use appear to be robust: For instance, in monological writing (essays and e-mails) high Extraverts use more social words, positive emotion words, and express more certainty; high Agreeableness scorers use more first person singular and positive emotion words, and fewer articles and negative emotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999; Gill and Oberlander, 2002).",
        "Personality can not only be projected through, but also perceived from, asynchronous textual communication.",
        "The extraversion dimension is generally perceived most accurately in a variety of contexts, while it was more difficult for raters to recognise neuroticism (Gill et al., 2006; Li and Chignell, 2010) Taking into account the difference between the language actually used by people with certain personality, and the language which others expect them to use, natural language generation (NLG) systems can exploit either to project personality.",
        "Perhaps the closest previous work to what we present here is the Personality Generator (PERSONAGE) (Mairesse and Walker, 2010) which mapped psychological findings relating to the personality to the components of the NLG system (e.g., content planning, sentence planning and realisation).",
        "Evaluation by human raters showed similar accuracy in perception of extraversion in the generated language compared with human-authored texts.",
        "There is evidence that computer users attribute personality to interfaces, and rate more highly those interfaces that exploit language associated with the user's own personality, and become more similar to the user over time (Isbister and Nass, 2000).",
        "We now turn to describing our automated natural language generation techniques, implemented in CRAG 2, followed by a description of our experimental method and evaluation."

        "We now discuss the perception and evaluation results of the CRAG 2 system in greater detail.",
        "In terms of personality perception, extraversion is accurately perceived, with agreeableness and conscientiousness less so, which matches findings from personality perception studies in other contexts, including text based computer-mediated communication (Li and Chignell, 2010; Gill et al., 2006).",
        "It is interesting to note, however, that alignment helps perception of conscientiousness, but hurts ratings of agreeableness.",
        "Reduced accuracy in perception of agreeableness, which is important to relationships, may have a negative impact on the use of dialogues in collaborative settings (Rammstedt and Schupp, 2008).",
        "Further work could usefully examine ways in which these characteristics can be generated in more readily perceptible ways.",
        "Interestingly, personality perception is unaffected by whether the judges are native English speakers or not.",
        "This is a notable finding, and apparently implies that the social information relating to personality is available in the text only environment, or through the generation process, it is equally accessible to native and non-native English speakers.",
        "Native speaking judges were more critical in rating dialogue smoothness and characters getting on, perhaps indicating a finer-grained awareness of linguistic cues in interpersonal interaction, or else just greater confidence in making negative judgements of their native language.",
        "Our finding that our generated alignment actually decreases the perceived positivity of the relationship is contrary to what is generally predicted by the literature (Brennan and Clark, 1996; Shepard et al., 2001; Pickering and Garrod, 2004); but cf. Nieder-hoffer and Pennebaker (2002).",
        "Likewise, we would also have expected the dialogues with alignment to have been perceived to have gone more smoothly.",
        "However, in our evaluation of the different types of alignment, we note that alignment per se is not necessarily a bad thing: Generally alignment of Polarity, Topic, and Construction are seen positively leading to higher ratings of ?getting on?, ?smoothness?, and increased accurate perception of Agreeableness; repetition of individual words is however viewed negatively, and leads to lower ratings of ?getting on?",
        "and ?smoothness?.",
        "There are a number of possible explanations for these negative responses to our generated dialogue alignment.",
        "They hinge on understanding what is involved in generating alignment, or similar behaviour, in dialogue participants.",
        "First, it could be that our dialogues encode the ?wrong?",
        "type of similarity.",
        "For example, the alignment and entrainment approaches to similarity usually study task-based dialogues, which often focus on establishing a shared vocabulary for referencing objects (i.e., at the word level).",
        "In such cases, the similarity arises either through priming mechanisms, or the establishment of common ground.",
        "Given that we used an alignment model to generate similarity in our dialogues, this kind of repetition or similarity may seem incon-gruent or out of place in dialogues that are not task-based (cf. negative impact of word-level alignment).",
        "A second explanation might be that similarity relates to positive outcomes when it occurs over a longer, rather than shorter, period of time (Reit-ter, 2008).",
        "In the current study the dialogues consisted of eight turns, thus similarity was not generated over a long period.",
        "Indeed, linguistic similarity over a longer period of time may be more consistent with perceptions of social similarity, such as in-group, rather than outgroup, membership (Shepard et al., 2001).",
        "Indeed, in such contexts word choice is an important feature in dialogue and would be useful to incorporate into a dialogue model to simulate ingroup membership.",
        "Third, in communication accommodation theory it is ?convergence?",
        "?",
        "the process of increasing similarity between interlocutors ?",
        "which is important, rather than similarity alone.",
        "In the current study, convergence was not examined since the dialogues were generated with static levels of alignment.",
        "So how do these findings relate back to the area of dialogue generation for applied contexts?",
        "Similarly to findings for the PERSONAGE system (Mairesse and Walker, 2010), personality in our generated dialogues is perceived with similar accuracy to the way humans perceive personality of other humans.",
        "This suggests that our CRAG 2 system can create believable characters to whom the user can potentially relate while auditing the dialogues, or using a dialogue-based interface.",
        "That alignment can have negative effects on dialogue perception we propose is due to the form of alignment depicted in these generated dialogues (i.e., task-based nature emphasising similarity at the word level), rather than alignment in general.",
        "We do not take this result to necessarily indicate that alignment in generated dialogues should be avoided.",
        "Rather, its implementation should be carefully considered, especially to ensure that the form of similarity achieved makes sense in the communicative context.",
        "Indeed, as we show in the evaluation of the generated dialogues, alignment at the Polarity, Topic, and Construction levels is generally viewed positively, however in contrast alignment at the Word level tends to be viewed more negatively.",
        "One of the key suggestions arising from this study is that the different forms of dialogue similarity cannot simply be used interchangeably, with alignment found in task-based dialogues which may include many instances of word-level repetition and alignment not necessarily appropriate in non-task dialogues, and thus not automatically resulting in perceptions of positivity.",
        "We note that non-native speakers were more forgiving in their ratings of the dialogues containing alignment.",
        "Given that they were equally able to perceive the personality of the characters, this may be due to non-native speakers having fewer expectations of alignment behaviour in dialogue.",
        "Indeed in some contexts, greater alignment, and thus repetition, may be beneficial for non-native speakers auditing dialogues.",
        "To conclude, personality in our generated dialogues was perceived with comparable accuracy to human texts, but alignment or similarity between speakers ?",
        "especially at the word level ?",
        "regarded negatively.",
        "We would like to see future work examine further the responses to different forms of alignment, including convergence, in generated dialogue."
