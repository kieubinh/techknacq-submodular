        "In the current study of tutorial dialogue we describe here, we seek to identify the most pedagogically valuable ways in which a tutor incorporates a student's contribution into his turn so that we can implement these in a tutorial dialogue system.",
        "In educational research, two teaching techniques that have ?The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant R305A100163 to the University of Pittsburgh.",
        "The opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the Institute or the U.S. Department of Education.",
        "been shown to benefit students, Accountable Talk (O?Connor and Michaels, 1993) and Questioning the Author (Beck et al., 1996), both train teachers to make use of a number of discussion moves that react to student contributions.",
        "One such move that is shared by both teaching techniques is revoic-ing.",
        "Revoicing is characterized as a reformulation of what the student said with the intention of expressing it in a way that most of the student's fellow classmates will be able to make sense of it and elaborate upon it.",
        "In the case of Accountable Talk it also includes the intent that the teacher attempt to relinquish authority on the topic under discussion.",
        "This is done by not evaluating the student contribution and instead inviting the student to assess the teacher's reformulation.",
        "In tutorial dialogue, the pedagogical intention of revoicing cannot be exactly the same.",
        "However, a reformulation that invites the student to assess it may retain some of the benefits of classroom revoicing.",
        "This is something we intend to test as part of our research.",
        "A step we are taking towards such a test is to look at what reformulations appear in tutorial dialogue and then attempt to characterize the tutor intentions that may be associated with them.",
        "In some applied contexts, such as second language learning, reformulations are more narrowly defined as using different words while keeping the content semantically equivalent.",
        "However, research in pragmatics takes a broader view of reformulation.",
        "In a corpus study of lectures that examined reformulation markers such as ?in other words,?",
        "?that is?",
        "and ?i.e.?",
        "and also endeavored to consolidate the findings from previous linguistics studies, the range of",
        "intentions identified include, among others, definition, denomination, specification, explanation, correction and consequence (Murillo, 2008).",
        "In our preliminary characterization of reformulations in naturalistic tutorial dialogue, we will use this broader definition and will test whether a tutor contribution is a reformulation of what the student said by checking the felicity of inserted reformulation markers such as ?in other words.?",
        "Two recent studies of tutorial dialogue specifically recognize revoicing.",
        "The first study (Chi and Roy, 2010) examines face to face naturalistic tutorial dialogue in which a tutor is helping a student work through a physics problem.",
        "They suggest that when the tutor repeats part of what the student said, it is often done with the intention of providing positive feedback for correct answers and call this revoicing as with the excerpt below which is repeated from (Chi and Roy, 2010) .",
        "S: First the gravity is pulling down T: Pulling it down.",
        "[Tutor revoiced.]",
        "S: Weight is..the mass times..acceleration due to gravity and that's force.",
        "T: Right.",
        "Right.",
        "S: Ok. T: So weight is the force.",
        "[Tutor revoiced.]",
        "Given the limited context of these transcribed excerpts it is difficult to argue that these are revoicings in the sense of Accountable Talk (AT).",
        "There are no implicit or explicit invitations, such as a question mark, to assess the tutor's contributions.",
        "While it is possible in the first example that the tutor understood the student to be making a generic statement and was adding ?it?",
        "to apply it to the particular problem under discussion, it is also possible they have the shared goal of identifying and summing all the forces on a particular object and the tutor is just acknowledging understanding.",
        "The second example seems to draw attention to what is most important in what the student just said.",
        "In AT and Questioning the Author (QtA), this type of move is called marking instead of revoicing.",
        "A marking is a reformulation that emphasizes what is most important in what the student said and attempts to direct the student to focus his/her continued discussion on the reformulation.",
        "Although neither of these examples are revoicings in the sense of AT and the first seems more like a repetition to acknowledge rather than reformulate, both are still important to consider for tutorial dialogue.",
        "They may help lessen the student's cognitive load (Walker, 1996) by drawing attention to what is most important in what the student said (Becker et al., 2011).",
        "The other recent study of tutorial dialogue that considers revoicing collected a corpus using human tutors who were trained to use QtA and who fill in for a conversational virtual tutor in a science education system (Becker et al., 2011).",
        "This corpus has been annotated along multiple dimensions.",
        "Two discussion moves from QtA, revoicing and marking, which are noted to be frequent in this corpus, are included in the dialogue act dimension along with other more general speech acts.",
        "However, there is no stated goal to annotate other reformulations.",
        "So we do not know what other intentions associated with reformulations may appear in the corpus.",
        "In addition, the authors?",
        "description of revoicing differs from that used in AT.",
        "Here, it is a reformulation that is meant to help a student who is struggling with a particular concept.",
        "As shown in the annotated example of revoicing repeated below from (Becker et al., 2011), authority is not relinquished and the student is not invited to assess the reformulation.",
        "S33: well when you scrub the the paperclip to the magnet the paperclip is starting to be a magnet [Answer/Describe/Process] T34: very good, so if the magnet gets close to the paperclip it picks it up [Feedback/Positive/None, Revoice/None/None] A range of reformulations are recognized in other work on tutorial dialogue and have been incorporated into tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "In AutoTutor (Person et al., 2003), elaboration and summary involve reformulation.",
        "In Circsim-Tutor (Freedman, 2000), student answers that are close to correct except for terminology trigger a reformulation.",
        "Finally, in Beetle II (Dzikovska et al., 2008), restatements of correct and near correct answers involve reformulations.",
        "In our work we wish to identify a more comprehensive set of reformulation types and intentions and determine which of these types are most beneficial to emulate.",
        "In this paper we examine a corpus of naturalistic human tutorial dialogues for tutor reformulations.",
        "We further outline our plans for implementing revoicing and reformulation in our tutorial dialogue system, Rimac (Katz et al., 2011), which engages high school physics students in post problem solving reflective discussions.",
        "By implementing reformulations and revoicings we can begin to test their impact on student learning in a more controlled way in addition to testing whether our approximations of them are adequate.",
        "First, we will describe the corpus of human tutorial dialogues we are analyzing and then we will present examples of some of the reformulations we have found in the corpus and speculate upon possible tutor intentions for these reformulations.",

        "To understand how we propose to implement reformulations, we must begin with a high level description of the current Rimac system.",
        "To build Rimac, we used the TuTalk (Jordan et al., 2007) natural language (NL) tutorial dialogue toolkit.",
        "This toolkit enables system developers to focus on developing the content to be presented to students and rapidly developing an end-to-end system for conducting experiments that determine what content and presentation is most pedagogically effective.",
        "Tutorial dialogue system developers can gradually transition towards a more principled dialogue system as questions of pedagogical effectiveness are answered, since core modules such as NL understanding and generation are designed to be replaced or supplemented as needed.",

        "Each state represents a tutor turn.",
        "The arcs leaving the state correspond to all classifications of a student's response turn.",
        "When creating a state, the author enters the NL text for a tutor's turn and enters the NL text that defines several classes of student responses as transition arcs, and indicates which state each arc leads to.",
        "An arc can also push to another finite state network.",
        "In this toolkit, the NL text associated with a state or an arc is represented by a concept definition.",
        "In the simplest case, a concept is a set of NL phrases.",

        "?Well, not exactly,?",

        "How the reformulation is presented depends on the quality or confidence of the concept match.",
