        "Conservation of wildlife is an objective to which considerable effort is devoted by governments and NGOs across the world.",
        "A variety of web-based approaches can help make the natural world more accessible to the public, which in turn may translate into greater public support for nature conservation initiatives.",
        "The present paper explores the role of Natural Language Generation (NLG) in bringing up-to-date information about wild animals in their natural environment to nature enthusiasts.",
        "We focus on the reintroduction of the red kite to the UK.",
        "This member of the raptor family was once widespread in the UK, but prolonged and intense persecution led to its near extinction.",
        "Since 1989, efforts have been ongoing to reintroduce this species in various locations across the country.",
        "We are working together with one of the largest nature conservation charities in Europe to use NLG for public engagement around a small number of satellite-tagged reintroduced red kites.",
        "The public engagement activities surrounding this reintroduction initiative have two subtly different objectives: (i) to communicate ecological insights to increase awareness about the species, and (ii) to create a positive image of the reintroduced species to harness public support for the reintroduction.",
        "Currently, data from these satellite tags are being used by the charity to manually create blogs such as: ...Ruby (Carrbridge) had an interesting flight down to Loch Duntelchaig via Dochfour on the 6th March before flying back to the Drumsmittal area, spending the 10th March in the Loch Ussie area (possibly also attracted by the feeding potential there!)",
        "and then back to Drumsmittal for the 13th...",
        "Such blogs are used by schools which have adopted individual kites, and pupils can read these texts alongside a map plotting the GPS locations of ?their?",
        "kite.",
        "As can already be seen from the above, there is currently little ecological information about the species in these blogs.",
        "Because of the perceived importance of education to the success of reintroductions, there is a clear desire to include more ecological insights.",
        "Yet, time and resource limitations have prevented the charity from doing so; they perceive the writing of such blogs already as very time consuming, and indeed, rather mundane.",
        "In this paper, we explore the use of blogs based on satellite tag data for communicating ecological insights and creating a positive image of a species.",
        "We consider both aspects, deemed essential for a successful species reintroduction, and focus on how the blogs can be made more informative than those currently being written by the charity."

        "There is some work on the use of data-to-text for lay audiences; e.g., generating narratives from sensor data for automotive (Reddington et al., 2011) and environmental (Molina et al., 2011) applications, generating personal narratives to help children with complex communication needs (Black et al., 2010), and summarising neonatal intensive care data for parents (Mahamood et al., 2008).",
        "Our application differs from the above-mentioned data-to-text applications, in that we aim to generate inspiring as well as informative texts.",
        "It bears some resemblance to NLG systems that offer ?infotainment?, such as Dial Your Disc (Van Deemter and Odijk, 1997) and Ilex (O?Donnell et al., 2001).",
        "In fact, Dial Your Disc, which generates spoken monologues about classical music, focused emphatically on generating engaging texts, and achieved linguistic variation through the use of recursive, syntactically structured templates (see also, Theune et al. (2001)).",

        "by constructing narratives around their patterns of movement.",
        "We require individual locations of a bird to be explained in the context of its wider spatial use, and the ecological interpretations thereof.",
        "This paper has the following goals:",
        "1.",
        "To illustrate how satellite tag data can be analysed to identify behavioural patterns for use in generating blogs (content selection); 2.",
        "To test whether blogs written by an ecologist based on such data analysis can be used to educate as well as create a positive perception of the species; 3.",
        "To investigate the challenges for NLG in automating the generation of such blogs.",
        "4 Data analysis for identifying behaviours",
        "From an NLG perspective, our interest in automating the generation of blogs from satellite tag data is in making these narratives more interesting, by using the data to illustrate key aspects of red kite behaviour.",
        "To illustrate how we can relate the data to behaviours, we provide two graphical views of GPS fixes from a tagged red kite.",
        "Fig.",
        "1(a) shows how far a focal kite is located from its nest over the course of a year.",
        "We propose to use such data to construct narratives around ecological insights regarding the exploratory behaviours of red kites during their first year after fledgling.",
        "Fig.",
        "1(b) shows the same GPS data, but now spatially, thereby plotting latitude against longitude of all fixes without regard to time.",
        "This portrayal highlights the kite's favoured locations (indicated in different colours based on a MATLAB cluster analysis which automatically estimates the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model,",
        "even when clusters overlap substantially), as well as its broad range.",
        "These plots illustrate two key aspects of kite behaviour: exploration and site-fidelity (the presence of favoured locations that the kite tends to return to).",
        "In addition, we are interested in communicating various feeding behaviours as well as that, unlike many other birds of prey, red kites are social birds, often found in groups.",
        "Feeding and social behaviours cannot be directly identified from the data.",
        "However, they can often be inferred; for instance, a red kite spending its time by the side of a main road is likely to be looking to scavenge on road kill.",
        "5 Study on engaging readers using blogs We now report a study that explores whether such ecological insights can be effectively communicated through blogs constructed around an individual of the species, and whether such blogs can help create a positive perception of the species in a reader's mind.",
        "This study was based on a text manually constructed by an ecologist based on five weeks of data such as in Fig 1 from a red kite named ?Red Baroness?.",
        "For this study, the data was mapped onto a simplified world with seven features: a lake, a shoreline, fields, a road, a moor, a forest and a river.",
        "A sample of the text is shown in Figure 2 for illustration.",
        "Week 2: How different the pattern of movements of Red Baroness was this week!",
        "On Monday, she shot off past Bleak Moor, on her longest journey so far north-east of the lake.",
        "She appeared not to find much of interest there, and on the next day she was observed combing the edges of Green Park, possibly in search of a group of birds resting in the top half of the trees.",
        "The bird was clearly restless however, as on Thursday she was observed following River Rapid, downstream for further than she had been last month, finally stopping when she reached Blue Lake again."

        "The experiment was conducted in a lab in a supervised setting.",

        "Q4 Write your email if you wish to be sent more blogs.",

        "The other two ecological concepts were not mentioned explicitly in the blog that participants read, but needed to be inferred.",
        "Around a quarter of participants managed to infer the notion of site fidelity",
        "(23%), the most difficult of the concepts, and 41% inferred exploratory behaviour.",
        "39% provided their email address to receive further blogs (the only real commitment), and an equal number expressed willingness to contribute money for red kite conservation efforts.",
        "85% expressed willingness to sign a campaign against rat poisoning, and 61% wanted increased government spending for red kite conservation.",
        "We detected a correlation between recall/inference of behaviours and willingness to engage (plotting total number of behaviours recalled/inferred by each participant against the total number of engagement questions answered affirmatively, rpearson = 0.31; p < 0.005; n = 80).",
        "One interpretation of this result is that greater insights into the life of this bird has positively influenced the reader's perceptions of it.",
        "Further qualitative studies are needed to substantiate this, but we view this result as evidence in favour of incorporating ecological insights into the blogs.",
        "Table 1 shows the big five personality traits assigned to Red Baroness by participants.",
        "The BFI is constructed such that being non-committal about the 44 trait questions would result in scores of 3.",
        "The ability of readers to assign human personality traits (significantly different from 3.0) to the red kite indicates a willingness to anthromorphise the bird.",
        "The last column shows the average personality of 21 year old humans (from Srivastava et al. (2003)), which is the same age group as our participants.",
        "The values for extroversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness are very similar, and the kite has lower neuroticism and openness."
