        "We try to address this issue by extending the IBM HMM model with an extra hidden layer which represents the senses a word can take, allowing similar words to share similar output distributions.",

        "Modern machine translation is dominated by statistical methods, most of which are trained on word-aligned parallel corpora (Koehn et al., 2007; Koehn, 2004), which need to be generated separately.",
        "One of the most commonly used methods to generate these word alignments is to use the IBM models 1-5, which generate one-directional alignments.",
        "Although the IBM models perform well, they fail to take into account certain situations.",
        "For example, if an alignment between two words f1 and e1 is considered, and f1 is an uncommon translation for e1, the translation probability will be low.",
        "It might happen, that an alignment to a different nearby word is preferred by the model.",
        "Consider for example the situation where f1 is ?taal?",
        "(Dutch, meaning language), and e1 is ?tongue?.",
        "The translation probability for this may be low, as ?tongue?",
        "usually translates as ?tong?, meaning the body part.",
        "In this case the preference of the alignment model may dominate, leading to the wrong alignment.",
        "Moreover, the standard tools for word alignment fail to make use of the lexical resources that already exist, and which could contribute useful information for the task.",
        "In particular, the ontology defined in WordNet (Miller, 1995) could be put to good use.",
        "Intuitively, the translation of a word should depend on the sense of the word being used.",
        "The current work seeks to explore this idea, by explicitly mod-eling the senses in the translation process.",
        "It does so, by modifying the HMM alignment model to include synsets as an intermediate stage of translation.",
        "This would facilitate sharing of translation distributions between words with similar senses that should generate the correct sense.",
        "In terms of the example above, one of the senses for ?tongue?",
        "will share the translation distribution with ?language?, for which we will have more relevant translation probabilities.",
        "As well as performing word alignment this model can be used to generate sense annotations on one side of a parallel corpus, given an alignment, or even generate sense annotations while aligning a corpus.",
        "Thus, the model could learn to align a corpus and do WSD at the same time.",
        "In this paper, the effect the usage of senses has on alignment is investigated, and the potential usefulness of the model for WSD is explored.",
        "In the next section related work is discussed, after which in section 3 the current model is",
        "discussed.",
        "In section 4 the evaluation of the model is discussed, in two parts.",
        "In the first part, the model is evaluated for English-French on gold standard manually aligned data and compared to the results of the base HMM model.",
        "In the second part, the model is qualitatively evaluated by inspecting the senses and associated output distributions of selected words."

        "Although most researchers agree that Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a useful field, it hasn't been shown to consistently help in related tasks.",
        "Machine Translation is no exception, and whether or not WSD systems can improve performance of MT systems is debated.",
        "Furthermore, it is unclear how parallel corpuses can be exploited for WSD systems.",
        "In this section we will present a brief overview of related work.",
        "(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) report an improvement in translation quality by incorporating a WSD system directly in a phrase-based translation system.",
        "This is in response to earlier work done, where incorporating the output of a traditional WSD system gave disappointing results (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).",
        "The WSD task is redefined, to be similar to choosing the correct phrasal translation for a word, instead of choosing a sense from a sense inventory.",
        "This system is trained on the same data as the SMT system is.",
        "The output of this model is incorporated into the machine translation system by providing the WSD probabilities for a phrase translation as extra features in a log-linear model (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "This system consistently outperforms the baseline system (the same system, but without WSD component), on multiple metrics, which seems to indicate that WSD can make a useful contribution to machine translation.",
        "However, the way the system is set up, it could also be viewed as a way of incorporating translation probabilities of other systems into the phrase-based translation model.",
        "(Chan and Ng, 2007) introduce a system very similar to that of (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), but as applied to hierarchical phrase-based translation.",
        "They demonstrate modest improvements in BLEU score over the unmodified system, as well as some qualitative improvements in the output.",
        "Here again, the argument could be made that what is being done is not strictly word sense disambiguation, but augmenting the translation system with extra features for some of the phrase translations.",
        "In (Tufis?",
        "et al, 2004) parallel corpora and aligned WordNets are exploited for WSD.",
        "This is done, by word aligning the parallel texts, and then for every aligned pair, generating a set of wordnet sense codes (ILI codes, or interlingual index codes) for either word, corresponding to the possible senses that word can take.",
        "As the wordnets for both languages are linked, if the ILI code of a sense is the same, the sense should be sufficiently similar.",
        "Thus, the intersection of both sets of ILI is taken to find an ILI code that is common to both pairs.",
        "If such a code is found, it represents the sense index of both words.",
        "Otherwise, the closest ILI code to the two most similar ILI codes is found, and that is taken as the sense for the word.",
        "The current work however only uses a lexical resource for one of the languages, and as such has fewer places to fail, and less demanding requirements.",
        "Other similar work includes that in (Ng et al., 2003), where a sense-annotated corpus was automatically generated from a parallel corpus.",
        "This is done by word-aligning the parallel corpus, and then finding the senses according to WordNet given a list of nouns.",
        "Two senses are lumped together if they are translated into the same chinese word.",
        "The selection of correct translations is done manually.",
        "Only those occurrences of the chosen nouns that translate to one of the chosen chinese words are considered sense-tagged by the translation.",
        "Although similar in approach to what the current system would do, this system uses a much more simple approach to generate sense annotations and it depends on a previously word-aligned corpus, whereas the current approach would integrate alignment and sense-tagging, whis may give a higher accuracy."
