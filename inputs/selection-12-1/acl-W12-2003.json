        "Education researchers criticize current standardized tests of science on many grounds.",
        "First, they lack context (Behrens et al., 2007), which complicates a student's task of applying classroom-based learning, as the theory of situated cognition suggests (Brown et al., 1989).",
        "Second, many have criticized such tests for failing to engage students long enough to apply their understanding to the question.",
        "Furthermore and perhaps worst of all, standardized tests fail to assess scientific inquiry?the ability of students to apply the scientific method?authentically rather than as scientific content (National Research Council, 2005; Singley and Taft, 1995).",
        "We consider an assessment conducted by the Situated Assessment using Virtual Environments for Science Content and Inquiry (SAVE Science) project (Ketelhut et al., 2010; Ketelhut et al., 2009), whose long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current standardized tests of science.",
        "The assessments from SAVE Science have produced an abundance of data on how students interact with a virtual world, when trying to conduct scientific inquiry.",
        "Observing student behavior in virtual environments offers the potential for new insights into both how students learn and what they know.",
        "However, this benefit can only be realized if we can make sense of the stream of data and text produced by the students.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to automate the process of grading students in SAVE Science assessments, to make the evaluations as cost-effective as standardized tests.",
        "Unlike most previous systems for automated grading (Sukkarieh and Stoyanchev, 2009; Sukkarieh et al., 2004; Higgins et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008), the data for this task includes a short paragraph (usually 50-60 words) natural language response stating a hypothesis and evidence in support of it.",
        "In addition, there is a wealth of relational data about student behavior in a virtual environment.",
        "We develop novel predictors for automatically grading the written responses using a wide variety of natural language features, as well as features from the data on student behavior in the virtual world.",
        "On student data from two virtual worlds, our best automated grader has correlations of r = 0.58 and 0.44 with human judgments, improving over the closest",
        "technique from previous work by 56% for the first world, and by 120% for the second.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section contrasts this project with previous work.",
        "Section 3 describes the SAVE Science project and the student data it has produced.",
        "Section 4 details our automated grading models.",

        "Wang et al. (2008) have previously conducted a study on assessing creative problem-solving in science education by automatically grading student essays.",
        "Our techniques improve substantially over theirs, as we demonstrate empirically.",
        "In part, we improve by including more sophisticated language-processing features in our model than the unigram and bigram features they use; as others have noted, bag-of-words representations and latent semantic indexing become less useful as word order and causal relationships become important for judging an essay's quality (Malatesta et al., 2002; Wiemer-Hastings et al., 2005).",
        "A secondary reason for our improvement is that we also have access to non-linguistic data about the students that we can mine for additional patterns.",
        "Most previous research on automated grading of written text focuses on short, factual text (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1999; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009; Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; Sukkarieh and Stoy-anchev, 2009; Sukkarieh et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2002; Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005), whereas SAVE Science's texts are only partly factual.",
        "Responses are meant to convey a scientific explanation of a mystery, and therefore, correct responses contain inferences, observations of the world, and causal links between observations and inferences.",
        "Automatic systems for grading longer responses typically grade essays for coherence and discourse structure (Burstein et al., 2001; Higgins et al., 2004), but these global discourse criteria are only partially indicative of the quality of a student's response to the SAVE Science assessments.",
        "To be considered fully correct in these tests, student responses must contain factually correct information, as well as causal relationships that justify the student's inferences, such as ?The balls don't bounce outside because it's cold, and lower temperatures decrease pressure.",

        "The full system for automatic grading is accurate, across both worlds and all gold standards.",
        "Figure 3 shows the results of predicting human judgments of the freeform responses, where the World+NLP system achieves a correlation of 0.58 for Basketball and 0.44 for Weather Trouble.",
        "The same system achieves 0.55 and 0.54 on the World questions of Basketball and Weather Trouble, respectively (Figures 4 and 5).",
        "Our best models are statistically significantly different from the Wang et al. model (for predicting contextualized questions for basketball: p = .009, ?2 = 6.87162; for grading freeform responses: p ?",
        "0, ?2 = 14.21725).",
        "Correlations from World+NLP for other quiz types ?",
        "tion over the Wang et al. model for grading freeform science essays, by a margin of 0.21 on Basketball and 0.23",
        "World and NLP, and substantially outperforms the Wang et al. system.",
        "non-contextualized and all questions ?",
        "were somewhat lower, but still statistically significant (p = .002, ?2 = 10.05986).",
        "The language features are currently the major factor in the predictive models for automated grading.",
        "The NLP model substantially outperforms both the simpler Wang et al. model and the World-only model in predicting quiz answers for both worlds.",
        "It achieves correlations that are statistically significantly different from the baseline, for all gold standards and both worlds.",
        "The story in the case of grading freeform essays is similar.",
        "Our NLP model beats the Wang et al. model and the World-only model.",
        "Our full model World+NLP, however, outperforms the NLP model by only a small fraction.",
        "Also, the Wang et al. model performs slightly better than the World-only model on freeform responses.",
        "For Basketball, the correlation coefficient of their model is greater by 0.11 and for Weather by 0.05.",
        "We believe that the NLP-based",
        "World and Wang et al. on predicting quiz questions for Weather Trouble, and the combined World+NLP model achieves a 0.54 correlation for contextualized questions.",
        "models, including Wang et al?s, are outperforming the World model because the current representation of the World data fails to capture all of the pertinent information from students?",
        "behavior in the virtual environments.",
        "Our plans for future work include the development of features that can capture temporal patterns in student activity.",
        "Each type of language feature appears to provide a beneficial and complementary source of evidence.",
        "We tested the model using only individual subsets of the NLP features, such as HMM features only, LSA features only, ngrams and loose patterns only, and features from semantic role labeling only.",
        "On their own, each set of features provides only a small improvement over the mean predictor.",
        "When combined with the world features, each subset of the NLP features again provides only a small improvement over the World-only model.",
        "For example, for predicting Basketball world quiz questions, World features achieve r = 0.34, World+HMM and World+LSA achieve 0.35, and World+(ngrams and loose patterns) achieves 0.39.",
        "The relative ranking of these subsets of features is not consistent across different tasks; for Weather contextualized questions, World+HMM is best, and for Weather non-contextualized questions, World+LSA is best.",
        "Features selected by the feature selection algorithm also indicate that the different types of language features complement one another.",
        "The feature selection algorithm for the World+NLP model selects some features for every different type we presented, although the HMM, LSA, loose pattern, and unigram features dominate.",
        "We believe that the best procedure",
        "for developing grading systems for science essays is therefore to construct a large number of possible features using a variety of techniques, and then train a model for a particular task and gold standard.",
        "Including significantly more varieties of features, perhaps from additional kinds of language models or NLP pipeline tools, is an important future direction for further improving the grading accuracy.",
        "While the accuracies of the models for contextualized and non-contextualized questions are broadly similar, the models themselves are not.",
        "For the contextualized questions, 4 important world behavior features were deemed important and non-redundant by the feature selection algorithm: the number of distinct collisions, the number of people collided with, the number of distinct objects (basketballs or balloons) whose pressure was measured, and the number of distinct temperature measurements that were recorded into clipboards.",
        "The essential task in this virtual world is to discover that a decrease in the temperature of several gas systems (basketballs and balloons filled with air) is causing their pressure to decrease.",
        "The model for the contextualized questions thus includes variables that are highly relevant to a student's understanding of the core problem in the world, which in turn indicates that automated data mining techniques are capable of identifying when students are learning to practice the scientific method, by observing student behavior.",
        "On the other hand, the model for the non-contextualized questions includes only 2 world features: The number of collisions made and number of different objects whose circumference was measured.",
        "The first one is an indicator of the activity level of a student and the second variable is an indicator for whether the student has identified the problem (the basketballs are not bouncing because they are deflated), but not for the underlying cause of the problem (the outside temperature causes a drop in pressure, which causes the basketball circumference to decrease).",
        "Thus the model that predicts non-contextualized questions very accurately has little information about whether the student understood the core problem of the world or not; instead, it has information about whether the student is active in the world.",
        "These observations lend some support to the criticism that the standardized tests are not properly assessing inquiry.",
        "Performance on the Weather Trouble module is consistently lower than on Basketball.",
        "In part, this reflects the increased difficulty of this world; human inter-annotator agreement is a bit lower (?",
        "= 0.8 vs. 0.95 on Basketball).",
        "However, another large part of the difference is that the world features provide far less information in Weather Trouble ?",
        "the World-only model has less than half the correlation on Weather than on Basketball, for all quiz question types.",
        "We suspect that the cause is the nature of the task on the Weather Trouble world, where temporal information plays a bigger role as measurements of air pressure and wind direction may change over time.",
        "Investigating world features that can distinguish different patterns of student behavior over time is an important area for further investigation."
