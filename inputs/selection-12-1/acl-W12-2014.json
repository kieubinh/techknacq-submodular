        "In recent years, there is an increasing interest of using speech processing and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automatically score speaking tests (Eskenazi, 2009).",
        "A set of features related to speech delivery, such as fluency, pronunciation, and intonation, has been utilized in these studies.",
        "However, accuracy of an answer's content to the question being asked, important factors to be considered during the scoring process, have not been fully utilized.",
        "In this paper, we will report our initial efforts exploring content scoring in an automated speaking assessment task.",
        "To start, we will briefly describe the speaking test questions in our research.",
        "In the test we used for evaluation, there were two types of questions.",
        "The first type, survey, requires a test-taker to provide answers specific to one or several key points in a survey question without any background reading/listening related to the topic of the survey.",
        "Typical questions could be ?how frequently do you go shopping??",
        "or ?what kind of products did you purchase recently??",
        "In contrast, the second type, opinion, requires a test-taker to speak as long as 60 seconds to present his or her opinions about some topic.",
        "An example of such questions could be, ?Do you agree with the statement that online shopping will be dominant in future or not??",
        "Compared to the essays in writing tests, these spoken responses could just be incomplete sentences.",
        "For example, for the survey questions, test-takers could just say several words.",
        "For the questions described above, some test-takers may just use phrases like ?once a week?",
        "or ?books?.",
        "In addition, given short responding durations, the number of words in test-takers?",
        "responses is limited.",
        "Furthermore, since scoring speech responses requires speech recognition, more noisy inputs are expected.",
        "To tackle these challenges, we propose two novel content scoring methods in this paper.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related previous research efforts; Section 3 proposes the two content-scoring methods we designed for two types of questions described above; Section 4 reports the experimental results of applying the proposed methods; finally, Section 5 concludes our reported research and describes our plans for future research."

        "For writing tests, previous content scoring investigations can be divided into the following three groups.",
        "The first group relies on obtaining and matching patterns associated with the correct answers (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; Sukkarieh and Blackmore, 2009).",
        "The second group of methods, also mostly used",
        "for content-scoring, is to rely on a variety of text similarity measurements to compare a response with either predefined correct answers or a group of responses rated with a high score (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009).",
        "Compared to the first group, such methods can bypass a labor intensive pattern-building step.",
        "A widely used approach to measuring text similarity between two text strings is to convert each text string into a word vector and then use the angle between these two vectors as a similarity metric.",
        "For example, Content Vector Analysis (CVA) has been successfully utilized to detect off-topic essays (Higgins et al., 2006) and to provide content-related features for essay scoring (At-tali and Burstein, 2004).",
        "For this group of methods, measuring the semantics similarity between two terms is a key question.",
        "A number of metrics have been proposed, including metrics (Courley and Mi-halcea, 2005) derived from WordNet, a semantics knowledge database (Fellbaum, 1998), and metrics related to terms?",
        "co-occurrence in corpora or on the Web (Turney, 2001).",
        "The third group of methods treats content scoring as a Text Categorization (TC) task, which treats the responses being scored on different score levels as different categories.",
        "Therefore, a large amount of previous TC research, such as the many machine learning approaches proposed for the TC task, can be utilized.",
        "For example, Furnkranz et al. (1998) compared the performance of applying two machine learning methods on a web-page categorization task and found that the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction algorithm (RIPPER) (Cohen, 1995) shows an advantage concerning the feature sparsity issue."

        "As described in Section 1, for the two types of questions considered, the number of words appearing in a response is quite limited given the short response time.",
        "Therefore, compared to written essays, when applying the content-scoring methods based on vector analysis, e.g., CVA, feature sparsity becomes a major factor negatively influencing the performance of these methods.",
        "Furthermore, there are more challenges when applying vector analysis on survey questions because test-takers could just use words/phrases rather than completed sentences.",
        "Also, some survey questions could have a very large range of correct answers.",
        "For example, if a question is about the name of a book, millions of book titles could be potential answers.",

        "Moreover, it should be the instances of specific TV programs, like news, comedy, talk shows, etc.",
        "Note that the acceptable answers may be infinite, so it is not realistic to enumerate all possible answers.",
        "Therefore, we proposed a method to extract the potential answer candidates and then measure their semantic similarities to the answer keys that could be determined manually.",
        "In particular, the answer keys were determined by the first author based on her analysis of the test prompts.",
        "For example, for the question ?What kind of books do you like to read?",
        "?, two answer keys, ?book?",
        "and ?reading?",
        "were selected.",
        "After a further analysis of the questions, we found that most of the survey questions are about ?when?",
        "?where?",
        "and ?what?, and the answers in the responses were usually nouns or noun phrases.",
        "Therefore, we decided to extract the noun phrases from each response and use them as potential candidates.",
        "We use two semantic similarity metrics (SSMs) to evaluate how each candidate relates to an answer key, including PMI-IR (Turney, 2001) and a word-to-word similarity metric from WordNet (Courley and Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "The PMI-IR is a measure based on web query analysis using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "For an answer candidate (c) and an answer key (k), their PMI-IR is computed as:",
        "where the hits(x) function obtains the count of term x returned by a web search engine and NEAR is a query operator for proximity search, searching the pages on which both k and c appear within a specified distance.",

        "we found that the Wu-Palmer metric proposed by Wu and Palmer (1994) worked the best in our pilot study.",
        "This metric is a score denoting how similar two word senses are, based on the depth of the two word senses in the taxonomy and their Least Com",
        "For each answer key, we calculated two sets of SSMs (SSMPMI-IR and SSMWN , respectively) from all candidates.",
        "Then, we selected the largest SSMPMI-IR and SSMWN as the final SSMs for this particular answer key.",
        "For each test question, using the corresponding responses in the training set, we built a linear regression model between these SSMs for all answer keys and the human judged scores.",
        "The learned regression model was applied to the responses to this particular testing question in the testing set to convert a set of SSMs to predictions of human scores.",
        "The predicted scores were then used as a content feature.",

        "In addition, using other non-CVA machine learning methods can enable us to try other types of linguistic features.",
        "To address the feature sparsity issue, a smoothing method, which converts word-based text features into features based on other entities with a much smaller vocabulary size, is used.",
        "We use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based smoothing method (Huang and Yates, 2009), which induces classes, corresponding to hidden states in the HMM model, from the observed word strings.",
        "This smoothing method can use contextual information of the word sequences due to the nature of HMM.",
        "Then, we convert word-entity vectors to the vectors based on the induced classes.",
        "TF-IDF (term 1Most specific ancestor node frequency and inverse document frequency) weighting is applied on the new class vectors.",
        "Finally, the processed class vectors are used as input features (smoothed) to a machine learning method.",
        "In this research, after comparing several widely used machine learning approaches, such as Naive Bayes, CART, etc., we decided to use RIPPER proposed by Cohen (1995), a rule induction method, similar to Furnkranz et al. (1998)."
