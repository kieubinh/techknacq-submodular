        "Peer review is a widely used educational approach for coaching writing in many domains (Topping, 1998; Topping, 2009).",
        "Because of the large number of review comments to examine, instructors giving peer review assignments find it difficult to examine peer comments.",
        "While there are web-based peer-review systems that help instructors set up peer-review assignments, no prior work has been done to support instructors?",
        "comprehension of the textual review comments.",
        "To address this issue, we have designed and developed an interactive analytic interface (RevExplore) on top of SWoRD1 (Cho and Schunn, 2007), a web-based peer-review reciprocal system that has been used by over 12,000 students over the last 8 years.",
        "In this paper, we show how RevExplore visualizes peer-review information in multiple dimensions and various granularity levels to support investigative exploration, and applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to facilitate review comprehension and comparison."

        "Instructors face challenges when they try to make sense of the peer-review data collected by SWoRD for their assignments.",
        "Instructors we have interviewed have complained that peer reviews are time-consuming to read and almost ?impossible?",
        "to interpret: 1) to understand the pros and cons of one student's paper, they need to synthesize all the peer reviews received by that student by reading them one by one; 2) furthermore, if instructors would like to discover general patterns regarding students?",
        "writing performance, they have to additionally compare peer reviews across multiple students which requires their simultaneously remembering various opinions for many students; 3) in the initial stage of peer review analysis, instructors have no clear idea of what potential patterns they should be looking for (?cold start?).",
        "These challenges motivate our design of RevExplore, a peer-review analytic tool that is a plugin to SWoRD.",
        "We set our design goals to address the challenges mentioned above, respectively: 1) create a simple and informative representation of peer-review data which automatically aggregates peer-reviews at the level of student; 2) provide intelligent support of text mining and semantic abstraction for the purpose of comparison; 3) enable an overview of key characteristics of peer reviews for initial exploration.",
        "To fulfill our design goals, we design an interactive visualization system to ease the exploration process, following the pattern of overview plus detail (Card et al., 1999).",
        "In the overview, RevExplore",
        "provides a high level of visualization of overall peer-review information at the student level for initial exploration.",
        "In the detail-view, RevExplore automatically abstracts the semantic information of peer reviews at the topic-word level, with the original texts visible on demand.",
        "In addition, we introduce clustering and NLP techniques to support automated an-alytics."

        "One major goal of peer review studies in educational research is to understand how to better improve student learning, directly or indirectly.",
        "Empirical studies of textual review comments based on manual coding have discovered that certain review features (e.g., whether the solution to a problem is explicitly stated in a comment) can predict both whether the problem will be understand and the feedback implemented (Nelson and Schunn, 2009).",
        "Our previous studies used machine learning and NLP techniques to automatically identify the presence of such useful features in review comments (Xiong et al., 2010); similar techniques have also been used to determine review comment helpfulness (Xiong and Litman, 2011; Cho, 2008).",
        "With respect to paper analysis, Sa?ndor and Vorndran (2009) used NLP to highlight key sentences, in order to focus reviewer attention on important paper aspects.",

        "profile information to maximize learning outcomes, while Crespo Garcia and Pardo (2010) explored the use of document clustering to adaptively guide the assignment of papers to peers.",
        "In contrast to the prior work above, the research presented here is primarily motivated by the needs of instructors, instead of the needs of students.",
        "In particular, the goal of RevExplore is to utilize the information in peer reviews and papers, to help instructors better understand student performance in the peer-review assignments for their courses.",
        "Many computer tools have already been developed to support peer review activities in various types of classrooms, from programming courses (Hyyrynen et al., 2010) to courses involving writing in the disciplines (Nelson and Schunn, 2009; Yang, 2011).",
        "Within the writing domain, systems such as SWoRD (Cho and Schunn, 2007) mainly assist instructors by providing administrative management support and/or (optional) automatic grading services.",
        "While peer review systems especially designed for instructors do exist, their goal is typically to create a collaborative environment for instructors to improve their professional skills (Fu and Hawkes, 2010).",
        "In terms of artificial intelligence support, to our knowledge no current peer review system has the power to provide instructors with insights about the semantic content of peer reviews, due to the diversity and complexity of the textual review comments.",
        "For example, SWoRD currently provides teachers a numerical summary view that includes the number of reviews received for each paper, and the mean and standard deviation of numerical reviewing ratings for each paper.",
        "SWoRD also allows instructors to automatically compute a grade based on a student's writing and reviewing quality; the grading algorithm uses the numerical ratings but not the associated text comments.",
        "In this work, we attempted to address the lack of semantic insight both by having humans in the loop to identify points of interest for interactive data exploration, and by adapting existing natural language processing techniques to the peer review domain to support automated analytics."

        "While reviewing dimensions and associated guidelines (see below) are typically created by an instructor for a particular assignment, instructors can also set up their rubric using a library provided by SWoRD.",

        "For example, Figure 1 shows that the peer reviews received by this student are mainly focused on the argumentation and the introduction part of the paper.",
        "To extract peer-review main issues, RevExplore syntactically simplifies each review sentence (Heil-man and Smith, 2010), parses each simplified sentence using the Stanford dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006), and then traverses each dependency tree to find the key NP in a rule-based manner.3 Due to reviewers?",
        "frequent references to the relevant paper, most of the learned NPs are domain related facts used in the paper, rather than evaluative texts that suggest problems or suggestions.",

        "In traditional text summarization, the informativeness measurement is designed to extract the common themes, while in our case of comparison, instructors are more concerned with the uniqueness of each target set of peer reviews compared to the others.",
        "Thus a topic-signature acquisition algorithm (Lin and Hovy, 2000), which extracts topic words through comparing the vocabulary distribution of a target corpus against that of a generic background corpus using a statistic metric, suits our application better than other approaches, such as probabilistic graphical models (e.g. LDA) and frequency based methods.",
        "Therefore, RevExplore considers topic signatures as the topic words for a group of reviews, using all peer reviews as the background corpus.4 Again, to minimize the impact of the domain content of the relevant papers, we apply topic-masking which replaces all domain words5 with ?ddd?",
