        "In this section, we aim at providing an overview of these research villages, also hoping to construct a road network that may connect them.",
        "Most approaches to short answer assessment are situated in an educational context.",
        "Some focus on GCSE1 tests, others aim at university assessment tests in the medical domain.",
        "Another strand of approaches focuses on language teaching and learning.",
        "All of these approaches share one theme: they assess short texts written by students.",
        "These may be answers to questions that ask for knowledge acquired in a course, e.g., in computer science, or to reading comprehension questions in second language",
        "learning.",
        "While thematically related, short answer assessment is different from essay grading.",
        "Short answers are formulated by students in a much more controlled setting.",
        "Not only are they short, they usually are supposed to contain only a few facts that answer only one question.",
        "Another common theme of these approaches is that they compare the student answers to one or more previously defined correct answers that are either given in natural language as target answers or as a list of concepts in an answer key.",
        "The ways of technically conducting these comparisons vary widely, as we discuss below in Section 2.2.",
        "There also are conceptual differences between the approaches.",
        "Some systems focus on assessing whether or not the student has properly answered the question.",
        "They put the spot on comparing the meaning of target answers and student answers; they aim at being tolerant of form errors such as spelling or grammar errors.",
        "Others aim at giving a grade as accurate as possible, therefore not only assessing meaning but also performing grading similar to human teachers.",
        "This can also include modules that take into account form errors.",
        "These two views on a similar task are also reflected in the annotation of the data used in experiments: Systems performing meaning comparison usually operate with labels specifying the relations between target answers and student answers.",
        "Grading systems naturally aim at producing numerical grades.",
        "Since labels are on a nominal scale, and grades are on an ordinal scale (or even treated as being on an interval scale), the difference between meaning comparison and grading results in a whole string of other differences in methodology.",
        "Researchers also enter the short answer landscape from different home countries: Some projects are interested in the strategies and mechanics of meaning comparison, others aim at reducing the load and costs of large-scale assessment tests, and yet others aim at improving intelligent tutoring systems, requiring additional components that provide useful feedback to students using these systems."

        "A human task creator feeds the system with scores for model answers.",
        "Regular expressions are then created automatically from these model answers.",
        "Since each regular expression is associated with a score, matching the expression against a student answer yields a score for that answer.",

        "Even though Rose?",
        "et al (2003) position CarmelTC in the context of essay grading, it may be considered to deal with short answers: in their data, the average length of a student response is approx.",
        "48 words.",
        "Their system is designed to perform text classification on single sentences in the student responses, where each class of text represents one possible model response, plus an additional class for ?no match?.",
        "They combine decision trees operating on an automatic syntactic analysis, a Naive Bayes text classifier, and a bag-of-words approach.",
        "In a 50-fold cross validation experiment with one physics question, six classes and 126 student responses, hand-tagged by two annotators, CarmelTC reaches an F-measure value of 0.85.",
        "They do not report on a baseline.",
        "Concerning the quality of the gold standard, they report that conflicts in the annotation have been resolved.",
        "C-Rater (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003) is based on a paraphrase recognition approach.",
        "It employs correct answer models consisting of essential points formulated in natural language.",
        "C-Rater aims at automatic scoring and focuses on meaning, thus tolerating form errors.",
        "Leacock and Chodorow (2003) present two pilot studies, one of them dealing with reading comprehension.",
        "From 16,625 student answers with an average length of 43 words, they drew a random sample of 100 answers to each of the seven questions.",
        "This sample was scored by one human judge using a three-way scoring system (full credit, partial credit, no credit).",
        "Their system achieved 84% agreement with the gold standard.",
        "Information about the distribution of the scoring categories is given indirectly: A baseline system that assigns scores randomly would have achieved 47% accuracy.",
        "Information extraction templates form the core of the Intelligent Assessment Technologies system (IAT, Mitchell et al. 2003).",
        "These templates are created manually in a special-purpose authoring tool by exploring sample responses.",
        "They allow for syntactic variation, e.g., filling the subject slot in a sentence with different equivalent concepts.",
        "The templates corresponding to a question are then matched against the student answer.",
        "Unlike other systems, IAT additionally features templates for explicitly invalid answers.",
        "They tested their approach with a progress test that has to be taken by medicine students.",
        "Approximately 800 students each plowed through 270 test items.",
        "The automatically graded responses then were moderated: Human judges streamlined the answers to achieve a more consistent grading.",
        "This step already had been done before with tests graded by humans.",
        "Mitchell et al. (2003) state that their system reaches 99.4% accuracy on the full dataset after the manual adjustment of the templates via the moderation process.",
        "Summarizing, they report an error of ?between 5 and 5.5%?",
        "in inter-grader agreement and an error of 5.8% in automatic grading without the moderation step, though it is not entirely clear which data these statistics correspond to.",
        "No information on the distribution of grades or a random baseline is provided.",
        "The Oxford system (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005) is another one to employ an information extraction approach.",
        "Again, templates are constructed manually.",
        "Motivated by the necessary robustness to process language with grammar mistakes and spelling errors, they use shallow analyses in their pre-processing.",
        "In order to overcome the hassle of manually constructing templates, they also investigated machine learning techniques.",
        "However, the automatically generated templates were outperformed by the manually created ones.",
        "Furthermore, they state that manually created templates can be equipped with messages provided to the student as feedback in a tutoring system.",
        "For evaluating their system, they used factual science questions and the corresponding",
        "student answers from GCSE tests.",
        "200 graded answers for each of nine questions served as a training set, while another 60 answers served as a test set.",
        "They report that their system achieves an accuracy of 84%.",
        "With inconsistencies in the human grading removed, it achieves 93%.",
        "However, they do not report on the level of inter-grader agreement or on a random baseline.",
        "Pe?rez et al. (2005) present the Atenea system, a combined approach that makes use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer et al. 1998) and n-gram overlap.",
        "While n-gram overlap supports comparing target responses and student responses with differing word order, it does not deal with synonyms and related terms.",
        "Hence, they use LSA to add a component that deals with semantic relatedness in the comparison step.",
        "As a test corpus, they collected nine different questions from computer science exams.",
        "A tenth question ?",
        "[consists] of a set of definitions of ?Operating System?",

        "Altogether, they gathered 924 student responses and 44 target responses written by teachers.",
        "Since their LSA module had been trained on English but their data were in Spanish, they chose to use Altavista Babelfish to translate the data into English.",
        "They do not provide information about the distribution of scores and about inter-grader agreement.",

        "They do not report on other properties of the dataset such as number of annotators or number of questions to which the student answers were given.",
        "Their winning configuration yields a F-measure value of 0.4974.",
        "While Makatchev and VanLehn (2007) position their approach in the context of the Why2 tutorial dialogue system, their use of semantic classes seems to make them more related to meaning comparison than to grading.",

        "In an alignment phase, these annotations are then used to map from elements (words, lemmas, chunks, dependency triples) in the student responses to elements in the target responses.",
        "Finally, a machine learning classifier judges on the basis of this alignment, whether or not the student has answered the question correctly.",
        "The data used for evaluation was made available as the Corpus of Reading Comprehension Exercises in English (CREE, Meurers et al. 2011a).",

        "For the test set containing 255 responses to 28 questions, the approach achieved 88%.",
        "However, the distribution of categories in the data is heavily skewed with 71% of the responses marked as correct in the development set and 84% in the test set.",

        "Furthermore, all facets were looked up in the corresponding student responses and annotated accordingly, using the mentioned set of labels.",
        "The best result of the Facets System is 75.5% accuracy on one of the held-out test sets.",
        "With tenfold cross validation on the training set, it achieves 77.1% accuracy.",

        "While the former is a classification task, the latter is better characterized as a regression problem because of the desired numerical outcome.",
        "Of course, one could simply pretend that individual grades are classes and treat scoring as a classification task.",

        "that 4 is a higher grade than 3 and a much higher grade than 1 (assuming a 0?5 scale).",
        "As a result, if an evaluation metric such as Pearson correlation is used, classification systems are at a disadvantage because some misclassifications are punished more than others.",
        "We discuss this point further in Section 4.",
        "For these reasons, to obtain a more interesting comparison, we modified CoMiC-EN to perform scoring instead of meaning comparison.",
        "This means that the memory-based learning approach CoMiC-EN had employed so far was no longer applicable and had to be replaced with a regression-capable learning strategy.",
        "We chose Support Vector Regression (SVR) using libSVM4 since that is one of the methods employed by Mohler et al. (2011).",
        "However, all other parts of CoMiC-EN such as the processing pipeline and the alignment approach and the extracted features remained the same.",
        "The evaluation procedure was carried out as a 12-fold cross-validation due to the 12 assignments in the Texas corpus.",
        "For each fold, one complete assignment was held out as test set.",
        "Parameters for the SVR were determined using a grid search using the tools provided with libSVM.",
        "As kernel function, we used a linear kernel as it was also used in the evaluation of the Texas system and thus constitutes a vital part of the evaluation setup.",

        "It seems clear that for systems to be comparable and results to be reproducible, datasets must be publicly available, as is the case with the Texas corpus.",
        "However, data availability alone does not ensure meaningful comparison.",
        "Depending on the context the corpus was drawn from, datasets will differ just like the corresponding systems: ?",
        "Data source: Reading comprehension task in language learning setting, language tutoring context, automated grading of short answer exams ?",
        "Language properties: Native vs. learner language, domain-specific language (e.g., computer science) ?",
        "Assessment scheme: nominal vs. interval scale Especially the last point deserves some further discussion.",
        "Depending on the kind of assessment scheme, which in turn is motivated by the task, different evaluation methods may be chosen.",
        "Scoring systems are often evaluated using a correlation metric in order to capture the systems?",
        "tendency to assign similar but not necessary equal grades as the human raters.",
        "Conversely, with category-based schemes one usually reports accuracy, which expresses how many items were classified correctly.",
        "The question that arises is how a system coming from one paradigm can be compared to one from the other paradigm in a meaningful way.",
        "One might argue that the tasks are simply too different: scoring might take form errors into account while meaning comparison by definition does not.",
        "Moreover, while classification labels say something explicit and absolute about a piece of data, grades by definition are relative to the scale they come from.",
        "It thus seems impossible to somehow unify the two schemes as they express fundamentally different ideas.",
        "However, the strategies systems use to tackle scoring or meaning comparison are undoubtedly similar and should be comparable, as we argue in this paper.",
        "So in order for researchers to learn from other approaches and also compare their results to those of other systems which tackle a different task, changes to systems seem necessary and should be preferred over changes to the gold standard data.",
        "In the case presented here, a meaning comparison system was turned into a scoring system by changing the machine learning component from classification to regression, which requires a certain level of system modularity.",
        "Having compared the two systems using Pearson correlation and RMSE, it also makes sense to consider the relevance of these evaluation metrics.",
        "For example, it is the case that pairwise correlation assumes a normal distribution whereas datasets like",
        "the Texas corpus are heavily skewed towards correct answers (see Table 2).",
        "Mohler et al. (2011) also note that in distributions with zero variance, correlation is undefined, which is not a problem as such but limits the use of correlation as evaluation metric.",
        "Mohler et al. (2011) propose that RMSE is better suited to the task since it captures the relative error a system makes when trying to predict scores.",
        "However, RMSE is scale-dependent and thus RMSE values across different studies cannot be compared.",
        "We can only suggest that in order to sufficiently describe a system's performance, several metrics need to be reported.",
        "Finally, an important point concerns the quality of gold standards.",
        "Given the relatively low inter-annotator agreement in the Texas corpus (r = 0.586, RMSE = 0.659) it seems fair to ask whether answers without perfect agreement should be used in training and testing systems at all.",
        "In the CREE and CREG corpora, answers with disagreement among the annotators have either been excluded from experiments or resolved by an additional judge.",
        "This approach is also supported by recent literature (cf., e.g., Beigman and Beigman Klebanov 2009; Beigman Klebanov and Beigman 2009).",
        "However, for the Texas corpus, Mohler et al. (2011) have opted to use the arithmetic mean of the two graders as gold standard.",
        "While mathematically a viable solution, it seems questionable whether the mean is reliable with only two graders, especially if they have not operated on the grounds of explicit guidelines.",
        "It would be interesting to see whether in this case, a system trained on more, singly annotated data would perform better than one on less, doubly annotated data, as argued for by Dligach et al. (2010).",
        "In any case, if many disagreements occur, one should ask the question whether the annotation task is defined well enough and whether machines should really be expected to perform it consistently if humans have trouble doing so."

        "In comparing the two, it was necessary to turn CoMiC-EN into a scoring system because the Texas corpus as the chosen gold standard contains numeric scores assigned by humans.",

        "We conclude that it is interesting and relevant to compare short answer evaluation systems even if the concrete task they tackle, such as grading or meaning comparison, is not the same.",
        "However, the availability and quality of the datasets will decide to what extent systems can sensibly be compared.",
        "For progress to be made in this area, more publicly available datasets and systems are needed.",
