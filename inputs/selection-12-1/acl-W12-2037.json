        "For instance, user-generated content from Twitter and Facebook is mainly comprised of short, shallow snippets of information.",
        "Most current research in AI (and more broadly in computer science) does not seem likely to reverse this trend: e.g., work in crowdsourcing has concentrated on tasks that can be easily decomposed into small pieces, and much current NLP research aims at facilitating short-term ?shallow?",
        "goals, such as answering well-formulated questions (e.g., (Kwok et al., 2001)) and extracting concrete facts (e.g., (Etzioni et al., 2006; Yates et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010)).",

        "We thus formulate the problem of comprehending technical material as a probabilistic planning problem, where reading a document is an operator that will probabilistically change the state of knowledge K(u, t) of a user u at time t, in a manner that depends on u's prior knowledge K(u, t ?",
