        "One of the reasons for this is that semantic structures are difficult to derive because of the complex compositionality of natural language.",
        "Another difficulty is that form errors in the input create problems for deep processing, which is required for extracting semantic representations.",
        "On the other hand, semantic representations have the significant advantage that they on the one hand abstract away from variation in the syntactic realization of the same meaning and on the other hand clearly expose those distinctions which do make a difference in meaning.",
        "For example, the difference between dog bites man and man bites dog is still present in deeper syntactic or semantic representations, while semantic representations abstract way from meaning-preserving form variation, such as the active-passive alternation (dog bites man ?",
        "man was bitten by dog).",
        "This suggests that sufficiently robust approaches using appropriate semantic formalisms can be useful for the evaluation of short answers.",

        "This is remarkable given that CoMiC-DE uses several (but comparably shallow) levels of linguistic abstraction for finding alignment links, whereas our approach is exclusively based on the semantic representations.",
        "The fact that WEIGHTED-Average outperforms the IGNORE-Average scores shows that the inclusion of functional element (i.e., predicates like subj, obj), which are not available to approaches based on aligning surface strings, improves the accuracy.3 On the other hand, the lower performance of EQUAL shows that functional elements should be treated differently from content-bearing elements.",
        "Of the 13.7% answers misclassified by WEIGHTED-Average FOCUS, 53.5% are false negatives and 46.5% are false positives.",
        "We also investigated the impact of grammaticality on the result by manually annotating a sample of 220 student answers for grammatical well-formedness, 66% of which were ungrammatical.",
        "On this sample, grammatical and ungrammatical student answers were evaluated with essentially the same accuracy (83% for ungrammatical answers, 81% for grammatical answers).",
        "The decrease in accuracy of the COMBINED score over the best score can be traced to some yes-no-questions which have an unaligned negation but are correct.",
        "On the other hand, testing only on answers with focused numbers results in an accuracy of 97%.",
        "The performance of GIVEN and FOCUS scores 3We also evaluated IGNORE scores using parameter values optimized for these scores, but their performance was still below those of the corresponding WEIGHTED-Average scores.",
        "compared to BASIC confirms that information structuring helps in targeting the relevant parts of the answers.",
        "Since CoMiC-DE also demotes given material, the better GIVEN results of our approach must result from other aspects than the information structure awareness.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, the FOCUS scores support reference to the material focused in the answers.",
        "However, since currently the FOCUS scores only differs from the GIVEN scores for alternative questions, and the test corpus only contains seven answers to such ?or?",
        "questions, we see no serious quantitative difference in accuracy between the FOCUS and GIVENNESS results.",
        "While the somewhat lower accuracy of the score ALIGN shows that the alignment scores are not sufficient for classification, the best-performing scores do not require much additional computation and do not need any information that is not in the alignments or the automatic focus annotation."
