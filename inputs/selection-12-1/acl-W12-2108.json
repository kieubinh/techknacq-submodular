        "fault and thus provide an enormous and growing free resource of authentic, unedited text by ordinary people.",
        "Researchers have used Twitter to study how human language varies by time zone (Kiciman, 2010), census area (Eisenstein et al., 2011), gender (Burger et al., 2011), and ethnicity (Fink et al., 2012).",
        "Twitter also provides a wealth of user dialog, and a variety of dialog acts have been observed (Ritter et al., 2010) and predicted (Ritter et al., 2011).",
        "Of course, working with Twitter is not all roses and rainbows.",
        "Twitter is a difficult domain because unlike, for example, news articles, tweets are short (limited to 140 characters), vary widely in style, and contain many spelling and grammatical errors.",
        "Moreover, unlike articles written by a particular news organization, a corpus constructed from Twitter will contain tweets in many different languages.",
        "This latter point is particularly troubling because the majority of language-processing technology is predicated on knowing which language is being processed.",
        "We are pursuing a long-term effort to build social media collections in a variety of low-resource languages, and we need robust language identification (LID) technology.",
        "While LID is often viewed as a solved problem (McNamee, 2005), recent research has shown that LID can be made arbitrarily difficult by choosing domains with (a) informal writing, (b) lots of languages to choose from, (c) very short texts, and (d) unbalanced data (Hughes et al., 2006; Baldwin and Lui, 2010).",
        "Twitter exhibits all of these properties.",
        "While the problem of LID on Twitter has been considered previously (Tromp and Pechenizkiy, 2011; Carter et al., 2013), these studies have only targeted five or six western European languages, and not the diversity of languages and writing systems that we would like to process.",
        "Our main contribution is the release of a large collection of tweets in nine languages using the Cyrillic, Arabic, and Devanagari alphabets.",
        "We test different methods for obtaining tweets in a given target language (?2).",
        "We then use an online crowd-sourcing platform to have these tweets annotated by fluent speakers of that language (?3).",
        "We generate over 18,000 triple-consensus tweets, providing the first publicly-available collection of LID-annotated tweets in non-Latin scripts.",

        "We also implement two LID approaches and evaluate these approaches against state-of-the-art competitors.",

        "Both types of systems achieve a huge improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches, including the Google Compact Language Detector (part of the Chrome browser), and a recent LID system from Lui and Baldwin (2011).",
        "Finally, we provide further analysis of our systems in this unique domain, showing how accuracy varies with the tweet-length and the amount of in-domain and out-of-domain training data.",

        "We computed the 25 most frequent unique words in a number of different languages (that is, words that do not occur in the vocabularies of other languages).",

        "Researchers have tackled language identification using statistical approaches since the early 1990s.",
        "Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) framed LID as a text categorization problem and made their influential TextCat tool publicly-available.",
        "The related problem of identifying the language used in speech signals has also been well-studied; for speaker LID, both phonetic and sequential information may be helpful (Berkling et al., 1994; Zissman, 1996).",
        "Insights from LID have also been applied to related problems such as dialect determination (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011a) and identifying the native language of non-native speakers (Koppel et al., 2005).",
        "Recently, LID has received renewed interest as a mechanism to help extract language-specific corpora from the growing body of linguistic materials on the web (Xia et al., 2009; Baldwin and Lui, 2010).",
        "Work along these lines has found LID to be far from a solved problem (Hughes et al., 2006; Baldwin and Lui, 2010; Lui and Baldwin, 2011); the web in general has exactly the uneven mix of style, languages, and lengths-of-text that make the real problem quite difficult.",
        "New application areas have also arisen, each with their own unique challenges, such as LID for search engine queries (Gottron and Lipka, 2010), or person names (Bhargava and Kondrak, 2010).",
        "The multilinguality of Twitter has led to the development of ways to ensure language purity.",

        "We focus on low-resource languages, where training data is scarce.",

        "Language identification is a key technology for extracting authentic, language-specific user-generated text from social media.",
        "We addressed a previously unexplored issue: LID performance on Twitter text in low-resource languages.",
        "We have created and made available a large corpus of human-annotated tweets in nine languages and three non-Latin writing systems, and presented two systems that can predict tweet language with very high accuracy.9 While challenging, LID on Twitter is perhaps not as difficult as first thought (Carter et al., 2013), although performance depends on the amount of training data, the length of the tweet, and whether we aggregate information across multiple tweets by the same user.",
        "Our next step will be to develop a similar approach to handle romanized text.",
        "We also plan to develop tools for identifying code-switching (switching languages) within a tweet."
