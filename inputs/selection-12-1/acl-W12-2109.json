        "Machine translation (MT) could supplement or replace such crowdsourcing efforts in the future.",
        "However, working with SMS data presents several challenges.",
        "First, messages may have non-standard spellings and abbreviations (?text speak?",
        "), which we need to normalize into standard language.",
        "Second, many languages that are typically written in a non-Roman script use a romanized version for SMS, which we need to deromanize.",
        "Normalizing and deromanizing SMS messages would allow us to use existing MT engines, which are typically trained on well-formed sentences written in their native-script, in order to translate the messages.",
        "With this work, we use and release a corpus of 1 million (4, 195 annotated) anonymized text messages sent in Pakistan1.",
        "We deromanize and normalize messages written in Urdu, although the general approach is language-independent.",
        "Using Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we collect normalized Arabic script annotations of romanized messages in order to both train and evaluate a Hidden Markov Model that automates the conversion.",
        "Our model drastically outperforms our baseline deterministic approach and its performance is comparable to the agreement between annotators."
