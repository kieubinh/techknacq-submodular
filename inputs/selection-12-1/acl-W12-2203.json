        "While there has been much work on computational models to predict readability based on the lexical, syntactic and discourse properties of a text, there are also interesting open questions about how computer generated text should be evaluated with target populations.",
        "In this paper, we compare two offline methods for evaluating sentence quality, magnitude estimation of acceptability judgements and sentence recall.",
        "These methods differ in the extent to which they can differentiate between surface level fluency and deeper comprehension issues.",
        "We find, most importantly, that the two correlate.",
        "Magnitude estimation can be run on the web without supervision, and the results can be analysed automatically.",
        "The sentence recall methodology is more resource intensive, but allows us to tease apart the fluency and comprehension issues that arise."

        "In Natural Language Generation, recent approaches to evaluation tend to consider either ?naturalness?",
        "or ?usefulness?.",
        "Following evaluation methodologies commonly used for machine translation and sum-marisation, there have been attempts to measure naturalness in NLG by comparison to human generated gold standards.",
        "This has particularly been the case in evaluating referring expressions, where the generated expression can be treated as a set of attributes and compared with human generated expressions (Gatt et al., 2009; Viethen and Dale, 2006), but there have also been attempts at evaluating sentences this way.",
        "For instance, Langkilde-Geary (2002) generate sentences from a parsed analysis of an existing sentence, and evaluate by comparison to the original.",
        "However, this approach has been criticised at many levels (see for example, Gatt et al. (2009) or Sripada et al. (2003)); for instance, because there are many good ways to realise a sentence, because typical NLG tasks do not come with reference sentences, and because fluency judgements in the monolingual case are more subtle than for machine translation.",
        "Readability metrics, by comparison, do not rely on reference texts, and try to model the linguistic quality of a text based on features derived from the text.",
        "This body of work ranges from the Flesch Metric (Flesch, 1951), which is based on average word and sentence length, to more systematic evaluations of various lexical, syntactic and discourse characteristics of a text (cf. Pitler et al. (2010), who assess readability of textual summaries).",
        "Some researchers have also suggested measuring edit distance by using a human to revise a system generated text and quantifying the revisions made (Sripada et al., 2003).",
        "This does away with the need for reference texts and is quite suited to expert domains such as medicine or weather forecasting, where a domain expert can easily correct system output.",
        "Analysis of these corrections can provide feedback on problematic content and style.",
        "We have previously evaluated text reformulation applications by asking readers which version they prefer (Siddharthan et al., 2011), or through the use of Likert scales (Likert, 1932) for measuring meaning preservation and grammaticality (Siddharthan, 2006).",
        "However, none of these approaches tell us very much about the comprehensibility of a text for an end reader.",
        "To address this, there has been recent interest in task based evaluations.",
        "Task based evaluations directly evaluate generated utterances for their utility",
        "to the hearer.",
        "However, while for some generation areas like reference (Gatt et al., 2009), the real world evaluation task is obvious, it is less so for other generation tasks such as surface realisation or text-to-text regeneration or paraphrase.",
        "We are thus keen to investigate psycholinguistic methods for investigating sentence processing as an alternative to task based evaluations.",
        "In the psycholinguistics literature, various offline and online techniques have been used to investigate sentence processing by readers.",
        "Online techniques (eye-tracking (Duchowski, 2007), neurophysiologi-cal (Friederici, 1995), etc.)",
        "offer many advantages in studying how readers process a sentence.",
        "But as these are difficult to set up and also resource intensive, we would prefer to evaluate NLG using offline techniques.",
        "Some offline techniques, such as Cloze tests (Taylor, 1953) or question answering, require careful preparation of material (choice of texts and questions, and for Cloze, the words to leave out).",
        "Other methods, such as magnitude estimation and sentence recall (cf. Sec 3 for details), are more straightforward to implement.",
        "In this paper, we investigate magnitude estimation of acceptability judgements and delayed sentence recall in the context of an experiment investigating generation choices when realising causal relations.",
        "Our goal is to study how useful these methods are for evaluating surface level fluency and deeper comprehensibility.",
        "We are interested in whether they can distinguish between similar sentences, and whether they can be used to test hypotheses regarding the effect of common generation decisions such as information order and choice of discourse marker.",
        "We briefly discuss the data in Section 2, before describing our experiments (Sections 3.1 and 3.2).",
        "We finish with a discussion of their suitability for more general evaluation of NLG with target readers."

        "In this paper, we have tried to separate out surface form aspects of acceptability from breakdowns in comprehension, using two offline psycholinguistic methods.",
        "We believe that sentence recall methodologies can substitute for task based evaluations and highlight breakdowns in comprehension at the sentence level.",
        "However, like most task based evaluations, recall experiments are time consuming as they need to be conducted in a supervised setting.",
        "Additionally, they require manual annotation of error types, though perhaps this could be automated.",
        "Acceptability ratings on the other hand are easy to acquire.",
        "Based on our experiments, we believe that acceptability ratings are reliable indicators of comprehension for longer sentences and, particularly for shorter sentences, combine surface form judgements with ease of comprehension in a manner that is very relevant for evaluating sentence generation or regeneration, including simplification.",
        "Both methods are considerably easier to set up and interpret than online methods such as self paced reading, eye tracking or neurophysiological methods."
