        "With its goal of identifying documents appropriate to readers of various proficiencies, automatic analysis of readability is typically approached as a text-level classification task.",
        "Although at least one popular readability metric (Dale and Chall, 1995) and a number of machine learning approaches to readability rely on lexical features (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Heilman et al., 2007; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Tanaka-Ishii et al., 2010), the readability of individual lexical items is not addressed directly in these approaches.",
        "Nevertheless, information about the difficulty of individual lexical items, in addition to being useful for text readability classification (Kidwell et al., 2009), can be applied to other tasks, for instance lexical simplification (Carroll et al., 1999; Burstein et al., 2007).",
        "Our interest is in providing students with educational software that is sensitive to the difficulty of particular English expressions, providing proactive support for those which are likely to be outside a reader's vocabulary.",
        "However, our existing lexical resource is coarse-grained and lacks coverage.",
        "In this paper, we explore the extent to which an automatic approach could be used to fill in the gaps of our lexicon.",
        "Prior approaches have generally depended on some kind of age-graded corpus (Kidwell et al., 2009; Li and Feng, 2011), but this kind of resource is unlikely to provide the coverage that we require; instead, our methods here are based on statistics from a huge web corpus.",
        "We show that frequency, an obvious proxy for difficulty, is only the first step; in fact we can derive key information from the documents that words appear in and the words that they appear with, information that can be combined to give high performance in identifying relative difficulty.",
        "We compare our automated lexicon against our existing resource as well as a crowdsourced annotation."

        "Simple metrics form the basis of much readability work: most involve linear combinations of word length, syllable count, and sentence length (Kincaid et al., 1975; Gunning, 1952), though the popular Dale-Chall reading score (Dale and Chall, 1995) is based on a list of 3000 ?easy?",
        "words; a recent review suggests these metrics are fairly interchangeable (van Oosten et al., 2010).",
        "In machine-learning classification of texts by grade level, unigrams have been found to be reasonably effective for this task, outperforming readability metrics (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).",
        "Var",
        "ious other features have been explored, including parse (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009) and coherence features (Feng et al., 2009), but the consensus seems to be that lexical features are the most consistently useful for automatic readability classification, even when considering non-native readers (Heilman et al., 2007).",
        "In the field of readability, the work of Kidwell et al.",
        "(2009) is perhaps closest to ours.",
        "Like the above, their goal is text readability classification, but they proceed by first deriving an age of acquisition for each word based on its statistical distribution in age-annotated texts.",
        "Also similar is the work of Li and Feng (2011), who are critical of raw frequency as an indicator and instead identify core vocabulary based on the common use of words across different age groups.",
        "With respect to our goal of lowering reliance on fine-grained annotation, the work of Tanaka-Ishii et al. (2010) is also relevant; they create a readability system that requires only two general classes of text (easy and difficult), other texts are ranked relative to these two classes using regression.",
        "Other lexical acquisition work has also informed our approach here.",
        "For instance, our co-occurrence method is an adaption of a technique applied in sentiment analysis (Turney and Littman, 2003), which has recently been shown to work for formality (Brooke et al., 2010), a dimension of stylistic variation that seems closely related to readability.",
        "Taboada et al. (2011) validate their sentiment lexicon using crowdsourced judgments of the relative polarity of pairs of words, and in fact crowd sourcing has been applied directly to the creation of emotion lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2010)."

        "Rather than trying to duplicate our arbitrary three-way distinction by manual or crowdsourced means, we instead focused on the relative difficulty of individual words: for each word in each of the two sets, we randomly selected three comparison words, one from each of the difficulty levels, forming a set of 4500 test pairs (2700 for the development set): 1/3 of these pairs are words from the same difficulty level, 4/9 are from adjacent difficulty levels, and the remaining 2/9 are at opposite ends of our difficulty spectrum.",

        "We can consider each feature as defining a lexicon on its own, which can be evaluated using our test set.",
        "Our features can be roughly broken into three types: simple features, document readability features, and co-occurrence features.",
        "The first of these types does not require much explanation: it includes the length of the word, measured in terms of letters and syllables (the latter is derived using a simple but reasonably accurate vowel-consonant heuristic), and the log frequency count in our corpus.",
        "The second feature type involves calculating simple readability metrics for each document in our corpus, and then defining the relevant feature for the word type as the average value of the metric for all the documents that the word appears in.",
        "For exam-1Though it is irrelevant when evaluating the feature alone, the log frequency was noticeably better when combining frequency with other features.",
        "ple, if Dw is the set of documents where word type w appears and di is the ith word in a document d, then the document word length (DWL) for w can be defined as follows:",
        "Other features calculated in this way include: the document sentence length, that is the average token length of sentences; the document type-token ratio2; and the document lexical density, the ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) to all words.",
        "The co-occurence features are inspired by the semi-supervised polarity lexicon creation method of Turney and Littman (2003).",
        "The first step is to build a matrix consisting of each word type and the documents it appears in; here, we use a binary representation, since the frequency with which a word appears in a particular document does not seem directly relevant to readability.",
        "We also do not remove traditional stopwords, since we believe that the use of certain common function words can in fact be good indicators of text readability.",
        "Once the matrix is built, we apply latent semantic analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997); we omit the mathematical details here, but the result is a dimensionality reduction such that each word is represented as a vector of some k dimensions.",
        "Next, we select two sets of seed words (P and N) which will represent the ends of the spectrum which we are interested in deriving.",
        "We derive a feature value V for each word by summing the cosine similarity of the word vector with all the seeds:",

The third, Difficulty, consists of the 300 beginner words from our development set as N, and the 300 advanced words from our development set as P. We tested several values of k for each of the seed sets (from 20 to 500); there was only small variation so here we just present our best results for each set as determined by testing in the development set.",

        "The second model is a binary SVM classifier; the features of the model are the difference between the respective features for each of the two words, and the classifier predicts whether the first or second word is more difficult.",
        "Both models were built using WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005), with default settings except for feature normalization, which must be disabled in the SVM to get useful weights for the linear combination which creates our lexicon.",
        "In practice, we would further normalize our lexicon; here, however, this normalization is not relevant since our evaluation is based entirely on relative judgments.",

        "When we combine features, we find that simple and document features combine to positive effect, but the co-occurrence features are redundant with each other and, for the most part, the document features.",

        "Our comparison of our existing resources with",
        "crowdsourced judgments suggests that some consistency is possible, but that granularity is, as we predicted, a serious concern, one which ultimately undermines our validation to some degree.",
        "An automatically derived lexicon, which can be fully continuous or as coarse-grained as needed, seems like an ideal solution, though the much lower performance of the automatic lexicon in predicting the more fine-grained Crowdflower judgments indicates that automatically-derived features are limited in their ability to deal with subtle differences.",
        "However, a visual inspection of the spectrum created by the automatic methods suggests that, with a judicious choice of granularity, it should be sufficient for our needs.",
        "In future work, we also intend to evaluate its use for readability classification, and perhaps expand it to include multiword expressions and syntactic patterns.",
        "Our results clearly show the benefit of combining multiple sources of information to build a model of word difficulty.",
        "Word frequency and word length are of course relevant, and the utility of the document context features is not surprising, since they are merely a novel extension of existing proxies for readability.",
        "The co-occurrence features were also useful, though they seem fairly redundant and slightly inferior to document features; we posit that these features, in addition to capturing notions of register such as formality, may also offer semantic distinctions relevant to the acquisition process.",
        "For instance, children may have a large vocabulary in very concrete domains such as animals, including words (e.g. lizard) that are not particularly frequent in adult corpora, while very common words in other domains (such as the legal domain) are completely outside the range of their experience.",
        "If we look at some of the examples which term frequency alone does not predict, they seem to be very much of this sort: dollhouse/emergence, skirt/industry, magic/system.",
        "Unsupervised techniques for identifying semantic variation, such as LSA, can capture these sorts of distinctions.",
        "However, our results indicate that simply looking at the readability of the texts that these sort of words appear in (i.e. our document features) is mostly sufficient, and less than 10% of the pairs which are correctly ordered by these two feature sets are different.",
        "In any case, an age-graded corpus is definitely not required.",
        "There are a few other benefits of using word co-occurrence that we would like to touch on, though we leave a full exploration for future work.",
        "First, if we consider readability in other languages, each language may have different properties which render proxies such as word length much less useful (e.g. ideographic languages like Chinese or agglutinative languages like Turkish).",
        "However, word (or lemma) co-occurrence, like frequency, is essentially a universal feature across languages, and thus can be directly extended to any language.",
        "Second, if we consider how we would extend difficulty-lexicon creation to the context of adult second-language learners, it might be enough to adjust our seed terms to reflect the differences in the language exposure of this population, i.e. we would expect difficulty in acquiring colloquialisms that are typically learned in childhood but are not part of the core vocabulary of the adult language."
