        "One of the concerns about gathering data from the Web is that it comes from various un-authoritative sources, and may not be reliable.",

        "In fact, the production rate of publicly available scientific data far exceeds the ability of researchers to ?manually?",
        "process it, and there is a growing need for the automation of this process.",
        "The biomedical field presents a great potential for text mining applications.",
        "An integral part of life science research involves production and publication of large collections of data by curators, and as part of collaborative community effort.",
        "Prominent examples include: publication of genomic sequence data, e.g., by the Human Genome Project; online collections of three-dimensional coordinates of protein structures; and databases holding data on genes.",
        "An important resource, initiated as a means of enforcing data standardization, are ontologies describing biological, chemical and medical terms.",
        "These are heavily used by the research community.",
        "With this wealth of available data the biomedical field holds many information extraction opportunities.",
        "We describe an open information extraction system adapting NELL to the biomedical domain.",
        "We present an implementation of our approach, named BioNELL, which uses three main sources of information: (1) a public corpus of biomedical scientific text, (2) commonly used biomedical ontologies, and",
        "complete fly gene dictionary.",
        "High PMI Seeds are the top 50 terms selected using PMI ranking, and Random Seeds are a random draw of 50 terms from the dictionary.",
        "These are used as seeds for the Fly Gene category (Section 4.2).",
        "Notice that the random set contains many terms that are often not used as genes including arm, 28, and dad.",
        "Using these as seeds can lead to semantic drift.",
        "In contrast, high PMI seeds exhibit much less ambiguity.",
        "(3) a corpus of Web documents.",
        "NELL's ontology, including categories and seeds, has been manually designed during the system development.",
        "Ontology design involves assembling a set of interesting categories, organized in a meaningful hierarchical structure, and providing representative seeds for each category.",
        "Redesigning a new ontology for a technical domain is difficult without non-trivial knowledge of the domain.",
        "We describe a process of merging source ontologies into one structure of categories with seed examples.",
        "However, as we will show, using NELL's bootstrapping algorithm to extract facts from a biomedical corpus is susceptible to noisy and ambiguous terms.",
        "Such ambiguities are common in biomedical terminology (see examples in Table 1), and some ambiguous terms are heavily used in the literature.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?We have cloned an induced white mutation and characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype?, white is an ambiguous term referring to the name of a gene.",
        "In NELL, ambiguity is limited using coupled semi-supervised learning (Carlson et al., 2009): if two categories in the ontology are declared mutually exclusive, instances of one category are used as negative examples for the other, and the two categories cannot share any instances.",
        "To resolve the ambiguity of white with mutual exclusion, we would have to include a Color category in the ontology, and declare it mutually exclusive with the Gene category.",
        "Then, instances of Color will not be able to refer to genes in the KB.",
        "It is hard to estimate what additional categories should be added, and building a ?complete?",
        "ontology tree is practically infeasible.",
        "NELL also includes a polysemy resolution component that acknowledges that one term, for example white, may refer to two distinct concepts, say a color and a gene, that map to different ontology categories, such as Color and Fly Gene (Krishna-murthy and Mitchell, 2011).",
        "By including a Color category, this component can identify that white is both a color and a gene.",
        "The polysemy resolver performs word sense induction and synonym resolution based on relations defined between categories in the ontology, and labeled synonym examples.",
        "However, at present, BioNELL's ontology does not contain relation definitions (it is based only on categories), so we cannot include this component in our experiments.",
        "Additionally, it is unclear how to avoid the use of polysemous terms as category seeds, and no method has been suggested for selecting seeds that are representative of a single specific category.",
        "To address the problem of ambiguity, we introduce a method for assessing the desirability of noun phrases to be used as seeds for a specific target category.",
        "We propose ranking seeds using a Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) based collocation measure for a seed and a category name.",
        "Collocation is measured based on a large corpus of domain-independent data derived from the Web, accounting for uses of the seed in many different contexts.",
        "NELL's bootstrapping algorithm uses the morphological and semantic features of seeds to propose new facts, which are added to the KB and used as seeds in the next bootstrapping iteration to learn more facts.",
        "This means that ambiguous terms may be added at any learning iteration.",
        "Since white really is a name of a gene, it is sometimes used in the same semantic context as other genes, and may be added to the KB despite not being used as an initial seed.",
        "To resolve this problem, we propose measuring seed quality in a Rank-and-Learn bootstrapping methodology: after every iteration, we rank all the instances that have been added to the KB by their quality as potential category seeds.",
        "Only high-ranking instances are used as seeds in the next iteration.",
        "Low-ranking instances are stored in the KB and ?remembered?",

        "An ambiguous set of seeds can lead to semantic drift, i.e., accumulation of erroneous terms and contexts when learning a semantic class.",
        "Strict bootstrapping environments reduce this problem by adding boundaries or limiting the learning process, including learning mutual terms and contexts (Riloff and Jones, 1999) and using mutual exclusion and negative class examples (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "McIntosh and Curran (2009) propose a metric for measuring the semantic drift introduced by a learned term, favoring terms different than the recent m learned terms and similar to the first n, (shown for n=20 and n=100), following the assumption that semantic drift develops in late bootstrapping iterations.",
        "As we will show, for biomedical categories, semantic drift in NELL occurs within a handful of iterations (< 5), however according to the authors, using low values for n produces inadequate results.",
        "In fact, selecting effective n and m parameters may not only be a function of the data being used, but also of the specific category, and it is unclear how to automatically tune them.",

        "Another approach, suggested by Kozareva et al. (2010), is using only constrained contexts where both seed and class are present in a sentence.",

        "For example, section 9 is a gene named after the functional unit to which it belongs, and abbreviated by the symbol 9.",
        "Clearly, removing 9 from the full lexicon should improve precision without great cost to recall.",
        "We similarly filtered the full dictionary, removing one-and two-letter abbreviations and terms composed only of non-alphabetical characters, leaving 6253 terms.",
        "Using the filtered dictionary, precision has doubled (18%) with minor compromise to recall.",
        "Using complete or manually refined gene dictionaries for named-entity recognition has been shown before to produce similar high-recall and low-precision results (Bunescu et al., 2005).",
        "We evaluated annotators on gene lexicons learned with BioNELL and NELL.",
        "BioNELL's lexicon achieved significantly higher precision (90%) than other lexicons (2%-18%).",
        "It is evident that this lexicon contains few ambiguous terms as it leads to only 2 false predictions.",

        "We have proposed a methodology for an open information extraction system for biomedical scientific text, using an automatically derived ontology of categories and seeds.",
        "Our implementation is based on constrained bootstrapping in which seeds are ranked at every iteration.",
        "The benefits of iterative seed ranking have been demonstrated, showing that our method leads to significantly less ambiguous lexicons for all the evaluated biomedical concepts.",
        "BioNELL shows 51% increase over NELL in the precision of a learned lexicon of chemical compounds, and 45% increase for a category of gene names.",
        "Importantly, when BioNELL and NELL learn lexicons of similar size, BioNELL's lexicons have both higher precision and recall.",
        "We have demonstrated the use of BioNELL's learned gene lexicon as a high precision annotator in an entity recognition task (with 90% precision).",
        "The results are promising, though it is currently difficult to provide a similar quantitative evaluation for a wider range of concepts.",
        "Many interesting improvements could be made in the current system, mainly discovery of relations between existing ontology categories.",
        "In addition, we believe that Rank-and-Learn bootstrapping and iterative seed ranking can be beneficial in general, domain-independent settings, and we would like to explore further use of this method."
