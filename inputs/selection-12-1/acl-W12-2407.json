        "Medical natural language processing techniques are potentially useful for extracting information contained in clinical texts, such as emergency department reports (Meystre et al., 2008).",
        "One important aspect to take into account when developing accurate information extraction tools is the ability to distinguish negated, affirmed, and uncertain information (Chu et al., 2006).",
        "Several research studies have targeted this problem and created annotation schemas and manually annotated reference standards for uncertainty and negation occurrence in news documents (Saur??",
        "and Pustejovsky (2009), Wiebe et al. (2001), Rubin et al. (2006)), biomedical research articles (Wilbur et al. (2006), Vincze et al. (2008)), and clinical narratives (Uzuner et al. (2011) and Uzuner et al. (2009)).",
        "There are encoding tools developed for automatic identification of uncertainty and negation in English, such as ConText (Harkema et al., 2009), which relies on heuristics and keyword lists, and MITRE's CARAFE (Clark et al., 2011), which combines heuristic and statistical techniques.",
        "However, most relevant annotation schemas, reference standards, and encoding tools are built for English documents.",
        "For smaller languages, such as Swedish, resources are scarce.",
        "We present a pilot, qualitative study to compare two different annotation schemas and subsequent annotated corpora for uncertainty modeling of disorder mentions, e.g., signs, symptoms, and diseases, in clinical texts, for two different languages: English and Swedish.",
        "We compare these annotation schemas and their instantiation in the two languages in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of how uncertainty and negation are expressed in different clinical texts with an emphasis on creating a portable uncertainty and negation application that generalizes among clinical texts of different languages.",
        "This pilot study is motivated for at least two reasons.",
        "First, little attention has been given to mapping, characterizing, or comparing annotation schemas built for different languages or to characterizing different types of uncertainty expressions and the intention underlying those expressions.",
        "Such knowledge is needed for building information extraction tools that can accurately identify or track differential diagnoses over time, particularly when medical reasoning can be laden with uncertainty about a disorder's existence or change over time.",
        "Second, building new resources for small languages is time consuming.",
        "Utilizing existing tools and techniques already developed for one language, such as English, could be an efficient way of developing new useful tools for other less exploited languages, such as Swedish.",
        "Our overall goal is to move towards improving automatic information extraction from clinical texts by leveraging language differences and similarities.",
        "In order to address this issue, our aims in this study are to 1) create a taxonomy for deepened characterization of how uncertainty and negation is expressed in clinical texts, 2) compare two existing uncertainty and negation annotation schemas from this perspective, and 3) compare differences and similarities in expressions of uncertainty and negation between two languages: English and Swedish."
