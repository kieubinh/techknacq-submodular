        "Domain event extraction has been advanced in particular by the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) events (Kim et al., 2011a; Kim et al., 2011b), which have introduced common task settings, datasets, and evaluation criteria for event extraction.",
        "Participants in these shared tasks have introduced dozens of systems for event extraction, and the resulting methods have been applied to automatically analyse the entire available domain literature (Bjo?rne et al., 2010) and applied in support of applications such as semantic literature search (Ohta et al., 2010; Van Landeghem et al., 2011b) and pathway curation support (Kemper et al., 2010).",
        "It is possible to assess recent advances in event extraction through results for a task considered both in the BioNLP ST 2009 and 2011.",
        "By the primary evaluation criteria, the highest performance achieved in the 2009 task was 51.95% F-score, and a 57.46% F-score was reached in the comparable 2011 task (Kim et al., 2011b).",
        "These results demonstrate significant advances in event extraction methods, but also indicate that the task continues to hold substantial challenges.",
        "This has led to a call from task participants for further analysis of the data and results, accompanied by a proposal to release analyses from individual systems to facilitate such analysis (Quirk et al., 2011).",
        "In this study, we explore new perspectives into the analyses and performance of event extraction methods.",
        "We build primarily on a new resource compiled with the support of the majority of groups participating in the BioNLP ST 2011, consisting of analyses from systems for the three main tasks sharing the text-bound event representation.",
        "We demonstrate the use of this resource through an evaluation focusing on events that cannot be extracted even by the union of combined systems, identifying particular remaining challenges for event extraction.",

        "In this work, we focus on the definition of the event extraction task first introduced in the BioNLP Shared Task 2009.1 The task targets the extraction of events, represented as nary associations of participants (entities or other events), each marked as playing a specific role such as Theme or Cause in the event.",
        "Each event is assigned a type such as BINDING or PHOSPHORYLATION from a fixed, task-specific set.",
        "Events are further typically associated with specific trigger expressions that state their occurrence in text.",
        "As physical entities such as proteins are also identified in the setting with specific spans referring to the real-world entities in text, the overall task is ?text-bound?",
        "in the sense of requiring not only the extraction of targeted statements from text, but also the identification of specific regions of text expressing each piece of extracted information.",
        "Events can further be marked with modifiers identifying additional features such as being explicitly negated or stated in a speculative context.",
        "Figure 1 shows an illustration of event annotations.",
        "This BioNLP ST 2009 formulation of the event extraction task was followed also in three 2011 main tasks: the GE (Kim et al., 2011c), ID (Pyysalo et al., 2011a) and EPI (Ohta et al., 2011) tasks.",
        "A variant of this representation that omits event triggers was applied in the BioNLP ST 2011 bacteria track (Bossy et al., 2011), and simpler, binary relation-type representations were applied in three supporting tasks (Nguyen et al., 2011; Pyysalo et al., 2011b; Jourde et al., 2011).",

        "Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of the total set of gold events remains inaccessible also to this system union.",
        "We then selected a random set of 100 events from each of the three sets of events that were not recovered by any system (i.e. 300 events in total) and performed a manual evaluation to identify frequent properties of these events that could contribute to extraction failures.",
        "In brief, we first performed a brief manual evaluation to identify common characteristics of these events, and then evaluated the 300 events individually to identify the set of these characteristics that apply to each event.",
        "The results of the evaluation for common cases are shown in Table 3.",
        "We find that the most frequent property of the unrecoverable events is that they involve implicit arguments (Gerber and Chai, 2010), a difficult challenge that has not been extensively considered in domain event extraction.",

        "an issue for approaches that assume each token can be assigned at most a single class.",

        "While there is an unavoidable subjective component to evaluations such as this, we note that a similar evaluation performed following the BioNLP Shared Task 2009 using test set data reached broadly comparable results (Kim et al., 2011a).",
        "The newly compiled dataset represents the first opportunity for those without direct access to the test set data and submissions to directly assess the task results, as demonstrated here.",
