        "Nevertheless, the semantic relations are important to various NLP tasks within general or specialized languages (i.e., query expansions, information retrieval and extraction, text mining or machine translation) and their deciphering must be tackled by automatic approaches.",
        "We focus in this work on synonymy relations.",
        "Thus, it is important to be able to decide whether two terms (i.e., anabolism and acetone anabolism, acetone anabolism and acetone biosynthesis, replication of mitochondrial DNA and mtDNA replication) convey the same, close or different meanings.",
        "According to the ability of an automatic system to decipher such relations, the answers of the system will be more or less exhaustive.",

        "However, in the biomedical domain, such resources are not well described.",
        "If the morphological description is the most complete (NLM, 2007; Schulz et al., 1999; Zweigenbaum et al., 2003), little or no freely available synonym resources can be found, while the existing terminologies often lack the synonyms.",

        "Due to the lack of resources, we propose to exploit the solutions 2 and 3.",
        "In either of these situations, the question arises about the robustness and the validity of the acquired relations.",
        "For instance, (Hamon and Grabar, 2008) face two problems: (1) contextual character of synonymy relations (Cruse, 1986), i.e., two words are considered as synonyms if they can occur within the same context, which makes this relation more or less broad depending on the usage; (2) ability of automatic tools to detect and characterize these relations, i.e., two words taken out of their context can convey different relations than the one expected.",
        "Our objective is to assess the reliability of synonymy resources.",
        "We propose to weight and to filter the synonym relations with the pager-ank-derived algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998).",

        "This last work takes into account the usage of a given word in corpora and its known synonyms from lexical resources.",
        "Other related works propose also the exploitation of the random walk algorithm for the detection of semantic relatedness of words (Gaume, 2006; Hughes and Ramage, 2007) and of documents (Hassan et al., 2007).",
        "Our work is different from the previous work in several ways: (1) the acquisition of synonymy is done on resources provided by a specialized domain; (2) the pager-ank algorithm is exploited for the filtering of semantic relations generated with linguistically-based approaches; (3) the pagerank algorithm is adapted to the small size of the processed data.",

        "macro-precision is superior to micro-precision because our data contain mainly small groups,",
        "while the few large connected components have a very low precision; ?",
        "there is but a small difference between connected components (figure 5(a)) and groups (figure 5(b)); ?",
        "the consideration of is-a relations and of lexical inclusions provides the best precision but the amount of the remaining synonyms is then the lowest.",
        "As we explained, it is important to keep the highest number of the correct relations, although when a lot of relations is removed, it is logical to obtain a higher precision.",
        "This means that the combination of is-a relations and of lexical inclusions is not suitable because it removes too much of synonyms.",
        "In relation with this last observation, is should be noted that the balance between the removed and the remaining relations is a subtle parameter.",
        "The obtained results indicate that the pagerank is indeed useful for the filtering of synonyms, although the parameters exploited by this algorithm must be defined accurately.",
        "Thus, it appears that synonymy alone may be sufficient for this filtering.",
        "When the quality indicators are considered, is-a relations are suitable for this filtering because very often they propose true hierarchical relations.",
        "However, the lexical inclusions have a negative effect of the filtering.",
        "We assume this is due to the fact that the lexical inclusions are ambiguous: they may convey hierarchical relations but also equivalence relations (Haralambous and Lavagnino, 2011).",
        "Indeed, contextually some terms may be shortened or may be subject to an elision while their meaning is not impacted.",
        "Currently, the pagerank is limited by the fact that it is applied to a relatively small set of data while it is designed to process very large data.",
        "Then, it can be interesting to enrich the model and to be able to take into account other quality indicators, such as frequencies, productivity or other semantic relations proposed within GO (part-of and regulates).",
        "Moreover, we can also give a lesser weight to some indicators (such as lexical inclusions) with penalties and keep the strong weight for other indicators.",
        "In the current model of the pagerank, we threshold rows to < 0.95.",
        "However, we assume that the algorithm may have problems with very large and very connected graphs: the pagerank may spread out in the graph too much and possibly allow the first words with the highest pagerank to make groups with only one word.",
        "This can be corrected if an additional calculation is added and when the group contains only one word at step 5."

        "This method can be adapted for the processing of corpora and also applied to terms from other terminologies.",
        "The acquired and filtered synonymy relations will be exploited within the NLP applications in order to test the efficiency of these resources and also the usefulness and efficiency of their filtering.",
