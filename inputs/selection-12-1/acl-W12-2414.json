        "Ng et al. (2002) improved this learning framework and achieved F-scores of 70.4 and 63.4 respectively on the same datasets.",
        "There are also a number of freely available off-the-shelf coreference resolution modules developed for the general domain.",
        "For example, BART (Vers-ley et al., 2008) is an open source coreference resolution system which provides an implementation of the Soon et al. algorithm (2001).",

        "Similarly, the GATE Information Extraction system (Cunningham et al., 2002) includes a rule-based coreference resolution module consisting of orthography-based patterns and a pronominal coreferencer (matching pronouns to the most recent referent).",

        "The importance and distinctive characteristics of coreference resolution for biomedical articles has been recognized, for example (Castano et al., 2002; Gasperin, 2006; Gasperin et al., 2007; Suet al, 2008).",

        "Radiology reports have some unique characteristics that preclude the use of coreference resolution modules or algorithms developed for the general biomedical domain or even for other types of clinical texts.",
        "The radiology report is a clinical text used to communicate medical image findings and observations to referring physicians.",
        "Typically, radiology reports are produced by radiologists after examining medical images and are used to describe the findings and observations present in the accompanied images.",
        "The radiology report accompanies an imaging study and frequently refers to artifacts present in the image.",
        "In radiology reports, artifacts present in the image exhibit discourse salience, and as a result are often introduced with definite pronouns and articles.",
        "For example, consider the sentence The pericardial space is clear.",
        "The definite noun phrase the pericardial space does not represent an anaphoric (or cataphoric) discourse entity and has no antecedent.",
        "In contrast, coreference resolution in general texts typically considers definite noun phrases to be anaphoric discourse entities and attempts to find their antecedents.",
        "Another important distinction between general purpose coreference resolution and the coreference resolution module needed by an NLP system for clinical texts is the scope of the task.",
        "General purpose coreference resolution systems typically cluster all mentions in a document into coreference chains.",
        "Such comprehensive mention clustering is often not necessary for the purposes of clinical text NLP systems.",
        "Biomedical Information Extraction systems typically first identify named entities (medical concepts) and map them to unambiguous biomedical standard vocabularies (e.g. UMLS2 or RadLex3 in the radiological domain).",
