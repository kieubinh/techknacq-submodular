        "Thanks to improving technology and the discovery of stronger statistical methods, natural language processing techniques have more power than ever to give us insights into real datasets too large for humans to efficiently process.",
        "In the field of BioNLP, we see that natural language processing has a wide range of applications within the medical domain from analysis of clinical data to literature.",
        "With the increasing amount of publications in this growing field, building a classification structure is helpful both for categorizing papers in a sensible way and for recognizing the trends that brought the field to where it is today.",
        "Understanding the current nature of the field can show us where the most effort is needed, while taking a look at where the field has been can highlight successes and even unanswered questions.",
        "As the use of NLP in the medical domain has expanded in recent years so has the amount of freely-available online research.",
        "With this wealth of information comes a problem, however, as it is not truly feasible for humans to read through all the research out there and classify it in a way that will capture the less-obvious trends and the finer relationships between seemingly-disconnected works.",
        "Instead, we propose that statistical methods can help us discover both the most reasonable way to partition the field and also see how the research has changed over the past decade.",
        "The longer term goal for the work is to contribute to a ?map?",
        "of the field that can be a community resource, such as www.medlingmap.org, described in Meteer, et al. (2012).",
        "Schuemie et al. (2009) used clustering techniques to analyze the domain of Medical Informatics.",
        "They processed a large number of Medline abstracts to find a subset of the journals classified as ?Medical Informatics?",
        "whose content was sufficiently related to constitute a basis for the field.",
        "Using hierarchical clustering, they determined that such a group of journals exists and, as we might expect, the rest of the journals were largely disconnected.",
        "They also used this cluster of journals as the basis for a topic modeling task.",
        "Analyzing the articles from their new basis of journals, they found three very strong, topic-based clusters, each comprised of three sub-clusters.",
        "Overall, Schuemie et al. (2009) demonstrated how it is possible to gain a great deal of insight into the nature of a field by using statistical methods over that field's literature.",
        "More recently, Gupta and Manning (2011) used automatic methods to tag documents for ?focus,?",
        "?technique,?",
        "and ?domain?",
        "by examining",
        "over 15,000 ACL abstracts.",
        "This level of categorization is useful because it expands beyond the simple notion of the ?topic?",
        "to implicitly show if a work, for example, is about an application of named-entity recognition or if it simply uses NER to achieve a greater task.",
        "The techniques demonstrated by Gupta and Manning could be very enlightening if applied to the BioNLP proceedings, though in this paper we refrain from drawing conclusions about individual papers.",
        "Instead, we will relate them through the topics extracted from the full-text proceedings.",
        "For our task, we look to the ACL and NAACL-associated workshops on NLP applications in the medical domain.",
        "Entering its 11th year, the BioNLP workshop (under a variety of names) has given us ten rich and varied proceedings in addition to a pair of more focused shared tasks.",
        "All in all, the workshops have produced over 270 unique papers.",
        "Our data of 270 documents was small relative to (Schuemie et al., 2009) 6.3 million documents; therefore, we chose to expand our analysis to the full text of the documents instead of just the abstracts.",
        "Additionally, using the full papers allowed us to capture information about document content that abstracts alone could not provide."

        "Using the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002), we were able to generate topics from our cleaned data using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.",
        "This approach allows us to represent each document as a vector of topic proportions instead of a bag of words, which prevents the problem of sparsity.",
        "When we set the number of topics to 30, the system output a set of distinct topics that seem to describe a range of tasks and methods within the domain of BioNLP.",
        "The topics generated by the LDA model reflect areas of study that are being pursued, techniques that are being applied, and resources that are being consulted in the field.",
        "A list of the generated topics along with the associated keywords is shown in Table 1 and the distributions of the topics across the entire document set is displayed in Figure 1.",
        "Additionally, we found that the topics generated by LDA were more informative about the full content of a work than those generated by TF-IDF as TF-IDF would often give too much weight to specific examples over general concepts.",
        "For example, TF-IDF tended to select specific names of resources and ontologies rather than general terms.",
        "For example, it selected ?Frame-net?",
        "instead ?ontology?",
        "and ?RadLex?",
        "instead of ?lexicon?.",
        "We concluded that, while interesting, TF-IDF results were not strongly suited for capturing an overall glimpse of the field.",
        "However, we think that TF-IDF can be much more useful in its more traditional capacity of finding document-specific keywords; we aim to use these indices to partially automate keyword generation for MedlingMap (Meteer et al., 2012), which is our accompanying project."

        "While looking at the topic proportions for each of our LDA topics overall can help us paint a broad picture of the field, it can also help to look at the relationship between these topics as they occur in the documents.",
        "Some topics appear highly ranked in nearly all papers, such as the topic that is characterized by terms such as ?system?",
        "and ?results?, and the topic that includes ?precision?",
        "and ?recall?",

        "topics refer to tasks (e.g. named-entity recognition, hedging) and others refer to techniques (e.g. CRFs, parsing).",
        "We can look at how often pairs of task-related topic and method-related topic co-occur to see if researchers in the community are using certain techniques in conjunction with solving certain problems.",
        "We first turned a topic proportion vector into a binary vector where each element indicates which topic is discussed more extensively than average.",
        "Then, we counted the co-occurrences of tasks and methods of interest.",
        "To demonstrate this, we computed the number of papers that substantially discuss event extraction in conjunction with parsing, graph, lexical categories, or semantic knowledge (Figure 2).",
        "This topic comparison method provides a means of visualizing how researchers in the field are approaching BioNLP problems.",
        "It reveals that parsing and graph-based methods are commonly used in biological event extraction, while lexical categories and semantic knowledge are not as central to many of the approaches to this task.",
        "Moving forward, tracking how these correlations change over time will provide an insightful reflection of the field's progress on the task in a more meaningful way than evaluation scores alone.",
        "While a deeper analysis of all of such trends is beyond the scope of this paper, it certainly warrants further investigation.",
        "Our analysis of temporal trends builds on the idea proposed by (Hall et al., 2008) in their analysis of the changing trends in the field of computational linguistics over time.",
        "In their approach, they attempted, among other things, to analyze which topics were up and coming in the field and which were becoming less popular.",
        "Given their sound results, we decided to perform the same kind of trend analysis over the BioNLP topics.",
        "For many of our 30 topics, there was little change in the topic frequency over time.",
        "Considering the relative youth of the BioNLP field, this result is not entirely surprising.",
        "We did, however, find a few topics that have undergone notable changes in these past ten years, as observable in Figure 3.",
        "In particular, we found that two topics have seen surges of activity in recent years, whereas there were three topics that started out strong in the early years but that have since petered off.",
        "The two topics that have gained popularity in the past few years both involve biomedical events.",
        "Specifically, one such topic is primarily about event extraction tasks, and the other is about event triggers and the more fine-grained roles one needs to tag to categorize such events.",
        "The popularity of these two tasks is hardly surprising, given that they were the focus of the 2009 and 2011 shared tasks which were about working with events in both general and detailed ways.",
        "We do notice, however, that the growing trends continue in 2010 as well, when there was no shared task, and so we can see that events are of great interest in the field at present even without the added incentive of the shared tasks.",
        "It is reasonable to suggest that the 2009 BioNLP Shared Task in event extraction generated interest in the topic that continued through 2010 and 2011.",
        "Two more topics originally saw their popularity rise in the early years, but have",
        "since seen it fade.",
        "Each of these is a specific task: named-entity recognition, which dropped off after 2004, and protein interaction, which saw a sharp decline after 2005.",
        "Although a detailed causal analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, we might wonder what accounts for these drops in topic proportion.",
        "The explanation that seems most likely is that great strides were made in these areas early on, but we have since reached a plateau in advancements.",
        "As such, the research has moved elsewhere.",
        "The only topic to see a steady decrease from the start was the topic associated with the Unified Medical Language System.",
        "In general, we can view a trend associated with a resource differently from one associated with a task.",
        "Above, when discussing tasks, we saw where the research currently has been heading and where it has been.",
        "With a resource, we could consider an upward trend to represent either an increased number of applications to a task or perhaps an expansion of the resource itself.",
        "In the case of UMLS, the downward trend likely suggests that the field has moved away from this particular resource, either because it does not apply as well to newer tasks or because it has been replaced with something more powerful."
