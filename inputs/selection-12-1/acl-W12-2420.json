        "However, the curation process is slow and cannot keep up with ongoing publications.",
        "Moreover, not all associations between biological concepts can be found in these databases.",
        "Another source of information is the scientific literature itself.",
        "However, searching for biological facts and how they might be related is often cumbersome.",
        "The work presented in this paper tries to automate the process of finding sentences that clearly describe relationships between biological concepts.",
        "We rank all sentences mentioning two concepts and pick the top one to show to the user.",

        "Systems to facilitate knowledge exploration of genes are being built for the biomedical domain.",
        "One of them, eGIFT (Tudor et al., 2010), tries to identify iTerms (informative terms) for a gene based on frequency of co-occurrence (see Figure 1 for top 15 terms selected for gene Groucho).",
        "iTerms are unigrams, bigrams, and exact matches of biomedical terms gathered from various controlled vocabularies.",
        "Thus, iTerms can be of any type (e.g., processes, domains, drugs, other genes, etc.",
        "), the types being determined by what is being described about the gene in the literature.",
        "The iTerms for a gene are ranked based on a score that compares their frequencies of occurrence in publications mentioning the gene in question with their frequencies in a background set of articles about a wide variety of genes.",
        "Previous evaluation of eGIFT by life scientists suggested that there is almost always some kind of relationship between a gene and its iTerms.",
        "These relationships can be many and varied from one gene-term pair to another.",
        "Sometimes a user might make an erroneous assumption about a gene-term association if sentences supporting the association are not immediately inspected.",
        "For example, upon seeing ?co-repressor?",
        "in connection to gene Groucho, eGIFT users might correctly assume that Groucho is 1Throughout the paper, the word ?gene?",
        "will be used for both the gene and its products.",
        "a co-repressor (i.e., a protein that binds to transcription factors).",

        "But this would be a wrong assumption, since in actuality the wrpw motif is contained within other genes that interact with Groucho, fact which is evident from reading sentences containing the gene and the motif.",

        "One way to do this is by employing the pointwise approach, which requires absolute judgments (i.e. the annotator scores each sentence in a list or ranks the sentences based on their relevance to the given task).",
        "A second approach is the pairwise approach, which requires the iteration of preference judgments (i.e., the annotator is presented with two sentences at a time, and is asked to chose one as more relevant to the task than the other).",
        "In order to simplify the annotator's task, as well as construct a more reliable training set, we used the pairwise approach.",
        "Our decision was influenced by Carterette et al. (2008), who showed that preference judgments are faster and easier to make than absolute judgments.",
        "Thus, we can obtain many annotated instances in a relatively short amount of time.",

        "We have developed a system which aims to identify sentences that clearly and succinctly describe the relation between two entities.",
        "We used a set of preference judgements, as provided by biologists, to learn an SVM model that could make a choice between any two sentences mentioning these entities.",
        "The model compares favorably with baselines on both the task of choosing between two sentences, as well as ranking a set of sentences.",
        "The performance for choosing between two sentences was 83.10%, as compared to 65.75% and 71.69% for the two baselines, respectively.",
        "For choosing one sentence from a list of sentences, the performance was 80%, as compared to 58% and 61%.",
        "Furthermore, when the entire list of ranked sentences was evaluated, the system reported a nDCG of 77.19%, compared to 68.36% and 68.32% for the two baselines.",
        "The model's performance was also shown to be significantly better when sentence simplification was used.",
        "We were able to match relation patterns on complex sentences, and observed an increase of 10.96%, 13%, and 7.74% for the three evaluations afore-mentioned, respectively.",
        "It is noteworthy that, without the simplification, the performance is only slightly better than the second baseline.",
        "This is because the second baseline uses information that is also used by our system, although this does not include the lexico-syntactic patterns that identify the type of relation between the gene and the term.",
        "Given that the full system's performance is much better than both baselines, and that the system's performance without simplification is only slightly better than the second baseline, we believe that: (1) the pattern and type of relation determination are important, and (2) sentence simplification is crucial for the determination of the relationship type.",
        "We are currently pursuing summaries for genes.",
        "Since iTerms have been shown in previous evaluations to represent important aspects of a gene's functionality and behavior, we are investigating whether they are represented in gene summaries found in En-trezGene and UniProtKB.",
        "If so, an extractive summary can be produced by choosing sentences for the gene and its iTerms.",
        "We are also considering developing abstractive summaries.",
        "Our use of lexico-syntactic patterns can be extended to pick the exact relation between a gene and the iTerm.",
        "For example, by using the lexico-syntactic patterns, coupled with simplification, we can extract the following exact relations from the four sentences shown in Figure 1: ?Groucho is a corepressor?, ?The wrpw motif recruits groucho?, ?Groucho is implicated in notch signaling?, and ?The eh1 repression domain binds groucho?.",
        "With these relations extracted, using text generation algorithms for textual realization and cohesion, we can produce abstractive summaries.",
        "We would also like to investigate how to generalize this work to other pairs of entities, as well as how to generalize this work for other applications which may or may not require the same features as the ones we used."
