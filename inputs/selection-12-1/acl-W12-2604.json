        "There is little evidence of widespread adoption of speech summarization systems.",
        "This may be due in part to the fact that the natural language heuristics used to generate summaries are often optimized with respect to a class of evaluation measures that, while computationally and experimentally inexpensive, rely on subjectively selected gold standards against which automatically generated summaries are scored.",
        "This evaluation protocol does not take into account the usefulness of a summary in assisting the listener in achieving his or her goal.",
        "In this paper we study how current measures and methods for evaluating summarization systems compare to human-centric evaluation criteria.",
        "For this, we have designed and conducted an ecologically valid evaluation that determines the value of a summary when embedded in a task, rather than how closely a summary resembles a gold standard.",
        "The results of our evaluation demonstrate that in the domain of lecture summarization, the well-known baseline of maximal marginal relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) is statistically significantly worse than human-generated extractive summaries, and even worse than having no summary at all in a simple quiz-taking task.",
        "Priming seems to have no statistically significant effect on the usefulness of the human summaries.",
        "In addition, ROUGE scores and, in particular, the context-free annotations that are often supplied to ROUGE as references, may not always be reliable as inexpensive proxies for ecologically valid evaluations.",
        "In fact, under some conditions, relying exclusively on ROUGE may even lead to scoring human-generated summaries that are inconsistent in their usefulness relative to using no summaries very favourably."

        "Summarization maintains a representation of an entire spoken document, focusing on those utterances (sentence-like units) that are most important and therefore does not require the user to process everything that has been said.",
        "Our work focuses on extractive summarization where a selection of utterances is chosen from the original spoken document in order to make up a summary.",
        "Current speech summarization research has made extensive use of intrinsic evaluation measures such as F-measure, Relative Utility, and ROUGE (Lin, 2004), which score summaries against subjectively selected gold standard summaries obtained using human annotators.",
        "These annotators are asked to arbitrarily select (in or out) or rank utterances, and in doing so commit to relative salience judgements with no attention to goal orientation and no requirement to synthesize the meanings of larger units of structure into a coherent message.",
        "Given this subjectivity, current intrinsic evaluation measures are unable to properly judge which summaries are useful for real-world applications.",
        "For example, intrinsic evaluations have failed to show that summaries created by algorithms based on complex linguistic and acoustic features are better than baseline summaries created by simply choosing the positionally first utterances or longest utterances in a spoken document (Penn and Zhu, 2008).",
        "What is needed is an ecologically valid evaluation that determines how valuable a summary is when embedded in a task, rather than how closely a summary matches the subjective utterance level scores assigned by annotators.",
        "Ecological validity is \"the ability of experiments to tell us how real people operate in the real world\" (Cohen, 1995).",
        "This is often obtained by using human judges, but it is important to realize that the mere use of human subjects provides no guarantee as to the ecological validity of their judgements.",
        "When utterances are merely ranked with numerical scores out of context, for example, the human judges who perform this task are not performing a task that they generally perform in their daily lives, nor does the task correspond to how they would create or use a good summary if they did have a need for one.",
        "In fact, there may not even be a guarantee that they understand the task --- the notions of ?importance,?",
        "?salience?",
        "and the like, when defining the criterion by which utterances are selected, are not easy to circumscribe.",
        "Judgements obtained in this fashion are no better than those of the generative linguists who leaned back in their armchairs in the 1980s to introspect on the grammaticality of natural language sentences.",
        "The field of computational linguistics could only advance when corpora became electronically available to investigate language that was written in an ecologically valid context.",
        "Ours is not the first ecologically valid experiment to be run in the context of speech summarization, however.",
        "He et al. (1999; 2000) conducted a very thorough and illuminating study of speech summarization in the lecture domain that showed (1) speech summaries are indeed very useful to have around, if they are done properly, and (2) abstractive summaries do not seem to add any statistically significant advantage to the quality of a summary over what topline extractive summaries can provide.",
        "This is very good news; extractive summaries are worth creating.",
        "Our study extends this work by attempting to evaluate the relative quality of extractive summaries.",
        "We conjecture that it would be very difficult for this field to progress unless we have a means of accurately measuring extractive summarization quality.",
        "Even if the measure comes at great expense, it is important to do.",
        "Another noteworthy paper is that of Liu and Liu (2010), who, in addition to collecting human summaries of six meetings, conducted a subjective assessment of the quality of those summaries with numerically scored questionnaires.",
        "These are known as Likert scales, and they form an important component of any human-subject study in the field of human-computer interaction.",
        "Liu and Liu (2010) cast considerable doubt on the value of ROUGE relative to these questionnaires.",
        "We will focus here on an objective, task-based measure that typically complements those subjective assessments."

        "Spontaneous speech is often not linguistically well-formed, and contains disfluencies, such as false starts, filled pauses, and repetitions.",
        "Additionally, spontaneous speech is more vulnerable to automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors, resulting in a higher word error rate (WER).",
        "As such, speech summarization has the most potential for domains consisting of spontaneous speech (e.g. lectures, meeting recordings).",
        "Unfortunately, these domains are not easy to evaluate compared to highly structured domains such as broadcast news.",
        "Furthermore, in broadcast news, nearly perfect studio acoustic conditions and professionally trained readers results in low ASR WER, making it an easy domain to summarize.",
        "The result is that most research has been conducted in this domain.",
        "However, a positional baseline performs very well in summarizing broadcast news (Christensen, 2004), meaning that simply taking the first N utterances provides a very challenging baseline, questioning the value of summarizing this domain.",
        "In addition, the widespread availability of written sources on the same topics means that there is not a strong use case for speech summarization over simply summarizing the equivalent textual articles on which the news broadcasts were based.",
        "This makes it even more difficult to preserve ecological validity.",
        "University lectures present a much more relevant domain, with less than ideal acoustic conditions but structured presentations in which deviation",
        "from written sources (e.g., textbooks) is commonplace.",
        "Here, a positional baseline performs very poorly.",
        "The lecture domain also lends itself well to a task-based evaluation measure; namely university level quizzes or exams.",
        "This constitutes a real-world problem in a domain that is also representative of other spontaneous speech domains that can benefit from speech summarization."

        "Increasingly, such user-centric evaluations are carried out within various natural language processing applications (Munteanu et al., 2006).",
        "The prevailing trend in HCI is for conducting extrinsic summary evaluations (He et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2008; Tucker et al., 2010), where the value of a summary is determined by how well the summary can be used to perform a specific task rather than comparing the content of a summary to an artificially created gold standard.",
        "We have conducted an ecologically valid evaluation of speech summarization that has evaluated summaries under real-world conditions, in a task-based manner.",
        "The university lecture domain is an example of a domain where summaries are an especially suitable tool for navigation.",
        "Simply performing a search will not result in the type of understanding required of students in their lectures.",

        "For these reasons, we have chosen this domain for our evaluation.",
        "By using actual university lectures as well as university students representative of the users who would make use of a speech summarization system in this domain, all results obtained are ecologically valid.",
        "3.1Experimental Overview We conducted a within-subject experiment where participants were provided with first year sociology university lectures on a lecture browser system installed on a desktop computer.",
        "For each lecture, the browser made accessible the audio, manual transcripts, and an optional summary.",
        "Evaluation of a summary was based on how well the user of the summary was able to complete a quiz based on the content of the original lecture material.",
        "It is important to note that not all extrinsic evaluation is ecologically valid.",
        "To ensure ecological validity in this study, great care was taken to ensure that human subjects were placed under conditions that result in behavior that would be expected in actual real-world tasks.",
        "3.2Evaluation Each quiz consisted of 12 questions, and were designed to be representative of what students were expected to learn in the class, incorporating factual questions only, to ensure that variation in participant intelligence had a minimal impact on results.",
        "In addition, questions involved information that was distributed equally throughout the lecture, but at the same time not linearly in the transcript or audio slider, which would have allowed participants to predict where the next answer might be located.",
        "Finally, questions were designed to avoid content that was thought to be common knowledge in order to minimize the chance of participants having previous knowledge of the answers.",
        "All questions were short answer or fill-in-the-blank.",
        "Each quiz consisted of an equal number of four distinct types of questions, designed so that performing a simple search would not be effective, though no search functionality was provided.",
        "Question types do not appear in any particular order on the quiz and were not grouped together.",
        "Type 1: These questions can be answered simply by looking at the slides.",
        "As such, these questions could be answered correctly with or without a summary as slides were available in all conditions.",
        "Type 2: Slides provide an indication of where the content required to answer these questions are located.",
        "Access to the corresponding utterances is still required to find the answer to the questions.",
        "Type 3: Answers to these questions can only be found in the transcript and audio.",
        "The slides provide no hint as to where the relevant content is located.",
        "Type 4: These questions are more complicated and require a certain level of topic comprehension.",
        "These questions often require connecting concepts from various portions of the lecture.",
        "These questions are more difficult and were included to minimize the chance that participants would already know the answer to questions without watching the lecture.",
        "A teaching assistant for the sociology class from which our lectures were obtained generated the quizzes used in the evaluation.",
        "This teaching assistant had significant experience in the course, but was not involved in the design of this study and did not have any knowledge relating to our hypotheses or the topic of extractive summarization.",
        "These quizzes provided an ecologically valid quantitative measure of whether a given summary was useful.",
        "Having this evaluation metric in place, automated summaries were compared to manual summaries created by each participant in a previous session.",

        "Students who had taken the first year sociology course we drew lectures from were not permitted to participate.",
        "The study was conducted with 48 participants over the course of approximately one academic semester.",
        "3.4Method Each evaluation session began by having a participant perform a short warm-up with a portion of lecture content, allowing the participant to become familiar with the lecture browser interface.",
        "Following this, the participant completed four quizzes, one for each of four lecture-condition combinations.",
        "There were a total of four lectures and four conditions.",
        "Twelve minutes were given for each quiz.",

        "Lectures and conditions were rotated using a Latin square for counter balancing.",
        "All participants completed each of the four conditions.",
        "One week prior to his or her evaluation session, each participant was brought in and asked to listen to and summarize the lectures beforehand.",
        "This resulted in the evaluation simulating a scenario where someone has heard a lecture at least one week in the past and may or may not remember the content during an exam or quiz.",
        "This is similar to conditions most university students experience.",
        "3.5Conditions The lecture audio recordings were manually transcribed and segmented into utterances, determined by 200 millisecond pauses, resulting in segments that correspond to natural sentences or phrases.",
        "The task of summarization consisted of choosing a set of utterances for inclusion in a summary (extractive summarization), where the total summary length was bounded by 17-23% of the words in the lecture; a percentage typical to most summarization scoring tasks.",
        "All participants were asked to make use of the browser interface for four lectures, one for each of the following conditions: no summary, generic manual summary, primed manual summary, and automatic summary.",
        "No summary: This condition served as a baseline where no summary was provided, but participants had access to the audio and transcript.",
        "While all lecture material was provided, the twelve-minute time constraint made it impossible to listen to the lecture in its entirety.",

        "Automatic summary: The procedure for this condition was identical to the generic manual summary condition from the point of view of the participant.",
        "However, during the evaluation phase, an automatically generated summary was provided instead of the summary that the participant created him or herself.",
        "The algorithm used to generate this summary was an implementation of MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "Cosine similarity with tf-idf term weighting was used to calculate similarity.",
        "Although the redundancy component of MMR makes it especially suitable for multi-document summarization, there is no negative effect if redundancy is not an issue.",
        "It is worth noting that our lectures are longer than material typically summarized, and lectures in general are more likely to contain redundant material than a domain such as broadcast news.",
        "There was only one MMR summary generated for each lecture, meaning that multiple participants made use of identical summaries.",
        "The automatic summary was created by adding the highest scoring utterances one at a time until the sum of the length of all of the selected utterances reached 20% of the number of words in the original lecture.",
        "MMR was chosen as it is commonly used in summarization.",
        "MMR is a competitive baseline, even among state-of-art summarization algorithms, which tend to correlate well with it.",

        "Quizzes were marked as they would be in the actual course and each question was graded with equal weight out of two marks.",
        "The scores were then converted to a percentage.",
        "The resulting scores (Table 1) are 49.3+-17.3% for the no summary condition, 48.0+-16.2% for the generic manual summary condition, 49.1+-15.2% for the primed summary condition, and 41.0+-16.9% for MMR.",
        "These scores are lower than averages expected in a typical university course.",
        "This can be partially attributed to the existence of a time constraint.",
        "Execution of the Shapiro-Wilk Test confirmed the scores are normally distributed and Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicates that the sphericity assumption holds.",
        "Skewness and Kurtosis tests were also employed to confirm normality.",
        "A repeated measures ANOVA determined that scores varied significantly between conditions (F(3,141)=5.947, P=0.001).",
        "Post-hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction indicate that the no summary, generic manual summary, and primed manual summary conditions all resulted in higher scores than the automatic (MMR) summary condition.",

        "This seems unintuitive at first, but could potentially be explained by the possibility that different participants focused on different aspects of the priming quiz, due to either perceived importance, or lack of time (or summary space) to address all of the priming questions.",
        "We also observe that generic summaries are more similar to conventionally annotated (context-free) summaries than either primed or MMR are.",
