        "This paper presents a method for an AAC system to predict a whole response given features of the previous utterance from the interlocutor.",
        "It uses a large corpus of scripted dialogs, computes a variety of lexical, syntactic and whole phrase features for the previous utterance, and predicts features that the response should have, using an entropy-based measure.",
        "We evaluate the system on a held-out portion of the corpus.",
        "We find that for about 3.5% of cases in the held-out corpus, we are able to predict a response, and among those, over half are either exact or at least reasonable substitutes for the actual response.",
        "We also present some results on keystroke savings.",
        "Finally we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art chatbot, and show (not surprisingly) that a system like ours, tuned for a particular style of conversation, outperforms one that is not.",
        "Predicting possible responses automatically by mining a corpus of dialogues is a novel contribution to the literature on whole utterance-based methods in AAC.",
        "Also useful, we believe, is our estimate that about 3.5-4.0% of utterances in dialogs are in principle predictable given previous context."

        "In recent years, there has been an increased interest in whole utterance-based and discourse-based approaches (see Section 2).",
        "Such approaches have been argued to be beneficial in that they can speed up the conversation, thus making it appear more felicitous (McCoy et al., 2007).",
        "Most commercial tablets sold as AAC devices contain an inventory of canned phrases, comprising such items as common greetings, polite phrases, salutations and so forth.",
        "Users can also enter their own phrases, or indeed entire sequences of phrases (e.g., for a prepared talk).",
        "The work presented here attempts to take whole phrase prediction one step further by automatically predicting appropriate responses to utterances by mining conversational text.",
        "In an actual deployment, one would present a limited number of predicted phrases in a prominent location on the user's device, along with additional input options.",
        "The user could then select from these phrases, or revert to other input methods.",
        "In actual use, one would also want such a system to incorporate speech recognition (ASR), but for the present we restrict ourselves to typed text ?",
        "which is perfectly appropriate for some modes of interaction such as on-line social media domains.",
        "Using a corpus of 72 million words from American soap operas, we isolate features useful in predicting an appropriate set of responses for the previous utterance of an interlocutor.",
        "The main results of this work are a method that can automati",

        "is central to smooth-flowing conversation (King et al., 1995).",
        "Many modern AAC systems therefore provide canned small-talk phrases (Alm et al., 1993; Todman et al., 2008).",
        "More complex conversational utterances are challenging to predict, and recent systems have used a variety of approaches to generate longer phrases from minimal user input.",
        "One approach relies on telegraphic input, where full sentences are constructed from a set of uninflected words, as in the Compansion system (McCoy et al., 1998).",
        "This system employs a semantic parser to capture the meaning of the input words and generates using the Functional Unification Formalism (FUF) system (Elhadad, 1991).",
        "One of the limitations of this approach is that information associated with each word is primarily hand-coded on the basis of intuition; as a result, the system cannot handle the problem of unrestricted vocabulary.",
        "Similar issues arise in semantic authoring systems (Netzer and Elhadad, 2006), where at each step of the sentence creation process, the system offers possible symbols for a small set of concepts, and the user can select which is intended.",

        "Midge requires as input a set of nouns and then builds likely syntactic structure around them, and so we use the dialogues to predict possible nouns in response to an input utterance.",
        "For each <utterance, response> pair in the dialogues, we gather all utterance nouns nu and all response nouns nr.",
        "We then compute normalized pointwise mutual information (nPMI) for each nu, nr pair type in the corpus.",
        "Given a novel input utterance, we tag it to extract the nouns and create the set of highest nPMI nouns from the model.",
        "This is then input to Midge, which uses the set to generate present-tense declarative sentences.",
        "Some examples are given in Figure 4.",
        "We hope to expand on this approach in future work.",
        "A further improvement is to take advantage of synonymy.",
        "There are many ways to convey the same basic message: i am sick, i am not feeling well, i?m under the weather, are all ways for a speaker to convey that he or she is not in the best of health.",
        "In the current system, these are all treated separately.",
        "Clearly what is needed is a way of recognizing that these are all paraphrases of each other.",
        "Fortunately, there has been a lot of progress in recent years on paraphrasing ?",
        "see Ganitkevitch et al. (2011) for a recent example ?",
        "and such work could in principle be adapted to the problem here.",
        "Indeed it seems likely that incorporating paraphrasing into the system will be a major source of improved coverage.",
        "A limitation of the work described here is that it only models turn-to-turn interactions.",
        "Clearly discourse models need to have more memory than this, so features that relate to earlier turns would be needed.",
        "The downside is that this would quickly lead to data sparsity.",
        "There are a variety of machine learning techniques that could also be tried, beyond the rather",
        "Input: this is n't the same .",
        "this is not like anything i have been through before .",
        "i mean , how am i supposed to make it work with somebody who ... Pred.",
        "nouns: strength, somebody Output: strength comes with somebody Input: i ?ve been a little bit too busy to socialize .",
        "i did have an interesting conversation with your sister , however .",
        "Pred.",
        "nouns: bit, conversation, sister Output: a bit about this conversation with sister",
        "simple methods employed in this work.",
        "For example, particular classes of response types, comprising a variety of related utterances, may be predictable using the extracted features.",
        "Finally, we have assumed for this discussion that the AAC system is only within the control of the impaired user.",
        "There is no reason to make that assumption in general: many AAC situations in real life involve a helper who will often co-construct with the impaired user.",
        "Such helpers usually know the impaired user very well and can often make reasonable guesses as to the whole utterance intended by the impaired user.",
        "Recent work reported in Roark et al. (2011) suggests one way in which the results of a language modeling system and those of a human co-constructor may be integrated into a single system, and such an approach could easily be applied here."

        "We have proposed and evaluated an approach to whole utterance prediction for AAC.",
        "While the approach is fairly simple, it is able to generate correct or at least reasonable responses in some cases.",
        "Such a system could be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as language-model-based prediction, or co-construction.",
        "One of the potentially useful side-effects of this work is an estimate of what percentage of interactions in a dialog are likely to be easily handled by such techniques.",
        "In other words, how many interactions in dialog are sufficiently predictable that a system could have a reasonable guess as to what a speaker is going to say given the previous context?",
        "A rough estimate based on what we have found here is something on the order of 3.5%- 4.0%.",
        "Obviously this does not mean that the system will always make the right prediction: a reasonable response to congratulations on your promotion would often be thank you, but a speaker may wish to say something else.",
        "But what it does mean is that in about 3.5%-4.0% of cases, one has a reasonable chance of being able to guess.",
        "This percentage is certainly small, and one might be inclined to conclude that the approach does not work.",
        "On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that not all percentages are created equal.",
        "Rapid responses to basic phrases (e.g. Are you mad at me?",
        "?",
        "No, I'm not mad at you), could help with the perceived flow of conversation, even if they do not occur that frequently.",
        "As we noted at the outset, whole utterance prediction is an area that has received increased interest in recent years, because of its potential to speed communication, and its contribution to increasing the naturalness of conversational interactions.",
        "When coupled with gains in utterance generation achieved by other methods, automatically generating utterances can further the range of comments and responses available to AAC users.",
        "The work reported here is a small contribution towards this goal."
