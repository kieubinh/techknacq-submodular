        "Machine translation systems are not reliable enough to be used directly.",
        "They can only be used to grasp the general meaning of texts or help human translators.",
        "Confidence measures detect erroneous words or sentences.",
        "Such information could be useful for users to decide whether or not to post-edit translated sentences (Specia, 2011; Specia et al., 2010) or select documents mostly correctly translated (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010).",
        "Moreover, it is possible to use confidence measures to compare outputs from different systems and to recommend the best one (He et al., 2010).",
        "One can also imagine that confidence measures at word-level could be also useful for a machine translation system to automatically correct parts of output: for example, a translation system translates the source sentence, then, this output is translated with another translation system (Simard et al., 2007).",
        "This last step could be driven by confidence measures.",
        "In previous works (Raybaud et al., 2011; Raybaud et al., 2009a; Raybaud et al., 2009b) we used state-of-the-art features to predict the quality of a translation at sentence-and word-level.",
        "Moreover, we proposed our own features based on previous works on cross-lingual triggers (Lavecchia et al., 2008; Latiri et al., 2011).",
        "We evaluated our work in terms of Discrimination Error Trade-off, Equal Error Rate and Normalised Mutual Information.",
        "In this article, we compare the features used in the shared task baseline system and our own features.",
        "This leads to 66 features which will be detailed in sections 3 and 4.",
        "We therefore deal with many features.",
        "We used a machine learning approach to perform regression of the feature space against scores given by humans.",
        "Machine learning algorithms may not efficiently deal with high dimensional spaces.",
        "Moreover, some features may be less discriminant descriptors and then in some cases could add more noise than information.",
        "That is why, in this article we propose an in-house feature selection algorithm to remove useless features.",
        "The article is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we give an overview of our quality estimation system.",
