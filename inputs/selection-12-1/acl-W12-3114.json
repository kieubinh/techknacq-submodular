        "Quality Estimation (or Confidence Estimation) refers here to the task of evaluating the quality of the output produced by a Machine Translation (MT) system.",
        "More precisely it consists in evaluating the quality of every individual sentence, in order (for instance) to decide whether a given sentence can be published as it is, should be post-edited, or is so bad that it should be manually re-translated.",
        "To our knowledge, most approaches so far (Spe-cia et al., 2009; Soricut and Echihabi, 2010; He et al., 2010; Specia et al., 2011) use several features combined together using supervised learning in order to predict quality scores.",
        "These features belong to two categories: black box features which can be extracted given only the input sentence and its translated version, and glass box features which rely on various intermediate steps of the internal MT engine (thus require access to this internal data).",
        "For the features they studied, Specia et al. (2009) have shown that black box features are informative enough and glass box features do not significantly contribute to the accuracy of the predicted scores.",
        "In this study, we use only black box features, and further, eschew supervised learning except in the broadest sense.",
        "Our method requires some reference data, all taken to be equally good exemplars of a positive reference category, against which the experimental sentences are compared automatically.",
        "This is the extent of broader-sense supervision.",
        "The method does not require a training set of items each annotated by human experts with quality scores (except for the purpose of evaluation of course).",
        "Successful unsupervised learning averts risks of the alternative: supervised learning necessarily makes the predicting system dependent on the annotated training data, i.e. less generic, and requires a costly human evalution stage to obtain a reliable model.",
        "Of course, our approach is likely not to perform as well as supervised approaches: here the goal is to find a rather generic robust way to measure quality, not to achieve the best accuracy.",
        "Nevertheless, in the context of this Quality Evaluation Shared task (see (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) for a detailed description) we have also used supervised learning as a final stage, in order to submit results which can be compared to other methods (see ?4).",
        "We investigate the use of various similarity measures for evaluating the quality of machine translated sentences.",
        "These measures compare the sentence to be evaluated against a reference text, providing a similarity score result.",
        "The reference data is supposed to represent standard (well-formed) language, so that the score is expected to reflect how complex (source side) or how fluent (target side) the given sentence is.",
        "After presenting the similarity measures in sec",
        "tion 2, we will show in section 3 how they perform individually on the ranking task; finally we will explain in section 4 how the results that we submitted were obtained using supervised learning."

        "Our method consists in trying to find the best measure(s) to estimate the quality of machine translated sentences, i.e. the ones which show the highest correlation with the human annotators scores.",
        "The measures we have tested work always as follows.",
        "Given a sentence to evaluate (source or target), a score is computed by comparing the sentence against a reference dataset (usually a big set of sentences).",
        "This dataset is assumed to represent standard and/or well-formed language.1 This score represents either the quality (similarity measure) or the faultiness (distance measure) of the sentence.",
        "It is not necessarily normalized, and in general cannot be interpreted straightforwardly (for example like the 1 to 5 scale used for this Shared Task, in which every value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has a precise meaning).",
        "In the context of the Shared task, this means that we focus on the ?ranking?",
        "evaluation measures provided rather than the ?scoring?",
        "measures.",
        "These scores are rather intended to compare sentences relatively to one another: for instance, they can be used to discard the N% lowest quality sentences from post-editing.",
        "The main interest in such an approach is in avoiding dependence on costly-to-annotate training data?correspondingly costly to obtain and which risk over-tuning the predicting system to the articulated features of the training items.",
        "Our method still depends on the dataset used as reference, but this kind of dependency is much less constraining, because the reference dataset can be any text data.",
        "To obtain the best possible results, the reference data has to be representative enough of what the evaluated sentences should be (if they were of perfect quality), which implies that: ?",
        "a high coverage (common words or n-grams) is preferable; this also means that the size of this dataset is important; 1We use this definition of ?reference?",
        "in this article.",
        "Please notice that this differs from the sense ?human translation of a source sentence?, which is more common in the MT literature.",
        "?",
        "the quality (grammaticality, language register, etc.)",
        "must be very good: errors in the reference data will infect the predicted scores.",
        "It is rather easy to use different reference datasets with our approach (as opposed to obtain new human scores and training a new model on this data), since nowadays numerous textual resources are available (at least for the most common languages)."

        "that there is the same number of n-grams containing a token w, for every w in the sentence; ?",

        "Below are the main measures explored.3",
        "(TF-IDF) is a widely used similarity measure in Information Retrieval(IR).",
        "It has also been shown to perform significantly better than only term frequency in tasks like matching coreferent named entities (see e.g. Cohen et al. (2003)), which is",
        "technically not very different from comparing sentences.",
        "The general idea is to compare two documents4 using their bags of n-grams representations, but weighting the frequency of every n-gram with the IDF weight, which represents ?how meaningful?",
        "the n-gram is over all documents based on its inverse frequency (because the n-grams which are very common are not very meaningful in general).",
        "There are several variants of TF-IDF comparison measures.",
        "The most recent ?Okapi BM25?",
        "version was shown to perform better in general than the original (more basic) definition (Jones et al., 2000).",
        "Moreover, there are different ways to actually combine the vectors together (e.g. L1 or L2 distance).",
        "In these experiments we have only used the Cosine distance, with Okapi BM25 weights.",
        "The weights are computed as usual (using the number of sentences containing X for any n-gram X), but are based only on the reference data.",
        "For a given length N, ?simple matching?",
        "is defined as follows: for every N gram in the sentence, the score is incremented if this N gram appears at least once in the reference data.",
        "The score is then relativized to the sentence N gram length.",
        "?Multi-level matching?",
        "(MLM) is similar but with different lengths of n-grams.",

        "1 in this n-gram, apply recursively the same method, but apply a penalty factor p (p < 1) to the result.5 This is intended to overcome the binary behaviour of the ?simple matching?.",

        "(sN?1 ?",
        "sN ) to the score, and so on.",
        "However this ?external?",
        "combination of scores can not take into account some of the extensions (e.g. weights).",
        "Two main variants have been tested.",
        "The first one consists in using skip-grams.6 Different sizes and configurations were tested (combining skip-grams and standard sequential n-grams), but none gave better results than using only sequential n-grams.",
        "The second variant consists in assigning a more fine-grained value, based on different parameters, instead of always assigning 1 to the score when n-gram occurs in the reference data.",
        "An optimal solution is not obvious, so we tried different strategies, as follows.",
        "Firstly, using the global frequency of the ngram in the reference data: intuitively, this could be interpreted as ?the more an n-gram appears (in the reference data), the more likely it is well-formed?.",
        "However there are obviously n-grams which appear a lot more than others (especially for short n-grams).",
        "This is why we also tried using the logarithm of the frequency, in order to smooth discrepancies.",
        "Secondly, using the inverse frequency: this is the opposite idea, thinking that the common n-grams are easy to translate, whereas the rare n-grams are harder.",
        "Consequently, the critical parts of the sentence are the rare n-grams: assigning them more weight focuses on these.",
        "This works in both cases (if the n-gram is actually translated correctly or not), because the weight assigned to the n-gram is taken into account in the normalization factor.",
        "Finally, using the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): this is a similar idea as the previous one, except that instead of considering the global frequency the number of sentences containing the n-gram is taken into account.",
        "In most cases (and in all cases for long n-grams), this is very similar to the previous option because the cases where an n-gram (at least with n > 1) appears several times in the same sentence are not common."
