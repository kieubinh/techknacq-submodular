        "Aside from improving the performance of core-translation models, there additionally exist two orthogonal approaches via which fully-automatic translations can achieve increased acceptance and better integration in real-world use cases.",
        "These two approaches are: improved translation accuracy via system combination (Rosti et al., 2008; Karakos et al., 2008; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008), and automatic quality-estimation techniques used as an additional layer on top of MT systems, which present the user only with translations that are predicted as being accurate (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010; Specia, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we describe new contributions to both these approaches.",
        "First, we present a novel and superior technique for performing quality estimation at document level.",
        "We achieve this by chang?Research was completed before the author started in his current role at Google Inc.",
        "The opinions stated are his own and not of Google Inc. ing the granularity of the prediction mechanism from document-level (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010) to sentence-level, and predicting BLEU scores via directly modeling the sufficient statistics for BLEU computation.",
        "A document-level score is then recreated based on the predicted sentence-level sufficient statistics.",
        "A second contribution is related to system combination (or, to be more precise, system selection).",
        "This is an intended side-effect of the granularity change: since the sentence-level statistics allow us to make quality predictions at sentence level, we can use these predictions to perform system combination by selecting among various sentence-level translations produced by different MT systems.",
        "That is, instead of presenting the user with a document with sentences translated entirely by a single system, we can present documents for which, say, 60% of the sentences were translated by system A, and 40% were translated by system B.",
        "We contribute a novel set of features and several techniques for choosing between competing machine translation outputs.",
        "The evaluation results show better output quality, across multiple domains and language pairs."

        "In this respect, the goal is more related to the area of confidence estimation for MT (Blatz et al., 2004).",
        "Confidence estimation is usually concerned with identifying words/phrases for which one can be confident in the quality of the translation.",
        "A sentence-level approach to quality estimation is taken on the classification-based work of Gamon et al. (2005) and regression-based work of Specia et al. (2009).",

        "We improve on the quality estimation technique that is proposed for document-level estimation in (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010).",

        "Our system combination methods are based on generic Machine Learning techniques, applied on 1-best output strings.",
        "In contrast, most of the approaches to MT system combination combine N-best lists from multiple MT systems via confusion network decoding (Karakos et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2008).",
        "The closest system combination approach to our work is (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008), where an ensemble of hypotheses is generated by combining N-best lists from all the participating systems, and a log-linear model is trained to select the best translation from all the possible candidates.",
        "In our work, we show that it is possible to gain significant translation quality by taking advantage of only two participating systems.",
        "This makes the system-combination proposition much more palatable in real production deployment scenarios for Machine Translation, as opposed to pure research scenarios as the ones used in the previous NIST and DARPA/GALE MT efforts (Olive et al., 2011).",
        "As our evaluations show, the two participating systems can be at very similar performance levels, and yet a system-selection procedure using Machine Learning techniques can achieve significant translation improvements in quality.",
        "In addition, in a scenario where quality estimation needs to happen as a requirement for MT integration in large applications, having two translation systems producing translations for the same inputs is part of the deployment set-up (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010).",

        "These feature types can be computed both on the source-side (MT input) and on the target-side (MT output).",
        "Text-based features These features compute the length of the input in terms of (tokenized) number of words.",

        "Language-model?based features These features are among the ones that were first proposed as possible differentiators between good and bad translations (Gamon et al., 2005).",
        "They are a measure of how likely a collection of strings is under a language model trained on monolingual data (either on the source or target side).",
        "The language-model?based feature values we use here are computed as perplexity numbers using a 5 gram language model trained on the MT training set.",
        "This can be achieved, for instance, by using the publicly-available SRILM toolkit 2.",
        "These two features are useful in modeling the relationship between the likelihood of a string (or set of strings) under an n-gram language model and the expected BLEU score for that input/output pair.",
        "Pseudo-reference?based features Previous work has shown that, in the absence of human-produced references, automatically-produced ones are still helpful in differentiating between good and bad translations (Albrecht and Hwa, 2008).",
        "When computed on the target side, this type of features requires one (or possibly more) secondary MT system(s), used to generate translations starting from the same input.",
        "These pseudo-references are useful in gauging translation convergence, using BLEU scores as feature values.",
        "In intuitive terms, their usefulness can be summarized as follows: ?if system X produced a translation A and system Y produced a translation B starting from the same input, and A and B are similar, then A is probably a good translation?.",
        "An important property here is that systems X and Y need to be as different as possible from each other.",
        "This property ensures that a convergence on similar translations is not just an artifact of the systems sharing the same translation model/resources, but a true indication that the translations converge.",

        "The set of positive and negative examples is a fixed set that is used in the same manner both at training-time (to compute the example-based feature values for the training examples) and at test-time (to compute the example-based feature values for the test examples).",
        "The intuition behind these features can be summarized as follows: ?if system X translated A well/poorly, and A and B are similar, then system X probably translates B well/poorly?.",

        "Training-data?based features If the system for which we make the predictions is trained on a parallel corpus, the data in this corpus can be exploited towards assessing translation quality (Specia et al., 2009; Soricut and Echihabi, 2010; Specia, 2011).",
        "In our context, the documents that make up this corpus can be used in a fashion similar with the positive examples.",

        "For instance, for HiTech English-French the best BLEU improvement is obtained by the Rank-based method with +1.7 BLEU points, but the KL divergence score of 3.31 is higher than the one for the Regression-based method (KL score of 0.11).",
        "Nevertheless, the choice distributions are an important factor in judging the performance of a given system selection method."

        "In addition to that, these finer-granularity, sentence-level predictions can be used as part of a system selection scheme.",
        "The three alternative system selection techniques we describe here are intuitive, computationally cheap, and bring significant BLEU gains across multiple domains and language pairs.",
        "The finding that the regression-based system selection technique performs as well (or sometimes better) compared to the discriminative methods fits well with the overall theme of using two systems for both improved quality estimation and improved MT performance."
