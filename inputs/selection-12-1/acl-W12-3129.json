        "We introduce the first fully automatic semantic-frame-based MT evaluation metric capable of outperforming all other commonly used automatic metrics like BLEU, NIST, METEOR, PER, CDER, WER, and TER for evaluating translation adequacy.",
        "This work, MEANT, can be seen as a fully automated version of HMEANT, which is a human metric, introduced by Lo and Wu (2011b).",
        "Despite its high performance, MEANT is still able to preserve HMEANT's virtues of Occam's razor simplicity, representational transparency, and inexpensiveness.",
        "For the past decade, MT evaluation has relied heavily on inexpensive automatic metrics such as BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), PER (Tillmann et al., 1997), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nie?en et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "In large part, this is because automatic metrics significantly shorten the evaluation cycle by providing a fast, easy and cheap quantitative evaluation which can be effectively incorporated into modern SMT training methods.",
        "Despite the fact that HMEANT, a human metric recently proposed by Lo and Wu (2011b,c,d), was shown to reflect translation adequacy more accurately than all of these automatic metrics, it is unfortunately infeasible to incorporate the HMEANT metrics directly into SMT training methods, due to the non-automatic processes of (1) semantic parsing and (2) aligning semantic frames.",
        "In this paper we introduce an automatic metric in which both the semantic parsing and the alignment of semantic frames are fully automated.",
        "Our aim is to show that even with full automation, this new metric still outperforms all the previous automatic metrics mentioned, thus providing a foundation for future incorporation into the training of SMT to drive system improvements in providing more adequate translation output.",
        "N-gram oriented automatic MT evaluation metrics like BLEU perform well at capturing translation fluency, and ranking overall systems with respect to each other when their scores are averaged over entire documents or corpora.",
        "However, they do not fare so well in ranking translations of individual sentences.",
        "As MT systems improve, the n-gram based evaluation metrics have begun to show their limits.",
        "State-of-the-art MT systems are often able to output translations containing roughly the correct words, while failing to convey important aspects of the meaning of the input sentence.",
        "Cases where BLEU strongly disagrees with human judgment of translation quality were",
        "reported in large scale MT evaluation tasks by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006).",
        "Motivated by the goal of addressing the weaknesses of n-gram oriented automatic MT evaluation metrics at evaluating translation adequacy, the HMEANT metric assesses translation utility by matching the basic event structure?",
        "?who did what to whom, when, where and why?",
        "(Pradhan et al., 2004)?representing the central meaning conveyed by sentences.",
        "As mentioned above, however, HMEANT requires humans to manually annotate semantic frames in the reference and machine translations, and then to align the semantic frames?making it difficult to incorporate HMEANT as an objective function in the MT system training, evaluating, and optimizing cycle.",
        "We argue in this paper that both the human semantic parsing and the semantic frame alignment tasks performed within HMEANT can be successfully automated to produce a state-of-the-art automatic metric.",
        "Moreover, we show that the spirit of Occam's razor can be preserved even for the semantic frame alignment, by demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm based on the lexical similarity between semantic frames.",
        "In addition, we show empirically that performing this semantic frame alignment automatically tends to be just as good as performing it manually.",
        "Our results indicate that MEANT, the fully automatic version of HMEANT, achieves levels of correlation with human adequacy judgment (in our experiments, approximately 0.37) which significantly outperforms the commonly used automatic metrics BLEU, NIST, METEOR, PER, CDER, WER, and TER (in our experiments, ranging between 0.20 and 0.29)."

        "This is surprising as, intuitively, using only the aligned tokens should avoid the introduction of noise in judging the similarity between semantic role fillers because it avoids adding in similarities for words within semantic role fillers whose meanings are not close to each other.",

        "We conjecture that the word alignments over-constrain the calculation of segment similarities.",
        "The individual lexical similarities are already weighted fairly accurately, so the lexical similarities between words that do not correspond do not hurt since they are already close to zero.",
        "On the other hand, in cases where the word alignment is ambiguous, it is better to aggregate over different possible pairwise alignments?strictly obeying a hard word alignment undesirably forces dropping of some individual lexical similarity scores that are actually relevant."

      "text": [
        "We have introduced a new fully automatic semantic MT evaluation metric, MEANT, that is fundamentally based on semantic frames, that is the first such metric to outperform all other commonly used automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Experimental results following the standard NIST MetricsMATR protocol indicate that our proposed metric achieves levels of correlation with human adequacy judgment (in our experiments, approximately 0.37) that significantly outperform BLEU, NIST, METEOR, PER, CDER, WER, and TER (in our experiments, ranging between 0.20 and 0.29).",
        "We have also shown in this paper that the spirit of Occam's razor of HMEANT can be preserved even under full automation by (1) replacing human semantic role annotation with automatic shallow semantic parsing and (2) replacing human semantic frame alignment with a simple maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm based on the lexical similarity between semantic frames.",
        "Under analysis, we have further shown empirically that performing this semantic frame alignment automatically tends to be just as good as performing it manually.",
        "Furthermore, we have shown surprisingly that (1) for aligning semantic frames, using only the similarity of predicates is more accurate than also taking into account the similarity of semantic role fillers, and (2) to judge similarity between semantic role fillers, aggregating similarity of all pairwise combination of word tokens is more accurate than considering only the similarity of the tokens that obey word alignments.",
        "Papineni et al. (2002) stated in their conclusion that ?We believe that BLEU will accelerate the MT R&D cycle by allowing researchers to rapidly home in on effective modeling ideas.?",
        "since fully automatic metrics allow inexpensive training and tuning of SMT systems.",
        "Developments in the past decade have more than borne witness to this statement.",
        "However, SMT has progressed to the stage where simple metrics like BLEU are no longer capable of driving progress toward preservation of meaning with respect to proper event structure.",
        "We believe that MEANT that rapidly and accurately reflects the translation adequacy of MT output by directly assessing who did what to whom, when, where and why is needed to bring MT R&D to a new level of improvement in generating more meaningful MT output."
