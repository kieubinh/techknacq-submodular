        "The results show that both methods have the potential of extracting good quality glossary sentences: the majority of the extracted sentences provide at least useful information about the domain concepts.",

        "The rating experiment suggests that the concept of definition quality in a specialized domain is largely subjective (borderline acceptable agreement overall and ?",
        "= 0.65 for rank-1 sentences).",
        "This calls for a modification of the evaluation methodology and for additional tests of consistency of ratings.",
        "The low agreement might be remedied by introducing a blocked design in which groups of judges would evaluate definitions of a small set of concepts with which they are most familiar, rather than a large set of concepts from various CL sub-areas.",
        "An analysis of the extracted sentences and their ratings12 revealed that deep analysis reduces noise in sentence extraction.",
        "Bootstrapping, however, yields more candidate sentences with good or very good ratings.",
        "While in the present work pattern refinement was based only on verbs, we observed that also the presence and position of (wh-)determiners and prepositions might be informative.",
        "Further experiments are needed 1) to find out how much specificity can be allowed without blocking the patterns?",
        "productivity and 2) to exploit the complementary strengths of the methods by combining them.",
        "Since both approaches use generic linguistic resources and preprocessing (POS-tagging, named-entity extraction, etc.)",
        "they can be considered domain-independent.",
        "To our knowledge, this is, however, the first work that attempts to identify definitions of Computational Linguistics concepts.",
        "Thus, it contributes to evaluating pattern bootstrapping and deep analysis in the context of the definition extraction task in our own domain."
