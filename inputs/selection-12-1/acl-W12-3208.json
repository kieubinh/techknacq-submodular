        "Text reuse refers to using the original text again in a different work.",
        "The text reuse in its most general form can be of two types: verbatim (quotations, definitions) and modified (paraphrasing, boilerplate text, translation).",
        "Although, the text reuse can be legal or illegal from a publishing authority perspective about the accreditation to the original author, more importantly it involves the ethical issues, especially in the scientific work.",
        "There is a fuzzy line between the text reuse and the plagiarism and often this line is legislative.",
        "There are no straightforward measures to declare a work as plagiarism and hence the publishing houses usually deploy their own rules and definitions to deal with plagiarism.",
        "For example, IEEE1 and ACM2 both consider the reuse as plagiarism in case of:",
        "1. unaccredited reuse of text; 2. accredited large portion of text without proper",
        "delineation or quotes to the complete reused portion.",
        "IEEE does not allow reusing large portion of own previous work, generally referred as self reuse or self plagiarism, without delineation, while ACM allows it provided the original source being explicitly cited.",
        "With the advent of a large number of conferences and their publicly available proceedings, it is extremely easy to access the information on the desired topic to refer to and to reuse.",
        "Therefore, it becomes essential to check the authenticity and the novelty of the submitted text before the acceptance.",
        "It becomes nearly impossible for a human judge (reviewer) to discover the source of the submitted work, if any, unless the source is already known.",
        "Automatic plagiarism detection applications identify such potential sources for the submitted work and based on it a human judge can easily take the decision.",
        "Unaccredited text reuse is often referred to as plagiarism and there has been abundant research about the same (Bouville, 2008; Loui, 2002; Maddox, 1995).",
        "Self plagiarism is another related issue, which is less known but not less unethical.",
        "There has been limited research on the nature of self-plagiarism and its limit to the acceptability (Bretag and Mahmud, 2009; Collberg and Kobourov, 2005).",
        "In theory, the technologies to identify either of them do not differ at the core and there have been many approaches to it (Bendersky and Croft, 2009; Hoad and Zobel, 2003; Seo and Croft, 2008).",
        "The text reuse can also be present in the cross-language environment (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al., 2010; Potthast et al., 2011a).",
        "Since few years, PAN organises competitions at CLEF3 (PAN@CLEF) on plagiarism detection (Potthast et al., 2010; Potthast et al., 2011b) and at FIRE4 (PAN@FIRE) on cross-language text reuse (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al., 2011).",
        "In the past, there has been an attempt to identify the plagiarism among the papers of ACL anthology in (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2010), but it mainly aims to propose a new strategy to identify the plagiarism and uses the anthology as the corpus.",
        "In this study, we are concerned about the verbatim reuse and that too in large amount, only.",
        "We identify such strong text reuse cases in two spans of five years papers of ACL (conference and workshops) and analyse them to notice the trends in the past and the present based on their year of publication, paper type and the authorship.",
        "The detection method along with the subsection of the ACL anthology used are described in Section 2.",
