        "As it was successfully done on part of speech (POS) tagging, where the use of rule-based POS taggers (Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1994) or a combination of a rule-based POS tagger with a statistical one (Aduriz et al., 1997, Ezeiza et al., 1998) outperformed purely statistical taggers, we think that exploring the combination of knowledge-based and data-driven systems in syntactic processing can be an interesting line of research.",
