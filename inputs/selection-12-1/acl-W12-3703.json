        "This simplified means of publication has led to the rise of several different websites specialized in the publication of users opinions.",
        "Some of the most well-known sites include Epinions1, RottenTomatoes2 and Muchocine3, where users express their opinions or criticisms on a wide range of topics.",
        "Opinions published on the Internet are not limited to certain sites, but rather can be found in a blog, forum, commercial website or any other site allowing posts from visitors.",
        "On of the most representative tools of the Web 2.0 are social networks, which allow millions of users",
        "to publish any information in a simple way and to share it with their network of contacts or ?friends?.",

        "This has aroused the interest of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, which has begun to study the texts posted on Twitter, and more specifically related to Sentiment Analysis (SA) challenges.",
        "In this manuscript we present a new approach to resolve the scoring of posts according to the expressed positive or negative degree in the text.",
        "This polarity detection problem is resolved by combining SentiWordNet scores with a random walk analysis of the concepts found in the text over the WordNet graph.",
        "In order to validate our non-supervised approach, several experiments have been performed to analyze major issues in our method and to compare it with other approaches like plain SentiWordNet scoring or machine learning solutions such as Support Vector Machines in a supervised approach.",

        "The first one consists on applying a lexicon-based method.",
        "In the second one the authors used the SVM algorithm to determine the polarity.",
        "For the machine learning phase, it is needed a labelled corpus, so the purpose of the lexicon-method is to tag the corpus.",
        "Thus, the authors selected a set of subjective words from all those available in English and added hash-tags with a subjective meaning.",
        "After labelling the corpus, it is used SVM for classifying new tweets.",
        "In (Agarwal et al., 2011) a study was conducted on a reduced corpus of tweets labelled manually.",
        "The experiment tests different methods of polarity classification and starts with a base case consisting on the simple use of unigrams.",
        "Then a tree-based model is generated.",
        "In a third step, several linguistic features are extracted and finally a final model learned as combination of the different models proposed is computed.",
        "A common feature used both in the tree-based model and in the feature-based one is the polarity of the words appearing in each tweet.",
        "In order to calculate this polarity the authors used DAL dictionary (Whissell, 1989).",
        "Most of the proposed systems for polarity detection compute a value of negativeness or positiveness.",
