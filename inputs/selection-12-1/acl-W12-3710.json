        "With their increasing popularity, social media applications provide a powerful communication channel for individuals to share information, exchange ideas and express their opinions on a wide variety of topics.",
        "An online debate is an open forum where a participant starts a discussion by posting his opinion on a particular topic, such as regional politics, health or the military, while other participants state their support or opposition by posting their opinions.",
        "Understanding participants?",
        "opinions in online debates has become an increasingly important task as its results can be used in many ways.",
        "For example, by analysing customers?",
        "online discussions, companies can better understand customers?",
        "reviews about their products or services.",
        "For government agencies, it could help gather public opinions about policies, legislation, laws, or elections.",
        "For social science, it can assist scientists to understand a breadth of social phenomena from online observations of large numbers of individuals.",
        "Despite the potentially wide range of applications, understanding participants?",
        "positions in online debates remains a difficult task.",
        "One reason is that online conversations are very dynamic in nature.",
        "Unlike spoken conversations (Thomas et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011), users in online debates are not guaranteed to participate in a discussion at all times.",
        "They may enter or exit the online discussion at any point, so it is not appropriate to use models assuming continued conversation.",
        "In addition, most discussions in online debates are essentially dialogic; participants could choose to implicitly respond to a previous post, or explicitly quote some content from an earlier post and make a response.",
        "Therefore, an assumption has to be made about what a participant's post is in response to, particularly when an explicit quote is not present; in most cases, a post is assumed to be in response to the most recent post in the thread (Murakami and Raymond, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of detecting users?",
        "positions with respect to the main topic in online debates; we call this the global position of users on an issue.",
        "It is inappropriate to identify each user's global position with respect to a main topic directly, because most expressions of opinion are made not",
        "for the main topic but for posts in a local context.",
        "This poses a difficulty in directly building a global classifier for agreement and disagreement.",
        "We illustrate this with the example below.",
        "Here, the topic of the thread is ?Beijing starts gating, locking migrant villages?",
        "and the discussion is started with a seed post criticising the Chinese government1.",

        "The opinion expressed in Reply 2, however, is not a response to the seed post: it relates to Reply 1.",
        "It indicates that the author of Reply 2 disagrees with the opinion made in Reply 1, and thus indirectly implies agreement with the seed post.",
        "From this example, we can see that it is hard to infer the global position of Reply 2's author only from the text of their post.",
        "However, we can exploit information in the local context, such as the relationship between Replies 1 and 2, to indirectly infer the author's opinion with regard to the seed post.",

        "The advantage of our proposed method is that it builds a unified framework which enables the classification of participants?",
        "local and global positions in online debates; the aggregation of local estimates also tends to reduce error in the global classification.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted experiments on data sets collected from two online debate forums.",

        "positions can be improved by introducing the constraint that a single speaker retains the same position during one debate.",

        "There has been other related work which aims to analyse informal texts for opinion mining and (dis)agreement classification in online discussions.",
        "Agrawal et al. (2003) described an observation that reply-to activities always show disagreement with previous authors in newsgroup discussions, and presented a clustering approach to group users into two parties: support and opposition, based on reply-to graphs between users.",

        "By combining both text and link information, this approach was demonstrated to outperform the method proposed by Agrawal et al. (2003).",

        "When a post does not contain a quote, we assume that it is a reply to the preceding post, and thus create an implicit link between the two adjacent posts.",

        "Since many words are topic related and might be used by both parties in a debate, we mainly use un-igrams for adjectives, verbs and adverbs because they have been demonstrated to possess discriminative power for sentiment classification (Benamara et al., 2007; Subrahmanian and Regorgiato, 2008).",

        "The presence of question marks could be indicative of disagreement, and the use of exclamation marks and capital letters could be an emphasis placed on opinions.",
        "Durational features Inspired by conversation analysis (Galley et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011), we extract durational features, such as the length of a post in words and in characters.",
        "These features are analogous to the ones used to capture the duration of a speech for conversation analysis.",
        "Intuitively, people tend to respond with a short post if they agree with a previous opinion.",
        "Otherwise, when there is a strong argument, people tend to use a longer post to state and defend their own opinions.",
        "Moreover, we also consider the time difference between adjacent posts as additional features.",

        "agreement or disagreement on an issue by exploiting local information contained in individual posts.",
        "Our proposed method builds a unified framework which enables the classification of participants?",
        "local and global positions in online debates.",
        "To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on two real-world data sets collected from two online debate forums.",
        "Our experiments have shown that regularised logistic regression is useful for this type of task; it has a built-in automatic feature selection by assigning a coefficient to each specific feature, and directly estimates probabilities of class memberships, which is quite useful for aggregating local positions between users.",
        "Our feature analysis has suggested that using sentiment, emotional and durational features can significantly improve the performance over only using word features.",
        "Experimental results have also shown that, for identifying users?",
        "global positions on an issue, aggregating local positions over posts results in better performance than no-aggregation baselines and that more benefit seems to accrue as users exchange more posts.",
        "We consider extending this work along several directions.",
        "First, we would like to examine what other factors would have predictive power in online debates and thus could be utilised to improve the performance of agreement/disagreement classification.",
        "Second, we have so far focused on classifying users?",
        "positions into two categories: agree and disagree.",
        "However, there do exist a portion of posts falling into the neutral category; that means posts/users do not express any position towards an issue.",
        "We will explore how to extend our computational framework to classify the neutral class.",
        "Finally, in online debates, it is not uncommon to have off-topic or topic-drift posts, especially for long threaded discussions.",
        "Off-topic posts are the ones totally irrelevant to the main issue being discussed, and topic-drift posts usually exist when the topic of a debate has shifted over time.",
        "Taking these posts into consideration would increase the difficulty of automatic agreement and disagreement classification, and therefore it is another important issue we plan to investigate."
