        "Although for more basic tasks such as tokenization or morphological parsing, the level of ambiguity and subjectivity is essentially lower than for higher-level tasks such as question answering or machine translation, it is still an open question to find a satisfactory solution for the (automatic) evaluation of certain tasks.",
        "Here we present the difficulties of finding an appropriate way of evaluating a highly semantics-and subjectivity-related task, namely opinionated keyphrase extraction.",

        "As the task we aim at involves extracting keyphrases that are responsible for the author's opinion toward the product, aspects of both keyphrase extraction and opinion mining determine our methodology and evaluation procedure.",

        "For evaluating scientific keyphrase extraction, several methods have traditionally been applied.",

        "In this work we applied the former approach for the evaluation of opinion phrases and made a thorough comparison with the human judgement.",

        "In order to find relevant keyphrases in the texts, first the reviews have to be segmented into ana-lyzable parts.",
        "We made use of the dataset described in Berend (2011), which contains 2000 product reviews each from two quite different domains, i.e. mobile phone and video film reviews from the review portal epinions.com.",
        "In the free-text parts of the reviews, the author describes his subjective feelings and views towards the product, and in the sections Pros and cons and Bottomline he summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the product, usually by providing some keyphrases or short sentences.",
        "However, these pros and cons are noisy since some authors entered full sentences while others just wrote phrases or keywords.",
        "Furthermore, the segmentation also differs from review to review or even within the same review (comma, semicolon, ampersand etc.).",
        "There are also non-informative comments such as none among cons.",
        "For the above reasons, the identification of the appropriate gold standard phrases is not unequivocal.",
        "We had to refine the pros and cons of the reviews so that we could have access to a less noisy database.",
        "Refinement included segmenting pros and cons into keyphrase-like units and also bringing complex phrases into their semantically equiva",

        "sets of opinion phrases.",

        "The second problem with regard to opinionated keyphrase extraction is the subjectivity of the task.",
        "Different people may have different opinions on the very same product, which is often reflected in their reviews.",
        "On the other hand, people can gather different information from the very same review due to differences in interpretation, which again complicates the way of proper evaluation.",
        "In order to evaluate the difficulty of identifying opinion-related keyphrases, we decided to apply the following methodology.",
        "We selected 25 reviews related to the mobile phone Nokia 6610, which were also collected from the website epinions.com.",
        "The task for three linguists was to write positive and negative aspects of the product in the form of keyphrases, similar to the original pros and cons.",

        "Since the comparison of annotations highlighted the subjectivity of the task, we voted for smoothing the divergences of annotations.",
        "We wanted to take into account all the available annotations which were manually prepared and regarded as acceptable.",
        "Thus, an annotator formed the union and the intersection of the pro and con features given by each annotator either including or excluding those defined by the original author.",
        "With this, we aimed at eliminating subjectivity since in the case of union, every keyphrase mentioned by at least one annotator was taken into consideration while in the case of intersection, it is possible to detect keyphrases that seem to be the most salient for the annotators as regards the given document.",
        "Thus, four sets of pros and cons were finally yielded for each review depending on whether the unions or intersections were determined purely on the phrases of the annotators excluding the original phrases of the author or including them.",
        "The following example illustrates the way new sets were created based on the input sets (in italics):",
        "Union: radio, organizer, calendar, loudspeaker, phone book Intersection: radio, organizer Proauthor : clear, fun Merged Union: radio, organizer, calendar, loudspeaker, phone book, clear, fun Merged Intersection: ?",
        "The reason behind this methodology was that it made it possible to evaluate our automatic methods in two different ways.",
        "Comparing the automatic keyphrases to the union of human annotations means that a bigger number of keyphrases is to be identified, however, with a bigger number of gold standard keywords it is more probable that the automatic keywords occur among them.",
        "At the same time having a larger set of gold standard tags might affect the recall negatively since there are more keyphrases to return.",
        "On the other hand, in the case of intersection it can be measured whether the most important features (i.e. those that every annotator felt relevant) can be extracted from the text.",
        "Note that our strategy is similar to the one applied in the case of BLEU/ROUGE score (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin, 2004) with respect to the fact that multiple good solutions are taken into account whereas the application of union and intersection is determined by the nature of the task: different annotators may attach several outputs (in other words, different numbers of keyphrases) to the same document in the case of keyphrase extraction, which is not realistic in the case of machine translation or summarization (only one output is offered for each sentence / text)."

      "heading": "4 Discussion and conclusions",
      "text": [
        "Both human and automatic evaluation reveal that the results yielded when the system was trained on manually refined keyphrases are better.",
        "The usage of manually refined keyphrases as the training set leads to better results (the difference being 5.9 F-score on average), which argues for human annotation as opposed to automatic normalization of the gold standard opinion phrases.",
        "Note, however, that even though results obtained with the automatic refinement of training instances tend to stay below the results that are obtained with the manual refinement of gold standard phrases, they are still comparable, which implies that with more sophisticated rules, training data could be automatically generated.",
        "If the inter-annotator agreement rates are compared, it can be seen that the agreement rates between the annotators are considerably higher than those between a linguist and the author of the product review.",
        "This may be due to the fact that the linguists were to conform to the annotation guidelines whereas the keyphrases given by the authors of the reviews were not limited in any way.",
        "Still, it can be observed that among the author-annotator agreement rates, the con phrases could reach higher agreement than the pro phrases.",
        "This can be due to psychological reasons: people usually expect things to be good hence they do not list all the features that are good (since they should be good by nature), in contrast, they list negative features because this is what deviates from the normal expectations.",
        "In this paper, we discussed the difficulties of evaluating opinionated keyphrase extraction and also conducted experiments to investigate the extent of overlap between the keyphrases determined by the original author of a review and those assigned by independent readers.",
        "To reduce the subjectivity of the task and to alleviate the evaluation process, we presented our method that employs several independent annotators and we also compared the results of human and machine-based evaluation.",
        "Our results reveal that for now, human evaluation leads to better results, however, we believe that the proper treatment of polar expressions and ambiguous adjectives might improve automatic evaluation among others.",
        "Besides describing the difficulties of the automatic evaluation of opinionated keyphrase extraction, the impact of training on automatically crawled gold standard opinionated phrases was investigated.",
        "Although not surprisingly they lag behind the ones obtained based on manually refined training data, the automatic creation of gold standard keyphrases can be a much cheaper, yet feasible option to manually refined opinion phrases.",
        "In the future, we plan to reduce the gap between manual and automatic evaluation of opinionated keyphrase extraction."
