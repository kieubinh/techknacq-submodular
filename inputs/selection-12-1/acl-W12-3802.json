        "Negation and modality function as operators modifying the meaning of the phrases in their scope.",
        "Negation can be used to deny or reject statements.",

        "), suffixes (?-less?",
        "), negator words, such as ?not?",
        "and negative polarity items (NPIs), which are words or idioms that appear in negative sentences, but not in their affirmative counterparts, or in questions, but not in assertions, for example ?any?, ?anything?, ?ever?.",
        "Negation can also be expressed using some nouns or verbs where negation is part of their lexical semantics (as ?abate?",

        "Modality can be used to express possibility, necessity, permission, obligation or desire.",
        "It is grammatically expressed via adverbial phrases (?maybe?, ?certainly?",
        "), conditional verbal moods and some verbs (?must?, ?can?, ?may?).",
        "Adjectives and nouns can also express modality (e.g. ?a probable cause?).",
        "Negation and modality can aggregate in a variety of ways: (1) multiple negatives, e.g, ?This restaurant never fails to disappoint on flavor?.",
        "In some languages, double negatives cancel the effect of negation, while in negative-concord languages like French, double negations usually intensify the effect of negation.",
        "(2) cumulative modalities, as in ?You definitely must see this movie?",
        "and (3) both negation and modality, as in ?you should not go see this movie?.",
        "Several reports have shown that negations and modalities are sentiment-relevant (Wiegand et al., 2010).",
        "Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) point out that",
        "negations are more sentiment-relevant than dimin-ishers.",
        "Wilson et al. (2009) show that modalities as well as negations are good cues for opinion identification.",
        "Given that the sentiment-relevance of negations and modalities is an established fact, this paper aims to go further by exploring how this relevance is distilled according to the semantics of each operator.",
        "To this end, we first study several taxonomies along with their associated categories of both modality and negation given by the linguistic literature.",
        "Among these categories, we decide to choose the categories of (Godard, to appear) for negations.",
        "For modalities, we rely on the categories of (Larreya, 2004) and (Portner, 2009).",
        "We thus distinguish three types of negation: negative operators, negative quantifiers and lexical negations and three types of modality: buletic, epistemic and deontic.",
        "We show that each type has a specific effect on the opinion expression in its scope: both on the polarity and the strength for negation, and on the strength and/or the degree of certainty for modality.",

        "Research efforts using negation in sentiment analysis can be grouped according to three main criteria: the effect of negation on opinion expressions, the types of negation used and the method employed to update the prior polarity of opinion expressions.",
        "According to the first criterion, most approaches treat negation as polarity reversal (Polanyi and Za-enen, 2006; Wilson et al., 2005; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Choi and Cardie, 2008).",
        "However, negation cannot be reduced to reversing polarity.",
        "For example, if we assume that the score of the adjective ?excellent?",
        "is +3, then the opinion score in ?this student is not excellent?",
        "cannot be -3.",
        "It rather means that the student is not good enough.",
        "Hence, dealing with negation requires to go beyond polarity reversal.",
        "Liu and Seneff (2009) propose a linear additive model that treats negations as modifying adverbs.",
        "In the same way, in (Taboada et al., 2011), the negation of an opinion expression shifts the value of its score to the opposite polarity by a fixed amount.",
        "Thus a +2 adjective is negated to a -2, but the negation of a very negative adjective is only slightly positive.",
        "Based on (Taboada et al., 2011)'s shift model, Yessenalina and Cardie (2011) propose to represent each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for modeling both additive (for negations) and multiplicative (for intensifiers) semantic effects.",
        "In our framework, we assume, as in (Liu and Seneff, 2009) and (Taboada et al., 2011), that negation affects both the polarity and the strength of an opinion expression.",
        "However, unlike other studies, we distill that effect depending on the type of the negation.",
        "Two main types of negation were studied in the literature: negators such as ?not?",
        "and content word negators such as ?eliminate?",
        "(Choi and Cardie, 2008).",
        "Wilson et al. (2009) also consider negators and in addition distinguish between positive polarity shifters and negative polarity shifters since they only reverse a particular polarity type.",
        "Few studies take into account other types of negation.",
        "Among them, Taboada et al. (2011) treat NPIs (as well as modalities) as ?irrealis blockers?",
        "by ignoring the semantic orientation of the word in their scope.",
        "For example, the opinion word ?good?",
        "will just be ignored in ?any good movie in this theater?.",
        "We think that ignoring NPIs is not suitable and a more accurate analysis is needed.",
        "In addition, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of multiple negatives on opinions.",
        "Finally, methods dealing with negation can be classified into three categories (Wiegand et al.,",
        "2010).",
        "In the shallow approach, negation is embedded into a bag-of-words model which is then used by supervised machine-learning algorithms for polarity classification (Pang et al2002; Ng et al. 2006).",
        "This method, rather simple, seems linguistically inaccurate and increases the feature space with more sparse features.",
        "The second approach concerns a local contextual analysis of valence shifter terms where negation modifies the prior scores of those terms (Taboada et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2009).",
        "The last approach uses semantic composition where the polarities of words within the sentence are aggregated (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we provide a way of treating negation and modality in a semantic composition framework."

        "Among the few research efforts in this direction, Wilson et al. (2009) use a list of modal words.",
        "In (Kobayakawa et al., 2009), modalities are defined in a flat taxonomy: request, recommendation, desire, will, judgment, etc.",
        "According to the reported results, the gain brought by the modalities seems difficult to assess.",
        "However, to our knowledge, no work has investigated how modality impacts on opinions.",
        "In NLP, modality is less addressed than other linguistic operators, such as negations.",
        "Most of the computational studies involving modality are focused on: (i) building annotated resources in terms of factuality information and (ii) uncertainty mod-eling and hedge detection in texts.",
        "Among annotated resources, we cite the FactBank corpus (Saur??",
        "and Pustejovsky, 2009) and the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "In the second research strand, the efforts go from detecting uncertainty in texts (Rubin, 2010), to finding hedges and their scopes in specialized corpora (Vincze et al., 2008; Gan-ter and Strube, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010).",
        "However, there is only partial overlapping between hedges and modal constructions.",
        "Hedges are linguistic means whereby the authors show that they cannot back their opinions with facts.",
        "Thus, hedges include certain modal constructions (especially epistemic), along with other markers such as indirect speech, e.g., ?According to certain researchers,...?.",
        "On the other hand, there are modal constructions which are not hedges, e.g. when expressing a factual possibility, without uncertainty on behalf of the speaker, e.g. may in ?These insects may play a part in the reproduction of plants as well?."
