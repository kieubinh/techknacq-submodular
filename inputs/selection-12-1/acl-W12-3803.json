        "Next, a second pilot study was performed, building on what was learned in the initial pilot study.",
        "The second pilot study involved a larger data set with a revised and improved annotation scheme that considered gradient correctness at different steps of the diagnostic reasoning process: (1) medical lesion morphology (e.g. recognizing the lesion type as a scaly erythematous plaque), (2) differential diagnosis (i.e. providing a set of possible final diagnoses), and (3) final diagnosis (e.g. identifying the disease condition as psoriasis).",

        "We assume that different reasoning systems may cause changes in linguistic behaviors.",

        "to determine uncertainty in text.",
        "Velupillai (2010) also applied the same approach to medical texts and noted that acoustic-prosodic features should be considered alongside salient lexical-structural features as indicators of uncertainty.",
        "In this work, we draw on the insight of such previous work, but we also extend the types of linguistic evidence considered for identifying possible links to diagnostic correctness.",
        "As another type of linguistic evidence, disfluen-cies make up potentially important linguistic evidence.",

        "This finding is important for the work presented here because our modified use of the Master-Apprentice scenario results in a particular dialogic interaction with the listener remaining silent.",
        "Perhaps most importantly, Clark and Fox Tree (2002) postulated that filled pauses (e.g., um, uh, er, etc.)",
        "play a meaningful role in speech.",

        "These steps are in essence local phenomena and a better understanding of how uncertainty is locally expressed in the diagnostic process is needed.",
        "Also, this work does not consider parametrization of algorithms or the role of feature selection.",
        "In future work, by considering only the features that are most important, a better understanding of linguistic expression in relation to diagnostic correctness could be achieved, and likely result in better performing models.",
        "One possible future adaptation would be the utilization of the Unified Medical Language System to improve the lexical features used Woods et al. (2006).",
        "Other future work includes integrating eye movement data into prediction models.",
        "The gaze modality informs us as to where the observers were looking when they were verbalizing their diagnostic process.",
        "We can thus map the narratives to how gaze was positioned on an image.",

        "diagnostic reasoning likely extend beyond language.",
        "By integrating gaze and linguistic information, much could be learned regarding perceptual and conceptual knowledge.",
        "Through this study, we have moved towards understanding reasoning in medical narratives, and we have come one step closer to linking the spoken words of doctors to their cognitive processes.",
        "In a much more refined, future form, certainty or correctness detection could become useful to help understanding medical reasoning or help guide medical reasoning or detect misdiagnosis."
