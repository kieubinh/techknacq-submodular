        "Extracting these facts from the huge and constantly growing body of research articles in areas such as, for example, molecular biology, becomes increasingly necessary, and has been the subject of intense research in the last decade (Ananiadou et al., 2006).",
        "The fields of information extraction and text mining have paid particular attention to this issue, seeking to automatically populate structured databases with data extracted or inferred from text.",
        "In both cases, the problem of speculative language detection is a challenging one, because it may correspond to a subjective attitude of the writer towards the truth value of certain facts, and that information should not be lost when the fact is extracted or inferred.",
        "When researchers express facts and relations in their research articles, they often use speculative language to convey their attitude to the truth of what is said.",
        "Hedging, a term first introduced by Lakoff (1973) to describe ?words whose job is to make things fuzzier or less fuzzy?",

        "Early work on speculative language detection tried to classify a sentence either as speculative or non-speculative (see, for example, Medlock and Briscoe (2007)).",
        "This approach does not take into account the fact that hedging usually affects propositions or claims (Hyland, 1995) and that sentences often include more than one of them.",
        "When the Bio-scope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) was developed the notions of hedge cue (corresponding to what was previously called just ?hedges?",
        "in the literature) and scope (the propositions affected by the hedge cues) were introduced.",
        "In this context, speculative language recognition can be seen as a two-phase process: first, the existence of a hedge cue in a sentence is detected, and second, the scope of the induced hedge is determined.",

        "Each of these phases can be modelled (albeit with some differences, described in the following sections) as a sequential classification task, using a similar approach to that commonly used for named entity recognition or semantic labelling: every word in the sentence is assigned a class, identifying spans of text (as, for example, scopes) with, for example, a special class for the first and last element of the span.",
        "Correctly learning these classes is the computational task to be solved.",

        "The methodology proposes the use of domain knowledge rules that suggest a class for an instance, and shows how to incorporate them into the learning process.",
        "In our particular task domain knowledge is linguistic knowledge, as hedging and scopes issues are general linguistic devices.",
