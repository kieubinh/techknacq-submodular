        "In John may go to NY, the basic proposition is John go to NY and the word may indicates modality.",

        "Many semanticists (e.g. Kratzer (1981), Kratzer (1991), Kaufmann et al. (2006)) define modality as quantification over possible worlds.",
        "John might go means that there exist some possible worlds in which John goes.",
        "Another view of modality relates more to a speakers attitude toward a proposition (e.g. McShane et al. (2004)).",
        "Modality might be construed broadly to include several types of attitudes that a speaker wants to express towards an event, state or proposition.",
        "Modality might indicate factivity, evidentiality, or sentiment (McShane et al., 2004).",
        "Factivity is related to whether the speaker wishes to convey his or her belief that the propositional content is true or not, i.e., whether it actually obtains in this world or not.",
        "It distinguishes things that (the speaker believes) happened from things that he or she desires, plans, or considers merely probable.",
        "Evidentiality deals with the source of information and may provide clues to the reliability of the information.",
        "Did the speaker",
        "have firsthand knowledge of what he or she is reporting, or was it hearsay or inferred from indirect evidence?",
        "Sentiment deals with a speaker's positive or negative feelings toward an event, state, or proposition.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the following five modalities; we have investigated the belief/factivity modality previously (Diab et al., 2009b; Prabhakaran et al., 2010), and we leave other modalities to future work.",

        "A pilot study revealed that it can boost recall well above the naturally occurring proportion of modality without annotated data but with only 60% precision.",
        "We investigated an approach where we first gathered sentences based on a simple modality tagger and then provided these sentences to annotators for further annotation, The resulting annotated data also preserved the level of inter-annotator agreement for each example so that learning algorithms could take that into account during training.",

        "In this section, we will discuss the procedure we followed to construct the training data for building the automatic modality tagger.",
        "In a pilot study, we obtained and ran the modality tagger described in (Baker et al., 2010) on the English side of the Urdu-English LDC language pack.2 We randomly selected 1997 sentences that the tagger had labeled as not having the Want modality and posted them on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).",
        "Three different Turkers (MTurk annotators) marked, for each of the sentences, whether it contained the Want modality.",
        "Using majority rules as the Turker judgment, 95 (i.e., 4.76%) of these sentences were marked as having a Want modality.",
        "We also posted 1993 sentences that the tagger had labeled as having a Want modality and only 1238 of them were marked by the Turkers as having a Want modality.",
        "Therefore, the estimated precision of this type of approach is only around 60%.",
        "Hence, we will not be able to use the (Baker et al., 2010) tagger to gather training data.",
        "Instead, our approach was to apply a simple tagger as a first pass, with positive examples subsequently hand-annotated using MTurk.",
        "We made use of sentence data from the Enron email corpus,3 derived from the",
        "version owing to Fiore and Heer,4 further processed as described by (Roark, 2009).5 To construct the simple tagger (the first pass), we used a lexicon of modality trigger words (e.g., try, plan, aim, wish, want) constructed by Baker et al. (2010).",
        "The tagger essentially tags each sentence that has a word in the lexicon with the corresponding modality.",
        "We wrote a few simple obvious filters for a handful of exceptional cases that arise due to the fact that our sentences are from e-mail.",
        "For example, we filtered out best wishes expressions, which otherwise would have been tagged as Want because of the word wishes.",
        "The words that trigger modality occur with very different frequencies.",
        "If one is not careful, the training data may be dominated by only the commonly occurring trigger words and the learned tagger would then be biased towards these words.",
        "In order to ensure that our training data had a diverse set of examples containing many lexical triggers and not just a lot of examples with the same lexical trigger, for each modality we capped the number of sentences from a single trigger to be at most 50.",
        "After we had the set of sentences selected by the simple tagger, we posted them on MTurk for annotation.",
        "The Turkers were asked to check a box indicating that the modality was not present in the sentence if the given modality was not expressed.",
        "If they did not check that box, then they were asked to highlight the target of the modality.",
        "Table 1 shows the number of sentences we posted on MTurk for each modality.6 Three Turkers annotated each sentence.",
        "We restricted the task to Turkers who were adults, had greater than a 95% approval rating, and had completed at least 50 HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) on MTurk.",
        "We paid US$0.10 for each set of ten sentences.",
        "Since our data was annotated by three Turkers, for training data we used only those examples for which at least two Turkers agreed on the modality and the target of the modality.",
        "This resulted in 1,008 examples.",
        "674 examples had two Turkers agreeing and 334 had unanimous agreement.",
        "We kept track of the level of agreement for each example so that",
        "turned by the simple tagger that we posted on MTurk.",
        "our learner could weight the examples differently depending on the level of inter-annotator agreement."
