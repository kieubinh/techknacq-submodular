        "(It is known that some predicative relations can be considered complex being saturated with another predicative relation ?",
        "but with the above given definition this case is simplified).",
        "The differences in word order and phrase structure across languages can be better captured at a clause rather than at a sentence level, therefore, monolingual and parallel text processing in the scope of the clauses may significantly improve syntactic parsing, automatic translation, etc.",
        "The sentences can be very long and complex in structure, may consist of a considerable number of clauses which in turn may vary with respect to their relative position to each other in parallel texts both due to linguistic reasons per se and translators?",
        "choices.",
        "The flexible order, length and number of clauses",
        "in sentences, along with the different word order and ways of lexicalisation across languages contribute to the complexity of clause alignment as compared to sentence alignment and call for more sophisticated approaches.",
        "These findings have inspired growing research into clause-to-clause machine translation involving clause splitting, alignment and word order restructuring within the clauses (Cowan et al., 2006; Ramanathan et al., 2011; Sudoh et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2011).",
