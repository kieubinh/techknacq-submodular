        "The idea of using citations as a source of information has been explored extensively in the field of bibliometrics, and more recently in the field of computational linguistics.",
        "State-of-the-art citations identification mechanisms focus either on detecting explicit citations i.e. those that consist of either the author names and the year of publication or bracketed numbers only, or include a small sentence window around the explicit citation as input text (Councill et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009; Ritchie et al., 2008).",
        "The assumption behind this approach is that all related mentions of the paper would be concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the anchor text.",
        "However, this assumption does not generally hold true (Teufel, 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2010).",
        "The phenomenon of trying to determine a citations's citation context has a long tradition in library sciences (O?Connor, 1982), and its connection with corefer-ence has been duely noted (Kim et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 2009).",
        "Consider Figure 1, which illustrates a",
        "While the first sentence cites the target paper explicitly using the name of the primary author along with the year of publication of the paper, the remaining sentences mentioning the same paper appear after a gap and contain an indirect and implicit reference to that paper.",
        "These mentions occur two sentences after the formal citation in the form of anaphoric it and the lexical hook METEOR.",
        "Most current techniques, with the exception of Qazvinian and Radev (2010), are not able to detect linguistic mentions of citations in such forms.",
        "Ignoring such mentions and examining only the sentences contain",
        "ing an explicit citation results in loss of information about the cited paper.",
        "While this phenomenon is problematic for applications like scientific summari-sation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011), it has a particular relevance for citation sentiment detection (Athar, 2011).",
        "Citation sentiment detection is an attractive task.",
        "Availability of citation polarity information can help researchers in understanding the evolution of a field on the basis of research papers and their critiques.",
        "It can also help expert researchers who are in the process of preparing opinion based summaries for survey papers by providing them with motivations behind as well as positive and negative comments about different approaches (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008).",
        "Current work on citation sentiment detection works under the assumption that the sentiment present in the citation sentence represents the true sentiment of the author towards the cited paper (Athar, 2011; Piao et al., 2007; Pham and Hoffmann, 2004).",
        "This assumption is so dominant because current citation identification methods (Councill et al., 2008; Ritchie et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009) can readily identify the citation sentence, whereas it is much harder to determine the relevant context.",
        "However, this assumption most certainly does not hold true when the citation context spans more than one sentence.",
        "Concerning the sentiment aspect of the citation context from Figure 1, we see that the citation sentence does not contain any sentiment towards the cited paper, whereas the following sentences act as a critique and list its shortcomings.",
        "It is clear that criticism is the intended sentiment, but if the gold standard is defined by looking at the citation sentence in isolation, a significant amount of sentiment expressed in the text is lost.",
        "Given that overall most citations in a text are neutral with respect to sentiment (Spiegel-Rosing, 1977; Teufel et al., 2006), this makes it even more important to recover what explicit sentiment there is in the article, wherever it is to be found.",
        "In this paper, we examine methods to extract all opinionated sentences from research papers which mention a given paper in as many forms as we can identify, not just as explicit citations.",
        "We present a new corpus in which all mentions of a cited paper have been manually annotated, and show that our annotation treatment increases citation sentiment coverage, particularly for negative sentiment.",
        "We then explore methods to automatically identify all mentions of a paper in a supervised manner.",
        "In particular, we consider the recognition of named approaches and acronyms.",
        "Our overall system then classifies explicit and implicit mentions according to sentiment.",
