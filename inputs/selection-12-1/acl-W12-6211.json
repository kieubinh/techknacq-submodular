        "This paper presents an application of finite-state transducers to the domain of medicine.",
        "The objective is to assign disease codes to each Diagnostic Term in the medical records generated by the Basque Health Hospital System.",
        "As a starting point, a set of manually coded medical records were collected in order to code new medical records on the basis of this set of positive samples.",
        "Since the texts are written in natural language by doctors, the same Diagnostic Term might show alternative forms.",
        "Hence, trying to code a new medical record by exact matching the samples in the set is not always feasible due to sparsity of data.",
        "In an attempt to increase the coverage of the data, our work centered on applying a set of finite-state transducers that helped the matching process between the positive samples and a set of new entries.",
        "That is, these transducers allowed not only exact matching but also approximate matching.",
        "While there are related works in languages such as English, this work presents the first results on automatic assignment of disease codes to medical records written in Spanish."

        "During the last years an exponential increase in the number of electronic documents in the medical domain has occurred.",
        "The automatic processing of these documents allows to retrieve information, helping the health professionals in their work.",
        "There are different sort of valuable data that help to exploit medical information.",
        "Our framework lays on the classification of Medical Records (MRs) according to a standard.",
        "In our context, the MRs produced in a hospital have to be classified with respect to the World Health Organization's 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases1 (ICD-9).",
        "ICD-9 is designed for the classification of morbidity and mortality information and for the indexing of hospital records by disease and procedure.",
        "The already classified MRs are stored in a database that serves for further classification purposes.",
        "Each MR consists of two pieces of information: Diagnostic Terms (DTs): one or more terms that describe the diseases corresponding to the MR. Body-text: a description of the patient's details, antecedents, symptoms, adverse effects, methods of administration of medicines etc.",
        "Even though the DTs are within a limited domain, their description is not subject to a standard.",
        "Doctors express the DTs in natural language with their own style and different degrees of precision.",
        "Usually, a given concept might be expressed by alternative DTs with variations due to modifiers, abbreviations, acronyms, dates, names, misspellings or style.",
        "This is a typical problem that arises in natural language processing due to the fact that doctors focus on the patients and not so much on the writing of the MR. On account of this, there is ample variability in the presentation of the DTs.",
        "Consequently, it is not a straightforward task to get the corresponding ICD-codes.",
        "That is, the task is by far more complex than a standard dictionary lookup.",
        "The Basque Health Hospital System is concerned with the automatization of this ICD-code assignment task.",
        "So far, the hospital processes the daily",
        "produced documents in the following sequence: 1.",
        "Automatic: exact match of the DTs in a set of manually coded samples.",
        "2.",
        "Semi-automatic: through semantic match, ranking the DTs by means of machine-learning techniques.",
        "This stage requires that experts select amongst the ranked choices.",
        "3.",
        "Manual: the documents that were not matched",
        "in the previous two stages are examined by professional coders assigning the codes manually.",
        "The goal of this paper is to bypass the variability associated to natural language descriptions in an attempt to maximize the proportion of automatically assigned codes, as the Hospital System aims to expand the use of the automatic codification of MRs to more hospitals.",
        "According to experts, even an increase of 1% in exact match would represent a significant improvement allowing to gain time and resources.",
        "Related work can be found in the literature.",
        "For instance, Pestian et al. (2007) reported on a shared task involving the assignment of ICD-codes to radiology reports written in English from a reduced set of 45 codes.",
        "In general it implied the examination of the full MR (including body-text).",
        "In our case, the number of ICD-codes is above 1,000, although we restrict ourselves to exact and approximate match over the diagnoses.",
        "Farkas and Szarvas (2008) used machine learning for the automatic assignment of ICD-9 codes.",
        "Their results showed that hand-crafted systems could be reproduced by replacing several laborious steps in their construction with machine learning models.",
        "Tsuruoka et al. (2008) presented a system that tried to normalize different variants of the terms contained in a medical dictionary, automatically getting normalizing rules for genes, proteins, chemicals and diseases in English.",
        "The contribution of this work is: i) to collect manually coded MRs in Spanish; ii) to approximate transduction with finite-state (FS) models for automatic MR coding and, iii) to assess the performance of the proposed FS transduction approaches."
