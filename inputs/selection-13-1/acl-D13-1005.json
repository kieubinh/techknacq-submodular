        "By the end of their first year, infants have acquired many of the basic elements of their native language.",
        "Their sensitivity to phonetic contrasts has become language-specific (Werker and Tees, 1984), and they have begun detecting words in fluent speech (Jusczyk and Aslin, 1995; Jusczyk et al., 1999) and learning word meanings (Bergelson and Swingley, 2012).",
        "These developmental cooccurrences lead some researchers to propose that phonetic and word learning occur jointly, each one informing the other (Swingley, 2009; Feldman et al., 2013).",
        "Previous computational models capture some aspects of this joint learning problem, but typically simplify the problem considerably, either by assuming an unrealistic degree of phonetic regularity for word segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2009) or assuming pre-segmented input for phonetic and lexical acquisition (Feldman et al., 2009; Feldman et al., in press; Elsner et al., 2012).",
        "This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first broad-coverage model that learns to segment phonetically variable input into words, while simultaneously learning an explicit model of phonetic variation that allows it to cluster together segmented tokens with different phonetic realizations (e.g., [ju] and [jI]) into lexical items (/ju/).",
        "We base our model on the Bayesian word segmentation model of Goldwater et al. (2009) (henceforth GGJ), using a noisy-channel setup where phonetic variation is introduced by a finite-state transducer (Neubig et al., 2010; Elsner et al., 2012).",
        "This integrated model allows us to examine how solving the word segmentation problem should affect infants?",
        "strategies for learning about phonetic variability and how phonetic learning can allow word segmentation to proceed in ways that mimic the idealized input used in previous models.",
        "In particular, although the GGJ model achieves high segmentation accuracy on phonemic (non-variable) input and makes errors that are qualitatively similar to human learners (tending to undersegment the input), its accuracy drops considerably on phonetically noisy data and it tends to oversegment rather than undersegment.",
        "Here, we demonstrate that when the model is augmented to account for phonetic variability, it is able to learn common phonetic changes",
        "and by doing so, its accuracy improves and its errors return to the more human-like undersegmentation pattern.",
        "In addition, we find small improvements in lexicon accuracy over a pipeline model that segments first and then performs lexical-phonetic learning (Elsner et al., 2012).",
        "We analyze the model's phonetic and lexical representations in detail, drawing comparisons to experimental results on adult and infant speech processing.",
        "Taken together, our results support the idea that a Bayesian model that jointly performs word segmentation and phonetic learning provides a plausible explanation for many aspects of early phonetic and word learning in infants."
