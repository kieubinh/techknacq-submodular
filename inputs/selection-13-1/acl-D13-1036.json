        "Recent work in NLP has tackled the inference of relations between events from a broad range of perspectives: (1) as inference of a discourse relations (e.g. the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) CONTINGENT relation and its specializations); (2) as a type of common sense reasoning; (3) as part of text understanding to support question-answering; and (4) as way of learning script-like or plot-like knowledge structures.",
        "All these lines of work aim to model narrative understanding, i.e. to enable systems to infer which events are likely to have happened even though they have not been mentioned in the text (Schank et al., 1977), and which events are likely to happen in the future.",
        "Such knowledge has practical applications in commonsense reasoning, infor",

        "We model this likelihood between events by drawing on the PTDB's general definition of the CONTINGENT relation, which encapsulates relations elsewhere called CAUSE, CONDITION and ENABLE-MENT (Prasad et al., 2008a; Lin et al., 2010; Pitler et al., 2009; Louis et al., 2010).",
        "Our aim in this paper is to implement and evaluate a range of different unsupervised methods for learning event pairs that are likely to be CONTINGENT on one another.",
        "We first utilize a corpus of scene descriptions from films because they are guaranteed to have an explicit narrative structure.",
        "Moreover, screenplay scene descriptions tend to be told in temporal order (Beamer and Girju, 2009; Gordon and Swanson, 2009), which makes them a good resource for learning about contingencies between events.",
        "In addition, scenes in film represent many typical sequences from real life, while providing a rich source of event clusters related to battles, love and mystery.",
        "We carry out separate experiments for the action movie genre and the romance movie genre.",
        "For example, in the scene from Total Recall, from the action movie genre (See Fig. 1), we might learn that the event of sits up is CONTINGENT on the event of clock chimes.",
        "The subset of the corpus we use comprises 123,869 total unique event pairs.",
        "We produce initial scalar estimates of potential CONTINGENCY between events using four previously defined measures of distributional co-occurrence.",
        "We then refine these estimates through web searches that explicitly model the patterns of narrative event sequences that were previously observed to be likely within a particular genre.",
        "There are several advantages of this method: (1) events in the same genre tend to be more similar than events across genres, so less data is needed to estimate co-occurrence; (2) film scenes are typically narrated via simple tenses in the correct temporal order, which allows the ordering of events to contribute to the estimation of the CONTINGENCY relation; (3) The web counts focus on validating event pairs already deemed to be likely to be CONTINGENT in the smaller, more controlled, film scene corpus.",
        "To test our method, we conduct perceptual experiments with human subjects on Mechanical Turk by asking them to select which of two pairs of events are the most likely.",

        "In all the other cases, the instructions that were given with the HIT are those in Fig. 3 where the Turkers are instructed to pay attention to the order of the events.",
        "For all types of HITS, for all measures of CONTINGENCY, we set up the task as a choice over two alternatives, where for each predicted contingent pair (PCEP), we generate a random event pair (REP), with the first event the same and the second one randomly chosen from all the events in the same film genre.",
        "The REPs are constructed the same way as we construct REPs for web search refinement, as illustrated by Table 1.",
        "This is illustrated in both Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.",
        "For all types of HITS, we ask 15 Turkers from a pre-qualified group to select which pair (the PCEP or the REP) is more likely to occur together.",
        "Thus, the framing of these Mechanical Turk tasks only assumes that the average person knows how the world works; we do not ask them to explicitly reason about causality as other work does (Beamer and Girju, 2009; Gordon et al., 2011; Do et al., 2011).",
        "For each measure of CONTINGENCY, we take 100 event pairs with highest PCEP scores, and put them in 5 HITs with twenty items per HIT.",
        "Previous work has shown that for many common NLP tasks, 7 Turkers' average score can match expert annotations (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "However, we use 15 Turkers because we had no gold-standard data and because we were not sure how difficult the task is.",
        "It is clearly subjective.",
        "To calculate the accuracy of each method, we computed the average correlation coefficient between each pair of raters and eliminate the 5 lowest scoring workers.",
        "We then used the perceptions of the 10 remaining workers to calculate accuracy as # of correct answers / total # of answers.",
        "In general, deciding when a MTurk worker is unreliable when the data is subjective is a difficult problem.",
        "In the future we plan to test other solutions to measuring annotator reliability as proposed in related work (Callison-Burch, 2009; Snow et al., 2008; Karger et al., 2011; Dawid and Skene, 1979; Welinder et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012)."

        "are told that the order of the events does not matter.",
        "considerably lower than when the PCEPs are tested without arguments.",
        "Comparing Rows 1 and 2 with Rows 3 and 4 suggests that even if the arguments provide extra information that help to ground the type of event, in some cases these constraints on events may mislead the Turkers or make the evaluation task more difficult.",
        "There is an over 10% increase in CP + Web search accuracy for the task that omits the event arguments (i.e.",
        "Fig. 3 as can be seen by comparing Row 2 with Row 4.",
        "Thus omitting the arguments of events in evaluations actually appears to allow Turkers to make better judgments.",
        "In addition, Table 2 shows clearly that for every single method, accuracy is improved by refining the initial estimates of contingency using the narrative-based web search patterns.",
        "Web search increases the accuracy of almost all evaluation tasks, with increases ranging from 3.45% to 12.5% when averaged over both film genres (Column 5 Average Acc%).",
        "where Turkers are told that the order of the events does matter.",
        "The best performing method for the Action genre is CP+Web Search at 87.67%, while the best performing method for the Romance genre is PMI+Web search at 88.52%.",
        "However PMI+Web Search does not beat CP+Web Search on average over both genres we tested, even though the Mechanical Turk HIT for CP specifies that the order of the events matters: a more stringent criterion.",
        "Also overall the CP+WebSearch method achieves a very high 85.64% average accuracy.",
        "It is also interesting to note the variation across the different methods.",
        "For example, while it is well known that PMI typically requires very large corpora to make good estimates, the PMI method without web search refinement has an initially high accuracy of 79.60% for the romance genre, while only achieving 68.70% for action.",
        "Perhaps this difference arises because the romance genre is more highly causal, or because situations are more structured in romance, providing better estimates with a small corpus.",
        "However even in this case of romance with PMI, adding web search refinement provides an almost 10% increase in absolute accuracy to the highest accuracy of any combination, i.e. 88.52%.",
        "There is also an interesting case of Protag CP for the romance genre where web search refinement actually decreases accuracy by 4.1%.",
        "In future work we plan to examine more genres from the film corpus and also examine the role of corpus size in more detail."

        "We induced event pairs using several methods from previous work with similar aims but widely different problem formulations and evaluation methods.",
        "We used a verb-rich film scene corpus where events are normally narrated in temporal order.",
        "We used Mechanical Turk to evaluate the learned pairs of CONTINGENT events using human perceptions.",
        "In the first stage drawing on previous measures of distributional co-occurrence, we achieved an overall average accuracy of around 70%, over a 50% baseline.",
        "We then implemented a novel method of defining narrative sequence patterns using the Google Search API, and used web counts to further refine our estimates of the contingency of the learned event pairs.",
        "This increased the overall average accuracy to around 77%, which is 27% above the baseline.",
        "Our results indicate that the use of web search counts increases the average accuracy of our Causal Potential-based method to 85.64% as compared to an average accuracy of 75.15% without web search.",
        "To our knowledge this is the highest accuracy achieved in tasks of this kind to date.",
        "Previous work on recognition of the PDTB CONTINGENT relation has used both supervised and unsupervised learning, and evaluation typically measures precision and recall against a PDTB annotated corpus (Do et al., 2011; Pitler et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Chiarcos, 2012; Louis et al., 2010).",
        "We use an unsupervised approach and measure accuracy using human perceptions.",
        "Other work by Girju and her students defined a measure called causal potential and then used film screen plays to learn a knowledge base of causal pairs of events.",
        "They evaluate the pairs by asking two trained human annotators to label whether occurrences of those pairs in their corpus are causally related (Beamer and Girju, 2009; Riaz and Girju, 2010).",
        "We also make use of their causal potential measure.",
        "Work on commonsense causal reasoning aims to learn causal relations be-ween pairs of events using a range of methods applied to a large corpus of weblog narratives (Gordon et al., 2011; Gordon and Swanson, 2009; Manshadi et al., 2008).",
        "One form of evaluation aimed to predict the last event in a sequence (Manshadi et al., 2008), while more recent work uses the learned pairs to improve performance on the COPA SEMEVAL task (Gordon et al., 2011).",
        "Related work on SCRIPT LEARNING induces likely sequences of temporally ordered events in news, rather than CONTINGENCY or CAUSALITY (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009).",
        "Chambers & Jurafsky also evaluate against a corpus of existing documents, by leaving one event out of a document (news story), and then testing the system's ability to predict the missing event.",
        "To our knowledge, our method is the first to augment distributional semantics measures from a corpus with web search data.",
        "We are also the first to evaluate the learned event pairs with a human perceptual evaluation with native speakers.",
        "We hypothesize that there are several advantages to our method: (1) events in the same genre tend to be more similar than events across genres, so less data is needed to estimate co-occurrence; (2) film scenes are typically narrated via simple tenses in the correct temporal order, which allows the ordering of events to contribute to estimates of the CONTINGENCY relation; (3) The web counts focus on validating event pairs already deemed to be likely to be CONTINGENT in the smaller, more controlled, film scence corpus.",
        "Our work capitalizes on event sequences narrated in temporal order as a cue to causality.",
        "We expect this approach to generalize to other domains where these properties hold, such as fables, personal stories and news articles.",
        "We do not expect this technique to generalize without further refinements to genres frequently told out of temporal order or when events are not mentioned consecutively in the text, for example in certain types of fiction.",
        "In future work we want to explore in more detail the differences in performance of the different contingency measures.",
        "For example, previous work would suggest that the the higher the measure is, the more likely the two events are to be contingent on one another.",
        "To date, while we have only tested the top 100, we have not found that the bottom set of 20 are less accurate than the top set of 20.",
        "This could be due to corpus size, or the measures themselves, or noise from parser accuracy etc.",
        "As shown in Table 2, web search refinement is able to eliminate most noise in event pairs, but we would still aim to achieve a better understanding of the circumstances which lead particular methods to work better.",
        "In future work we also want to explore ways of inducing larger event structures than event pairs, such as the causal chains, scripts, or narrative schemas of previous work."
