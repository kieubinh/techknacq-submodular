        "A key enabling component for such enhanced search capability is a type and entity catalog.",

        "With two exceptions (Zheng et al., 2012; Gabrilovich et al., 2013) that we discuss later, public-domain corpus annotation work has almost exclusively used Wikipedia and derivatives, partly because Wikipedia provides not only a standardized space of entities, but also reliably labeled mention text within its own documents, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for entity disambiguation.",

        "TMI improves per-snippet accuracy, for some classes of entities, from 46% to 70%, and pooled F1 score from 66% to 73%.",
