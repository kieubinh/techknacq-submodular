        "Word segmentation has been a long-standing challenge for the Chinese NLP community.",
        "It has received steady attention over the past two decades.",
        "Previous studies show that joint solutions usually lead to the improvement in accuracy over pipelined systems by exploiting POS information to help word segmentation and avoiding error propagation.",
        "However, traditional joint approaches usually involve a great number of features, which arises four limitations.",
        "First, the size of the result models is too large for practical use due to the storage and computing constraints of certain real-world applications.",
        "Second, the number of parameters is so large that the trained model is apt to overfit on training corpus.",
        "Third, a longer training time is required.",
        "Last but not the least, the decoding by dynamic programming technique might be intractable since a large search space is faced by the decoder.",
        "The choice of features, therefore, is a critical success factor for these systems.",
        "Most of the state-of-the-art systems address their tasks by applying linear statistical models to the features carefully optimized for the tasks.",
        "This approach is effective because researchers can incorporate a large body of linguistic knowledge into the models.",
        "However, the approach does not scale well when it is used to perform more complex joint tasks, for example, the task of joint word segmentation, POS tagging, parsing, and semantic role labeling.",
        "A challenge for such a joint model is the large combined search space, which makes engineering effective task-specific features and structured learning of parameters very hard.",
        "Instead, we use multilayer neural networks to discover the useful features from the input sentences.",
        "There are two main contributions in this paper.",
        "(1) We describe a perceptron-style algorithm for training the neural networks, which not only speeds up the training of the networks with negligible loss in performance, but also can be implemented more easily; (2) We show that the tasks of Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging can be effectively performed by the deep learning.",
        "Our networks achieved close to state-of-the-art performance by transferring the unsupervised internal representations of Chinese characters into the supervised models.",
        "Section 2 presents the general architecture of neural networks, and our perceptron-style training algorithm for tagging.",
        "Section 3 describes how to",
        "leverage large unlabeled data to obtain more useful character embeddings, and reports the experimental results of our systems.",
