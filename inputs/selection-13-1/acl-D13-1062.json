        "Currently, most of statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems rely heavily on manually annotated resources to train their statistical models.",
        "The more of the data scale, the better the performance will be.",
        "However, the costs are extremely expensive to build the large scale resources for some NLP tasks.",
        "Even worse, the existing resources are often incompatible even for a same task and the annotation guidelines are usually different for different projects, since there are many underlying linguistic theories which explain the same language with different perspectives.",
        "As a result, there often exist multiple heterogeneous annotated corpora for a same task with vastly different and incompatible annotation philosophies.",
        "These heterogeneous resources are waste on some level if we cannot fully exploit them.",
        "However, though most of statistical NLP methods are not bound to specific annotation standards, almost all of them cannot deal simultaneously with the training data with different and incompatible annotation.",
        "The coexistence of heterogeneous annotation data therefore presents a new challenge to utilize these resources.",
        "The problem of incompatible annotation standards is very serious for many tasks in NLP, especially for Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Chinese S&T).",
        "In Chinese S&T, the annotation standards are often incompatible for two main reasons.",
        "One is that there is no widely accepted segmentation standard due to the lack of a clear definition of Chinese words.",
        "Another is that there are no morphology for Chinese word so that there are many ambiguities to tag the parts-of-speech for Chinese word.",
        "For example, the two commonly-used corpora, PKU's People's Daily (PPD) (Yu et al., 2001) and Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xia, 2000), use very different segmentation and POS tagging standards.",
        "For example, in Table 1, it is very different to annotate the sentence ?????????",
        "??",
        "(Liu Xiang reaches the national final in China)?",
        "with guidelines of CTB and PDD.",
        "PDD breaks some phrases, which are single words in",
        "CTB, into two words.",
        "The POS tagsets are also significantly different.",
        "For example, PDD gives diverse tags ?n?",
        "and ?vn?",
        "for the noun, while CTB just gives ?NN?.",
        "For proper names, they may be tagged as ?nr?, ?ns?, etc in PDD, while they are just tagged as ?NR?",

        "information in another heterogeneous style.",
        "The proposed method can improve the performances of joint Chinese S&T on both corpora by using the shared information of each other, which is proven effective by experiments.",

        "(2) We will analyze the shared information (weights of the features derived from the tags which have the mapping relation) in detail and propose a more effective model.",
