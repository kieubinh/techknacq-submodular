        "With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web, information explosion has become an important issue to modern people.",
        "Those who search for information from the Internet often get lost and confused by the overwhelmingly large collection of web documents.",
        "So how to get a concise and global picture for a given event subject is an urgent problem to be solved.",
        "Although many document understanding systems have been proposed, such as ?Corresponding author multi-document summarization systems, to generate a compressed summary by extracting the major information from the collection of documents, they ignored the dynamic development information of an event.",
        "Intuitively, each event is long-running and contains multiple sub-events, including related events.",
        "Users are likely to prefer a summary of all occurrences of all the sub-events along the timeline of the event.",
        "This motivates us to study the task of generating event storyline from a collection of web documents related to an event subject.",
        "The research of event storyline summarization is popular in recent years.",
        "Its task is to summarize a collection of web documents by extracting representative information based on all the sub-events and generate a global summary.",
        "Generally, generating such a global storyline is quite interesting for the following main reasons: (1) It can help people catch the whole incident based on an overall temporal structured summary for a given subject, and understand the cause, climax, development process and result of an event.",
        "(2) It can also make people know what other events are related, or the effect of this incident to subsequent events, which can present the evolution of an event along a timeline.",
        "Though several methods of generating event storyline have been proposed recently, there are still some problems unresolved.",
        "As event storyline summarization is a process to generate component summaries based on the multiple sub-events, which is different from traditional summarization focusing on only one subject, so how to exactly extract all the sub-events is the first challenge.",
        "Moreover, users tend to bias to the sub-events which have global",
        "consistency with the given event subject, so the sub-events should not be considered equally when generating the component summaries.",
        "It is also a great challenge to generate a qualified summary based on the different types of sub-events.",
        "The component summaries should be correlative across different dates based on the global collection (Yan et al., 2011a).",
        "Mei and Zhai (Mei and Zhai, 2005) proposed to use theme or topic to model different sub-events, which is to some extent similar to our method.",
        "To be different, in this paper we introduce ?local/global?",
        "property to distinguish different part-whole relationship between the sub-events and the major event, which have not been considered before in storyline generation or summarization, to improve the quality of the storyline.",
        "The local/global property corresponds to the elements of an event, such as the place, characters and other body information.",
        "These information reflects the relationship between the sub-events and the major event.",
        "Some sub-events have distinctive body information and little relevance with each other.",
        "They generally occur for a local period, which we name as ?local-sub-events?.",
        "While other sub-events often share common properties with each other and have close relationship with the major event and we call them as ?global-sub-events?.",
        "Here we give some examples to illustrate the difference.",
        "For the event ?Connecticut school shooting?",
        "which occurred on Dec.14 2012, its sub-events such as ?Obama's speech for this massacre?",
        "or ?Gun control Act?",
        "have little word co-occurrences and distinctive event body information to each other, while the process and result of this tragedy can be regarded as global-sub-events which have a lot of word co-occurrences and share common properties with the major event.",
        "Inspired by these, to detect different types of sub-events based on word co-occurrences between sub-events and the major event, we propose a mixture-event-aspect (MEA) model to formalize different types of sub-events into local/global aspects, which are implicated with clusters of sentences.",
        "Then combining the local/global aspects with summarization requirements together, we utilized an optimization approach to get the optimal component summaries along the timeline.",
        "We evaluate our method on 6 distinctively different datasets.",
        "Performance comparisons among different system-generated storylines demonstrate the necessity to distinguish different types of sub-events and also indicates the effectiveness of the proposed mixture-event-aspect model.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We briefly review the related work in section 2.",
        "In section 3 we present the details of optimized event storyline generation based on mixture-event-aspect model.",
        "Experiments and results are discussed in Section 4.",
