        "While online versions are now common in many fields, these are still largely compiled manually, relying on costly human editorial effort.",
        "This leads to resources that are often outdated or stale with respect to the current state-of-the-art.",
        "Another indirect result of this leads to a second problem: lexical resources tend to be general, and may contain multiple definitions for a single term.",
        "For example, the term ?CRF?",
        "connotes ?Conditional Random Fields?",
        "in most modern computational linguistics literature; however, there are many definitions for this acronym in Wikipedia.",
        "Because only one correct sense applies, readers may need to expend effort to identify the appropriate meaning of a term in context.",
        "We address both issues in this work by automatically extracting terms and definitions directly from primary sources: scientific publications.",
        "Since most new technical terms are introduced in scientific publications, our extraction process addresses the bottleneck of staleness.",
        "Second, since science is organized into disciplines and sub-disciplines, we can exploit this inherent structure to gather contextual information about a term and its definition.",
        "Aside from performance improvements, the key contributions of our work are in 1) recasting the problem as a sequence labeling task and exploring suitable learning architectures, 2) our proposal and validation of the the use of shallow parsing and dependency features to target definition extraction, and 3) analyzing the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus from statistical, chronological and lexical viewpoints."

        "The output of such systems can be used to produce glossaries or answer definition questions.",
        "The primary model for this task in past work has been one of binary classification: does a sentence contain a definition or not?",
        "Existing methods can be cast into three main categories, namely rule-based (Muresan and Klavans, 2002; Westerhout and Monachesi, 2007), supervised machine learning (Fahmi and Bouma, 2006; Westerhout, 2009), and semi-supervised approaches (Navigli and Velardi, 2010; Reiplinger et al., 2012).",
        "Rule-based approaches are intuitive and efficient, and were adopted in early research.",
        "Here, system performance is largely governed by the quality of the rules.",
        "Muresan and Klavans (2002) developed a rule-based system to extract definitions from online medical articles.",
        "The system first selects candidates using hand-crafted cue-phrases (e.g. is defined as, is called; analogous to ?IS-A?",
        "phrases), further filtering the candidates with grammar analysis.",
        "Westerhout and Monachesi (2007) augmented the set of rules with part-of-speech (POS) tag patterns, achieving an F2 of 0.43.",
        "While such manually-crafted expert rules have high precision, they typically suffer from low recall.",
        "Definitions can be expressed in a variety of ways, making it difficult to develop an exhaustive set of rules to locate all definition sentences.",
        "To address low recall, later research adopted data-driven machine learning approaches.",
        "Fahmi and Bouma (2006) made used of supervised machine learning to extract definitions from a corpus of Dutch Wikipedia pages in the medical domain.",
        "They showed that a baseline approach which simply classifies every first sentence as a definition works surprisingly well, achieving an accuracy of 75.9% (undoubtedly due to the regular structure and style for Wikipedia).",
        "Their final system, based on the important feature of sentence position, was augmented with surface-level features (bag-of-words, bigrams, etc.)",
        "and syntactic features (type of determiner, position of the subject in the sentence).",

        "na?",
        "?ve Bayes, maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and the support vector machine (SVM) ?",
        "showed that MaxEnt gave the best results (92.2% accurate).",

        "Borg et al. (2009) implemented a fully automated system to extract and rank definitions based on genetic algorithms and genetic programming.",
        "They defined two sub-problems including 1) acquiring the relative importance of linguistic forms, and 2) learning of new linguistic forms.",
        "Starting with a small set of ten simple hand-coded features, such as having sequence ?FW IS?",
        "(FW is a tag for foreign word) or containing keyword identified by the system, the system is able to learn simple rules such as ?NN is a NN?.",
        "However, their system is optimized for similar ?IS-A?",
        "patterns, as was used in (Westerhout, 2009).",
        "Their system, achieving an average f-measure of 0.25, also performs poorer than machine learning systems which exploit more specific features.",
        "To cope with the generality of patterns, Navigli and Velardi (2010) proposed the three-step use of directed acyclic graphs, called Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), to classify a Wikipedia dataset of definitions.",
        "They first replace the uncommon words in the sentences with a wildcard (*), generating a set of ?star patterns?.",
        "Star patterns are then clustered according to their similarity.",
        "For each cluster, a WCL is generated by aligning the sentences in the cluster to form a generalized sentence.",
        "Although they reported a higher precision and recall compared with previous work, the result for WCL (F1 of 75.23%) is not significantly better than the baseline system which exploits only star patterns (F1 of 75.05%) without generating the directed graphs.",
        "Reiplinger et al. (2012) took a semi-supervised approach.",

        "We note that these previous systems rely heavily on lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "They neither sufficiently exploit the intrinsic characteristics of the term and definition, nor invest effort to localize them within the sentence1.",
        "Given the significant structure in definitions, we take a more fine-grained approach, isolating the term and its definition from sentences.",
        "According to Pearson (1996), a definition can be formally expressed as:",

        "Leveraging the current best practice of using conditional random fields, we contribute two additional ideas that lead to DefMiner, a state-of-the-art scholarly definition mining system.",
        "First, we show that shallow parsing and dependency parse features that may provide additional non-local information, are useful in improving task performance.",
        "Second, viewing the problem as two correlated subproblems of term and definition extraction, we measure the tightness and dependency of the correlation.",
        "We find that a two-stage sequential learning architecture (term first, definition second) leads to best performance.",
        "DefMiner outperforms the state of the art, and we feel is fit for macroscopic analysis of scientific corpora, despite significant noise.",
        "We thus deployed DefMiner on the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus.",
        "We demonstrate how DefMiner can yield insights into both the structure and semantics of terms and definitions, in both static and diachronic modes.",
        "We think future work could pursue more in-depth analysis of the distributional and demographic properties of automatically extracted lexica.",
        "We can use the lexicon obtained from different years to carry out trend prediction, which we have illustrated here.",
        "Downstream systems may predict which term will become popular, or could alert an author if their definition of a term significantly differs from the original source.",
        "We hope to tackle the annotation bottleneck in future work on definition extraction, common in many data-driven learning fields.",
        "We plan to explore iterative, semi-supervised methods to best manage human effort to maximize the effectiveness of future annotation.",
        "In addition, with respect to modeling, although we showed that doing definition classification before term classification does not improve over our single-stage classifier, we hope to study whether suitable joint inference models can benefit from the interaction between the two classification processes."
