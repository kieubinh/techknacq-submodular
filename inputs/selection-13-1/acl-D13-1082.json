        "Language models are important in natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition and statistical machine translation.",
        "Traditionally, back-off n-gram language models (BNLMs) (Chen and Goodman, 1996; Chen and Goodman, 1998; Stolcke, 2002) are being widely used for these tasks.",
        "Recently, neural network language models, or continuous-space language models (CSLMs) (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Le et al., 2011) are being used in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Schwenk et al., 2006; Son et al., 2010; Schwenk et al., 2012; Son et al., 2012; Niehues and Waibel, 2012).",
        "These works have shown that CSLMs can improve the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores of SMT when compared with BNLMs, on the condition that the training data for language modeling are the same size.",
        "However, in practice, CSLMs have not been widely used in SMT.",
        "One reason is that the computational costs of training and using CSLMs are very high.",
        "Various methods have been proposed to tackle the training cost issues (Son et al., 2010; Schwenk et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2011).",
        "However, there has been little work on reducing using costs.",
        "Since the using costs of CSLMs are very high, it is difficult to use CSLMs in decoding directly.",
        "A common approach in SMT using CSLMs is the two pass approach, or n-best reranking.",
        "In this approach, the first pass uses a BNLM in decoding to produce an n-best list.",
        "Then, a CSLM is used to rerank those n-best translations in the second pass.",
        "(Schwenk et al., 2006; Son et al., 2010; Schwenk et al., 2012; Son et al., 2012) Another approach is using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) (Niehues and Waibel, 2012) instead of using multilayer neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Le et al., 2011).",
        "Since probability in a RBM can be calculated very efficiently (Niehues and Waibel, 2012), they can use the RBM language model in SMT decoding.",
        "However, the RBM was just used in an adaptation of SMT, not in a large SMT task, because the training costs of RBMs are very high.",
        "The last approach is using a BNLM to simulate a CSLM (Deoras et al., 2011; Arsoy et al., 2013).",
        "(Deoras et al., 2011) used a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) to generate a large amount of text, which was generated by sampling words from the probability distributions calculated by the RNNLM.",
        "Then, they trained the BNLM",
        "from the text using the interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing method.",
        "(Arsoy et al., 2013) converted neural network language models of increasing order to pruned back-off language models, using lower-order models to constrain the n-grams allowed in higher-order models.",
        "Both of these methods were used in decoding for speech recognition.",
        "These methods were applied to not-so-large scale experiments (55 million (M) words for training their BNLMs) (Arsoy et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, our method is applied to SMT and can be used to improve a BNLM created from 746 M words by using a CSLM trained from 42 M words.",
        "Because BNLMs can be trained from much larger corpora than those that can be used for training CSLMs, improving a BNLM by using a CSLM trained from a smaller corpus is very important.",
        "Actually, a CSLM trained from a smaller corpus can improve the BLEU scores of SMT if it is used in the n-best reranking (Schwenk, 2010; Huang et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, we will demonstrate that a BNLM simulating a CSLM can improve the BLEU scores of SMT in the first pass decoding.",
        "Our approach is as follows: (1) First, we train a CSLM (Schwenk, 2007) from a corpus.",
        "(2) Second, we also train a BNLM from the same corpus or larger corpus.",
        "(3) Finally, we rewrite the probability of each n-gram of the BNLM with that probability calculated from the CSLM.We also re-normalize the probabilities of the BNLM, then use the rewritten BNLM in SMT decoding.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the BNLM and CSLM (Schwenk, 2010) used for rewriting BNLMs.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the method of converting a CSLM into a BNLM.",
