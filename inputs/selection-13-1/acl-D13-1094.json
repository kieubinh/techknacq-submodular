        "A central goal of natural language generation and summarization systems is to produce interpretable, coherent text that rivals material a human would produce.",
        "Doing so requires that systems not only have the ability to generate clauses that are grammatical and easy for people to process, but also the ability to employ the appropriate discourse structuring devices needed to yield fluid transitions between these clauses.",
        "This is a tricky issue in that it requires that a balance be achieved between the opposing goals of communicative expressiveness and economy.",
        "On the one hand, insufficient cueing of inter-clausal relationships can lead to a discourse that is at best difficult to process, and at worst misunderstood.",
        "On the other hand, too much explicit marking can result in a clunky and even redundant sounding discourse.",
        "Here we consider the question of when to explicitly mark the COHERENCE RELATIONS in discourse, that is, the inter-clausal relationships that the language producer intends the interpreter to infer between the meanings of clauses (Hobbs, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Kehler, 2002; Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "Consider, for example, the EXPLANATION coherence relation that holds in (1), in which the second clause provides a cause or reason for the eventuality described in the first: (1) a. Max will visit Australia this summer because his father is turning 65. b. Max will visit Australia this summer.",
        "His father is turning 65.",
        "As example (1) shows, coherence relations can be marked explicitly?by using lexical connectives such as coordinating or subordinating conjunctions (e.g., because in 1a) or certain types of prepositional or adverbial phrases?or left implicit as in (1b).",
        "Either way, establishing the relation itself requires the reader to go through a complex inferential process necessitating that a variety of assumptions be made, typically supported by context and/or world knowledge, that are not explicitly asserted by the actual linguistic material.",
        "In (1), for instance, such inferences would include that Max intends to see his father when he travels to Australia, that his father resides in that country, and that the birthday will taking place during the time of the visit.",
        "Importantly, the role of the connective in (1a) is therefore not to establish that an EXPLANATION relation holds.",
        "Instead, connectives serve the function of directing the addressee's inference processes toward a smaller set of coherence relations than might otherwise be available, among other possible roles.",
        "The fact that both (1a) and (1b) are felicitous may lead us to believe that the choice to insert a connective between clauses is simply optional.",
        "This is not",
        "always the case, however.",
        "Sometimes the use of a connective is required, since omitting it would likely result in incorrect inferences being drawn by the addressee.",
        "For example, the use of when in (2a) implies a backward temporal ordering of events, which is reversed if the connective is left out, as in (2b).",
        "(2) a. Maggie fell over in shock when Saul offered to help her.",
        "b. Maggie fell over in shock.",
        "Saul offered to help her.",
        "On the other hand, a connective can seem unnecessary if the relation between the two clauses is sufficiently implied by other cues in the text.",
        "For instance, since the act of throwing a vase against a concrete wall would normally be expected to cause the vase to break, the adverbial phrase as a result in (3a), while felicitous, seems overly verbose and perhaps even redundant.",
        "(3) a. Susan threw the fragile vase against the concrete wall.",
        "As a result, it broke.",
        "b. Susan threw the fragile vase against the concrete wall.",
        "It broke.",
        "The foregoing examples suggest that the appropriateness of including an explicit connective is inherently gradient, and is in fact correlated with ease of inference: the more difficult recovering the correct relation would be without a connective, the more necessary it is to include one.",
        "This characterization in turn suggests that predicting whether a connective should be included might be a difficult problem for an NLP system to address, since current-day systems lack the requisite world knowledge and capacity for inference that would be necessary to evaluate the ease with which coherence relations can be established on arbitrary examples.",
        "However, it is also possible that the decision to include a connective depends in part on stylistic and other types of factors as well, such that there might be predictive information in the kinds of shallow linguistic and textual features that systems do have access to.",
        "This is the question taken up in this work: Given two adjacent clauses in a text, the type of coherence relation holding between them and a candidate connective that could be used to signal the relation, we ask how well a system can predict whether or not that connective was used by the author of the text.",
        "This capability would be useful to generation systems as a post-cursor to discourse-level message planning and sentence realization processes, as well as summarization systems that take existing sentences and have to reconsider connective placement upon reassembling them.",
        "To our knowledge, there is no work in the literature that addresses this issue directly.",
        "There is a growing body of research (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) that focuses on building supervised models for classifying implicit relations using a variety of contextual features, such as the polarity of clauses, the semantic class and tense/aspect of verbs, and information from syntactic parses.",
        "With respect to explicit relations, Elhadad and McKe-own (1990) sketch a procedure to select an appropriate connective to link two propositions as part of a larger text generation system, using linguistic features derived from the sentences.",
        "The procedure selects the best connective from a given set of candidates, but does not allow for the option of leaving the relation implicit.",
        "More recently, Asr and Dem-berg (2012a) look at both explicit and implicit relations, and make the observation that certain relation types are more likely to be realized explicitly than others.",
        "Relatedly, Asr and Demberg (2012b) discuss which connectives are the strongest predictors of which relation types.",
        "However, there is no work of which we are aware that specifically predicts whether connectives should be used or omitted."

        "Obviously, the PDTB does not avail us of the opportunity to evaluate this gradience directly (or even use a 3 way required/optional/redundant distinction), since the producer of the actual text samples in the corpus had to ultimately decide whether or not to use a connective.",

        "The variability in the judgments of native speakers when presented with these data suggests that the use of a connective is in many cases simply optional; in such cases the decision may reflect lower-level stylistic choices on the part of the author.",
