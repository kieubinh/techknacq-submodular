        "Natural language conversation is one of the holy grail of artificial intelligence, and has been taken as the original form of the celebrated Turing test.",
        "Previous effort in this direction has largely focused on analyzing the text and modeling the state of the conversation through dialogue models, while in this pa-?The work is done when the first author worked as intern at Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei Techologies.",
        "per we take one step back and focus on a much easier task of finding the response for a given short text.",
        "This task is in clear contrast with previous effort in dialogue modeling in the following two aspects ?",
        "we do not consider the context or history of conversations, and assume that the given short text is self-contained; ?",
        "we only require the response to be natural, relevant, and human-like, and do not require it to contain particular opinion, content, or to be of particular style.",
        "This task is much simpler than modeling a complete dialogue session (e.g., as proposed in Turing test), and probably not enough for real conversation scenario which requires often several rounds of interactions (e.g., automatic question answering system as in (Litman et al., 2000)).",
        "However it can shed important light on understanding the complicated mechanism of the interaction between an utterance and its response.",
        "The research in this direction will not only instantly help the applications of short session dialogue such as automatic message replying on mobile phone and the chatbot employed in voice assistant like Siri1, but also it will eventually benefit the modeling of dialogues in a more general setting.",
        "Previous effort in modeling lengthy dialogues focused either on rule-based or learning-based models (Carpenter, 1997; Litman et al., 2000; Williams and Young, 2007; Schatzmann et al., 2006; Misu et al., 2012).",
        "This category of approaches require relatively less data (e.g. reinforcement learning based) for",
        "training or no training at all, but much manual effort in designing the rules or the particular learning algorithms.",
        "In this paper, we propose to attack this problem using an alternative approach, by leverag-ing the vast amount of training data available from the social media.",
        "Similar ideas have appeared in (Ja-farpour and Burges, 2010; Leuski and Traum, 2011) as an initial step for training a chatbot.",
        "With the emergence of social media, especially microblogs such as Twitter, in the past decade, they have become an important form of communication for many people.",
        "As the result, it has collected conversation history with volume previously unthinkable, which brings opportunity for attacking the conversation problem from a whole new angle.",
        "More specifically, instead of generating a response to an utterance, we pick a massive suitable one from the candidate set.",
        "The hope is, with a reasonable retrieval model and a large enough candidate set, the system can produce fairly natural and appropriate responses.",
        "This retrieval-based model is somewhat like non-parametric model in machine learning communities, which performs well only when we have abundant data.",
        "In our model, it needs only a relatively small labeled dataset for training the retrieval model, but requires a rather large unlabeled set (e.g., one million instances) for candidate responses.",
        "To further promote the research in similar direction, we create a dataset for training and testing the retrieval model, with a candidate responses set of reasonable size.",
        "Sina Weibo is the most popular Twitter-like microblog service in China, hosting over 500 million registered users and generating over 100 million messages per day 2.",
        "As almost all mi-croblog services, Sina Weibo allows users to comment on a published post3, which forms a natural one-round conversation.",
        "Due to the great abundance of those (post, response) pairs, it provides an ideal data source and test bed for one-round conversation.",
        "We will make this dataset publicly available in the",
        "which a user can publish short messages (will be referred to as post in the remainder of the paper) visible to public or a group specified by the user.",
        "Similar to Twitter, Sina Weibo has the word limit of 140 Chinese characters.",
        "Other users can comment on a published post, with the same length limit, as shown in the real example given in Figure 6 (in Chinese).",
        "Those comments will be referred to as responses in the remainder of the paper.",
        "ments it received.",
        "We argue that the (post, response) pairs on Sina Weibo provide rather valuable resource for studying one round dialogue between users.",
        "The comments to a post can be of rather flexible forms and diverse topics, as illustrated in the example in Table 1.",
        "With a post stating the user's status (traveling to Hawaii), the comments can be of quite different styles and contents, but apparently all appropriate.",
        "In many cases, the (post, response) pair is self-contained, which means one does not need any background and contextual information to get the main point of the conversation (Examples of that include the responses from B, D, G and H).",
        "In some cases, one may need extra knowledge to understand the conversation.",
        "For example, the response from user E will be fairly elusive if taken out of the context that A's Hawaii trip is for an international conference and he is going to give a talk there.",
        "We argue that the number of self-contained (post, response) pairs is vast, and therefore the extracted (post, re",
