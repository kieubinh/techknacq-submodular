        "Some examples of these three classes will be given in Section 3.",

        "The evaluation campaigns Tem-pEval 2007 (Verhagen et al., 2007) and TempEval 2010 (Verhagen et al., 2010) focused on temporal relation identification, mainly on temporal relations between events and times in the same sentence or in consecutive sentences and between events and the creation time of documents.",

        "More recently, Mirroshandel and Ghassem-Sani (2012) proposed a new method for temporal relation extraction by using a bootstrapping method on annotated data and have a better accuracy than state-of-the-art systems.",
        "Their method is based on the assumption that similar event pairs in topically related documents are likely to have the same temporal relations.",
        "For this work, the authors had already some collections of topically related documents and did not need to identify them.",
        "In the 2012 i2b2 challenge (i2b, 2012), the problem was not only to identify the type of temporal relations, but also to decide whether a temporal relation existed or not between two elements, either clinical concepts or temporal expressions.",
        "But, as in TempEval, the temporal analysis were only to be performed within a single document.",
        "Other works focus on event ordering.",

        "The first step consists in detecting narrative relations between events sharing coreferring arguments.",
        "Then, a temporal classifier orders partially the connected events with the before relation.",
        "Concerning the identification of the reaction relation, to our knowledge, there is no work on the detection of reaction between several documents.",
        "Pouliquen et al. (2007), Krestel et al. (2008) and Balahur et al. (2009) focused on the identification of reported speech or opinions in quotations in a document, but not on the identification of an event which is the source of a reaction and which can possibly be in another document.",
        "As we can see, all these approaches, as well as traditional information extraction approaches, lean on information contained by a single document, and consider an event as a word or a phrase.",
        "However, Ahmed et al. (2011) proposed a framework to group temporally and tocipally related news articles into same story clusters in order to reveal the temporal evolution of stories.",
        "But in these topically related clusters of documents, no temporal relation is detected between articles or events except chronological order.",
        "On this point of view, our task is closer to what is done in multidocument summarization, where a system has to detect redundant excerpts from various texts on the same topic and present results in a relevant chronological order.",
        "For example, Barzilay et al. (2002) propose a system for multidocument summarization from newswire articles describing the same event.",
        "First, similar text units from different documents are identified using statistical techniques and shallow text analysis and grouped into thematic clusters.",

        "to the user, in order to contextualize the information and recomposing the story of an event.",
        "Now that the task is well defined and that encouraging results have been obtained, we envisage to enrich classifiers by more fine-grained temporal and lexical information, such as narrative chains (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) for continuation relation or event clustering (Barzilay et al., 2002) for same-event relation.",
        "There is no doubt that reaction detection can be improved a lot, by going beyond simple lexical features and discovering specific patterns.",
        "We also intend to adapt the described system to other languages than English."
