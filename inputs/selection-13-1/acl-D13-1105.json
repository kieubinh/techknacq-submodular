        "Morphological lexicons specify all inflected forms for each lexeme; in a language with rich morphology, such a resource can be important for natural language processing (NLP) tasks in order to limit data sparseness.",
        "For example, a morphological lexicon is an important component of a morphological tagger or of a part-of-speech (POS) tagger for languages with rich morphology.1 Traditionally, a morphological lexicon has been created through painstaking lexicographic and morphological analysis of the language, drawing on unannotated corpora.",
        "Recently, new approaches have emerged.",
        "Fully or largely unsupervised approaches cannot link surface forms to morphosyntactic features and are thus not suited for building morphological lexicons.",
        "This problem is overcome by approaches that use explicit linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we investigate using existing morphologically annotated corpora.",
        "In a morphologically annotated corpus, the words in naturally occurring texts or transcribed speech are annotated for the correct morphological analysis (includ1Note that a full-form morphological lexicon is functionally equivalent to a morphological analyzer-generator, since one can be used to create the other.",
        "ing, of course, core POS) in context.",
        "While there has been much work on computational morphology, to our knowledge this is the first paper to study the question of how to extract morphological lexicons from morphologically annotated corpora, and how to determine how much annotation is needed.",
        "In this paper, we assume a corpus with each word annotated with morphosyntactic features and with a lemma which tells us what lexeme the word form is part of.",
        "The task is to predict the correspondence between a word form and its lemma and morphological features.",
        "This paper makes two contributions.",
        "First, we introduce an algorithm that learns unseen forms by analogy.",
        "This algorithm is language-independent.",
        "It incrementally merges complementary paradigm information about different lexemes into more abstract and more informative inflectional classes.",
        "Second, we explore how to model stems, and we propose a generalization of the Semitic root-and-template modeling.",
        "We use Egyptian Arabic (EGY), and German (GER) as our test languages.",
        "We test on corpus data, in order to simulate a standard real-world application.",
        "The baseline just uses the word forms seen in training and does not predict any unseen forms.",
        "Our language-independent algorithm improves the performance for both EGY and GER, with error reductions over the baseline of 44.4% for EGY and of 66.7% for GER.",
        "By adding language-specific modeling of the stem using templates, we obtain further error reductions for EGY (up to 55.6%) but not for GER.",
        "Next, we review related work (Section 2) and introduce the key linguistic concepts we use (Section 3).",

        "Approaches to Morphological Modeling Much work has been done in the area of computational morphology ranging from systems painstakingly designed by hand (Koskenniemi, 1983; Buckwalter, 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2006; De?trez and Ranta, 2012) to unsupervised methods that learn morphology models from unannotated data (Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Monson et al., 2008; Ham-marstro?m and Borin, 2011; Dreyer and Eisner, 2011).",
        "There is a large continuum between these two approaches.",
        "Closer to one end, we find work on minimally supervised methods for morphology learning that make use of available resources such as parallel data, dictionaries or some additional morphological annotations (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008).",
        "Closer to the other end, we find work that focuses on defining morphological models with limited lexicons that are then extended using raw text (Cle?ment et al., 2004; Forsberg et al., 2006).",
        "The work presented in this paper falls in the middle of this continuum: we are interested in learning complete morphological models using rich morphological annotations and, optionally, limited linguistic knowledge.",
        "We compare the value of different amounts of annotation and how they relate to additional linguistic knowledge.",
        "Morphological Paradigms Many traditional and modern theories of inflectional morphology organize natural language morphology by paradigms (Stump, 2001; Walther, 2011; Camilleri, 2011).",
        "Within the continuum we discussed above, we find hierarchical representations of paradigm knowledge that have been used in manually constructed morphological models (Finkel and Stump, 2002; Habash et al., 2005).",
        "Furthermore, De?trez and Ranta (2012) introduce an implementation of Smart Paradigms ?",
        "heuristically organized paradigms minimizing the number of forms needed to predict the full paradigm of a particular lexeme.",
        "Both Forsberg et al. (2006) and Cle?ment et al. (2004) describe methods for automatically populating a lexicon from raw data given a set of morphological inflectional classes in a language.",
        "Our work differs in that we use annotated data, but do not start with a complete set of inflectional classes; thus, our work is exactly complementary to this work.",
        "The concept of a paradigm is also used in many published efforts on unsupervised learning of morphology, although not always in a way consistent with its use in linguistics.",
        "For instance, Snover et al.",
        "(2002) (and later on Can and Manandhar (2012)) define a paradigm as ?a set of suffixes and the stems that attach to those suffixes and no others?.",
        "This definition is quite limited since it is not modeling the notion of lexeme.",
        "Chan (2006) defines a simpler concept of paradigms in his probabilistic paradigm model, which has many limitations, such as not handling syncretism or irregular morphology, nor distinguishing inflection and derivation.",
        "Dreyer and Eisner (2011) learn complete German verb paradigms from a small set of complete seed paradigms (50 or 100), which they choose randomly from all verbs in the language.",
        "They model stem changes using letter-based models, and use a large unannotated corpus in addition to the seed paradigms.",
        "Durrett and DeNero (2013) attack the same problem as Dreyer and Eisner (2011).",
        "Instead of using unannotated text, they model explicit rules for affixes and stem changes.",
        "The major difference between these two efforts and our work is that the problem is defined differently: we assume that the training and test data is defined by a corpus, not by complete paradigms.",
        "Our methods therefore are more sensitive to frequency effects of tokens.",
        "We believe that our way of stating the problem is more relevant to actual computational challenges for languages with limited morphological resources.",
        "We empirically compare our approach to that of Durrett and DeNero (2013) in Section 5.",
        "None of the unsupervised approaches mentioned model inflectional classes, i.e., meta-paradigmatic representation that cluster the various paradigms of different lexemes into a set of general classes of paradigms.",
        "There is no explicit notion of morphosyntactic features.",
        "In this paper we target the learning and completion of inflectional classes from morphologically annotated data.",
        "Our approach does not sacrifice details of what paradigms should include: we handle syncretism and stem changes, and allow for the prediction of new word forms from morphosyntactic features and lemmas, unlike the largely unsupervised work.",
        "Our work also differs from most previous work in that we investigate how to model stem change explicitly.",
        "Whereas other approaches model stem syncretism through letter",
        "based models (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Dreyer and Eisner, 2011), we explore the use of abstract stems.",
        "In our previous work on the EGY morphological analyzer CALIMA, we similarly used a lexicon of annotated morphological forms and extended it automatically using a simpler approach to paradigm completion (Habash et al., 2012)."
