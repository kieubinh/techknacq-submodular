        "The character-based approach treats segmentation as a character sequence labeling problem, indicating whether a character is located at the boundary of a word.",
        "Typically the word-based approach uses word level features, such as word n-grams and word length; while the character-based approach uses character level information, such as character n-grams.",
        "Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and there has been some research in combining the two approaches to improve the performance of supervised word segmentation.",
        "In this research we are trying to take advantage of the word-based and the character-based approaches in the semi-supervised setting for Chinese word segmentation, where there is only a limited amount of human-segmented data available, but there exists a relatively large amount of in-domain unsegmented data.",
        "The goal is to make use of the in-domain unsegmented data to improve the ultimate performance of word segmentation.",
        "According to Sun et al. (2009), ?the two approaches [word-based and character-based approaches] are either based on a particular view of segmentation.?",
        "This naturally motivates the use of co-training, which utilizes two models trained on different views of the input la-beled data which then iteratively educate each other with the unlabelled data.",
        "At the end of the co-training iterations, the initially weak models achieve improved performance.",
        "Co-training has been successfully applied in many natural language processing tasks.",
        "In this paper we describe an empirical study of applying co-training to semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Our experimental results show that co-training captures 20% and 31% of the performance improvement achieved by supervised training with an order of magnitude more data for the SIGHANBakeoff 2005 PKU and CU corpora respectively.",
        "In section 2 we review the two supervised approaches and co-training algorithm in more detail.",

(2005), and Zhang and Clark (2007) use averaged perceptron; Nakagawa (2004) uses general iterative scaling; Andrew (2006) uses semi-Markov CRF; and Sun (2010) uses a passive-aggressive learning algorithm.",
        "The character-based approach treats word segmentation as a character sequence labeling problem, to label each character with its location in a word, first proposed by Xue (2003).2 The basic label-ing scheme is to use two tags: ?B?",
        "for the beginning character of a word and ?O?",
        "for other characters (Peng et al., 2004).",

        "Given that many words contain more than one character, a word-based model can examine a wider context.",
        "Thus the contextual dependency information encoded in a character-based model is generally weaker than in a word-based model.",
        "Andrew (2006) also shows that semi-Markov CRF makes strictly weaker independence assumptions than linear CRF and so a word-based segmenter using an order-K semi-Markov model is more expressive than a character-based model using an order-K CRF.",

        "We split the features into two sets, a character-level feature set used by the character-based segmenter and a word-level feature set used by the word-based",
        "segmenter.",
        "We have shown that these two segmenters improve each other via co-training.",
        "However, as reviewed in Section 2.1, there is active research in combining the character-level and word-level features in a segmenter.",
        "When training with the whole set of data (i.e. under the CEILING condition), a segmenter with combined features tends to perform better than only using one set of features.",
        "Thus we need to address two problems.",
        "First, we want to understand whether co-training, which splits the features, can actually beat the BASIC and FOLD-IN baselines of a segmenter with combined features.",
        "Second, we want to explore whether we can further improve the final co-training performance by feature combination.",
        "To address these two problems, we adopt Weiwei Sun's character-based segmenter4 in (Sun, 2010).",
        "We use this segmenter because it is publicly available and it performs well on both the PKU corpus and CU corpus.",
        "It models word segmentation as a character labelling problem, and solves it with a passive-aggressive optimization algorithm.",
        "It uses the same feature set as in (Sun et al., 2009), including both character-level features and word-level features.",
        "Character-level features include character uni-grams and bi-grams in the five character window, and whether the current character is the same as the next or the one after the next character.",
        "Word",
        "level features include what word uni-grams or bigrams are anchored at the current character.",
        "Word uni-grams and bi-grams are extracted from the labeled training data.",
        "For more details, please refer to (Sun et al., 2009) and (Sun, 2010).",
        "For ease of description, we will refer to Weiwei Sun's segmenter with combined features as Sun-Segmenter, and the character-based segmenter used in our co-training which uses character-level features as Char-Segmenter.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance of the Sun-Segmenter under the three conditions: BASIC, FOLD-IN, and CEILING.",
        "We see that under the CEILING condition, the Sun-Segmenter outperforms the Char-Segmenter by 0.3% in the PKU corpus and 0.8% in the CU corpus.",
        "However, under the BASIC condition when there is only 10% of training data available, the Sun-Segmenter gives no gain.",
        "This probably is due to the fact that the Sun-Segmenter uses a much larger feature set and thus correspondingly a larger training set is needed to avoid under-fitting.",
        "The Sun-Segmenter has more gain when folding in the unsegmented data than the Char-Segmenter, further suggesting that the Sun-Segmenter is benefiting from the size of data.",
        "For both corpora, however, the Char-Segmenter after co-training beats the FOLD-IN baseline of the Sun-Segmenter by at least 0.5%, and the improvement is statistically significant.",
        "When there is only a small amount of segmented data available, using a more advanced segmenter with combined features still under-performs compared to co-training.",
        "These results justify the split of features for running co-training.",
        "Next we would like to explore whether we could further improve the co-training performance, given that we have a more advanced segmenter using combined features.",
        "We try two approaches.",
        "In the first approach, after all the iterations of co-training, the data are split into two sets, one set for training the word-based segmenter L1 and the other set for training the character-based segmenter L2.",
        "The segmentations of these two sets of data are probably better than the segmentations under the FOLD-IN condition.",
        "We thus combine the two sets of data, and use the combined data to train a new model with the Sun-Segmenter.",
        "In the second approach, we use the character-based segmenter after co-training, which has an improved performance, to relabel the set of unsegmented data U, and then combine it with the segmented data set S.We then use the combined data to train a new model with the Sun-Segmenter.",
        "Results are shown in Table 4.",
        "In the PKU corpus, we do not see a gain using either the data combination approach or the relabelling approach compared to the performance of the Char-Segmenter after co-training, probably because the Sun-Segmenter just modestly improves over the Char-Segmenter under the CEILING condition.",
        "However, in the CU corpus, where under the CEILING condition the Sun-Segmenter has a much bigger gain over the Char-Segmenter, there is 0.7% improvement by using the data combination approach and 0.8% by using the relabelling approach, and the improvement is statistically significant.",
        "Overall, using co-training with feature combination we are able to cut the gap between the BASIC baseline and CEILING of the Sun-Segmenter by 20% in the PKU corpus and 31% in the CU corpus."

        "There has been some research on semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation.",
        "For example, Liang (2005) derive word cluster features and mutual information features from unlabelled data, and add them to supervised discriminative training; Li and Sun (2009) use punctuation as implicit annotations of a character starting a word (the character after a punctation) or ending a word (the character before a punctuation) in a large unlabelled data set to augment supervised data; Sun and Xu (2011) derive a large set of features from unlabelled data, includ",
        "ing mutual information, accessor variety and punctuation variety to augment the character and word features derived from labelled data.",
        "These research works aim to use huge amount of unsegmented data to further improve the performance of an already well-trained supervised model.",
        "In this paper, we assume a much limited amount of segmented data available, and try to boost up the performance by using in-domain unsegmented data.",
        "Chinese word segmentation is domain-sensitive or application sensitive.",
        "For example, a CRF segmenter trained on the SIGhan MSR training data, which achieves an F-measure of 96.5% in the MSR testing data, only has 83.8% when applied to the PKU testing data; and the same CRF segmenter trained on the PKU training data achieves 94.5% on the PKU testing data.",
        "When one starts a new application that requires word segmentation in a new domain, it is likely that there is only a very small amount of segmented data available.",
        "We propose the approach of co-training for Chinese word segmentation for the semi-supervised setting where there is only a limited amount of human-segmented data available, but there exists a relatively large amount of in-domain unsegmented data.",
        "We split the feature set into character-level features and word-level features, and then build a character-based segmenter with character-level features and a word-based segmenter with word-level features, using the limited amount of available segmented data.",
        "These two segmenters then iteratively educate and improve each other by making use of the large amount of unsegmented data.",
        "Finally we combine the word-level and character-level features with an advanced segmenter to further improve the co-training performance.",
        "Our experiments show that using 10% data as segmented data and the other 90% data as unsegmented data, co-training reaches 20% performance improvement achieved by supervised training with all data in the SIGHAN 2005 PKU corpus and 31% in the CU corpus."
