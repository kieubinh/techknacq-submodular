        "Predicate-argument structure analysis is one of the fundamental techniques for many natural language applications such as recognition of textual entailment, information retrieval, and machine translation.",
        "In Japanese, the relationship between a predicate and its argument is usually represented by using case particles1 (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006; Taira et al., 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2011).",
        "However, since case particles vary depending on the voices, we have to take case alternation into account to represent predicate-argument structure.",
        "There are thus two major types of representations: one uses surface cases, and the other uses normalized-cases for the base form of predicates.",
        "For example, while the Kyoto University Text Corpus (Kawahara et al., 2004), one of the major Japanese corpora that contains annotations of predicate-argument structures, adopts",

        "Instead, postpositional case particles function as case markers.",
        "the former representation, the NAIST Text Corpora (Iida et al., 2007), another major Japanese corpus, adopts the latter representation.",
        "Examples (1) and (2) describe the same event in the passive and active voices, respectively.",
        "When we use surface cases to represent the relationship between the predicate and its argument in Example (1), the case of ??",

        "is ga2 and the case of ??",

        "is ni.2 On the other hand, when we use the normalized-cases for the base form, the case of ??",
        "(woman)?",
        "is wo2 and the case of ??",

        "is ga, which are the same as the surface cases in the active voice as in Example (2).",

        "man-ga woman-wo pushed down (A man pushed down a woman.)",
        "Both representations have their own advantages.",
        "Surface case analysis is easier than normalized-case analysis, especially when we consider omitted arguments, which are also called zero anaphors (Na-gao and Hasida, 1998).",
        "In Japanese, zero anaphora frequently occurs, and the omitted unnormalized-case of a zero anaphor is often the same as the surface case of its antecedent (Sasano and Kuro-hashi, 2011).",
        "Therefore, surface case analysis suits zero anaphora resolution.",
        "On the other hand, when 2Ga, wo, and ni are typical Japanese postpositional case particles.",
        "In most cases, they indicate nominative, accusative, and dative, respectively.",
        "we focus on the resulting predicate argument structures, the normalized-case structure is more useful.",
        "Specifically, since a normalized-case structure represents the same meaning in the same representation, normalized-case analysis is useful for recognizing textual entailment and information retrieval.",
        "Therefore, we need a system that first analyzes surface cases and then alternates the surface cases with normalized-cases.",
