        "A trend is a hot topic (e.g., the release of a popular movie) which is being widely discussed by the public.",
        "Hot trends usually attract much attention from the public, and they are likely to bring new business opportunities.",
        "Consider the following e-shopping scenario.",
        "A user in Beijing would like to buy something to reduce the health impacts of Beijing air pollution1.",
        "Different from traditional e-shopping stories, in this case the user may not have a clear idea of what she should buy, and cannot even formulate the",
        "air-pollutants-increase-in-china.html to find more details about the trending topic ?Beijing Air Pollution?.",
        "purchase needs into a clear query.",
        "Faced with trend-driven business opportunities, e-commerce companies typically ask workers to manually identify related products and make heuristic rules to match user queries (e.g., incorporating trending keywords into related product titles).",
        "To improve trend-driven e-commerce, in this paper, we propose to study the novel task of automatically identifying trend related products.",
        "Why is it compelling to understand and study trend-driven product purchase?",
        "Because hot trends are closely related to business opportunities directly or indirectly.",
        "As a case of direct causal relationship, the worldwide popularity of the movie series ?Harry Potter?",
        "created the great success of the original novels of ?Harry Potter?.",
        "As a case of indirect causal relationship, the stock rise or salary increase might exert positive effects on product sale.",
        "Based on our empirical analysis (See Section 3), a considerable proportion, i.e. 50%, of hot trends discussed on the largest Chinese microblog (i.e. Sina Weibo) indeed have corresponding product entries in the largest Chinese C2C e-commerce website (i.e. Taobao), which indicates a strong correlation between hot trends and product sale.",
        "Although the task is important and emergent, it has at least two major challenges.",
        "First of all, how to infer users?",
        "trend-driven purchase intents promptly.",
        "A trend usually happens unexpectedly.",
        "Without prior knowledge and experiences, it is particularly difficult to make rapid response to relate the trend to candidate products.",
        "Our solution is to leverage trend-related commercial intents from microblogs by mining users?",
        "real-time response to a trending topic.",
        "We adopt the solution based on two key considerations:",
        "(1) Microblogs are fast.",
        "As previous studies showed,",
        "the first story of a trending topic indeed was usually reported in microblogs rather than traditional news media (Sakaki et al., 2010; Kwak et al., 2010; Leskovec et al., 2009).",
        "(2) Microblogs contain users?",
        "commercial intents.",
        "The microblogging service has become one of the most popular social network platforms, where users may tweet about their needs and desires (Hollerit et al., 2013).",
        "E.g., a microblog user may complain about the air quality and evince the desire to buy a mouth mask in a tweet.",
        "The example indicates we can make use of tweet-level relatedness to capture the correlation between trends and products.",
        "Second, how to achieve a comprehensive coverage of related products but not hurting precision.",
        "The above solution will miss the related products which have not been discussed in microblogs.",
        "Our idea is to take the associativity between products into consideration.",
        "Our definition about associativity is very general and can have different instantiations in specific settings.",
        "For example, we can define product associativity to be the similarity between product descriptions, or the ratio of historical purchase records in e-commerce companies.",
        "However, one-step associativity may not fully discover the underlying relatedness between products due to the fact that the product associativity is indeed transitive.",
        "Thus, a transitable associativity model is needed.",
        "To address these two challenges, we propose a unified graph based ranking algorithm which jointly models the above two aspects, i.e., relevance and associativity.",
        "Given a trend, the algorithm runs in an iterative way and seeks a trade-off between relevance and associativity by propagating the scores on the product graph.",
        "Our contribution can be summarized as follows: (1) we introduce the novel task of identifying trend related products, most of all, we propose to leverage trend-related commercial intents from microblogs; (2) we present insightful empirical analysis to illustrate the correlation between hot trends and product sale (See Section 3); (3) we propose a novel graph based ranking algorithm which jointly considers relevance and associativity; (4) we carefully construct the test collection based on real data of the largest microblog and the largest C2C e-commerce website in China.",
        "(5) we perform extensive experiments and present some important implications for practice.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work was the first to consider identifying trend related products by leveraging commercial intents from microblogs.",
        "We believe the current work will have important impact on industry and inspire more follow-up research studies.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present the data collection and empirical analysis of the impact of hot trends on product sale in Section 3.",
        "We present a novel graph-based method in Section 4.",
        "Experimental setup and results are discussed in Section 5 and Section 6.",
