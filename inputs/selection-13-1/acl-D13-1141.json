        "If co-occurrences of exact word combinations are rare in the training parallel text, it can be difficult for classical statistical MT methods to identify this similarity, or produce a reasonable translation given the source phrase.",

        "As an extension to their monolingual counterpart (Turian et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Bengio et al., 2003), bilingual embeddings capture not only semantic information of monolingual words, but also semantic relationships across different languages.",
        "This property allows them to define semantic similarity metrics across phrase-pairs, making them perfect features for machine translation.",
        "To learn bilingual embeddings, we use a new objective function which embodies both monolingual semantics and bilingual translation equivalence.",
        "The latter utilizes word alignments, a natural subtask in the machine translation pipeline.",
        "Through large-scale curriculum training (Bengio et al., 2009), we obtain bilingual distributed representations which lie in the same feature space.",
        "Embeddings of direct translations overlap, and semantic relationships across bilingual embeddings were further improved through unsupervised learning on a large unlabeled corpus.",
        "Consequently, we produce for the research community a first set of Mandarin Chinese word embeddings with 100,000 words trained on the Chinese Gigaword corpus.",
        "We evaluate these embedding on Chinese word semantic similarity from SemEval2012 (Jin and Wu, 2012).",
        "The embeddings significantly outperform prior work and pruned tf-idf base-lines.",
        "In addition, the learned embeddings give rise to 0.11 F1 improvement in Named Entity Recognition on the OntoNotes dataset (Hovy et al., 2006) with a neural network model.",
        "We apply the bilingual embeddings in an end-to-end phrase-based MT system by computing semantic similarities between phrase pairs.",
        "On NIST08 Chinese-English translation task, we obtain an improvement of 0.48 BLEU from a competitive baseline (30.01 BLEU to 30.49 BLEU) with the Stanford Phrasal MT system."
