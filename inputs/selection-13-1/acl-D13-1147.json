        "Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are defined as ?idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries?",
        "(Sag et al., 2002).",
        "They tend to have a standard syntactic structure but are often semantically non-compositional; i.e. their meaning is not fully determined by their syntactic structure and the meanings of their constituents.",
        "A classic example is kick the bucket, which means to die rather than to hit a bucket with the foot.",
        "These types of expressions account for a large proportion of day-to-day language interactions (Schuler and Joshi, 2011) and present a significant problem for natural language processing systems (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach to detecting the compositionality of MWEs, specifically of verb-noun collocations.",
        "The idea is that we can recognize compositional phrases by substituting related words for constituent words in the phrase: if the result of a substitution yields a meaningful phrase, its individual constituents are likely to contribute toward the overall meaning of the phrase.",
        "Conversely, if a substitution yields a nonsensical phrase, its constituents are likely to contribute less or not at all to the overall meaning of the phrase.",
        "For the phrase eat her hat, for example, we might consider the following substituted phrases:",
        "1. consume her hat 2. eat her trousers",
        "Both phrases are semantically anomalous, implying that eat hat is a highly non-compositional verb-noun collocation.",
        "Following a similar procedure for eat apple, however, would not lead to an anomaly: consume apple and eat pear are perfectly meaningful, leading us to believe that eat apple is compositional.",
        "In the context of distributional models, this idea can be formalised in terms of vector spaces: the average distance between a phrase vector and its substituted phrase vectors is related to its compositionality.",
        "Since we are relying on the relative distances of phrases in semantic space, we require a method for computing vectors for phrases.",
        "We experimented with a number of composition operators from Mitchell and Lapata (2010), in order to compose constituent word vectors into phrase vectors.",
        "The relation between phrase vectors and substituted phrase vectors is most pronounced in the case of",
        "pointwise multiplication, which has the effect of placing semantically anomalous phrases relatively close together in space (since the vectors for the constituent words have little in common), whereas the semantically meaningful phrases are further apart.",
        "This implies that compositional phrases are less similar to their neighbours, which is to say that the greater the average distance between a phrase vector and its substituted phrase vectors, the greater its compositionality.",
        "The contribution of this short focused research paper is a novel approach to detecting the compositionality of multi-word expressions that makes full use of the ability of semantic vector space models to calculate distances between words and phrases.",
        "Using this unsupervised approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in a direct comparison with existing supervised methods."

        "The verb-noun collocation dataset from Venkatapa-thy and Joshi (2005), which consists of 765 verb-object pairs with human compositionality ratings, was used for evaluation.",
        "Venkatapathy & Joshi used a support vector machine (SVM) to obtain a Spear-man 's correlation of 0.448.",
        "They employed a variety of features ranging from frequency to LSAderived similarity measures and used 10% of the dataset as training data with tenfold cross-validation.",
        "McCarthy et al. (2007) used the same dataset and expanded on the original approach by adding WordNet and distributional prototypes to the SVM, achieving a 's correlation of 0.454.",
        "The distributional vectors for our experiments were constructed from the ukWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "Vectors were obtained using a standard window method (with a window size of 5) and the 50,000 most frequent context words as features, with stopwords removed.",
        "We also experimented with syntax-based co-occurrence features extracted from a dependency-parsed version of ukWaC, but in agreement with results obtained by Schulte im Walde et al. (2013) for predicting compositionality in German, the window-based co-occurrence method produced better results.",
        "We tried several weighting schemes from the literature, such as t-test (Curran, 2004), positive mutual information (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012) and the ratio of the probability of the context word given the target word1 to the context word's overall probability (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "We found that a tf-idf variant called LTU yielded the best results, defined as follows (Reed et al., 2006):",
        "where fij is the number of times that the target word and context word co-occur in the same window, nj is the context word frequency, N is the total frequency and |context word |is the total number of occurrences of a context word.",

        "We experimented with two different ways of obtaining neighbours for the constituent words in a phrase.",
        "Since vector space models lend themselves naturally to similarity computations, one way to get neighbours is to take the k-most similar vectors from a similarity matrix.",
        "This approach is straightforward, but has some potential drawbacks: it assumes that we have a large number of vectors to select neighbours from, and becomes computationally expensive when the number of neighbours is increased.",
        "An alternative source for obtaining neighbours is the lexical database WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We define neighbours as siblings in the hypernym hierarchy, so that the neighbours of a word can be found by taking the hyponyms of its hypernyms.",
        "WordNet alo allows us to extract only neighbours of the same grammatical type (yielding noun neighbours for nouns and verb neighbours for verbs, for example).",
        "Since not every word has the same number of neighbours in WordNet, we use only the first k",
        "neighbours, which means that the neighbours have to be ranked.",
        "An obvious ranking method is to use the frequency with which each neighbour co-occurs with the other constituent(s) of the same phrase.",
        "For example, for all the WordNet neighbours of eat (for all senses of eat), we count the co-occurrences with hat in a given window size and rank them accordingly.",
        "This ranking method also has the desirable side-effect of performing some word sense disambiguation, at least in some cases.",
        "For example, the highly ranked neighbours of apple for eat apple are likely to be items of food, and not (inedible) trees (apple is also a tree in WordNet).",
        "In order to obtain frequency-ranked neighbours, we used the ukWaC corpus with a window size of 5.",
        "One reason for having multiple neighbours is that it allows us to correct for word sense disambiguation errors (as mentioned above), since averaging over results for several neighbours reduces the impact of including incorrect senses.",
        "For example, the first 20 neighbours of eat, ranked by co-occurrence frequency with all the objects of eat in the dataset, are: eat use consume drink sample smoke swallow spend break hit save afford burn partake dine breakfast worry damage deplete drug One problem with the evaluation dataset is that it does not solely consist of verb-noun pairs: 84 phrases contain pronouns, while there are also several examples containing words that WordNet considers to be adjectives rather than nouns.",
        "This problem was mitigated by part-of-speech tagging the dataset.",
        "As neighbours for pronouns (which are not included in WordNet), we used the other pronouns present in the dataset.",
        "For the remaining words, we included the part-of-speech when looking up the word in WordNet."

        "To illustrate the method, consider the collocations take breath and lend money.",
        "The annotators assigned these phrases a compositionality score of 1 out of 6 and 6 out of 6, respectively, meaning that the former is non-compositional and the latter is compositional.",
        "The distances between the first ten verb-substituted phrases and the original phrase, together with the average distance, are shown in Table 1 and",
        "Substituting the verb in the non-compositional phrase yields semantically anomalous vectors, which leads to very small changes in the distance between it and the original phrase vector.",

        "the idiomatic sense in take breath, its neighbour-substituted phrases also have little overlap, resulting in a smaller change in distance upon substitution.",

        "of 0.61 and a Spearman 's of 0.71 and all reported differences in values are highly significant.",
        "Table 3 gives the results.",
        "Note that, even though the current approach is unsupervised (in terms of not having access to compositionality ratings during training, although it does rely on WordNet), it outperforms SVMs that require an ensemble of complex feature sets (some of which are also based on WordNet).",
        "It is interesting to observe that the state-of-the-art performance is reached when only using the verb's neighbours to compute substituted phrase vectors.",
        "One might initially expect this not to be the case, since e.g. eat trousers, where the noun has been substituted, does not make a lot of sense either ?",
        "which we would expect to be informative for determining compositionality.",
        "There are two possible explanations for this, which might be at play simultaneously: since our dataset consists of verb-object pairs, the verb constituent is always the head word of the phrase, and the dataset contains several so-called ?light verbs?, which have little semantic content of their own.",
        "Head words have been found to have a higher impact on compositionality scores for compound nouns: Reddy et al. (2011) weighted",
        "the contribution of individual constituents in such a way that the modifier's contribution is included but is weighted less highly than the head's contribution, which led to an improvement in performance.",
        "Our results might be improved by weighting the contribution of constituent words in a similar fashion, and by more closely examining the impact of light verbs for the compositionality of a phrase."
