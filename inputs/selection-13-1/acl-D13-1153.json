        "With the rapid development of linguistic resources in different languages, developing cross-lingual natural language processing (NLP) systems becomes increasingly important (Bel et al., 2003; Shanahan et al., 2004).",
        "Recently, cross-lingual adaptation methods have been studied to exploit labeled information from an existing source language domain where labeled training data is abundant for use in a target language domain where annotated training data is scarce (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).",
        "Previous work has shown that cross-lingual adaptation can greatly reduce labeling effort for a variety of cross language NLP tasks such as document categorization (Bel et al., 2003; Amini et al., 2009), genre classification (Petrenz and Webber, 2012), and sentiment classification (Shanahan et al., 2004; Wei and Pal, 2010; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).",
        "The fundamental challenge of cross-lingual adaptation stems from a lack of overlap between the feature space of the source language data and that of the target language data.",
        "To address this challenge, previous work in the literature mainly relies on automatic machine translation tools.",
        "They first translate all the text data from one language domain into the other and then apply techniques such as domain adaptation (Wan et al., 2011; Rigutini and Maggini, 2005; Ling et al., 2008) and multi-view learning (Amini et al., 2009; Guo and Xiao, 2012b; Wan, 2009) to achieve cross-lingual adaptation.",
        "However, machine translation tools may not be freely available for all languages.",
        "Moreover, translating all the text data in one language into the other language is too time-consuming in reality.",
        "As an economic alternative solution, cross-lingual representation learning has recently been used in the literature to learn language-independent representations of the data for cross language text classification (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010; Petrenz and Webber, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we propose to tackle cross language text classification by inducing cross-lingual predictive data representations with both labeled and unlabeled documents from the two language domains.",
        "Specifically, we propose a cross-lingual log-bilinear document model to learn distributed representations of words, which can capture both the semantic sim",
        "ilarities of words across languages and the predictive information with respect to the target classification task.",
        "We conduct the representation learning by maximizing the log-likelihood of all documents from both language domains under the cross-lingual log-bilinear document model and minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents.",
        "We formulate the learning problem as a joint non-convex minimization problem and solve it using a local optimization algorithm.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on the task of cross language sentiment classification of Amazon product reviews.",
        "The empirical results show the proposed approach is very effective for cross-lingual document classification, and outperforms other comparison methods."

        "Much work in the literature proposes to construct cross-lingual representations by using aligned parallel data.",
        "Basically, they first employ machine translation tools to translate documents from one language domain to the other one and then induce low dimensional latent representations as interlingual representations (Littman et al., 1998; Vinokourov et al., 2002; Platt et al., 2010; Pan et al., 2011; Guo and Xiao, 2012a).",
        "Littman et al. (1998) proposed a cross-language latent semantic indexing method to induce interlingual representations by performing latent semantic indexing over a dual-language document-term matrix, where each dual-language document contains its original words and the corresponding translation text.",
        "Vinokourov et al. (2002) proposed a cross-lingual kernel canonical correlation analysis method, which learns two projections (one for each language) by conducting kernel canonical correlation analysis over a paired bilingual corpus and then uses the two projections to project documents from language-specific feature spaces to the shared multilingual semantic feature space.",
        "Platt et al. (2010) employed oriented principal component analysis (Diamantaras and Kung, 1996) over concatenated parallel documents, which learns a multilingual projection by simultaneously minimizing the projected distance between parallel documents and maximizing the projected covariance of documents across different languages.",
        "Pan et al. (2011) proposed a bi-view non-negative matrix tri-factorization method for cross-lingual sentiment classification on the parallel training and test data.",
        "Guo and Xiao (2012a) developed a transductive subspace representation learning method for cross-lingual text classification based on non-negative matrix factorization.",
        "Some other works exploited parallel data by using multilingual topic models to extract cross-language latent topics as interlingual representations (Mimno et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2011; Platt et al., 2010; Smet et al., 2011) and using neural probabilistic language modes to learn word embeddings as cross-lingual distributed representations (Klementiev et al., 2012).",
        "Most of them were developed by applying the latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) in a multilingual setting, including the polylingual topic model (Mimno et al., 2009), the bilingual LDA model (Smet et al., 2011), and the multilingual LDA model (Ni et al., 2011).",
        "Platt et al. (2010) extended the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model (Hofmann, 1999) and presented two variants of multilingual topic models: the joint PLSA model and the coupled PLSA model.",
        "Recently, Klementiev et al. (2012) extended the neural probabilistic language model (Bengio et al., 2000) to induce cross-lingual word distributed representations on a set of word-level aligned parallel sentences.",
        "The applicability of these approaches however is limited by the availability of parallel corpus.",
        "Translating the whole set of documents to produce parallel corpus is too time-consuming, expensive and even practically impossible for some language pairs.",
        "We thus do not evaluate those approaches in our empirical study.",
        "Another group of works propose to use bilingual dictionaries to learn interlingual representations (Gliozzo, 2006; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).",
        "Gliozzo (2006) first translated each term from one language to the other using a bilingual dictionary and used the translated terms to augment original documents.",
        "Then they conducted latent semantic analysis (LSA) over the document-term matrix with concatenated vocabularies to obtain interlingual representations.",
        "Prettenhofer and Stein (2010) proposed a cross-language structural correspondence learning (CL-SCL) method to induce language-independent features by using word translation oracles.",
        "They first selected a subset of source",
        "language features, which have the highest mutual information with respect to the class labels in the labeled documents from the source language domain, to translate them into the target language domain, and then used these pivot pairs to induce cross-lingual representations by modeling the correlations between pivot features and non-pivot features.",
        "Our proposed approach shares a similarity with the CL-SCL method in (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) on only requiring a small amount of word translations.",
        "But our approach performs representation learning in a semi-supervised manner by directly incorporating discriminative information with respect to the target prediction task, while CL-SCL only exploits labels when selecting pivot features and the structural correspondence learning process is conducted in a fully unsupervised fashion.",
        "Some other bilingual resources, such as multilingual WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and universal part-of-speech (POS) tags (Petrov et al., 2012), have also been exploited in the literature for interlingual learning.",
        "Gliozzo (2006) proposed to use MultiWordNet to map words from different languages to a common synset-id as language-sharing terms.",
        "A similar work was proposed in A.R.",
        "et al (2012), which transformed words from different languages to WordNet synset identifiers as interlingual sense-based representations.",
        "However, multilingual WordNet resources are not always available for different language pairs.",
        "Recently, Petrenz and Webber (2012) used language-specific POS taggers to tag each word and then mapped those language-specific POS tags to twelve universal POS tags as interlingual features for cross language fine-grained genre classification.",
        "This approach requires a POS tagger for each language and it may be adversely affected by the POS tagging accuracy."

        "In each experiment, for a given value ?t, we randomly selected ?t documents from the training set of the target language domain as labeled data and used the rest as unlabeled data.",

        "We repeated each experiment 10 times based on different random selections of the labeled training data from the target language domain.",
        "The average classification accuracies and standard deviations across different ?t values for all comparison methods on all the nine tasks are plotted in Figure 1.",
        "We can see when the number of labeled target documents is small, TB performs poorly, especially for the first six tasks (GB, GD, GM, FB, FD, FM).",
        "By increasing the size of labeled target training data, TB can greatly increase its prediction accuracies and even outperform the CL-Dict method.",
        "The simple CL-Dict method has inconsistent performance across the nine tasks.",
        "Its performance is better than",
        "TB when the labeled training data in the target language domain is very limited and is poor than TB when the labeled target data reaches 300 for the six tasks using German and French as target languages.",
        "Moreover, when adapting a system from English to a much more different target language (Japanese), CL-Dict produces much lower accuracies for all the three tasks comparing with TB.",
        "These results show that CL-Dict has very limited capacity on transferring labeled information from a related source language domain.",
        "Similar performance is observed for CLD-LSA.",
        "With a more sophisticated representation learning, the CL-SCL method consistently outperforms CL-Dict.",
        "However, it produces inferior performance than CLD-LSA on the tasks of JB and JM.",
        "By using more translation resources, the MT method outperforms TB, CL-Dict, CLD-LSA, CL-SCL in all the nine tasks across almost all scenarios.",
        "Our proposed method CL-RL significantly outperforms all the other five comparison methods across all experiments except on the task of FD, where MT produces similar performance.",
        "Moreover, it is especially important to notice that CL-RL achieves high test accuracies even when the number of labeled target instances is small.",
        "This is important for transferring knowledge from a source language to reduce the labeling effort in the target language."
