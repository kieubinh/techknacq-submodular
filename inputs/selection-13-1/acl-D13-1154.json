        "Finding good representations of classification problems is often glossed over in the literature.",
        "Several authors have emphasized the need to pay more attention to finding such representations (Wagstaff, 2012; Domingos, 2012), but in document classification most research still uses n-gram representations.",
        "This paper considers two document classification problems where such representations seem inadequate.",
        "The problems are answer scoring (Burstein et al., 1998), on data from stackoverflow.com, and multi-attribute sentiment analysis (McAuley et al., 2012).",
        "We argue that in order to adequately represent such problems we need discontinuous features, i.e., regular expressions.",
        "The problem with using regular expressions as features is of course that even with a finite vocabulary we can generate infinitely many regular expressions that match our documents.",
        "We suggest to use expert knowledge or crowdsourcing in the loop.",
        "In particular we present experiments where standard representations are augmented with features from a few hours of manual work, by machine learning experts or by turkers.",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, we find that features derived from crowdsourced annotation tasks lead to the best results across the three datasets.",
        "While crowdsourcing of annotation tasks has become increasing popular in NLP, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to crowdsource the problem of finding good representations."
