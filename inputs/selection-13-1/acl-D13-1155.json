        "Although a compression may differ lexically and structurally from the source sentence, to date most systems are extractive and proceed by deleting words from the input (Knight & Marcu, 2000; Dorr et al., 2003; Turner & Charniak, 2005; Clarke & Lapata, 2008; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011, inter alia).",
        "To decide which words, dependencies or phrases can be dropped, (i) rule-based approaches (Grefenstette, 1998; Jing & McKeown, 2000; Dorr et al., 2003; Zajic et al., 2007), (ii) supervised models trained on parallel data (Knight & Marcu, 2000; Turner & Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Gillick & Favre, 2009; Galanis & Androutsopoulos, 2010, inter alia) and (iii) unsupervised methods which make use of statistics collected from non-parallel data (Hori & Furui, 2004; Zajic et al., 2007; Clarke & Lapata, 2008; Filippova & Strube, 2008) have been investigated.",
        "Since it is infeasible to manually devise a set of accurate deletion rules with high coverage, recent research has been devoted to developing statistical methods and possibly augmenting them with a few linguistic rules to improve output readability (Clarke & Lapata, 2008; Nomoto, 2009).",

        "To our knowledge, this extended data set has not yet been used for successful training of compression systems.",
        "Scarce parallel data makes it hard to go beyond a small set of features and explore lexicalization.",
        "For example, Knight & Marcu (2000) only induce non-lexicalized CFG rules, many of which occurred only once in the training data.",
        "The features of McDonald (2006) are formulated exclusively in terms of syntactic categories.",

        "Galanis & Androutsopoulos (2010) use many features when deciding which branches of the input dependency tree can be pruned but require a reranker to select most fluent compressions from a pool of candidates generated in the pruning phase, many of which are ungrammatical.",

        "These methods are sensitive to alignment errors, their performance degrades if the syntactic structure of the compression is very different from that of the input.",

        "Due to space limitations, we refer the reader to (Filippova & Strube, 2008) for a detailed description on the method.",
        "Essential for the present discussion is that source dependency trees are transformed to dependency graphs in that (1) auxiliary, determiner, preposition, negation and possessive nodes are collapsed with their heads; (2) prepositions replace labels on the edges to their arguments; (3) the dummy root node is connected with every inflected verb.",

        "(1) is thus the set of edges of the transformed dependency graph, like in Fig. 1(b).",
        "A benefit of the transformations is that function words and negation appear in the compression if and only if their head words are present.",
        "Hence no separate constraints are required to ensure that negation or a determiner is preserved.",

        "From every article, the headline and the first sentence, which are known to be semantically similar (Dorr et al., 2003), were extracted.",
        "Predictably, very few headlines are extractive compressions of the first sentence, therefore simply looking for pairs where the headline is a subsequence of the words from the first sentence would not solve the problem of getting a large amount of parallel data.",

        "Thus, instead of taking the headline as it is, we use it to find a proper extractive compression of the sen",

Once all the nodes in T which match content words and entities from H are identified, a minimum subtree covering these nodes is found such that every word or entity from H occurs as many times in T as in H. So if H mentions Obama only once, then either Barack Obama or he must be covered by the subtree but not both.",
        "This minimum subtree corresponds to an extractive headline, H*, which we generate by ordering the surface forms of all the words in the subtree nodes by their offsets in S. Finally, the character length of H* is compared with the length of H. If H* is much longer than H, the pair (H, S) is discarded (max ratio 1.5).",

        "Hence, sparse lexical features are useful for compression and a large parallel corpus is a requirement for successful supervised training.",
