        "Most UGC in social media is unstructured, or organized in a predefined category hierarchy.",

        "With new content kept adding into a hierarchy, we need to maintain category hierarchy (Yuan et al., 2012) to make content within the same category more topically cohesive.",
        "Apart from category hierarchy, UGC can also be organized by topic models and tags.",
        "Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), are widely applied in document clustering and classification, However, it is not trivial to control the granularity of topics (Chen et al., 2011).",
        "What's more, it is generally difficult to understand a topic only from the multinomial distribution (Mei et al., 2007).",
        "Social tagging provides an alternative approach in document organization (Gupta et al., 2010).",
        "In some UGC websites like stackoverflow3, users usually add tags to describe their contents.",
        "However, tags are not widely applicable and tags are usually sparse (Shepitsen et al., 2008).",
        "Our hierarchical entity-based approach prevents these problems by employing a large-scale entity repository.",
        "As the entity repository provides a unified set of entities across various of predefined topics, and gives descriptions of entities, CET avoids the granularity, interpretation and sparsity issues.",
        "The work in (Zhu et al., 2013), which automatically generates and updates topic terms to organize UGC, is mostly related to our work.",
        "In this paper, given a root topic, subtopics and lower-level topics are extracted from UGC, which form a hierarchical structure to organize corresponding UGC.",
        "However, in (Zhu et al., 2013) more external sources are utilized to identify subtopics.",
        "In addition, relationships among subtopics which under the same parent are not investigated.",
        "The metro maps proposed in (Shahaf et al., 2013) are also related to our work.",
        "Different from (Shahaf et al., 2013), we employ a large-scale entity repository to extract more meaningful and interpretable key terms (entities), which make each subtopic much easier to understand.",
        "Entity extraction.",
        "In our framework, we leverage an entity repository to extract named entities from UGC.",
        "A common approach is to utilize a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system like Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005), which recognizes the names of things (e.g., person and product names) from texts.",
        "For cross-domain NER, (Ru?d et al., 2011) employed search engines.",

        "To address the problem, (Ling and Weld, 2012) defined a fine-grained set of 112 tags based on Freebase for entity extraction.",
