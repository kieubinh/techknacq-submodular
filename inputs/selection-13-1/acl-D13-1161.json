        "Semantic parsers map sentences to formal representations of their underlying meaning.",
        "Recently, algorithms have been developed to learn such parsers for many applications, including question answering (QA) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2011), relation extraction (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012), robot control (Matuszek et al., 2012; Krishnamurthy and Kollar, 2013), interpreting instructions (Chen and Mooney, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), and generating programs (Kushman and Barzilay, 2013).",
        "In each case, the parser uses a predefined set of logical constants, or an ontology, to construct meaning representations.",
        "In practice, the choice of ontology significantly impacts learning.",
        "For example, consider the following questions (Q) and",
        "A semantic parser might aim to construct MR1 for Q1 and MR2 for Q2; these pairings align constants (count, person, etc.)",
        "directly to phrases (?How many,?",
        "?people,?",
        "etc.).",
        "Unfortunately, few ontologies have sufficient coverage to support both meaning representations, for example many QA databases would only include the population relation required for MR1.",
        "Most existing approaches would, given this deficiency, simply aim to produce MR1 for Q2, thereby introducing significant lexical ambiguity that complicates learning.",
        "Such ontological mismatches become increasingly common as domain and language complexity increases.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a semantic parsing approach that supports scalable, open-domain ontological reasoning.",
        "The parser first constructs a linguistically motivated domain-independent meaning representation.",
        "For example, possibly producing MR1 for Q1 and MR2 for Q2 above.",
        "It then uses a learned ontology matching model to transform this represen",
        "logical forms y, and answers a drawn from the Freebase domain.",
        "tation for the target domain.",
        "In our example, producing either MR1, MR2 or another more appropriate option, depending on the QA database schema.",
        "This two stage approach enables parsing without any domain-dependent lexicon that pairs words with logical constants.",
        "Instead, word meaning is filled in on-the-fly through ontology matching, enabling the parser to infer the meaning of previously unseen words and more easily transfer across domains.",
        "Figure 1 shows the desired outputs for two example Freebase sentences.",
        "The first parsing stage uses a probabilistic combi-natory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000; Clark and Curran, 2007) to map sentences to new, underspecified logical-form meaning representations containing generic logical constants that are not tied to any specific ontology.",
        "This approach enables us to share grammar structure across domains, instead of repeatedly relearning different grammars for each target ontology.",
        "The ontology-matching step considers a large number of type-equivalent domain-specific meanings.",
        "It enables us to incorporate a number of cues, including the target ontology structure and lexical similarity between the names of the domain-independent and dependent constants, to construct the final logical forms.",
        "During learning, we estimate a linear model over derivations that include all of the CCG parsing decisions and the choices for ontology matching.",
        "Following a number of recent approaches (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011), we treat all intermediate decisions as latent and learn from data containing only easily gathered question answer pairs.",
        "This approach aligns naturally with our two-stage parsing setup, where the final logical expression can be directly used to provide answers.",
        "We report performance on two benchmark datasets: GeoQuery (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and Freebase QA (FQ) (Cai and Yates, 2013a).",
        "GeoQuery includes a geography database with a small ontology and questions with relatively complex, compositional structure.",
        "FQ includes questions to Freebase, a large community-authored database that spans many sub-domains.",
        "Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cases, including a nine point improvement in recall for the FQ test."

        "The lexicon is open domain, using no symbols from the ontology O for K. This allows us to write a single set of lexical templates that are reused in every domain (Section 5.1).",
        "The burden of learning word meaning is shifted to the second, ontology matching, stage of parsing (Section 5.2), and modeled with a number of new features (Section 7.2) as part of the joint model.",

        "Following Cai and Yates (2013a), we also report a cross-domain evaluation where the Freebase data is divided by topics such as sports, film, and business.",

        "This method serves as the state of the art for our comparison in Section 9.",
        "We build on a number of existing algorithmic ideas, including using CCGs to build meaning representations (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010, 2011), building derivations to transform the output of the CCG parser based on context (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009), and using weakly supervised margin-sensitive parameter updates (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011, 2013).",

        "We filter Freebase to cover the domains contained in the FQ dataset resulting in a database containing 18 million entities, 2072 relations, 635 types, 135 million facts and 81 domains, including for example film, sports, and business.",
        "We use this schema to define our target domain, allowing for a wider variety of queries than could be encoded with the 635 collapsed relations previously used to label the FQ data.",

        "We run the training algorithm for one iteration on the Freebase data, at which point performance on the development set had converged.",

        "Both the Wiktionary features and knowledge base features were helpful.",
        "Without the Wiktionary features, the model must rely on word stem matches which, in combination with graph constraints, can still recover many of the correct queries.",
