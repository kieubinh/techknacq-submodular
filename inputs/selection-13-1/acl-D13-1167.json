        "Continuous semantic space representations have proven successful in a wide variety of NLP and IR applications, such as document clustering (Xu et al., 2003) and cross-lingual document retrieval (Dumais et al., 1997; Platt et al., 2010) at the document level and sentential semantics (Guo and Diab, 2012; Guo and Diab, 2013) and syntactic parsing (Socher et al., 2013) at the sentence level.",
        "Such representations also play an important role in applications for lexical semantics, such as word sense disambiguation (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007), measuring word ?Work conducted while interning at Microsoft Research.",
        "similarity (Deerwester et al., 1990) and relational similarity (Turney, 2006; Zhila et al., 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "In many of these applications, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) has been widely used, serving as a fundamental component or as a strong baseline.",
        "LSA operates by mapping text objects, typically documents and words, to a latent semantic space.",
        "The proximity of the vectors in this space implies that the original text objects are semantically related.",
        "However, one well-known limitation of LSA is that it is unable to differentiate fine-grained relations.",
        "For instance, when applied to lexical semantics, synonyms and antonyms may both be assigned high similarity scores (Landauer and Laham, 1998; Landauer, 2002).",
        "Asymmetric relations like hyponyms and hypernyms also cannot be differentiated.",
        "Although there exists some recent work, such as PILSA which tries to overcome this weakness of LSA by introducing the notion of polarity (Yih et al., 2012).",
        "This extension, however, can only handle two opposing relations (e.g., synonyms and antonyms), leaving open the challenge of encoding multiple relations.",
        "In this paper, we propose Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA), which strictly generalizes LSA to incorporate information of multiple relations concurrently.",
        "Similar to LSA or PILSA when applied to lexical semantics, each word is still mapped to a vector in the latent space.",
        "However, when measuring whether two words have a specific relation (e.g., antonymy or is-a), the word vectors will be mapped to a new space according to the relation where the degree of having this relation will be",
        "judged by cosine similarity.",
        "The raw data construction in MRLSA is straightforward and similar to the document-term matrix in LSA.",
        "However, instead of using one matrix to capture all relations, we extend the representation to a 3-way tensor.",
        "Each slice corresponds to the document-term matrix in the original LSA design but for a specific relation.",
        "Analogous to LSA, the whole linear transformation mapping is derived through tensor decomposition, which provides a low-rank approximation of the original tensor.",
        "As a result, previously unseen relations between two words can be discovered, and the information encoded in other relations can influence the construction of the latent representations, and thus potentially improves the overall quality.",
        "In addition, the information in different slices can come from heterogeneous sources (conceptually similar to (Riedel et al., 2013)), which not only improves the model, but also extends the word coverage in a reliable way.",
        "We provide empirical evidence that MRLSA is effective using two different word relations: antonymy and is-a.",
        "We use the benchmark GRE test of closest-opposites (Mohammad et al., 2008) to show that MRLSA performs comparably to PILSA, which was the pervious state-of-the-art approach on this problem, when given the same amount of information.",
        "In addition, when other words and relations are available, potentially from additional resources, MRLSA is able to outperform previous methods significantly.",
        "We use the is-a relation to demonstrate that MRLSA is capable of handling asymmetric relations.",
        "We take the list of word pairs from the Class-Inclusion (i.e., is-a) relations in SemEval-2012 Task 2 (Jur-gens et al., 2012), and use our model to measure the degree of two words have this relation.",
        "The measures derived from our model correlate with human judgement better than the best system that participated in the task.",

        "MRLSA can be viewed as a model that derives general continuous space representations for capturing lexical semantics, with the help of tensor decomposition techniques.",
        "We highlight some recent work related to our approach.",
        "The most commonly used continuous space representation of text is arguably the vector space model (VSM) (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "In this representation, each text object can be represented by a high-dimensional sparse vector, such as a term-vector or a document-vector that denotes the statistics of term occurrences (Salton et al., 1975) in a large corpus.",
        "The text can also be represented by a low-dimensional dense vector derived by linear projection models like latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990), by discriminative learning methods like Siamese neural networks (Yih et al., 2011), recurrent neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2013) and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2011), or by graphical models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "As a generalization of LSA, MRLSA is also a linear projection model.",
        "However, while the words are represented by vectors as well, multiple relations between words are captured separately by matrices.",
        "In the context of lexical semantics, VSMs provide a natural way of measuring semantic word relatedness by computing the distance between the corresponding vectors, which has been a standard approach (Agirre et al., 2009; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Yih and Qazvinian, 2012).",
        "These approaches do not apply directly to the problem of modeling other types of relations.",
        "Existing methods that do handle multiple relations often use a model combination scheme to integrate signals from various types of information sources.",
        "For instance, morphological variations discovered from the Google n-gram corpus have been combined with information from thesauri and vector-based word relatedness models for detecting antonyms (Mohammad et al., 2008).",
        "An alternative approach proposed by Turney (2008) that handles synonyms, antonyms and associations is to use a uniform approach by first reducing the problem to determining whether two",
        "pairs of words can be analogous, and then predicting it using a supervised model with features based on the frequencies of patterns in the corpus.",
        "Similarly, to measure whether two word pairs have the same relation, Zhila et al. (2013) proposed to combine heterogeneous models, which achieved state-of-the-art performance.",
        "In comparison, MRLSA models multiple lexical relations holistically.",
        "The degree that two words having a particular relation is estimated using the same linear function of the corresponding vectors and matrix.",
        "Tensor decomposition generalizes matrix factorization and has been applied to several NLP applications recently.",
        "For example, Cohen et al. (2013) proposed an approximation algorithm for PCFG parsing that relies on Kruskal decomposition.",
        "Van de Cruys et al. (2013) modeled the composition of subject-verb-object triples using Tucker decomposition, which results in a better similarity measure for transitive phrases.",
        "Similar to this construction but used in the community-based question answering (CQA) scenario, Qiu et al. (2013) represented triples of question title, question content and answer as a tensor and applied 3-mode SVD to derive latent semantic representations for question matching.",
        "The construction of MRLSA bears some resemblance to the work that use tensors to capture triples.",
        "However, our goal of modeling different relations for lexical semantics is very different from the intended usage of tensor decomposition in the existing work."

        "The elements of each slice are multiplied by the scaling factor before factorization.",
        "This is important because Tucker decomposition minimizes the reconstruction error (the Frobenius norm of the residual tensor).",
        "As a result, the slice with a larger range of values becomes more influential to U and V. In this work, we fixW:,:,ant, and search for the scaling factor of W:,:,syn in {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4} and the factors ofW:,:,hyper andW:,:,hypo in {0.0625, 0.125, 0.25}.",

        "For example, when we add the hypernymy and hyponymy relations to the tensor, these class-inclusion relations provide a weak signal to help resolve antonymy.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the fact that antonyms typically share the same properties but only have the opposite meaning on one particular semantic dimension.",
