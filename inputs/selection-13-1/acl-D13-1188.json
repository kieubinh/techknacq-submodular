        "The Web keeps many potentially valuable opinions in news articles which are partly new online articles or uploaded print media articles.",
        "Many companies or organisations such as political parties or even distinguished public figures perform a Media Response Analysis (MRA) (Watson and Noble, 2007) in order to analyse the output of their effort in public relations.",
        "So, an opinion-oriented analysis of news articles is important, because the tonality (Watson and Noble, 2007; Scholz et al., 2012a) is the key indicator of a MRA.",
        "A purely manual solution implies a big human effort for so-called media analysts, because they have to read and rate approx.",
        "200 to 800 news articles each week.",
        "As a consequence, an automated Opinion Mining solution is very attractive.",
        "At the same time, Opinion Mining in newspaper articles appears to be difficult, because not all parts of news articles are as subjective (Balahur et al., 2010) as reviews, for example.",
        "Also, different parts of one article can contain different opinions (Watson and Noble, 2007).",
        "Therefore, we work with extracted statements of news articles, in which a sequence of consecutive sentences has the same tonality value.",
        "At the same time, some approaches focus more on differentiating only between positive and negative news and leave out neutral examples (Taboada et al., 2011; Scholz et al., 2012b).",
        "Conversely, we have noticed that even if the used words in the news domain are quite similar, the tonality which the words express can be different, especially if neutral examples are involved (cf. section 3.1).",
        "We propose this task formulation: Problem definition: Let s ?",
        "d be a statement and document d represents a newspaper article.",
        "The task is to determine the tonality y for a given statement s, consisting of k words:",
        "Normally, a statement consists of one up to four sentences.",
        "But also longer statements are possible, but they appear less frequently in a MRA.",
        "An automated approach (Scholz and Conrad, 2013) for the extraction of statements already exists.",
        "The approach applies machine learning to extract relevant sentences from a collection of news articles and combine them to statements.",
        "So, we concentrate on the tonality classification, which is not provided by",
        "the approach for the statements extraction (Scholz and Conrad, 2013).",
        "Furthermore, we define the polarity of sentiment as the distinction between positive and negative sentiment and the subjectivity as the distinction between subjective (positive and negative) statements and neutral statements.",
        "The following example is a positive statement from an article in The Telegraph (8th Aug 2012) which deals with the prospects of British companies in Africa: ?",
        "Example statement (positive): There are structural factors behind the African growth story: a growing and sizeable population which is increasingly urbanised with disposable income; growing political stability; and a financial services industry that is still in its infancy.",
        "The so-called pressrelations dataset (Scholz et al., 2012a), which represents a publicly available corpus1 of a MRA on German news articles, contains 1,521 annotated statements.",
        "Since this is the only publicly available corpus of a MRA as far as we know, we perform our experiments in German.",
        "We are aware of the fact that viewpoints play a significant role in a newspaper, but since we concentrate on the determination of the tonality, the extraction of viewpoints can be solved in a separate step (Scholz and Conrad, 2012).",
        "This is possible, because the tonality of a statement can be determined without knowledge of the viewpoint in almost all cases.",
        "The only exception is a statement with multiple viewpoints and different tonalities, but these statements are very rare (cf. also section 4.1).",
        "Our approach learns a graph from an annotated collection of statements, in which nodes and edges model tonality-bearing word connections.",
        "For unseen statements, we recognize subgraphs of the learned graph, compare two weighting methods for extracting different tonality features, and classify the statements by a support vector machine.",
        "In this paper, we describe four state-of-the-art techniques for Opinion Mining in the next section about related work.",
        "In the third section, we introduce our graph-based and entropy-based approach to calculate the tonality features T .",
        "We will evaluate our approach against the state-of-the-art methods in section 4, before we conclude in the last section."

        "Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis represent a broad subject area (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "The different contributions reach from applying Opinion Mining in reviews and recommending new multimedia products for individuals (Qumsiyeh and Ng, 2012) to sentiment analyses for different topics in social media (Wang et al., 2011) or the creation of sentiment dictionaries (Baccianella et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we focus on state-of-the-art methods for Opinion Mining which differ from each other in their methodology.",
        "In the news domain, Wilson et al. (2009) developed a word-based classification approach which can extract contextual polarity.",
        "This method (denoted as Wilson) uses a lexicon and POS-tagging to generate word features and sentence features.",
        "Moreover, it also uses deep natural language analyses with dependency parse trees in order to calculate (general and polarity) modification features and structure features.",
        "Finally, they compute 32 features for neutral-polar classification and 10 features for the polarity classification.",
        "These features can be used by different kinds of machine learning techniques such as Ripper (Cohen, 1996) or BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000).",
        "Based on a sentiment lexicon, Taboada et al. (2011) calculate the semantic orientation of opinion-bearing words (SO-CAL).",
        "They begin with a fine-grained dictionary of adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and nouns which have a score from 5 to +5.",
        "?Masterpiece?",
        "has a score of +5 and ?monstrosity?",
        "of -5, for example.",
        "In addition, the approach takes intensifiers, negations, and irrealis (Taboada et al., 2011) into account and thereby modifies the score of the words through rules and formulas.",
        "SO-CAL identifies some special expressions and constructions, which tell the reader, that this text part does not really contain an actual opinion or sentiment.",
        "The linguistic term for this situation is called irrealis.",
        "Also, text-level features weight the final score by mere presence of the words.",
        "In the field of customer reviews, Ding et al. (2008) also work with a dictionary, which even includes context-dependent words (positive, neutral, and negative words) as well as rules to identify the sentiment orientation of words (Opinion",
        "Observer).",
        "The rules deal with negations, inter-sentence conjunctions, but-clauses, and the modifier ?too?.",
        "Furthermore, they extract relations between opinion words and corresponding product features.",
        "Thereby, a detailed analysis of product reviews is possible.",
        "Sarvabhotla et al. (2011) propose to extract the subjective excerpt of a text (RSUMM).",
        "They construct two word-vectors: An average document frequency vector represents the most important and most specific word features for the given domain.",
        "Subsequently, an average subjective measure vector selects the most subjective terms.",
        "As a result, they require hardly any natural language preprocessing except a sentence splitter and a tokenizer.",
        "The final classification is accomplished by a SVM (SVMLight (Joachims, 1999)).",
        "For product reviews, graph-based approaches (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006; Wu et al., 2009) can increase the performance in cross-domain tasks (Ponomareva and Thelwall, 2012).",
        "By contrast, our graph nodes do not represent documents, but words to overcome the problem of similar bag-of-words representations (cf. next section).",
        "One important resource for Opinion Mining in news is the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005) which contains word and phrase-based annotation for 523 news articles.",
        "Unfortunately, since the corpus does not have statements and a statement-based tonality, it is not designed as a MRA.",
        "A slightly larger corpus, the pressrelations dataset (Scholz et al., 2012a) with 617 articles, is the result of a MRA in German.",
        "We use this corpus as one part of our evaluation."

        "As the SentiWS has sentiment values between ?1 and 1, we apply similar procedures to construct the method-specific dictionaries as described above: For SO-CAL, it is the same procedure by using the SentiWS values, positive words has a score above 0.33 for Wilson and Opinion Observer, strongsubj words have an absolute value above 0.66 and so on.",

        "RSUMM (Sarvabhotla et al., 2011) needs less specific adaptation, because only a sentence splitter and a tokenizer are needed.",
        "So, RSUMM is very language-independent.",
        "We test two versions of this method: one includes the optimization step to estimate the best values for X and Y (notated as RSUMM(X%, Y%)) and the other version (RSUMM(100%)) does without this step, because we believe that every sentence is important in the statements and also because more words mean more information about the tonality in our domain.",
        "We use the sets for the creation of the graphs and lexicons as the validation dataset (VDS) (Sarvabhotla et al., 2011) and the subjectivity dataset (SDS) (Sarvabhotla et al., 2011).",
        "As in (Sarvabhotla et al., 2011), we apply the SVMLight package4 for classification.",
        "Opinion Observer (Ding et al., 2008) and SO-CAL (Taboada et al., 2011) do not use supervised learning.",
        "Therefore, we have also added our SVM in order to classify the statements based on the scores of Opinion Observer and SO-CAL (as shown in tables with (+ SVM))."
