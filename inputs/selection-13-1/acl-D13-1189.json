        "Microblogging services such as Twitter 1 , Sina Weibo2 and Tencent Weibo3 have swept across the globe in recent years.",

        "It is reported that there are more than 340 million tweets per day on Twitter and more than 200 million on Sina Weibo.",
        "A tweet means a post on Twitter.",
        "Since we mainly focus on Chinese microblogs instead of Twitter in this paper, we will refer to a post as a message.",
        "Each message is limited to 140 Chinese characters and usually contains several sentences.",
        "Currently, researches on microblog sentiment analysis have been conducted on polarity classification (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Jiang el al., 2011; Speriosu et al., 2011) and have been proved to be useful in many applications, such as opinion polling (Tang et al., 2012), election prediction (Tumasjan et al., 2010) and even stock market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011).",
        "However, classifying microblog texts at the sentence level is often insufficient for applications because it does not identify the opinion targets.",
        "In this paper, we will study the task of opinion target extraction for Chinese microblog messages.",
        "Opinion target extraction aims to find the object to which the opinion is expressed.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?The sound quality is good!",
        "?, ?sound quality?",
        "is the opinion target.",
        "This task is mostly studied in customer review texts in which opinion targets are often referred as features or aspects (Liu, 2012).",
        "Most of the opinion target extraction approaches rely on dependency parsing (Zhuang et al., 2006; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Qiu et al., 2011) and are regarded as a domain-dependent task (Li et al., 2012a).",
        "However, such approaches are not suitable for microblogs because the natural language processing tools perform poorly on microblog texts due to their inherent characteristics.",
        "Studies show that one of the state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers - OpenNLP only achieves the accuracy of 74% on tweets (Liu et al. 2011).",
        "The syntactic analysis tool that generates dependency relation may perform even worse.",
        "Besides, microblog messages may express opinion in different ways and do not always contain opinion words, which lowers the performance of methods utilizing opinion words to find opinion targets.",
        "In this study, we propose an unsupervised method to collectively extract the opinion targets from opinionated sentences in the same topic.",
        "Topics are directly identified by hashtags.",
        "We first present a dynamic programming based segmentation algorithm for Chinese hashtag segmentation.",
        "By leveraging the contents in a topic, our segmentation algorithm can successfully identify out-of-vocabulary words and achieve promising results.",

        "We propose an unsupervised label propagation algorithm to collectively rank the candidates of all sentences based on the assumption that similar sentences in a topic may share the same opinion targets.",
        "Finally, for each sentence, the candidate which gets the highest score after unsupervised label propagation is selected as the opinion target.",
        "Our contributions in this study are summarized as follows: 1) our method considers not only the explicit opinion targets within the sentence but also the implicit opinion targets in the hashtag or mentioned in the previous sentence.",
        "2) We develop an efficient algorithm to segment Chinese hashtags.",
        "It can successfully identify out-of-vocabulary words by leveraging contextual information and help to improve the segmentation performance of the messages in the topic.",
        "3) We develop an unsupervised label propagation algorithm for collective opinion target extraction.",
        "Label propagation (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) aims to spread label distributions from a small training set throughout the graph.",
        "However, our unsupervised algorithm leverages the connection between two adjacent unlabeled nodes to find the correct labels for both of them.",
        "The proposed unsupervised method does not need any training corpus which will cost much human labor especially for fine-grained annotation.",
        "4) To the best of our knowledge, the task of opinion target extraction in microblogs has not been well studied yet.",
