        "Research in authorship attribution has developed substantially over the last decade (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "The vast majority of such research has been dedicated towards finding the author of long texts, ranging from single passages to book chapters.",
        "In recent years, the growing popularity of social media has created special interest, both theoretical and computational, in short texts.",
        "This has led to many recent authorship attribution projects that experimented with web data such as emails (Abbasi and Chen, 2008), web forum messages (Solorio et al., 2011) and blogs (Koppel et al., 2011b).",
        "This paper addresses the question to what extent the authors of very short texts can be identified.",
        "To answer this question, we experiment with Twitter tweets.",
        "Twitter messages (tweets) are limited to 140 characters.",
        "This restriction imposes major difficulties on authorship attribution systems, since authorship attribution methods that work well on long texts are often not as useful when applied to short texts (Burrows, 2002; Sanderson and Guenter, 2006).",
        "Nonetheless, tweets are relatively self-contained and have smaller sentence length variance compared to excerpts from longer texts (see Section 3).",
        "These characteristics make Twitter data appealing as a testbed when focusing on short texts.",
        "Moreover, an authorship attribution system of tweets may have various applications.",
        "Specifically, a range of cyber-crimes can be addressed using such a system, including identity fraud and phishing.",
        "In this paper, we introduce the concept of k-signatures.",
        "We denote the k-signatures of an author a as the features that appear in at least k% of a's training samples, while not appearing in the training set of any other author.",
        "When k is large, such signatures capture a unique style used by a.",
        "An analysis of our training set reveals that unique k-signatures are typical of many authors.",
        "Moreover, a substantial portion of the tweets in our training set contain at least one such signature.",
        "These findings suggest that a single tweet, although short and sparse, often contains sufficient information for identifying its author.",
        "Our results show that this is indeed the case.",
        "We train an SVM classifier with a set of features that include character n-grams and word n-grams.",
        "We use a rigorous experimental setup, with varying number of authors (values between 50-1,000) and various sizes of the training set, ranging from 50 to 1,000 tweets per author.",
        "In all our experiments, a single tweet is used as test document.",
        "We also use a setting in which the system is allowed to respond don't know in cases of uncertainty.",
        "Applying this option results in higher precision, at the expense of",
        "lower recall.",
        "Our results show that the author of a tweet can be successfully identified.",
        "For example, when using a dataset of as many as 1,000 authors with 200 training tweets per author, we are able to obtain 30.3% accuracy (as opposed to a random baseline of only 0.1%).",
        "Using a dataset of 50 authors with as few as 50 training tweets per author, we obtain 50.7% accuracy.",
        "Using a dataset of 50 authors with 1,000 training tweets per author, our results reach as high as 71.2% in the standard classification setting, and exceed 91% accuracy with 60% recall in the don't know setting.",
        "We also apply a new set of features, never previously used for this task ?",
        "flexible patterns.",
        "Flexible patterns essentially capture the context in which function words are used.",
        "The effectiveness of function words as authorship attribution features (Koppel et al., 2009) suggests using flexible pattern features.",
        "The fact that flexible patterns are learned from plain text in a fully unsupervised manner makes them domain and language independent.",
        "We demonstrate that using flexible patterns gives significant improvement over our baseline system.",
        "Furthermore, using flexible patterns, our system obtains a 6.1% improvement over current state-of-the-art results in authorship attribution on Twitter.",
        "To summarize, the contribution of this paper is threefold.",

        "Authorship attribution dates back to the end of 19th century, when (Mendenhall, 1887) applied sentence length and word length features to plays of Shakespeare.",

        "For recent surveys, see (Koppel et al., 2009; Stamatatos, 2009; Juola, 2012).",
        "Authorship attribution methods can be generally divided into two categories (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "In similarity-based methods, an anonymous text is attributed to some author whose writing style is most similar (by some distance metric).",
        "In machine learning methods, which we follow in this paper, anonymous texts are classified, using machine learning algorithms, into different categories (in this case, different authors).",
        "Machine learning papers differ from each other by the features and machine learning algorithm.",
        "Examples of features include HFWs (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Argamon et al., 2007), character n-gram (Kjell, 1994; Hoorn et al., 1999; Stamatatos, 2008), word n-grams (Peng et al., 2004), part-of-speech n-grams (Koppel and Schler, 2003; Koppel et al., 2005) and vocabulary richness (Abbasi and Chen, 2005).",
        "The various machine learning algorithms used include naive Bayes (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Kjell, 1994), neural networks (Matthews and Merriam, 1993; Kjell, 1994), K-nearest neighbors (Kjell et al., 1995; Hoorn et al., 1999) and SVM (De Vel et al., 2001; Diederich et al., 2003; Koppel and Schler, 2003).",
        "Traditionally, authorship attribution systems have mainly been evaluated against long texts such as theater plays (Mendenhall, 1887), essays (Yule, 1939; Mosteller and Wallace, 1964), biblical books (Mealand, 1995; Koppel et al., 2011a) and book chapters (Argamon et al., 2007; Koppel et al., 2007).",
        "In recent year, many works focused on web data such as emails (De Vel et al., 2001; Koppel and Schler, 2003; Abbasi and Chen, 2008), web forum messages (Abbasi and Chen, 2005; Solorio et al., 2011), blogs (Koppel et al., 2006; Koppel et al., 2011b) and chat messages (Abbasi and Chen, 2008).",
        "Some works focused on SMS messages (Mohan et al., 2010; Ishihara, 2011).",
        "Authorship Attribution on Twitter.",
        "The performance of authorship attribution systems on short texts is affected by several factors (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "These factors include the number of candidate authors, the training set size and the size of the test document.",
        "Very few authorship attribution works experimented with Twitter.",
        "Unlike our work, all used a single group of authors (group sizes varied between 3-50).",
        "Layton et al. (2010) used the SCAP methodology (Frantzeskou et al., 2007) with character n-gram features.",
        "They experimented with 50 authors and compared different numbers of tweets per author (values between 20-200).",
        "Surprisingly, they showed that their system does not improve when given more training tweets.",
        "In our work, we noticed a different trend, and showed that more data can be extremely valuable for authorship attribution systems on micro-messages (see Section 6).",
        "Silva et al. (2011) trained an SVM classifier with various features (e.g., punctuation and vocabulary features) on a small dataset of three authors only, with varying training set size.",
        "Although their work used a set of Twitter-specific features that we do not explicitly use, our features implicitly cover a large portion of their features (such as punctuation and emoticon",
        "features, which are largely covered by character n-grams).",
        "Boutwell (2011) used a naive Bayes classifier with character n-gram features.",
        "She experimented with 50 authors and two training size values (120 and 230).",
        "She also provided a set of experiments that studied the effect of joining several tweets into a single document.",

        "They experimented with 10 authors of Greek text, and also joined several tweets into a single document.",
        "Joining several tweets into a longer document is appealing since it can lead to substantial improvement of the classification results, as demonstrated by the works above.",
        "However, this approach requires the test data to contain several tweets that are known a-priori to be written by the same author.",
        "This assumption is not always realistic.",
        "In our paper, we intentionally focus on a single tweet as document size.",
        "Flexible Patterns.",
        "Patterns were introduced by (Hearst, 1992), who used hand crafted patterns to discover hyponyms.",
        "Hard coded patterns were used for many tasks, such as discovering meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999), noun categories (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and semantic class learning (Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Patterns were first extracted in a fully unsupervised manner (?flexible patterns?)",
        "by (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), who used flexible patterns in order to establish noun categories, and (Bicic?i and Yuret, 2006) who used them for analogy question answering.",
        "Ever since, flexible patterns were used as features for various tasks such as extraction of semantic relationships (Davidov et al., 2007; Tur-ney, 2008b; Bollegala et al., 2009), detection of synonyms (Turney, 2008a), disambiguation of nominal compound relations (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a), sentiment analysis (Davidov et al., 2010b) and detection of sarcasm (Tsur et al., 2010)."
