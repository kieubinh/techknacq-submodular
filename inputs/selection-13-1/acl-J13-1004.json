        "2013 Association for Computational Linguistics  cannot exclude that architectural or representational modeling decisions established as empirically useful on English data may be favoring the specific language type of English.",
        "Indeed, carrying over successful model architectures from English to typologically different languages mostly leads to a substantial drop in parsing accuracy.",
        "Linguistically aware representational adjustments can help reduce the problem significantly, as Collins et al. (1999) showed in their pivotal study adjusting a statistical (constituent) parsing model to a highly inflectional language with free word order, Czech in that case, pushing the results more than seven percentage points up to a final 80% dependency accuracy (as compared with 91% accuracy for the English ?source?",
        "parser on the Wall Street Journal).",
        "Even in recent years, however, a clear gap has remained between the top parsing architecture for English and morphologically rich(er) languages.",
        "The relative hardness of the parsing task, compared with English, cuts across statistical parsing approaches (constituent or dependency parsing) and across morphological subtypes, such as languages with a moderately sized remaining inflectional system (like German), highly inflected languages (like Czech), and languages in which interactions with derivational morphology make the segmentation question non-trivial (such as Turkish or Arabic, compare, for example, Eryig?it, Nivre, and Oflazer [2008]).",
        "Still, it remains hard to pinpoint systematic architectural or representational factors that explain the empirical picture, although there is a collection of ?recipes?",
        "one can try to tune an approach to a ?hard language.?",
        "Of course, there are good reasons for adjusting a well-proven system rather than developing a more general one from scratch?given that part of the success of statistical parsing in general lies in subtle ways of exploiting statistical patterns that reflect inaccessible levels of information in an indirect way.",
        "This article attempts to do justice to the special status of mature data-driven systems and still contribute to a systematic clarification, by (1) focusing on a clear-cut aspect of morphological marking relevant to syntactic parsing (namely, case marking of core arguments); (2) comparing a selection of languages covering part of the typological spectrum (Czech, German, and Hungarian); (3) using a state-of-the-art data-driven parser (Bohnet 2009, 2010) to establish how far the technique of representational adjustments may take us; and (4) performing a problem-oriented comparison with an alternative architecture, which allows us to add constraints motivated from linguistic considerations.",
        "In a first experiment, we vary the morphological information available to the parser and examine the errors of the parser with respect to the case-related functions.",
        "It turns out that although the parser is indeed able to learn the case-function mapping for all three languages, it is susceptible to errors that are propagated through the pipeline model when parsing languages that show syncretism2 in their morphological paradigms, in our case Czech and German (e. g., for neuter nouns, nominative and accusative case have the same surface form).",
        "In contrast, due to its mostly unambiguous case system, we find a much smaller effect for Hungarian.",
        "Although the parser itself profits much from morphological information as our experiments with gold standard morphology show, errors in automatically predicted morphological information frequently cause errors in the syntactic analysis.",
        "Seeker and Kuhn Morphological and Syntactic Case in Statistical Dependency Parsing In order to better handle syncretism in the morphological description, we then propose a different way of integrating morphology into the parsing process.",
        "We develop an alternative architecture that circumvents the strict separation of morphological and syntactic analysis in the pipeline model.",
        "We adopt the integer linear programming (henceforth ILP) approach by Martins, Smith, and Xing (2009), which we augment with a set of linguistically motivated constraints modeling the morpho-syntactic dependencies in the languages.",
        "Case is herein interpreted as an underspecified filtering device that guides a statistical model by restricting the search space of the parser.",
        "Due to the constraints, the output of the ILP parser is guaranteed to obey all syntactic restrictions that are marked overtly in the morphological form of the words.",
        "Although the restrictions are implemented as symbolic constraints, they are applied to the parser during the search for the best tree, which is driven by a statistical model.",
        "We show in a second experiment that restricting the search space in this way improves the performance on argument functions (indicated by case morphology) considerably on all three languages while the performance on all other functions stays stable.",
        "We proceed by first discussing the role of case morphology in syntax (Section 2), followed by a presentation of the parsing architecture of the Bohnet parser with a discussion of the relevant aspects for our first experiment (Section 3).",
        "Next, we compare the morphological annotation quality of automatic tools with the gold standard across languages (Section 4).",
        "We then turn to the first experiment in this article where we examine the performance of the parser with respect to core argument functions on the three languages (Section 5).",

        "Challenges of Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages A characteristic property of most languages commonly referred to as morphologically rich is that they use morphological means at the word level to encode grammatical relations within the sentence rather than using the phrase-structural configuration.",
        "Whereas in English or Chinese, placement of a word (or phrase) in a particular position relative to the verbal head marks its function (e. g., as the subject or object), morphologically rich languages encode grammatical relations largely by changing the morphological form of the dependent word, the head word, or both.",
        "A correlated phenomenon is the free word order for which many of these languages allow.",
        "Because information about grammatical relations is marked on the words themselves, it stays available regardless of their relative position, so word order can be used to mark other information such as topic-focus structure.",
        "The richer the morphological system, the freer the word order tends to be, or, as Bresnan (2001) puts it, morphology competes with syntax.",
        "We thus see that typologically, morphological and syntactic systems are interdependent and influence each other.",
        "Most languages are located somewhere along a continuum between purely configurational and purely morphological marking.",
        "In principle, data-driven parsing models with word form sensitive features have the potential to not only pick up configurational patterns for grammatical relation marking, but also systematic patterns in the observed variation and covariation of morphological word forms.",
        "It is, however, not only the interaction between syntax and morphology that adds challenges?the marking patterns are also non-trivial to pick up from surface data.",
        " One of the linguistic challenges is that there are different, overlapping regimes for morphological marking.",
        "One can distinguish head-marking and dependent-marking of a grammatical relation, depending on where the inflection occurs.",
        "In addition, Nichols (1986, page 58) identifies four ways in which inflection markers may play a role in signaling syntactic dependency: Example 1 Hebrew, taken from Nichols (1986, page 58) be?t house-of sefer book ?school?, lit.",
        "?book house?",
        "First, the morphological marker simply registers the presence of a syntactic dependency.",
        "In Example (1), the form of the word be?t signals the presence of a dependent, without specifying the nature of the relation.",
        "Second, the affix marks not only the presence but also the type of the dependency.",
        "A typical example of the dependent-marking kind is nominal case: Accusative case on a noun marks it not only as a dependent of a verb, but it also marks the type of relation, namely, direct object.",
        "Verb agreement markers in Indo-European languages are a head-marking kind of example: They indicate that a noun stands specifically in the subject relation.",
        "Third, a morphological marker may, in addition, index certain lexical or inflectional categories of the dependent on the head (or vice versa).",
        "Subject agreement often indexes the dependent subject's gender and number properties on the head verb; attributive adjectives in Czech, for instance, agree with their noun heads in case, number, and gender.",
        "Fourth, for some affixes, there is a paradigm for indexing internal properties of the head on the head itself (e. g., tense or mood of a verb) or properties of the dependent on the dependent (e. g., gender marking on nouns).",
        "An additional linguistic challenge in learning the patterns from data, which we will discuss in detail in Section 2.2, comes from the fact that the inflectional paradigms may contain syncretism.",
        "This may interfere with the learning of the previously discussed patterns.",
        "Further challenges we do not address in this article include interactions between syntax and derivational morphology, which for some languages like Turkish and Arabic can go along with segmentation issues.",
        "The first Workshop on Statistical Parsing of Morphologically Rich Languages has set the agenda for developing effective systems by identifying three main types of technical challenges (Tsarfaty et al. 2010, page 2), which we rephrase here from our system perspective: Architectural challenges.",
        "Should data-driven syntactic parsing be split into subtasks, and how should they interact?",
        "Specifically, should morphological analysis (and likewise tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, etc.)",
        "be performed in a separate (data-driven?)",
        "module and how can error propagation through the pipeline be minimized?",
        "Can a joint model be trained on data that captures two-way interactions between several levels of representation?",
        "Should the same system modularization be used in training and decoding, or can decoding combine locally trained models, taking into account more global structural and representational constraints?",
        "Representational challenges.",
        "At what technical level should morphological distinctions be represented?",

        "The standard way established in the CoNLL Shared Tasks (Nivre et al. 2007a; Hajic?",

        "Although Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) and Marton, Habash, and Rambow (2010) find improvements for hand-annotated (gold) morphological features, automatically predicted morphological information has none or even negative effects on their parsing models.",
        "Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) also show that linguistically grounded, carefully designed features (here agreement between adjectives and nouns in Hebrew) can contribute a considerable improvement, however.",

        "Cohen and Smith (2007), Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008), and Lee, Naradowsky, and Smith (2011) present joint models where the processes of predicting morphological information and syntactic information are performed at the same time.",
        "All three approaches acknowledge the fact that syntax and morphology are heavily intertwined and interact with each other.",
        "Our attempt at tackling the technical and linguistic challenges can be characterized as follows: In Section 6, we propose a system architecture that at the basic level follows a pipeline approach, where local data-driven models are used to predict the highest scoring output in each step.",
        "But this pipeline is complemented with a knowledge-based component modeling grammatical knowledge about inflectional paradigms and morphological marking of grammatical relations.",
        "Both parts are combined using a set of global constraints that model the language-specific morpho-syntactic dependencies to which a syntactic structure in that language has to adhere.",
        "These constraints are",
        " used to weed out linguistically implausible structures among the candidate outputs of the parser.",
        "Our architecture thus resides between a strict pipeline approach where no step can influence previous results, and a full joint model, where several subtasks are predicted simultaneously.",
        "Using the global constraints we can precisely define the parts of the structure where an interaction between the morphology and the syntax is allowed to take place.",
        "The key design tasks are of a representational nature: What are the linguistic units for which hard constraints can (and should) be enforced in a language?",
        "(For example, within Czech and German nominal phrases, indexing of case, number, and gender follows a strict regime?the values have to co-vary.)",
        "What underspecified interface representation is appropriate to negotiate between the potentially ambiguous output of one local component and the assumed input of another component?",
        "How can we restrict them as much as possible without sacrificing the correct solution?",
        "As it turns out, the explicit enforcement of conservative linguistic constraints over morphological and syntactic structures in decoding leads to significantly improved parsing performance on case-bearing dependents, and also to improved overall performance over a state-of-the-art data-driven pipeline approach."

        "Because we are interested in the way the parser handles morphological information, we will briefly discuss the inclusion of morphological features as described in Bohnet (2009, page 3).",
        "The parser computes morphological features by combining the part-of-speech tags (pos) of the head and the dependent with the crossproduct of their morphological feature values.",
        "For this, the morphological information (see Figure 2: columns 7 and 8) is split at the vertical bar and every single morphological feature value is treated as one morphological feature in the statistical model.",

        "They demonstrate that a rule-based parser can benefit from statistical models that model preferences rather than hard constraints.",
        "Our approach comes from the other side: We equip a statistical parser with hard rules that ensure the linguistic plausibility of the output.",
        "Both approaches prove that proper statistical models and linguistically motivated rules can work well together to produce syntactic structures of high quality.",
        "One advantage of applying constraints over the argument structure is that we can give a guarantee that certain ill-formed trees will not be produced by the parser.",
        "For example, the constraints make sure that there will not be any parser output where there are two subjects annotated for the same verb.",
        "Although this does not mean that the subject will be the correct one, the formal requirement of not having two subjects is met, which we believe can be helpful for subsequent semantic analysis/interpretation or, for example, relation extraction.",
        "In the same sense, the constraints will also ensure that morphological agreement and case licensing is correct to the degree that the morphological analyzer was correct.",
        "This feature thus implements a tentative notion of grammaticality for the statistical model."

        "In this article, we investigated the performance of the state-of-the-art statistical dependency parser by Bohnet (2010) on three morphologically rich languages?Czech, German, and Hungarian.",
        "We concentrated on the core grammatical functions (subject,",
        " object, etc.)",
        "that are marked by case morphology in each of the three languages.",
        "Our first experiment shows that apart from small frequency effects due to the statistical nature of the parser, learning the mapping between a case value and the grammatical functions signaled by it is not a problem for the parser.",
        "We also see, however, that the pipeline approach, where morphological information is fully disambiguated before being used by the parser as features in the statistical model, is susceptible to error propagation for languages that show syncretism in their morphological paradigms.",
        "Although we can show that parsing Hungarian, an agglutinating language without major syncretism in the case paradigm, is not affected by these problems, parsing the fusional languages Czech and German frequently suffers from propagated errors due to ambiguous case morphology.",
        "Furthermore, although the predicted morphological information does not help very much in German, it contributes very much when parsing Czech and Hungarian, even if it is not completely reliable.",
        "Handling syncretism requires changes in the processing architecture and the representation of morphological information.",
        "We proposed an augmented pipeline where the parsing model is restricted by possibly underspecified, morpho-syntactic constraints exploiting grammatical knowledge about the morphological marking regimes and the inflectional paradigms.",
        "Although the statistical parsing model provides scores for local substructures during decoding, the symbolic constraints are applied globally to the entire output structure.",
        "A morpho-syntactic feature like case is interpreted as a filter on the parser output.",
        "By modeling phenomena like case-function mapping, agreement, and function uniqueness as constraints in an ILP decoder for dependency parsing, we showed in a second experiment that supporting a statistical model with these constraints helps avoiding parsing errors due to incorrect morphological preprocessing.",
        "The advantage of this approach is the combination of local statistical models and globally enforced hard grammatical knowledge.",
        "Whereas some key aspects of the grammatical structure are ensured by the linguistic knowledge (e.g., overtly marked case morphology) the underlying data-driven model can still exploit statistical effects to resolve the remaining ambiguity and model semantic preferences, which are difficult to model with hard rules.",
        "Morphologically rich languages pose various challenges to the standard parsing approaches because of their different linguistic properties.",
        "As one of them, case systems are a key device in these languages to encode argument structure and reside at the brink between morphology and syntax.",
        "Paying attention to the role of case in statistical parsing results in more appropriate models.",
        "Morphologically rich, however, is a wide category and covers a wide range of languages.",
        "Taking the idea of linguistically informed restrictions over data-driven system components may lead to further improvements on other phenomena and for other languages."
