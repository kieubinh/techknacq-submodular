        "A definition of what phenomena constitute paraphrases and what do not has been a problem in the past.",
        "Whereas some people have used a very narrow interpretation of paraphrases?paraphrases must be exactly logically equivalent?others have taken broader perspectives that consider even semantic implications to be acceptable paraphrases.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, outside of specific language interpretation frameworks (like Meaning Text Theory [Mel?cuk 1996]), no one has tried to create a general, exhaustive list of the transformations that define paraphrases.",
        "In this article we provide such a list.",
        "We have also tried to empirically quantify the distribution and accuracy of the list.",
        "It is notable that certain types of quasi-paraphrases dominate whereas others are very rare.",
        "We also observed, however, that the dominating transformations vary based on the type of paraphrase corpus used, thus indicating the variety of behavior exhibited by the paraphrases.",
        "Based on the large variety of possible transformations that can generate paraphrases, its seems likely that the kinds of paraphrases that are deemed useful would depend on the application at hand.",
        "This might motivate the creation of 2 The words in the new sentence were allowed to be reordered (permuted) if needed and only function words (and no content words) were allowed to be added to the new sentence.",
        " application-specific lists of the kinds of allowable paraphrases and the development of automatic methods to distinguish the different kinds of paraphrases."
