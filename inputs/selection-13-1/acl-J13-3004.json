        "Existing lexicons often do not classify opposites into the different kinds, however.",
        "Further, the terminology is inconsistent across different sources.",
        "For example, Cruse (1986) defines antonyms as gradable adjectives that are opposite in meaning, whereas the WordNet antonymy link connects some verb pairs, noun pairs, and adverb pairs too.",
        "In this article, we will follow Cruse's terminology, and we will refer to word pairs connected by WordNet's antonymy link as opposites, unless referring specifically to gradable adjectival pairs.",

        "In our own experiments described later in this article, we find that more than 90% of the contrasting pairs in GRE ?most contrasting word?",
        "questions are not listed as antonyms in WordNet.",
        "We should not infer from this that WordNet or any other lexicographic resource is a poor source for detecting opposites, but rather that identifying the large number of contrasting word pairs requires further computation, possibly relying on other semantic relations stored in the lexicographic resource.",
        "Even though a number of computational approaches have been proposed for semantic closeness (Curran 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006), and some for hypernymy?",
        "Mohammad et al. Computing Lexical Contrast hyponymy (Hearst 1992), measures of lexical contrast have been less successful.",
        "To some extent, this is because lexical contrast is not as well understood as other classical lexical?",
        "semantic relations.",
        "Over the years, many definitions of semantic contrast and opposites have been proposed by linguists (Lehrer and Lehrer 1982; Cruse 1986), cognitive scientists (Kagan 1984), psycholinguists (Deese 1965), and lexicographers (Egan 1984), which differ from each other in various respects.",
        "Cruse (1986, page 197) observes that even though people have a robust intuition of opposites, ?the overall class is not a well-defined one.?",
        "He points out that a defining feature of opposites is that they tend to have many common properties, but differ saliently along one dimension of meaning.",
        "We will refer to this semantic dimension as the dimension of opposition.",
        "For example, giant and dwarf are both living beings; they both eat, they both walk, they are both capable of thinking, and so on.",
        "They are most saliently different, however, along the dimension of height.",
        "Cruse also points out that sometimes it is difficult to identify or articulate the dimension of opposition (for example, city?farm).",
        "Another way to define opposites is that they are word pairs with a ?binary incompatible relation?",
        "(Kempson 1977, page 84).",
        "That is to say that one member entails the absence of the other, and given one member, the identity of the other member is obvious.",
        "Thus, night and day are good examples of opposites because night is best paraphrased by not day, rather than the negation of any other term.",
        "On the other hand, blue and yellow make poor opposites because even though they are incompatible, they do not have an obvious binary relation such that blue is understood to be a negation of yellow.",
        "It should be noted that there is a relation between binary incompatibility and difference along just one dimension of meaning.",
        "For this article, we define opposites to be term pairs that clearly satisfy either the property of binary incompatibility or the property of salient difference across a dimension of meaning.",
        "Word pairs may satisfy the two properties to different degrees, however.",
        "We will refer to all word pairs that satisfy either of the two properties to some degree as contrasting.",
        "For example, daylight and darkness are very different along the dimension of light, and they satisfy the binary incompatibity property to some degree, but not as strongly as day and night.",
        "Thus we will consider both daylight and darkness as well as day and night as semantically contrasting pairs (the former pair less so than the latter), but only day and night as opposites.",
        "Even though there are subtle differences in the meanings of the terms contrasting, opposite, and antonym, they have often been used interchangeably in the literature, dictionaries, and common parlance.",
        "Thus, we list here what we use these terms to mean in this article: Opposites are word pairs that have a strong binary incompatibility relation with each other and/or are saliently different across a dimension of meaning.",
        "Contrasting word pairs are word pairs that have some non-zero degree of binary incompatibility and/or have some non-zero difference across a dimension of meaning.",
        "Thus, all opposites are contrasting, but not all contrasting pairs are opposites.",
        "Antonyms are opposites that are also gradable adjectives.1",
        " In this article, we present an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs that is based on the following hypothesis: Contrast Hypothesis: If a pair of words, A and B, are contrasting, then there is a pair of opposites, C and D, such that A and C are strongly related and B and D are strongly related.",
        "For example, there exists the pair of opposites night and day such that darkness is related to night, and daylight is related to day.",
        "We then determine the degree of contrast between two words using this hypothesis: Degree of Contrast Hypothesis: If a pair of words, A and B, are contrasting, then their degree of contrast is proportional to their tendency to co-occur in a large corpus.",
        "For example, consider the contrasting word pairs top?low and top?down; because top and down occur together much more often than top and low, our method concludes that the pair top?down has a higher degree of lexical contrast than the pair top?low.",
        "The degree of contrast hypothesis is inspired by the idea that opposites tend to co-occur more often than chance (Charles and Miller 1989; Fellbaum 1995).",
        "Murphy and Andrew (1993) claim that this is because together opposites convey contrast well, which is rhetorically useful.",
        "Thus we hypothesize that the higher the degree of contrast between two words, the higher the tendency of people to use them together.",
        "Because opposites are a key component of our method, we begin by first understanding different kinds of opposites (Section 3).",
        "Then we describe a crowdsourced project on the annotation of opposites into different kinds (Section 4).",
        "In Section 5.1, we examine whether opposites and other highly contrasting word pairs occur together in text more often than randomly chosen word pairs.",
        "This experiment is crucial to the degree of contrast hypothesis because if our assumption is true, then we should find that highly contrasting pairs are used together much more often than randomly chosen word pairs.",
        "Section 5.2 examines this question.",
        "Section 6 presents our method to automatically compute the degree of contrast between word pairs by relying on the contrast hypothesis, the degree of contrast hypothesis, seed opposites, and the structure of a Roget-like thesaurus.",
        "(This method was first described in Mohammad, Dorr, and Hirst [2008].)",
        "Finally we present experiments that evaluate various aspects of the automatic method (Section 7).",
        "Following is a summary of the key research questions addressed by this article: (1) On the kinds of opposites: Research questions: How good are humans at identifying different kinds of opposites?",
        "Can certain term pairs belong to more than one kind of opposite?",
        "Experiment: In Sections 3 and 4, we describe how we designed a questionnaire to acquire annotations about opposites.",
        "Because the annotations are done by crowdsourcing, and there is no control over the educational background of the annotators, we devote extra effort to make sure that the questions are phrased in a simple, yet clear, manner.",
        "We deploy a quality control method that uses a word-choice question to automatically identify and discard dubious and outlier annotations.",
        "Findings: We find that humans agree markedly in identifying opposites; there is significant variation in the agreement for different kinds of",
        "Mohammad et al. Computing Lexical Contrast opposites, however.",
        "We find that a large number of opposing word pairs have properties pertaining to more than one kind of opposite.",
        "(2) On the manifestation of opposites and other highly contrasting pairs in text: Research questions: How often do highly contrasting word pairs co-occur in text?",
        "How strong is this tendency compared with random word pairs, and compared with near-synonym word pairs?",
        "Experiment: Section 5 describes how we compiled sets of highly contrasting word pairs (including opposites), near-synonym pairs, and random word pairs, and determine the tendency for pairs in each set to co-occur in a corpus.",
        "Findings: Highly contrasting word pairs co-occur significantly more often than both the random word pairs set and also the near-synonyms set.",
        "We also find that the average distributional similarity of highly contrasting word pairs is higher than that of synonymous words.",
        "The standard deviations of the distributions for the high-contrast set and the synonyms set are large, however, and so the tendency to co-occur is not sufficient to distinguish highly contrasting word pairs from near-synonymous pairs.",
        "(3) On an automatic method for computing lexical contrast: Research questions: How can the contrast hypothesis and the degree of contrast hypothesis be used to develop an automatic method for identifying contrasting word pairs?",
        "How can we automatically generate the list of opposites, which are needed as input for a method relying on the contrast hypothesis?",
        "Proposed Method: Section 6 describes an empirical method for determining the degree of contrast between two words by using the contrast hypothesis, the degree of contrast hypothesis, the structure of a thesaurus, and seed opposite pairs.",
        "The use of affixes to generate seed opposite pairs is also described.",
        "(This method was first proposed in Mohammad, Dorr, and Hirst [2008].)",
        "(4) On the evaluation of automatic methods of contrast: Research questions: How accurate are automatic methods at identifying whether one word pair has a higher degree of contrast than another?",
        "What is the accuracy of this method in detecting opposites (a notable subset of the contrasting pairs)?",
        "How does this accuracy vary for different kinds of opposites?2 How easy is it for automatic methods to distinguish between opposites and synonyms?",
        "How does the proposed method perform when compared with other automatic methods?",
        "Experiments: We conduct three experiments (described in Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3) involving three different data sets and two tasks to answer 2 Note that though linguists have classified opposites into different kinds, we know of no work doing so for contrasts more generally.",
        "Thus this particular analysis must be restricted to opposites alone.",
        " these questions.",
        "We compare performance of our method with methods proposed by Lin et al. (2003) and Turney (2008).",

        "questions to evaluate performance of our method on five different kinds of opposites and across four parts of speech.",
        "(The evaluation described in Section 7.1 was first described in Mohammad, Dorr, and Hirst [2008].)",
        "Findings: We find that the proposed measure of lexical contrast obtains high precision and large coverage, outperforming existing methods.",
        "Our method performs best on gradable pairs, antipodal pairs, and complementary pairs, but poorly on disjoint opposite pairs.",
        "Among different parts of speech, the method performs best on noun pairs, and relatively worse on verb pairs.",

        "Even if a few exceptions to this hypothesis are found (we are not aware of any), the hypothesis would remain useful for practical applications.",
        "We first determine pairs of thesaurus categories that have at least one word in each category that are opposites of each other.",
        "We will refer to these categories as contrasting categories and the opposite connecting the two categories as the seed opposite.",
        "Because each thesaurus category is a collection of closely related terms, all of the word pairs across two contrasting categories satisfy the contrast hypothesis, and they are considered to be contrasting word pairs.",
        "Note also that words within a thesaurus category may belong to different parts of speech, and they may be related to the seed opposite word through any of the many possible semantic relations.",
        "Thus a small number of seed opposites can help identify a large number of contrasting word pairs.",

        "Opposites such as hot?cold and dark?light occur frequently in text, but in terms of type-pairs they are outnumbered by those created using affixes, such as un- (clear?unclear) and dis (honest?dishonest).",
        "Further, this phenomenon is observed in most languages (Lyons 1977).",
        "Table 9 lists 15 affix patterns that tend to generate opposites in English.",

        "These patterns were applied to all words in the thesaurus that are at least three characters long.",
        "If the resulting term was also a valid word in the thesaurus, then the word pair was added to the affix-generated seed set.",
        "These fifteen rules generated 2,682 word pairs when applied to the words in the Macquarie Thesaurus.",
        "Category pairs that had these opposites were marked as contrasting.",
        "Of course, not all of the word pairs generated through affixes are truly opposites, for example sect?insect and part?impart.",
        "For now, such pairs are sources of error in the system.",
        "Manual analysis of these 2,682 word pairs can help determine whether this error is large or small.",

        "Evaluation results (Section 7) indicate that these seed pairs improve the overall accuracy of the system, however.",

        "We will refer to such thesaurus paragraph pairs that have one word each of a seed pair as prime contrasting paragraphs.",
        "We expect the words across prime contrasting paragraphs to have a high degree of antonymy (for example, mask and bare), whereas words across other contrasting category paragraphs may have a smaller degree of antonymy as the meaning of these words may diverge significantly from the meanings of the words in the prime contrasting paragraphs (for example, white lie and disclosure).",

        "There are a number of exceptions to this rule, and often a category may be contrasting in meaning to several other categories.",
        "Because this was an easy enough heuristic to implement, however, we investigated the usefulness of considering adjacent thesaurus categories",

        "Note that this method of determining contrasting categories does not explicitly identify a seed opposite, but one can assume the head words of these category pairs as the seed opposites.",
        "To determine how accurate the adjacency heuristic is, the first author manually inspected adjacent thesaurus categories in the Macquarie Thesaurus to determine which of them were indeed contrasting.",
        "Because a category, on average, has about a hundred words, the task was made less arduous by representing each category by just the first ten words listed in it.",
        "This way it took only about five hours to manually determine that 209 pairs of the 811 adjacent Macquarie category pairs were contrasting.",
        "Twice, it was found that category number X was contrasting not just to category number X+1 but also to category number X+2: category 40 (ARISTOCRACY) has a meaning that contrasts that of category 41 (MIDDLE CLASS) as well as category 42 (WORKING CLASS); category 542 (PAST) contrasts with category 543 (PRESENT) as well as category 544 (FUTURE).",

        "We showed earlier in Section 5.1 that highly contrasting pairs (including opposites) co-occur more often than randomly chosen pairs.",
        "All of these support the degree of contrast hypothesis stated earlier in the introduction: Degree of Contrast Hypothesis: If a pair of words, A and B, are contrasting, then their degree of contrast is proportional to their tendency to co-occur in a large corpus.",
        " We used PMI to capture the tendency of word?word co-occurrence.",

        "Our third evaluation follows that of Lin et al. (2003) and Turney (2008).",
        "We developed a system for automatically distinguishing synonyms from opposites, and applied it to two data sets.",
        "The approach and experiments are described herein.",
        "7.3.1 Data.",
        "Lin et al. (2003) compiled 80 pairs of synonyms and 80 pairs of opposites from the Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus (Kay 1988) such that each word in a pair is also in their list of the 50 distributionally most similar words of the other.",
        "(Distributional similarity was calculated using the algorithm proposed by Lin et al. [1998].)",
        "Turney (2008) compiled 136 pairs of words (89 opposites and 47 synonyms) from various Web sites for learners of English as a second language; the objective for the learners is to identify whether the words in a pair are opposites or synonyms of each other.",
        "The goals of this evaluation are to determine whether our automatic method can distinguish opposites from near-synonyms, and to compare our method with the closest related work on an evaluation task for which published results are already available.",
        "7.3.2 Method.",
        "The core of our method is this: 1.",
        "Word pairs that occur in the same thesaurus category are close in meaning and so are marked as synonyms.",
        "2.",
        "Word pairs that occur in contrasting thesaurus categories or paragraphs",
        "(as described in Section 6.2.1 above) are marked as opposites.",
        "Even though opposites often occur in different thesaurus categories, they can sometimes also be found in the same category, however.",
        "For example, the word ascent is listed in the Macquarie Thesaurus categories of 49 (CLIMBING) and 694 (SLOPE), whereas the word descent is listed in the categories 40 (ARISTOCRACY), 50 (DROPPING), 538 (PARENTAGE), and 694 (SLOPE).",
        "Observe that ascent and descent are both listed in the same category 694 (SLOPE), which makes sense here because both words are pertinent to the concept of slope.",
        "On the other hand, two separate clues independently inform our system that the words are opposites of each other: (1) Category 49 has the word upwardness in the same paragraph as ascent, and category 50 has the word downwardness in the same paragraph as descent.",
        "The 13th affix pattern from Table 9 (upX and downX) indicates that the two thesaurus paragraphs have contrasting meaning.",
        "Thus, ascent and descent occur in prime contrasting thesaurus paragraphs.",
        "(2) One of the ascent categories (49) is adjacent to one of the descent categories (50), and further this adjacent category pair has been manually marked as contrasting.",
        "Thus the words in a pair may be deemed both synonyms and opposites simultaneously by our methods of determining synonyms and opposites, respectively.",
        "Some of the features we use to determine opposites were found to be more precise (e.g., words listed in adjacent categories) than others (e.g., categories identified as contrasting based on affix and WordNet seeds), however.",
        "Thus we apply the following rules as a decision list: If one rule fires, then the subsequent rules are ignored.",
        "1.",
        "Rule 1 (high confidence for opposites): If the words in a pair occur in adjacent thesaurus categories, then they are marked as opposites.",
        "2.",
        "Rule 2 (high confidence for synonyms): If both the words in a pair occur in the same thesaurus category, then they are marked as synonyms.",
        " 3.",
        "Rule 3 (medium confidence for opposites): If the words in a pair occur in prime contrasting thesaurus paragraphs, as determined by an affix-based or WordNet seed set, then they are marked as opposites.",
        "If a word pair is not tagged as synonym or opposite: (a) the system can refrain from attempting an answer (this will attain high precision), or (b) the system can randomly guess the lexical relation (this will obtain 50% accuracy for the pairs), or (c) it could mark all remaining word pairs with the predominant lexical relation in the data (this will obtain an accuracy proportional to the skew in distribution of opposites and synonyms).",
        "For example, if after step 3, the system finds that 70% of the marked word pairs were tagged opposites, and 30% as synonyms, then it could mark every hitherto untagged word pair (word pair for which it has insufficient information) as opposites.",
        "We implemented all three variants.",

        "After step 3 of the algorithm, however, the system had marked 65 pairs as opposites and 63 pairs as synonyms, and so it concluded that opposites are slightly more dominant in this data set and therefore the guess-predominant-class variant marked all previously unmarked pairs as opposites.",
        "It should be noted that the LZQZ data set was chosen from a list of high-frequency terms.",
        "This was necessary to increase the probability of finding sentences in a corpus where the target pair occurred in one of the chosen patterns proposed by Lin et al. (2003).",
        "As shown in Table 10, the Lin et al. (2003) patterns have a very low coverage otherwise.",
        "Further, the test data compiled by Lin et al. only had opposites whereas the contrast questions had many contrasting word pairs that were not opposites.",

        "Also observe that results obtained by guessing the predominant class (method (c)) are markedly better than those obtained by randomly guessing in case of insufficient information (method (b)).",
        "This is because, as mentioned earlier, the distribution of opposites and synonyms is somewhat skewed in this data set (65.4% of the pairs are opposites).",
        "Of course, again the system was not privy to this information, but method (a) marked 58 pairs as opposites and 39 pairs as synonyms.",
        "Therefore, the system concluded that opposites are more dominant and method (c) marked all previously unmarked pairs as opposites, obtaining an accuracy of 90%.",
        "Recall that in Section 7.3.2 we described how opposite pairs may occasionally be listed in the same thesaurus category because the category may be pertinent to both words.",
        "For 12 of the word pairs in the Lin et al. data and 3 of the word pairs in the Turney data, both words occurred together in the same thesaurus category, and yet the system marked them as opposites because they occurred in adjacent thesaurus categories (Class I).",

        "By contrast, only one of the term pairs in this table occurred in one of Lin's patterns of oppositeness, and was thus the only one correctly identified by their method as a pair of opposites.",
        "It should also be noted that a word may have multiple meanings such that it may be synonymous to a word in one sense and opposite to it in another sense.",
        "Such pairs are also expected to be marked as opposites by our system.",

        "So this row reports baseline results when choosing opposites as the predominant class.",
        "WordNet opposites set 1,358 word pairs WordNet random word pairs set 1,358 word pairs WordNet synonyms set 1,358 word pairs we have made available.",
        "We determined the amount of agreement among humans in identifying lexical contrast, and also in identifying different kinds of opposites.",
        "We also showed that a large number of opposing word pairs have properties pertaining to more than one kind.",

        "It may be desirable to break a complex question into two or more simpler questions.",

        "Note, however, that as of February 2012, most of the Mechanical Turk participants are native speakers of English, certain Indian languages, and some European languages.",
        "Our future goals include porting this approach to a cross-lingual framework to determine lexical contrast in a resource-poor language by using a bilingual lexicon to connect the words in that language with words in another resource-rich language.",

        "We are interested in using contrasting word pairs as seeds to identify phrases that convey contrasting meaning.",
        "These will be especially helpful in machine translation where current systems have difficulty separating translation hypotheses that convey the same meaning as the source sentences, and those that do not.",
        "Given a particular word, our method computes a single score as the degree of contrast with another.",
        "A word may be more or less contrasting with another word when used in different contexts (Murphy 2003), however.",
        "Just as in the lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli 2009), where a system has to find the word that can best replace a target word in context to preserve meaning, one can imagine a lexical substitution task to generate contradictions where the objective is to replace a given target word with one that is contrasting so as to generate a contradiction.",
        "Our future work includes developing a context-sensitive measure of lexical contrast that can be used for exactly such a task.",
        "There is considerable evidence that children are aware of lexical contrast at a very early age (Murphy and Jones 2008).",
        "They rely on it to better understand various concepts and in order to communicate effectively.",
        "Thus we believe that computer algorithms that deal with language can also obtain significant gains through the ability to detect contrast and the ability to distinguish between differing degrees of contrast."
