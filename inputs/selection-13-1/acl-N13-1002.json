        "Of these models, only the target language model ?This research was conducted during the author's internship at Microsoft Research (and, to some weak extent, the lexicalized reordering model) captures some lexical dependencies that span phrase boundaries, though it is not able to model information from the source side.",

        "For language pairs with significant typological divergences, such as Chinese-English, it is quite difficult to extract a synchronized sequence of units; in the limit, the smallest synchronized unit may be the whole sentence.",
