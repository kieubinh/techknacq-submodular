        "This paper discusses the extension of a system developed for automatic discovery of treebank annotation inconsistencies over an entire corpus to the particular case of evaluation of inter-annotator agreement (IAA).",
        "In IAA, two or more annotators annotate the same sentences, and a comparison identifies areas in which the annotators might need more training, or the annotation guidelines some refinement.",
        "Unlike other IAA evaluation systems, this system application results in a precise pinpointing of inconsistencies and the grouping of inconsistencies by their structural types, making for a more informative IAA evaluation.",
        "Treebank annotation, consisting of syntactic structure with words as the terminals, is by its nature more complex and therefore more prone to error than many other annotation tasks.",
        "However, high annotation consistency is crucial to providing reliable training and testing data for parsers and linguistic research.",
        "Error detection is therefore an important area of research, and the importance of work such as Dickinson and Meurers (2003) is that errors and annotation inconsistencies might be automatically discovered, and once discovered, be targeted for subsequent quality control.",
        "A recent approach to this problem (Kulick et al., 2011; Kulick et al., 2012) (which we will call the KBM system) improves upon Dickinson and Meurers (2003) by decomposing the full syntactic tree into smaller units, using ideas from Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).",
        "This allows the comparison to be based on small syntactic units instead of string n-grams, improving the detection of inconsistent annotation.",
        "The KBM system, like that of Dickinson and Meurers (2003) before it, is based on the notion of comparing identical strings.",
        "In the general case, this is a problematic assumption, since annotation inconsistencies are missed because of superficial word differences between strings which one would want to compare.1 However, this limitation is not present for IAA evaluation, since the strings to compare are, by definition, identical.",
        "The same is also true of parser evaluation, since the parser output and the gold standard are based on the same sentences.",
        "We therefore take the logical step of applying the KBM system developed for automatic discovery of annotation inconsistency to the special case of IAA.3",
        "uation, although it is conceptually the same problem as IAA evaluation.",
        "We wanted to first refine the system using annotator input for the IAA application before applying it to parser",
        "To our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize such a general system for this special case.",
        "The advantages of the KBM system play out somewhat differently in the context of IAA evaluation than in the more general case.",
        "In this context, the comparison of word sequences based on syntactic units allows for a precise pinpointing of differences.",
        "The system also retains the ability to group inconsistencies together by their structural type, which we have found to be useful for the more general case.",
        "Together, these two properties make for a useful and informative system for IAA evaluation.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the basic working of our system.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss in more detail the advantages of this approach.",
        "In Section 4 we evaluate the system on two treebanks, a corpus of English web text and a corpus of Modern British English.",

        "The basic idea of the KBM system is to detect word sequences that are annotated in inconsistent ways by evaluation.",
        "comparing local syntactic units.",
        "Following Dickinson and Meurers (2003), we refer to sequences examined for inconsistent annotation as nuclei.",
        "The sentence excerpts (1ab) in Figure 1, from the test corpora used in this work, illustrate an inconsistency in the annotation of corresponding strings.",
        "We focus here on the difference in the annotation of the nucleus The word renaissance, which in (1a) is annotated as an appositive structure, while in (1b) it is flat.",
        "Following the TAG approach, KBM decomposes the full phrase structure into smaller chunks called elementary trees (henceforth, e-trees).",
        "The relationship of the e-trees underlying a full phrase structure to each other is recorded in a derivation tree, in which each node is an e-tree, related to its parent node by a composition operation, as shown in (2ab).4 KBM uses two composition operations, each with left and right variants, shown in Figure 3: (1) ad",
        "with the result here that word is the head of (1a), while renaissance is the head of (1b), as reflected in their respective derivation trees (2a) and (2b).",
        "We omit the POS tags in (1ab) and (2ab) to avoid clutter.",
        "junction, which attaches one tree to a target node in another tree by creating a copy of the target node, and (2) sister adjunction, which attaches one tree as a sister to a target node in another tree.",
        "Each arc in Figure 2 is labeled by an ?M?",
        "for adjunction and ?A?",
        "for sister-adjunction.",
        "5 The system uses the tree decomposition and resulting derivation tree for the comparison of different instances of the same nucleus.",
        "The full derivation tree for a sentence is not used, but rather only that slice of it having e-trees with words that are in the nucleus being examined, which we call a derivation tree fragment.",
        "That is, for a given nucleus with a set of instances, we compare the derivation fragments for each instance.",
        "For example, for the nucleus The word renaissance, the derivation tree fragment for the instance in (1a) consists of the e-trees a1, a2, a3 (and their arcs) in (2a), and likewise the derivation tree from the instance in (1b) consists of the e-trees b1, b2, b3 in (2b).",
        "These derivation fragments have a different structure, and so the two instances of The word renaissance are recognized as inconsistent.",
        "Two important aspects of the overall system require mention here: (1) Nuclei are identified by using sequences that occur as a constituent anywhere 5KBM is based on a variant of Spinal TAG (Shen et al., 2008), and uses sister adjunction without substitution.",
        "Space prohibits full discussion, but multiple adjunction to a single node (e.g., a4, a6, a8 to a5 in (2a)) does not create multiple levels of recursion, while a special specification handles the extra NP recursion for the apposition with a2, a3, and a5.",
        "For reasons of space, we also leave aside a precise comparison to Tree Insertion Grammar (Chiang, 2003) and Spinal TAG (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "in the corpus, even if other instances of the same sequence are not constituents.",
        "Both instances of The word renaissance are compared, because the sequence occurs at least once as a constituent.",
        "(2) We partition each comparison of the instances of a nucleus by the lowest nonterminal in the derivation tree fragment that covers the sequence.",
        "The two instances of The word renaissance are compared because the lowest nonterminal is an NP in both instances."

        "As Kulick et al. (2012) stressed, using derivation tree fragments allows the comparison to abstract away from interference by irrelevant modifiers, an issue with Dickinson and Meurers (2003).",
        "However, in the context of IAA, this advantage of KBM plays out in a different way, in that it allows for a precise pinpointing of the inconsistencies.",
        "For IAA, the concern is not whether an inconsistent annotation will be reported, since at some level higher in the tree every difference will be found, even if the context is the entire tree.",
        "KBM, however, will find the inconsistencies in a more informative way, for example reporting just The word renaissance, not some larger unit.",
        "Likewise, it reports Rinascimento in Italian as an inconsistently annotated sequence.6 A critical desirable property of KBM that carries over from the more general case is that it allows for different nuclei to be grouped together in the system's output if they have the same annotation inconsistency type.",
        "As in Kulick et al. (2011), each nucleus found to be inconsistent is categorized by an inconsistency type, which is simply the collection of different derivation tree fragments used for the comparison of its instances, including POS tags but not the words.",
        "For example, the inconsistency type of the nucleus The word renaissance in (1ab) is the pair of derivation tree fragments (a1,a2,a3) and (b1,b2,b3) from (2ab), with the POS tags.",
        "This nu-6Note however that it does not report -LRB- Rinascimento in Italian -RRB- which is also a constituent, and so might be expected to be compared.",
        "The lowest nonterminal above this substring in the two derivation trees in Figure 2 is the NP in a5 and the FRAG in b5, thus exempting them from comparison.",
        "It is exactly this sort of case that motivated the ?external check?",
        "discussed in Kulick et al. (2012), which we have not yet implemented for IAA.",
        "cleus is then reported together with other nuclei that use the same derivation fragments.",
        "In this case, it therefore also reports the nucleus The term renaissance, which appears elsewhere in the corpus with the two annotations from the different annotators as in (3):",
        "renaissance together because they are inconsistently annotated in exactly the same way, in spite of the difference in words.",
        "This grouping together of inconsistencies based on structural characteristics of the inconsistency is critically important for understanding the nature of the annotation inconsistencies.",
        "It is the combination of these two characteristics - (1) pinpointing of errors and (2) grouping by structure - that makes the system so useful for IAA.",
        "This is an improvement over alternatives such as using evalb (Sekine and Collins, 2008) for IAA.",
        "No other system to our knowledge groups inconsistencies by structural type, as KBM does.",
        "The use of the derivation tree fragments greatly lessens the multiple reporting of a single annotation difference, which is a difficulty for using evalb (Manning and Schuetze, 1999, p. 436) or Dickinson and Meurers (2003)."
