        "Word sense annotation is regarded as one of the most difficult annotation tasks (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) and building manually-annotated corpora with high-quality sense labels is often a time-and resource-consuming task.",
        "As a result, nearly all sense-tagged corpora in widespread use are created using trained annotators (Hovy et al., 2006; Passonneau et al., 2010), which results in a knowledge acquisition bottleneck for training systems that require sense labels (Gale et al., 1992).",
        "In other NLP areas, this bottleneck has been addressed through gathering annotations using many untrained workers on platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a task commonly referred to as crowdsourcing.",
        "Recently, several works have proposed gathering sense annotations using crowdsourcing (Snow et al., 2008; Biemann and Nygaard, 2010; Passonneau et al., 2012b; Rumshisky et al., 2012).",
        "However, these methods produce sense labels that are different from the commonly used sense inventories such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, while Passonneau et al. (2012b) did use WordNet sense labels, they found the quality was well below that of trained experts.",
        "We revisit the task of crowdsourcing word sense annotations, focusing on two key aspects: (1) the annotation methodology itself, and (2) the restriction to single sense assignment.",
        "First, the choice in sense inventory plays an important role in gathering high-quality annotations; fine-grained inventories such as WordNet often contain several related senses for polysemous words, which untrained annotators find difficult to correctly apply in a given context (Chugur et al., 2002; McCarthy, 2006; Palmer et al., 2007; Rumshisky and Batiukova, 2008; Brown et al., 2010).",
        "However, many agreement studies have restricted annotators to using a single sense, which can significantly lower inter-annotator agreement (IAA) in the presence of ambiguous or polysemous usages; indeed, multiple studies have shown that when allowed, annotators readily assign multiple senses to a single usage (Ve?ronis, 1998; Murray and Green, 2004; Erk et al., 2009; Passonneau et al., 2012b).",
        "Therefore, we focus on annotation methodologies that enable workers to use as many labels as they feel appropriate, asking the question: if allowed to make labeling ambiguity explicit, will annotators agree?",
        "Furthermore, we adopt the goal of Erk et al. (2009), which enabled annotators to weight each sense by its applicability to the given context, thereby quantifying the ambiguity.",
        "This paper provides the following contributions.",
        "First, we demonstrate that the choice in annotation setup can significantly improve IAA and that the labels of untrained workers follow consistent patterns that enable creating high quality labeling from their aggregate.",
        "Second, we find that the sense labeling from crowdsourcing matches performance with annotators in a controlled setting."

        "Given the potential utility of a sense-labeled corpus, multiple studies have examined how to efficiently gather high quality sense annotations.",

        "Biemann and Nygaard (2010) showed that the number of sense definitions for a word in their inventory was correlated with the number in WordNet, often with their inventory having fewer senses by combining related meanings and omitting rare meanings.",

        "We consider three methodologies for gathering sense labels: (1) the methodology of Erk et al. (2009) for gathering weighted labels, (2) a multi-stage strategy that uses both binary and Likert ratings, and (3) MaxDiff, a paired choice format.",
        "Likert Ratings Likert rating scales provide the most direct way of gathering weighted sense labels; Turkers are presented with all senses of a word and then asked to rate each on a numeric scale.",
        "We adopt the annotation guidelines of Erk et al. (2009) which used a five-point scale, ranging from 1 to 5, indicating the sense does not apply or that it matches the contextual usage exactly, respectively.",
        "Select and Rate Recent efforts in crowdsourcing have proposed multi-stage processes for accomplishing complex tasks, where efforts by one group of workers are used to create new subtasks for other workers to complete (Bernstein et al., 2010; Kittur et al., 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2012).",
        "We propose a two-stage strategy that aims to reduce the complexity of the annotation task, referred to as Select and Rate (S+R).",
        "First, Turkers are presented with all the senses and asked to make a binary choice of which senses apply.",
        "Second, a Likert rating task is created for only those senses whose selection frequency is above a threshold, thereby concentrating worker focus on a potentially smaller set of senses.",
        "Our motivation for S+R is two-fold.",
        "First, the sense definitions of certain words may be unclear or misinterpreted by a minority of the Turkers, who then systematically rate inapplicable senses as applicable.",
        "The Select task can potentially remove such noise and therefore improve both IAA and rating quality in the subsequent Rate task.",
        "Second, while the present study analyzes words with 4?8 senses, we are ultimately interested in annotating highly polysemous words with tens of senses, which could present a significant cognitive burden for an annotator to rate concurrently.",
        "Here, the Select stage can potentially reduce the number of senses presented, leading to less cognitive burden in the Rate stage.",
        "Furthermore, as a pragmatic benefit, removing inapplicable senses reduces the visual space required for displaying the questions on the MTurk platform, which can improve annotation throughput.",
        "MaxDiff MaxDiff is an alternative to scale-based ratings in which Turkers are presented with a only subset of all of a word's senses and then asked to select (1) the sense option that best matches the mean",
        "ing in the example context and (2) the sense option that least matches (Louviere, 1991).",
        "In our setting, we presented three options at a time for words with fewer than seven senses, and four options for those with seven senses.",
        "For a single context, multiple subsets of the senses are presented and then their relative ranking is used to produce the numeric rating.",
        "The final applicability ratings were produced using a modification of the counting procedure of Orme (2009).",
        "First, all sense ratings are computed as the number of times the sense was rated best minus the number of times rated least.",
        "Second, all negatively-rated senses are assigned score of 1, and all positively ratings are normalized to be (1, 5]."

        "For measuring the difference in methodologies, we propose three experiments based on different analyses of comparing Turker and non-Turker annotations on the same dataset, the latter of which we refer to as the reference labeling.",
        "First, we measure the ability of the Turkers individually by evaluating their IAA with the reference labeling.",
        "Second, many studies using crowdsourcing combine the results into a single answer, thereby leveraging the wisdom of the crowds (Surowiecki, 2005) to smooth over inconsistencies in the data.",
        "Therefore, in the second experiment, we evaluate different methods of combining Turker responses into a single sense labeling, referred to as an aggregate labeling, and comparing that with the reference labeling.",
        "Third, we measure the replicability of the Turker annotations (Kilgarriff, 1999) using a sampling methodology.",
        "Two equally-sized sets of Turker annotations are created by randomly sampling without replacement from the full set of annotations for each item.",
        "IAA is calculated between the aggregate labelings computed from each set.",
        "This sampling is repeated 50 times and we report the mean IAA as a measure of the expected degree of replicability when annotating using different groups of Turkers.",
        "For the reference sense labeling, we use a subset of the GWS dataset of Erk et al. (2009), where three annotators rated 50 instances each for eight words.",
        "For clarity, we refer to these individuals as the GWS annotators.",
        "Given a word usage in a sentence, GWS annotators rated the applicability of all WordNet 3.0 senses using the same Likert scale as described in Section 3.",
        "Contexts were drawn evenly from the SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) and SENSEVAL-3 lexical substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2004) corpora.",
        "GWS annotators were apt to use multiple senses, with nearly all instances having multiple labels.",
        "For each annotation task, Turkers were presented with an identical set of annotation guidelines, followed by methodology-specific instructions.1 To increase the familiarity with the task, four instances were shown per task, with all instances using the same target word.",
        "Unlike Passonneau et al. (2012b), we did not require a Turker to annotate all contexts for a single word; however many Turkers did complete the majority of instances.",
        "Both the Likert, Select, and Rate tasks used ten Turkers each.",
        "Senses were passed from Select to Rate if they received at",
        "least three votes.",
        "For MaxDiff, we gathered at least 3n annotations per context where n is the number of senses of the target word, ensuring that each sense appeared at least once.",
        "Due to resource limitations, we omitted the evaluation of argument.n for MaxDiff.",
        "Following the recommendation of Kosinski et al. (2012), Turkers were paid $0.05USD for each Likert, Select, and Rate task.",
        "For MaxDiff, due to their shorter nature and comparably high volume, Turkers were paid $0.03USD per task.",
        "To ensure fluency in English as well as reduce the potential for low-quality results, we prefaced each task with a simple test question that asked the Turker to pick out a definition of the target word from a list of four options.",
        "The incorrect options were selected so that they would be nonsensical for anyone familiar with the target word.",
        "Additionally, we rejected all Turker responses where more than one option was missing a rating.",
        "In the case of missing ratings, we infer a rating of 1.",

        "First, the word itself plays a significant role in IAA.",
        "Though Erk et al. (2009) reported a pairwise IAA of the GWS annotators between 0.466 and 0.506 using Spearman's ?, the IAA varies considerably between words for both Turkers and GWS annotators when measured using Krippendorff's ?.",
        "Second, the choice of annotation methodology 2We note that although the ratings are technically given on an ordinal scale (ranks), we use the interval scale to allow comparison with rational ratings from the aggregate solutions.",
        "significantly impacts IAA.",
        "While both the Likert and S+R tasks have lower IAA than the GWS annotators do, the MaxDiff annotators achieve higher IAA for almost all words.",
        "We hypothesize that comparing senses for applicability is an easier task for the untrained worker, rather than having to construct a mental scale of what constitutes the applicability of each sense.",
        "Surprisingly, the binary Select task has a lower IAA than the more complex the Likert task.",
        "An analysis of the duration of median task completion times for the Likert and Select tasks showed little difference (with the exception of paper.n, which was on average 50 second faster for Likert ratings), suggesting that both tasks are equally as cognitively demanding.",
        "In addition, the Rate task has the lowest IAA, despite its similarity to the Likert task.",
        "An inspection of the annotations shows that the full rating scale was used, so the low value is not due to Turkers always using the same rating, which would yield an IAA near chance.",
        "In the second experiment, we created a aggregate sense labeling and compared its IAA with the GWS annotators, shown in Table 1 (bottom).",
        "For scale-based ratings, we considered three arithmetic operations for selecting the final rating: mode, median, and mean.",
        "We found that the mode yielded the highest average IAA for the Likert ratings and median for S+R; however, the differences in IAA using each operation were often small.",
        "We compare the IAA with GWS annotators against two baselines: one generated by sampling from the GWS annotators?",
        "rating distribution, and a second generated by uniformly sampling in [1, 5].",
        "By comparison, the aggregate labelings have a much larger IAA than the baselines, which is often at least as high as the IAA amongst the GWS annotators themselves, indicating that the Turkers in aggregate are capable of producing equivalent ratings.",
        "Of the three annotation methodologies, MaxDiff provides the highest IAA both within its annotators and with its aggregate key.",
        "Surprisingly, neither the Likert or S+R aggregate labeling appears better than the other.",
        "Based on the second experiment, we measured the average IAA across all words between the aggregate Likert and MaxDiff solutions, which was 0.472.",
        "However, this IAA is significantly affected by the annotations for win.v and different.a, which had the lowest IAA among Turkers (Table 1) and there",
        "ment, a third annotator is added.",
        "If the third annotator agrees with either of the first two, the instance is marked as a case of agreement.",
        "However, the unadjudicated agreement for the dataset was 67.3 measured using pairwise agreement.",
        "A re-annotation by Palmer et al. (2004) produced a similar pairwise agreement of 71.0. ?",

        "fore produce noisy aggregate solutions.",
        "When win.v and different.a are excluded, the agreement between aggregate Likert and MaxDiff solutions is 0.649.",
        "While this IAA is still moderate, it suggests that Turkers can still produce similar annotations even when using different annotation methodologies.",
        "For the third experiment, replicability is reported as the average IAA between the sampled aggregate labelings for all annotated words.",
        "Table 2 shows this IAA for Likert and MaxDiff methodologies in comparison to other sense annotation studies.",
        "Krippendorff (2004) recommends that an ?",
        "of 0.8 is necessary to claim high-quality agreement, which is achieved by the MaxDiff methodology.",
