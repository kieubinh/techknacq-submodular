        "Furthermore, interaction parameters were used to create statistical recognition models for predicting IQ and US, respectively.",
        "Two approaches have been investigated: Belief-Based Sequential Recognition, which is based on an HMM-like structure with IQ as an additional latent variable, and Model Exchange, which uses statistical models trained on IQ to recognize US.",
        "Unfortunately, neither Belief-Based Sequential Recognition nor Model Exchange achieved results with an acceptable UAR.",
        "The high correlation between expert and user ratings, depicted by high values for Cohen's ?",
        "and Spearman's ?, already allow the conclusion that expert ratings can be used as a good replacement for user ratings.",
        "Moreover, the presented recognition results of the Model Exchange approach being clearly above chance underpin the strong similarity of IQ and US.",
        "Furthermore, IQ recognition is much more reliable and accurate than US recognition (shown by higher UAR, ?",
        "and ?",
        "values).",
        "While the experiments disproved the hope of getting acceptable user rating prediction results, the obtained results confirmed the similarity between both kinds of ratings.",
        "And as it is not necessary to use user ratings for most applications, e.g., for using the quality information to automatically improve the interaction (cf. (Ultes et al., 2012)), we believe that it suffices to use expert ratings as those can be acquired easier and less expensively and are similar enough to user ratings.",
        "Prompting the user to apply quality ratings in everyday situations with real-life systems will always be annoying to the user while recording of such interactions are always much easier to rate.",
        "By providing a study for determining quality ratings of dialogues, we hope to encourage other researchers to look into this research for other parameters, e.g., emotion recognition."
