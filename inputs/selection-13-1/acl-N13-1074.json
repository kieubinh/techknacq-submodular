        "The task of domain-adaptation attempts to exploit data mainly drawn from one domain (e.g. news, parliamentary discussion) to maximize the performance on the test domain (e.g. lectures, web forums).",
        "In this work, we focus on translation model (TM) adaptation.",
        "A prominent approach in recent work is weighting at different levels of granularity.",
        "Foster and Kuhn (2007) perform weighting at the corpus level, where different corpora receive different weights and are then combined using mixture modeling.",
        "A finer grained weighting is that of Mat-soukas et al. (2009), who weight each sentence in the bitexts using features of meta-information and optimize a mapping from the feature vectors to weights using a translation quality measure.",
        "In this work, we propose to perform TM adaptation using phrase training.",
        "We start from a general-domain phrase table and adapt the probabilities by training on an in-domain data.",
        "Thus, we achieve direct phrase probabilities adaptation as opposed to weighting.",
        "Foster et al. (2010) perform weighting at the phrase level, assigning each phrase pair a weight according to its relevance to the test domain.",
        "They compare phrase weighting to a ?flat?",
        "model, where the weight directly approximates the phrase probability.",
        "In their experiments, the weighting method performs better than the flat model, therefore, they conclude that retaining the original relative frequency probabilities of the TM is important for good performance.",
        "The ?flat?",
        "model of Foster et al. (2010) is similar to our work.",
        "We differ in the following points: (i) we use the same procedure to perform the phrase training based adaptation and the search thus avoiding inconsistencies between the two; (ii) we do not directly interpolate the original statistics with the new ones, but use a training procedure to manipulate the original statistics.",
        "We perform experiments on the publicly available IWSLT TED task, on both Arabic-to-English and German-to-English lectures translation tracks.",
        "We compare our suggested phrase training adaptation method to a variety of baselines and show its effectiveness.",
        "Finally, we experiment with mixture modeling based adaptation.",
        "We compare mixture modeling to our adaptation method, and apply our method within a mixture modeling framework.",
        "In Section 2, we present the phrase training method and explain how it is utilized for adaptation.",
        "Experimental setup including corpora statistics and the SMT system are described in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 summarizes the phrase training adaptation results ending with a comparison to mixture modeling."

        "The standard phrase extraction procedure in SMT consists of two phases: (i) word-alignment training (e.g., IBM alignment models), (ii) heuristic phrase extraction and relative frequency based phrase translation probability estimation.",

        "We use the forced alignment (FA) method (Wuebker et al., 2010) to perform the phrase alignment training and probability estimation.",
