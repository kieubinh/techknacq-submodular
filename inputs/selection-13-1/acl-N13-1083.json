        "Speech disfluencies are common phenomena in spontaneous speech.",
        "They consist of spoken words and phrases that represent self-correction, hesitation, and floor-grabbing behaviors, but do not add semantic information; removing them yields the intended, fluent utterance.",
        "The presence of disfluencies in conversational speech data can cause problems for both downstream processing (parsing and other natural language processing tasks) and human readability of speech transcripts.",
        "There has been much research effort on automatic disfluency detection in recent years (Shriberg and Stolcke, 1997; Snover et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Lin and Lee, 2009; Schuler et al., 2010; Georgila et al., 2010; Zwarts and Johnson, 2011), particularly from the DARPA"

        "However, the EARS MDE effort was focused on English only, and there hasn't been much research on the effectiveness of similar automatic disfluency detection approaches for multiple languages.",
        "This paper presents three main innovations.",
        "First, we extend the EARS MDE-style disfluency detection approach combining lexical and prosodic features using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, which was employed for detecting disfluency on English conversational speech data (Liu et al., 2005), to Mandarin conversational speech, as presented in Section 2.",
        "Second, we implement an automatic filled pause detection approach through constrained speech recognition, as presented in Section 3.",
        "Third, for both disfluency detection systems, we compare side-by-side contributions of different knowledge sources to detection performance for two languages, English and Mandarin, as presented in Section 4.",
        "Conclusions appear in Section 5."

        "We focus on two types of disfluencies, Fillers and Edit disfluencies, following the EARS MDE disfluency types modeled in (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "Fillers include filled pauses (FP), discourse markers (DM), and explicit editing terms (ET).",
        "FPs are words used by the speakers as floor holders to maintain control of a conversation.",
        "They can also indicate hesitations of the speaker.",
        "In this work, English FPs",
        "comprise uh and um, based on English CTS corpora.",
        "For Mandarin, Zhao and Jurafsky found that Mandarin speakers intensively used both demonstratives zhege (literally ?this?)",
        "and nage (literally ?that?)",
        "and uh/mm as FPs based on a large speech corpus of Mandarin telephone conversation (Zhao and Juraf-sky, 2005).",
        "We study the same set of Chinese FPs in this study.",
        "DMs are words or phrases related to the structure of the discourse and help taking or keeping a turn, or serving as acknowledgment, for example, I mean, you know.",
        "An explicit ET is an editing term in an edit disfluency that is not an FP or a DM.",
        "For example, we have two action items sorry three action items from the meeting, where sorry is an explicit ET.",
        "Edit disfluencies involve syntactically relevant content that is either repeated, revised, or abandoned.",
        "The basic pattern for edit disfluencies has the form (reparandum) <editing term> correction.",
        "The reparandum is the portion of the utterance that is corrected or abandoned entirely (in the case of restarts).",
        "An interruption point (IP), marked with ??",
        "in the pattern, is the point at which the speaker breaks off the original utterance and then repeats, revises, or restarts the utterance.",
        "The editing term is optional and consists of one or more filler words.",
        "The correction is the portion of the utterance that corrects the original reparandum.",
        "Revisions denote the cases when a speaker modifies the original utterance with a similar syntactic structure, e.g., we have two action items sorry three action items from the meeting.",
        "Restarts denote the cases when a speaker abandons an utterance or a constituent and restarts all over again, e.g., He I like this idea.",
        "We used a CRF model to combine lexical features, shallow syntactic features, and prosodic features for joint detection of edit words and IP words.",
        "A CRF defines a global log-linear distribution of the state (or label) sequence E conditioned on an observation sequence, in our case including the word sequence W and the features F , and optimized globally over the entire sequence considering the context event information for making decisions at each point.",
        "We used the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002) to implement the CRF model.",
        "We used a first-order model that includes only two sequential events in the feature set.",
        "The CRF model is trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of a given training set P (EjW; F ).",
        "During testing, the most likely sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "To avoid over-fitting, a zero-mean Gaussian prior (McCallum and Li, 2003) was applied to the parameters, where the variance of the prior was optimized on the development test set.",
        "Each word is associated with a class label, representing whether it is an edit word or not.",
        "We included IP in the target classes and used five states, as outside edit (O), begin edit with an IP (B-E+IP), begin edit (B-E), inside edit with an IP (I-E+IP), and inside edit (I-E) (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "State transitions are also the same as in (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "We built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based part-of-speech (POS) taggers for English conversational speech and Mandarin broadcast conversation data.",
        "After employing the co-training approach described in (Wang et al., 2007), we achieved 94% POS tagging accuracy for both data sets.",
        "The features for CRF modeling include: n-grams from words and automatically generated POS tags, speaker turns, whether there is a repeated word sequence ending at a word boundary, whether a word is a fragment, whether there is a predefined filler phrase after the word boundary, and the prosody model posterior probabilities from a decision tree model (Shriberg and Stolcke, 1997) and discretized by cumulative binning (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "The prosodic features were computed for each interword boundary from words and phonetic alignments of the manual transcriptions.",
        "We extracted the same set of prosodic features for English and Mandarin data, based on duration, fundamental frequency (f0), energy, and pause information, and nonprosodic information such as speaker gender and speaker change, for training and applying the decision-tree-based prosody model (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "We implemented a rule-based system for filler word detection.",
        "We defined a list of possible Chinese and English filler words, including filled pauses and discourse markers.",
        "The rules also explore POS tags assigned by our Chinese and English POS taggers."

        "We also propose an alternative approach for automatic detection of FPs given speech transcripts that omit FPs but are otherwise accurate.",
        "This approach is motivated by situations where only an edited, ?cleaned-up?",
        "transcript is available, but where an accurate verbatim transcript is to be recovered automatically.",
        "We treat this task as a constrained speech recognition problem, and investigate how effectively it is solved by a state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system.",
        "Hence, this approach can be considered as combining LVCSR acoustic model (AM) and language model (LM) knowledge sources in a search framework for FP detection.",
        "Compared to the FP detection component in the disfluency detection systems described in Section 2, this alternative approach explores different knowledge sources.",
        "In particular, the AMs explore different front-end features compared to the lexical and prosodic features explored in those disfluency detection systems presented in Section 2.",
        "Details of the front-end features are illustrated below.",
        "We evaluated this approach on both English and Mandarin conversational speech.",
        "For detecting FPs in English conversational speech, we used a modified and simplified form of the recognition system developed for the 2004 NIST Rich Transcription Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) evaluations, described in (Stolcke et al., 2006).",
        "The first pass of the recognizer uses a within-word MFCC+MLP model (i.e, trained on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features augmented with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based phone-posterior features), while the second pass uses a crossword model trained on Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) features adapted (by speaker) to the output of the first pass.",
        "For purposes of FP detection, the recognition is constrained to a word lattice formed by the manually transcribed non-FP reference words, with optional FP words inserted between any two words and at the beginning and end of each utterance.",
        "Both first and second pass decoding was constrained by the optional-FP lattices.",
        "In the second pass, HTK lattices were generated with bigram LM probabilities and rescored with a 4-gram LM.",
        "The consensus decoding output from the rescored lattices was used for scoring FP detection.",
        "The system thus evaluates the posterior probability of an FP at every word boundary using both acoustic model (AM) and language model (LM) evidence.",
        "The acoustic model for the English recognition system was trained on about 2300 hours of CTS data.",
        "The language models (which models FP like any other word) are bigram and 4-gram statistical word n-gram LMs estimated from the same data plus additional non-CTS data and web data.",
        "For detecting FPs in Mandarin broadcast conversation speech, we used a modified form of the recognition system developed for the 2008 DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) Speech-to-Text evaluation, described in (Lei et al., 2009).",
        "The system conducted a constrained decoding on the optional-FP lattices, using a speaker-independent within-word triphone MPE-trained MFCC+pitch+MLP model and a pruned trigram LM.",
        "For the Mandarin ASR system, the MFCC+MLP front-end features were augmented with 3-dimension smoothed pitch features (Lei et al., 2006).",
        "HTK lattices were generated with probabilities from the pruned trigram LM and rescored by the full trigram LM.",
        "The consensus decoding output from the rescored lattices was used for scoring FP detection.",
        "The AMs for this system were trained on 1642 hours of Mandarin broadcast news and conversation speech data and the LMs were trained on 1.4 billion words comprising a variety of resources.",
        "Details of training data and system development were illustrated in (Lei et al., 2009).",
        "This procedure is similar to forced aligning the word lattices to the audio data (Finke and Waibel, 1997).",
        "Both Finke et al's approach (Finke and Waibel, 1997) and our approach built a lattice from each transcription sentence (in our approach, optional filled pauses are inserted between any two words and at the beginning and end of each utterance).",
        "Then Finke et al. force-aligned the lattice with utterance; whereas, we used multi-pass constrained decoding with within-word and crossword models, MLLR adaptation of the acoustic models, and rescoring with a higher-order n-gram LM, so the performance will be better than just flexible alignment to the lattices.",
        "Note that when constructing the word lattices with optional FP words, for En",
        "glish, the optional FP words are a choice between uh and um.",
        "For Mandarin, the optional FP words are a choice between uh, mm, zhege, and nage.",
