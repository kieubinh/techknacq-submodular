        "One way to improve the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is to use discriminative language modeling (DLM), which enhances discrimination by learning where the ASR hypotheses deviate from the uttered sentences.",
        "However, DLM requires large amounts of ASR output to train.",
        "Instead, we can simulate the output of an ASR system, in which case the training becomes semi-supervised.",
        "The advantage of using simulated hypotheses is that we can generate as many hypotheses as we want provided that we have enough text material.",
        "In typical scenarios, transcribed in-domain data is limited but large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data is available.",
        "In this study, we investigate how semi-supervised training performs with OOD data.",
        "We find out that OOD data can yield improvements comparable to in-domain data."

        "Discriminative language modeling (DLM) helps ASR systems to discriminate between acoustically similar word sequences in the process of choosing the most accurate transcription of an utterance.",
        "DLM characterizes and learns from ASR errors by comparing the reference transcription of the utterance and the candidate hypotheses generated by the ASR system.",
        "Although previous studies based on this supervised setting have been successful (Roark et al., 2007; Ar?soy et al., 2009; Ar?soy et al., 2012; Sak et al., 2012), they require large amounts of transcribed speech data and a well-trained in-domain ASR system, both of which are hard to obtain.",
        "To overcome this difficulty, instead of training with the real ASR output, we can use simulated output, in which case the training becomes semi-supervised.",
        "Semi-supervised training for discriminative language modeling has been shown to achieve as good word error rate (WER) reduction as the training done with real ASR output (Sagae et al., 2012; C?elebi et al., 2012).",
        "In this approach, first a confusion model (CM) is estimated from supervised data.",
        "This CM contains all seen confusions and their occurrence probabilities in hypotheses generated by an ASR system.",
        "Then, the CM is used to generate a number of alternative-but-incorrect hypotheses, or simulated hypotheses, for a given sentence.",
        "Since the CM characterizes the errors that the ASR system makes, simulated hypotheses carry these characteristics.",
        "At the end, the DLM is trained on the reference sentences and their simulated hypotheses.",
        "Although being able to simulate the output of the ASR system allows us to generate as much output as we need for the DLM training, there is not always enough text data that is in the same domain as the ASR system.",
        "Yet, it is easier to find large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) text data.",
        "In this study, we extend the previous studies where in-domain text data was used for hypothesis simulation.",
        "Instead of using limited in-domain data, we experiment with larger amounts of OOD data for hypothesis simulation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we summarize the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we explain the methods to simulate the hypotheses and to train the DLM.",

        "They observe that the strategy that matches the word error (WE) distribution of the simulated hypotheses to the WE distribution of the ASR outputs yields the best WER reduction.",
        "While the previous studies use in-domain data sets for simulation, it is quite common to collect large amounts of OOD text data from the web.",
        "However, given the nature of web data, some kind of selection mechanism is needed to ensure quality.",
