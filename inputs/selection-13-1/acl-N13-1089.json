        "Sentence Similarity [SS] is emerging as a crucial step in many NLP tasks that focus on sentence level semantics such as word sense disambiguation (Guo and Diab, 2010; Guo and Diab, 2012a), summarization (Zhou et al., 2006), text coherence (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005), tweet clustering (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2011), etc.",
        "SS operates in a very small context, on average 11 words per sentence in Semeval-2012 dataset (Agirre et al., 2012), resulting in inadequate evidence to generalize to robust sentential semantics.",
        "Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization [WTMF] (Guo and Diab, 2012b) is a latent variable model that outperforms Latent Semantic Analysis [LSA] (Deer-wester et al., 1990) and Latent Dirichelet Allocation [LDA] (Blei et al., 2003) models by a large margin in the SS task, yielding state-of-the-art performance on the LI06 (Li et al., 2006) SS dataset.",
        "However, all of these models make harsh simplifying assumptions on how a token is generated: (1) in LSA/WTMF, a token is generated by the inner product of the word latent vector and the document latent vector; (2) in LDA, all the tokens in a document are sampled from the same document level topic distribution.",
        "Under this framework, they ignore rich linguistic phenomena such as inter-word dependency, semantic scope of words, etc.",
        "This is a result of simply using document IDs as features to represent a word.",
        "Modeling quality lexical semantics in latent variable models does not draw enough attention in the community, since people usually apply dimension reduction techniques for documents, which have abundant words for extracting the document level semantics.",
        "However, in the SS setting, it is crucial to make good use of each word, given the limited number of words in a sentence.",
        "We believe a reasonable word generation story will avoid introducing noise in sentential semantics, encouraging robust lexical semantics which can further boost the sentential semantics.",
        "In this paper, we explicitly encode lexical semantics, both corpus-based and knowledge-based information, in the WTMF model, by which we are able to achieve even better results in SS task.",
        "The additional corpus-based information we exploit is selectional preference semantics (Resnik, 1997), a feature already existing in the data yet ignored by most latent variable models.",
        "Selectional preference focuses on the admissible arguments for a word, thus capturing more nuanced semantics than the sentence IDs (when applied to a corpus of sentences as opposed to documents).",
        "Consider the following example:",
        "Many analysts say the global Brent crude oil benchmark price, currently around $111 a barrel ...",
        "In WTMF/LSA/LDA, a word will receive semantics from all the other words in a sentence, hence, the word oil, in the above example, will be assigned the incorrect finance topic that reflects the sentence level semantics.",
        "Moreover, the problem worsens for adjectives, adverbs and verbs, which have a much narrower semantic scope than the whole sentence.",
        "For example, the verb say should only be associated with analyst (only receiving semantics from analyst), as it is not related to other words in the sentence.",
        "In contrast, oil, according to its selectional preference, should be associated with crude indicating the resource topic.",
        "We believe modeling selectional preference capturing local evidence completes the semantic picture for words, hence further rendering better sentential semantics.",
        "To our best knowledge, this is the first work to model selectional preference for sentence/document semantics.",
        "We also integrate knowledge-based semantics in the WTMF framework.",
        "Knowledge-based semantics, a human-annotated clean resource, is an important complement to corpus-based noisy co-occurrence information.",
        "We extract similar word pairs from Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Leveraging these pairs, an infrequent word such as purchase can exploit robust latent vectors from its synonyms such as buy.",
        "Similar words pairs can be seamlessly modeled in WTMF, since in the matrix factorization framework a latent vector profile is explicitly created for each word, while in LDA all the data structures are designed for documents/sentences.",
        "We construct a graph to connect words according to the extracted similar word pairs, to encourage similar words to share similar latent vector profiles.",
