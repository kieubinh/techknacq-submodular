        "Relation Extraction (RE) systems are designed to discover various semantic relations (e.g. <Obama, president, the United States>) from natural language text.",
        "Traditional RE systems extract specific relations for prespecified name-entity types (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Chan and Dan, 2011; Zhou and Zhu, 2011).",
        "To train such systems, every relation needs manually annotated training examples, which supports limited scope and is difficult to extend.",
        "For this reason, Banko et al. (2007) proposed Open Information Extraction (Open IE), whose goal is to extract general relations for two entities.",
        "The idea is to avoid the need for specific training examples, and to extract a diverse range of relations.",
        "This generalized form has received significant attention, e.g., (Banko et al., 2007; Akbik, 2009; Wu and Weld, 2010; Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012).",
        "Because Open IE is not guided by or not restricted to a prespecified list of relations, the immediate challenge is determining about what counts as a relation?",
        "Most recent Open IE systems have targeted verbal relations (Banko et al., 2007; Mausam et al., 2012), claiming that these are the majority.",
        "However, Chan and Dan (2011) show that only 20% of relations in the ACE programs Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) are verbal.",
        "Our manually extracted relation triple set from the Penn Treebank shows that there are more nominal relations than verbal ones, 3 to 2.",
        "This difference arises because of the ambiguity of what constitutes a relation in Open IE.",
        "It is often difficult even for humans to agree on what constitutes a relation, and which words in the sentence establish a relation between a pair of entities.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?Olivetti broke Cocom rules?",
        "is there a relation between Olivetti and Cocom?",
        "This ambiguity in the problem definition leads to significant challenges and confusion when evaluating and comparing the performance of different methods and systems.",
        "An example are the results in Fader et al. (2011) and Mausam et al. (2012).",

        "as su",
        "perior to WOEparse, a system proposed in Wu and Weld (2010); while in Mausam et al. (2012), it is reported the opposite.",
        "To better answer the question, what counts as a relation?",
        "we propose two tasks for Open IE.",
        "The first task seeks to determine whether there is a relation between two entities (called ?Binary task?).",
        "The other is to confirm whether the relation words extracted for the two entities are appropriate (the ?Triple task?).",
        "The Binary task does not restrict relation word forms, whether they are mediated by nouns, verbs, prepositions, or even implicit relations.",
        "The Triple task requires an abstract representation of relation word forms, which we develop here.",
        "We assume that relation words are nouns or verbs; in our data, these two types comprise 71% of explicit relations.",
        "We adapt an SVM dependency tree kernel model (Moschitti, 2006) for both tasks.",
        "The input to our tasks is a dependency parse, created by Stanford Parser.",
        "Selecting relevant features from a parse tree for semantic tasks is difficult.",
        "SVM tree kernels avoid extracting explicit features from parse trees by calculating the inner product of the two trees.",
        "For the Binary task, our dependency path is the path between two entities.",
        "For the Triple task, the path is among entities and relation words (i.e. relation triples).",
        "Tree kernels have been used in traditional RE and have helped achieve state of the art performance (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Wang, 2008; Nguyen et al., 2009; Zhou and Zhu, 2011).",
        "But one challenge of using tree kernels on Open IE is that the lexicon of relations is much larger than those of traditional RE, making it difficult to include the lexical information as features.",
        "Here we proposed an unlexicalized tree structure for Open IE.",
        "As far as we know, this is the first time an SVM tree kernel has been applied in Open IE.",
        "Experimental results on multiple datasets show our system outperforms state-of-the-art systems REVERB and OLLIE.",
        "Typically an Open IE system is tested on one dataset.",
        "However, because the definition of relation is ambiguous, we believe that is necessary to test with multiple datasets.",
        "In addition to the supervised model, we also propose an unsupervised model which relies on several heuristic rules.",
        "Results with this approach show that this simple unsupervised model provides a robust strong baseline for other approaches.",
        "In summary, our main contributions are: ?",
        "Use SVM tree kernels for Open IE.",
        "Our system is robust comparing with other Open IE systems, achieving superior scores in two test sets and comparative scores in another set.",
