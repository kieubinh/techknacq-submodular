        "A meeting is generally accomplished by a number of participants and a wide range of subjects are discussed.",
        "Therefore, it would be helpful to meeting participants to provide them with some additional information related to the current subject.",
        "For instance, assume that a participant is discussing a specific topic with other participants at a meeting.",
        "The summary of previous meetings on the topic is then one of the most important resources for her discussion.",
        "In order to provide information on a topic to participants, keywords should be first generated for the topic since keywords are often representatives of a topic.",
        "A number of techniques have been proposed for automatic keyword extraction (Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2000; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007), and they are designed to extract keywords from a written document.",
        "However, they are not suitable for meeting transcripts.",
        "In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract keywords at the time at which a new utterance is made for just-in-time service of additional information.",
        "Otherwise, the extracted keywords become just the important words at the end of the meeting.",
        "Two key factors for just-in-time keyword extraction from meeting transcripts are time of preceding utterances and topic of current utterance.",
        "First, current utterance is affected by temporal history of preceding utterances.",
        "That is, when a new utterance is made it is likely to be related more closely with latest utterances than old ones.",
        "Second, the preceding utterances which carry similar topics to current utterance are more important than irrelevant utterances.",
        "Since a meeting consists of several topics, the utterances that have nothing to do with current utterance are inappropriate as a history of the current utterance.",
        "This paper proposes a graph-based keyword extraction to reflect these factors.",
        "The proposed method represents an utterance as a graph of which nodes are candidate keywords.",
        "The preceding utterances are also expressed as a history graph in which the weight of an edge is the temporal importance of the keywords connected by the edge.",
        "To reflect the temporal history of utterances, forgetting curve (Wozniak, 1999) is adopted in updating the weights of edges in the history graph.",
        "It expresses effectively not only the reciprocal relation between memory re",
        "tention and time, but also active recall that makes frequent words more consequential in keyword extraction.",
        "Then, a subgraph that is relevant to the current utterance is derived from the history graph, and used as an actual history of the current utterance.",
        "The keywords of the current utterance are extracted by TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) from the merged graph of the current utterance and the history graphs.",
        "The proposed method is evaluated with two kinds of data sets: the National Assembly transcripts in Korean and the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) in English.",
        "The experimental results show that it outperforms both the TFIDF framework (Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009) and the PageRank-based graph model (Wan et al., 2007).",
        "One thing to note is that the proposed method improves even the supervised methods that do not reflect utterance time and topic relevance for the ICSI corpus.",
        "This proves that it is critical to consider time and content of utterances simultaneously in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the related studies on keyword extraction.",
        "Section 3 explains the overall process of the proposed method, and Section 4 addresses its detailed description how to reflect meeting characteristics.",

        "Keyword extraction has been of interest for a long time in various fields such as information retrieval, document clustering, summarization, and so on.",
        "Thus, there have been many studies on automatic keyword extraction.",
        "The frequency-based keyword extraction with TFIDF weighting (Frank et al., 1999) and the graph-based keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) are two base models for this task.",
        "Many studies recently tried to extend them by incorporating specific information such as linguistic knowledge (Hulth, 2003), web-based resource (Turney, 2003), and semantic knowledge (Chen et al., 2010).",
        "As a result, they show good performance on written text.",
        "However, it is difficult to use them directly for spoken genres, since spoken genres have significantly different characteristics from written text.",
        "There have been a few studies focused on keyword extraction from spoken genres.",
        "Among them, the extraction from meetings has attracted more concern, since the need for grasping important points of a meeting or an opinion of each participant has increased.",
        "The studies on meetings focused on the exterior features of meeting dialogues such as unstructured and ill-formed sentences.",
        "Liu et al. (2009) used some knowledge sources such as Part-of-Speech (POS) filtering, word clustering, and sentence salience to reflect dialogue features, and they found out that a simple TFIDF-based keyword extraction using these knowledge sources works reasonably well.",
        "They also extended their work by adopting various features such as decision making sentence features, speech-related features, and summary features that reflect meeting transcripts better (Liu et al., 2011).",
        "Chen et al. (2010) extracted keywords from spoken course lectures.",
        "In this study, they considered prosodic information from HKT forced alignment and topics in a lecture generated by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA).",
        "These studies focused on the exterior characteristics of spoken genres, since they assumed that entire scripts are given in advance and then they extracted keywords that best describe the scripts.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study considered time of utterances which is an intrinsic element of spoken genres.",
        "The relevance between current utterance and preceding utterances is also a critical feature in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",
        "The study that considers this relevance explicitly is CollabRank proposed by Wan and Xiao (2008).",
        "This is collaborative approach to extract keywords in a document.",
        "In this study, it is assumed that a few neighbor documents close to a current document can help extract keywords.",
        "Therefore, they applied a clustering algorithm to a document set and then extracted words that are reinforced by the documents within a cluster.",
        "However, this method also does not consider the utterance time, since it is designed to extract keywords from normal documents.",
        "As a result, if it is applied to meeting transcripts, all preceding utterances would affect the current utterance uniformly, which leads to a poor performance."

        "Since our method can extract up to 5 keywords for each utterance, the number of keywords for the segment can reach to 5 ?",
        "l. From these keywords, we select top-5 keywords ranked by Equation (3).",
        "The proposed method is compared with three previous studies.",
        "The first two are the methods proposed by Liu et al. (2009) One is the frequency-based method of TFIDF weighting with the features such as POS filtering, word clustering, and sentence salience score, and the other is the graph-based method with POS filtering.",
        "The last method is a maximum entropy model applied to this task (Liu et al., 2008).",
        "Note that the maximum entropy is a supervised learning model.",
        "Table 5 summarizes the comparison results.",
        "As shown in this table, the proposed method outperforms all previous methods.",
        "Our method achieves precision of 0.311 and recall of 0.361, and thus the F-score is 0.334.",
        "The weight relative score of the proposed method is 0.533.",
        "This is the improvement of up to 0.044 in F-measure and 0.129 in weighted relative score over other unsupervised methods (TFIDF-Liu and TextRank-Liu).",
        "It should be also noted that the proposed method outperforms even the supervised method (ME model).",
        "The difference between our method and the maximum entropy model in weighted relative score is 0.132.",
        "One possible variant of the proposed method for the ICSI corpus is to simply merge the current utterance graph (G1) with the history graph (G2) rather than to extract keywords from each utterance.",
        "After the current utterance graph of the last utterance in a topic segment is merged into the history graph, the keywords for the segment are extracted from the history graph.",
        "This variant and the proposed method both rely on the temporal history, but the difference is that the history graph of the variant accumulates all information within the topic segment.",
        "Thus, the keywords extracted from the history graph by this variant are those without consideration of topic relevance.",
        "Table 6 compares the proposed method with the variant.",
        "The performance of the variant is higher than those of TFIDF-Liu and TextRank-Liu.",
        "This proves the importance of the temporal history in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",
        "However, the proposed method still outperforms the variant, and it demonstrates the importance of topic relevance.",
        "Therefore, it can be concluded that the consideration of temporal history and topic relevance is critical in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts."

        "In this paper, we have proposed a just-in-time keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",
        "Whenever an utterance is spoken, the proposed method extracts keywords from the utterance that best describe the utterance.",
        "Based on the graph representation of all components in a meeting, the proposed method extracts keywords by TextRank with some graph operations.",
        "Temporal history and topic of the current utterance are two major factors especially in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",
        "This is because recent utterances are more important than old ones and only the preceding utterances of which topic is relevant to the current utterance are important.",
        "To model the temporal importance of the preceding utterances, the concept of forgetting curve is used in updating the history graph of preceding utterances.",
        "In addition, the subgraph of the history graph that shares words appearing in the current utterance graph is used to extract keywords rather than whole history graph.",
        "The proposed method was evaluated with the National Assembly transcripts and the ICSI meeting corpus.",
        "According to our experimental results on these data sets, the performance of keyword extraction is improved when we consider temporal history and topic relevance."
