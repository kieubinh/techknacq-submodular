        "Furthermore, particular training corpora may be highly suitable for training the TM or the LM, but unsuitable for training the RM, or vice versa, so mixture weights for these models should be estimated separately.",
        "An additional contribution of the paper is to propose two improvements to mixture model adaptation: smoothing the in-domain sample, and weighting instances by document frequency.",
        "Applied to mixture RMs in our experiments, these techniques (especially smoothing) yield significant performance improvements."

        "A phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system typically has three main components: a translation model (TM) that contains information about how to translate word sequences (phrases) from the source language to the target language, a language model (LM) that contains information about probable word sequences in the target language, and a reordering model (RM) that indicates how the order of words in the source sentence is likely to influence the order of words in the target sentence.",
        "The TM and the RM are trained on parallel data, and the LM is trained on target-language data.",
        "Usage of language and therefore the best translation practice differs widely across genres, topics, and dialects, and even depends on a particular author's or publication's style; the word ?domain?",
        "is often used to indicate a particular combination of all these factors.",
        "Unless there is a perfect match between the training data domain and the (test) domain in which the SMT system will be used, one can often get better performance by adapting the system to the test domain.",
        "In offline domain adaptation, the system is provided with a sample of translated sentences from the test domain prior to deployment.",
        "In a popular variant of offline adaptation, linear mixture model adaptation, each training corpus is used to generate a separate model component that forms part of a linear combination, and the sample is used to assign a weight to each component (Foster and Kuhn, 2007).",
        "If the sample resembles some of the corpora more than others, those corpora will receive higher weights in the combination.",
        "Previous research on domain adaptation for SMT has focused on the TM and the LM.",
        "Such research is easily motivated: translations across domains are unreliable.",
        "For example, the Chinese translation of the English word ?mouse?",
        "would most likely be ?laoshu ???",
        "if the topic is the animal; if the topic is computer hardware, its translation would most 938 likely be ?shubiao???.",
        "However, when the translation is for people in Taiwan, even when the topic is computer hardware, its translation would more likely be ?huashu ???.",
        "It is intuitively obvious why TM and LM adaptation would be helpful here.",
        "By contrast, it is not at all obvious that RM model adaptation will improve SMT performace.",
        "One would expect reordering behaviour to be characteristic of a particular language pair, but not of particular domains.",
        "At most, one might think that reordering is lexicalized?perhaps, (for instance) in translating from Chinese to English, or from Arabic to English, there are certain words whose English translations tend to undergo long-distance movement from their original positions, while others stay close to their original positions.",
        "However, one would not expect a particular Chinese adverb or a particular Arabic noun to undergo long-distance movement when being translated into English in one domain, but not in others.",
        "Nevertheless, that is what we observe: see section 5 below.",
        "This paper shows that RM adaptation improves the performance of our phrase-based SMT system.",
        "In our implementation, the RM is adapted by means of a linear mixture model, but it is likely that other forms of RM adaptation would also work.",
        "We obtain even more effective RM adaptation by smoothing the in-domain sample and by weighting orientation counts by the document frequency of the phrase pair.",
        "Both improvements could be applied to the TM or the LM as well, though we have not done so.",
        "Finally, the paper analyzes reordering to see why RM adaptation works.",
        "There seem to be two factors at work.",
        "First, the reordering behaviour of words and phrases often differs dramatically from one bilingual corpus to another.",
        "Second, there are corpora (for instance, comparable corpora and bilingual lexicons) which may contain very valuable information for the TM, but which are poor sources of RM information; RM adaptation downweights information from these corpora significantly, and thus improves the overall quality of the RM.",
        "2 Reordering Model In early SMT systems, such as (Koehn, 2004), changes in word order when a sentence is translated were modeled by means of a penalty that is incurred when the decoder chooses, as the next source phrase to be translated, a phrase that does not immediately follow the previously translated source sentence.",
        "Thus, the system penalizes deviations from monotone order, with the magnitude of the penalty being proportional to distance in the source sentence between the end of the previously translated source phrase and the start of the newly chosen source phrase.",
        "Many SMT systems, including our own, still use this distance-based penalty as a feature.",
        "However, starting with (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005; Koehn et al., 2005), a more sophisticated type of reordering model has often been adopted as well, and has yielded consistent performance gains.",
        "This type of RM typically identifies three possible orientations for a newly chosen source phrase: monotone (M), swap (S), and discontinuous (D).",
        "The M orientation occurs when the newly chosen phrase is immediately to the right of the previously translated phrase in the source sentence, the S orientation occurs when the new phrase is immediately to the left of the previous phrase, and the D orientation covers all other cases.1 This type of RM is lexicalized: the estimated probabilities of M, S and D depend on the source-language and target-language words in both the previous phrase pair and the newly chosen one.",
        "Galley and Manning (2008) proposed a ?hierar- chical?",
        "lexicalized RM in which the orientation (M, S, or D) is determined not by individual phrase pairs, but by blocks.",
        "A block is the largest contiguous sequence of phrase pairs that satisfies the phrase pair consistency requirement of having no external links.",
        "Thus, classification of the orientation of a newly chosen phrase as M, S, or D is carried out as if the decoder always chose the longest possible source phrase in the past, and will choose the longest possible source phrase in the future.",
        "The RM used in this paper is hierarchical and lex-icalized.",
        "For a given phrase pair (f , e), we estimate the probabilities that it will be in an M, S, or D orientation o with respect to the previous phrase pair and the following phrase pair (two separate distri-butions).",
        "Orientation counts c(o, f, e) are obtained from a word-aligned corpus using the method de-1Some researchers have distinguished between left and right versions of the D orientation, but this 4-orientation scheme has not yielded significant gains over the 3-orientation one.",
        "939 scribed in (Cherry et al., 2012), and corresponding probabilities p(o|f, e) are estimated using recursive MAP smoothing: p(o|f, e) = c(o, f, e) + ?f p(o|f) + ?e p(o|e) c(f, e) + ?f + ?e p(o|f) = c(o, f) + ?g p(o) c(f) + ?g p(o) = c(o) + ?u/3 c(?)",
        "+ ?u , (1) where p(o|e) is defined analogously to p(o|f), and the four smoothing parameters ?e, ?f , ?g, and ?u are set to values that minimize the perplexity of the resulting model on held-out data.",
        "During decoding, orientations with respect to the previous context are obtained from a shift-reduce parser, and orientations with respect to following context are approximated using the coverage vector (Cherry et al., 2012).",
        "3 RM Adaptation 3.1 Linear mixture model Following previous work (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Foster et al., 2010), we adopt the linear mixture model technique for RM adaptation.",
        "This technique trains separate models for each training corpus, then learns weights for each of the models and combines the weighted component models into a single model.",
        "If we have N sub-corpora, the global reordering model probabilities p(o|f, e) are computed as in (2): p(o|f, e) = N?",
        "i=1 ?i pi(o|f, e) (2) where pi(o|f, e) is the reordering model trained on sub-corpus i, and ?i is its weight.",
        "Following (Foster et al., 2010), we use the EM algorithm to learn the weights that maximize the probability of phrase-pair orientations in the development set (in-domain data): ??",
        "= argmax ?",
        "?",
        "o,f,e p?",
        "(o, f, e) log N?",
        "i=1 ?i pi(o|f, e) (3) where p?",
        "(o, f, e) is the empirical distribution of counts in the dev set (proportional to c(o, f, e)).",
        "Two separate sets of mixing weights are learned: one for the distribution with respect to the previous phrase pair, and one for the next phrase pair.",
        "3.2 Development set smoothing In Equation 3, p?",
        "(o, f, e) is extracted from the in-domain development set.",
        "Since dev sets for SMT systems are typically small (1,000-3,000 sentences), we apply smoothing to this RM.",
        "We first obtain a smoothed conditional distribution p(o|f, e) using the MAP technique described above, then multiply by the empirical marginal p?",
        "(e, f) to obtain a final smoothed joint distribution p(o, f, e).",
        "There is nothing about this idea that limits it to the RM: smoothing could be applied to the statistics in the dev that are used to estimate a mixture TM or LM, in order to mitigate over-fitting.",
        "However, we note that, compared to the TM, the over-fitting problem is likely to be more acute for the RM, since it splits counts for each phrase pair into three categories.",
        "3.3 Document-frequency weighting Mixture models, like the RM in this paper, depend on the existence of multiple training corpora, with each sub-corpus nominally representing a domain.",
        "A recent paper suggests that some phrase pairs belong to general language, while others are domain-specific (Foster et al., 2010).",
        "If a phrase pair exists in all training corpora, it probably belongs to general language; on the other hand, if it appears in only one or two training corpora, it is more likely to be domain-specific.",
        "We were interested in seeing whether information about domain-specificity could improve the estimation of mixture RM weights.",
        "The intuition is that phrase pairs that belong to general language should contribute more to determining sub-corpus weights, since they are the ones whose reordering behaviour is most likely to shift with domain.",
        "To capture this intuition, we multiplied the empirical distribution in (3) by the following factor, inspired by the standard document-frequency formula: D(f, e) = log(DF (f, e) +K), (4) where DF (f, e) is the number of sub-corpora that (f, e) appears in, and K is an empirically-determined smoothing term.",

        "5.1 Weighting by corpus quality One answer to the above question is that some corpora are better for training RMs than others.",
        "Fur-thermore, corpora that are good for training the LM or TM are not necessarily good for training the RM, and vice versa.",
        "Tables 6 and 7 illustrate this.",
        "These list the weights assigned to various sub-corpora for LM, TM, and RM mixture models.",
        "The weights assigned to the isi sub-corpus in particular exhibit a striking pattern.",
        "These are high in the LM mixtures, moderate in the TM mixtures, and very low in the RM mixtures.",
        "When one considers that isi contains 72.6% of the English words in the Arabic training data (see table 2), its weight of 0.01 in the RM mixture is remarkable.",
        "On reflection, it makes sense that EM would assign weights in the order it does.",
        "The isi corpus consists of comparable data: sentence pairs whose source and target-language sides are similar, but often not mutual translations.",
        "These are a valuable source of in-domain n-grams for the LM; a somewhat noisy source of in-domain phrase pairs for the TM; and an unreliable source of reordering patterns for the RM.",
