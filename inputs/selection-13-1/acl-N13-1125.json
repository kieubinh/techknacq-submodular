        "In modern theoretical linguistics, empty categories (ECs) are an important piece of machinery in representing the syntactic structure of a sentence and they are used to represent phonologically null elements such as dropped pronouns and traces of dislocated elements.",
        "They have also found their way into large-scale treebanks which have played an important role in advancing the state of the art in syntactic parsing.",
        "In phrase-structure treebanks, ECs have been used to indicate long-distance dependencies, discontinuous constituents, and certain dropped elements (Marcus et al., 1993; Xue et al., 2005).",
        "Together with la-beled brackets and function tags, they make up the full syntactic representation of a sentence.",
        "The use of ECs captures some cross-linguistic commonalities and differences.",
        "For example, while both the Penn English TreeBank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) and the Chinese TreeBank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) use traces to represent the extraction site of a dislocated element, dropped pronouns (represented as *pro*s) are much more widespread in the CTB.",
        "This is because Chinese is a pro-drop language (Huang, 1984) that allows the subject to be dropped in more contexts than English does.",
        "While detecting and resolving traces is important to the interpretation of the syntactic structure of a sentence in both English and Chinese, the prevalence of dropped nouns in Chinese text gives EC detection added significance and urgency.",
        "They are not only an important component of the syntactic parse of a sentence, but are also essential to a wide range of NLP applications.",
        "For example, any meaningful tracking of entities and events in natural language text would have to include those represented by dropped pronouns.",
        "If Chinese is translated into a different language, it is also necessary to render these dropped pronouns explicit if the target language does not allow pro-drop.",
        "In fact, Chung and Gildea (2010) reported preliminary work that has shown a positive impact of automatic EC detection on statistical machine translation.",
        "Some ECs can be resolved to an overt element in the same text while others only have a generic reference that cannot be linked to any specific entity.",
        "Still others have a plausible antecedent in the text, but are not annotated due to annotation limitations.",
        "A common practice is to resolve ECs in two separate stages (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003b; Dienes and Dubey, 2003a; Campbell, 2004; Gab-bard et al., 2006; Schmid, 2006; Cai et al., 2011).",
        "The first stage is EC detection, where empty categories are first located and typed.",
        "The second stage",
        "is EC resolution, where empty categories are linked to an overt element if possible.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel approach to detecting empty categories in Chinese, using the CTB as training and test data.",
        "More concretely, EC detection involves (i) identifying the position of the EC, relative to some overt word tokens in the same sentence, and (ii) determining the type of EC, e.g., whether it is a dropped pronoun or a trace.",
        "We focus on EC detection here because most of the ECs in the Chinese Treebank are either not resolved to an overt element or linked to another EC.",
        "For example, dropped pronouns (*pro*) are not resolved, and traces (*T*) in relative clauses are linked to an empty relative pronoun (*OP*).",
        "In previous work, ECs are either represented linearly, where ECs are indexed to the following word (Yang and Xue, 2010) or attached to nodes in a phrase structure tree (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003b; Gabbard et al., 2006).",
        "In a linear representation where ECs are indexed to the following word, it is difficult to represent consecutive ECs because that will mean more than one EC will be indexed to the same word (making the classification task more complicated).",
        "While in English consecutive ECs are relatively rare, in Chinese this is very common.",
        "For example, it is often the case that an empty relative pronoun (*OP*) is followed immediately by a trace (*T*).",
        "Another issue with the linear representation of ECs is that it leaves unspecified where the EC should be attached, and crucial dependencies between ECs and other elements in the syntactic structure are not represented, thus limiting the utility of this task.",
        "In a phrase structure representation, ECs are attached to a hierarchical structure and the problem of multiple ECs indexed to the same word token can be avoided because linearly consecutive ECs may be attached to different non-terminal nodes in a phrase structure tree.",
        "In a phrase structure framework, ECs are evaluated based on their linear position as well as on their contribution to the overall accuracy of the syntactic parse (Cai et al., 2011).",
        "In the present work, we propose to look at EC detection in a dependency structure representation, where we define EC detection as (i) determining its linear position relative to the following word token, (ii) determining its head it is a dependent of, and (iii) determining the type of EC.",
        "Framing EC detection this way also requires a new evaluation metric.",
        "An EC is considered to be correctly detected if its linear position, its head, and its type are all correctly determined.",
        "We report experimental results that show even using this more stringent measure, our EC detection system achieved performance that improved significantly over the state-of-the-art results.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will describe how to represent ECs in a dependency structure in detail and present our approach to EC detection.",
        "In Section 3, we describe how linguistic information is encoded as features.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss our experimental setup and present our results.",

        "In order to detect ECs anchored in a dependency tree, we first convert the phrase structure trees in the CTB into dependency trees.",

        "We then train a classifier to predict the position and type of ECs in the dependency tree.",
        "Let W be a sequence of word tokens in a sentence, and T is syntactic parse tree for W , our task is to predict whether there is a tuple (h, t, e), such that h and t are word tokens in W , e is an EC, h is the head of e, and t immediately follows e. When EC detection is formulated as a classification task, each classification instance is thus a tuple (h, t).",
        "The input to our classifier is T , which can either be a phrase structure tree or a dependency tree.",
        "We choose to use a phrase structure tree because phrase structure parsers trained on the Chinese Treebank are readily available, and we also hypothesize that phrase structure trees have a richer hierarchical structure that can be exploited as features for EC detection."

        "The number of *OP*s, in particular, has increased dramatically from 134 to 527, and this is because a null relative pronoun (*OP*) immediately followed by a trace (*T*) in the subject position of a relative clause is a very common pattern in the Chinese Treebank, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In (Yang and Xue, 2010), the *OP*-*T* sequences are collapsed into one, and only the *T*s are counted.",
        "That leads to the much smaller count of *OP*s. type count type count",
        "Our results are shown in Table 3.",
        "These results are achieved by using the full feature set presented in Section 3.",
        "The overall accuracy by F1-measure is 0.574 if we assume there can only be one EC associated with a given (h, t) tuple and hence the total EC count in the gold standard is 1,765, or 0.561 if we factor in all the EC instances and use the higher total count of 1,838, which lowers the recall.",
        "If instead we use the total EC count of 1,352 that was used in previous work (Yang and Xue, 2010; Cai et al., 2011), then the F1-measure is 0.660 because the lower total count greatly improves the recall.",
        "This is a significant improvement over the best previous result reported by Cai et al(2011), which is an F1 measure of 0.586 on the same test set but based on a less stringent metric of just comparing the EC position and type, without considering whether the EC is attached to the correct head.",
        "There are several observations worth noting from these results.",
        "One is that our method performs particularly well on null relative pronouns (*OP*) and class correct prec rec F1",
        "comparison with (Cai et al., 2011) [CCG] traces (*T*), indicating that our features are effective in capturing information from relative clause constructions.",
        "This accounts for most of the gain compared with previous approaches.",
        "The *OP* category, in particular, benefits most from the dependency representation because it is collapsed to the immediately following *T* in previous approaches and does not even get a chance to be detected.",
        "On the other hand, our model did poorly on dropped pronouns (*pro*).",
        "One possible explanation is that *pro*s generally occupy subject positions in a sentence and is attached as an immediate child of an IP, which is the top-level structure of a sentence that an automatic parser tends to get wrong.",
        "Unlike *PRO*, it is not constrained to well-defined grammatical constructions such as subject-and object-control structures.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of our features, we also did an ablation study on the contribution of different feature groups.",
        "The most effective features are the ones when taken out lead to the most drop in accuracy.",
        "As should be clear from Table 4, the most effective features are the horizontal features, followed by vertical structures.",
        "Features extracted from targeted grammatical constructions and features representing whether h is the head of a coordinated VP lead to modest improvement.",
        "Transitivity and semantic role features make virtually no difference at all.",
        "We believe it is premature to conclude that they are not useful.",
        "Possible explanations for their lack of effectiveness is that they are used in very limited context and the accuracy of the semantic role label"

        "The work reported here follows a fruitful line of research on EC detection and resolution, mostly in English.",
        "Empty categories have initially been left behind in research on syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001) for efficiency reasons, but more recent work has shown that EC detection can be effectively integrated into the parsing process (Schmid, 2006; Cai et al., 2011).",
        "In the meantime, both preprocessing and post-processing approaches have been explored in previous work as alternatives.",
        "Johnson (2002) has showed that empty categories can be added to the skeletal parses with reasonable accuracy with a simple pattern-matching algorithm in a postprocessing step.",
        "Dienes and Dubey (2003b; 2003a) achieved generally superior accuracy using a machine learning framework without having to refer to the syntactic structure in the skeletal parses.",
        "They described their approach as a preprocessing step for parsing because they only use as features morpho-syntactic clues (passives, gerunds and to-infinitives) that can be found in certain function words and part-of-speech tags.",
        "Even better results, however, were obtained by Campbell (2004) in a postprocessing step that makes use of rules inspired by work in theoretical linguistics.",
        "Gabbard et al(2006) reported further improvement largely by recasting the Campbell rules as features to seven different machine learning classifiers.",
        "We adopted a machine-learning based postprocessing approach based on insights gained from prior work in English and on Chinese-specific considerations.",
        "All things being equal, we believe that a machine learning approach that can exploit partial information is more likely to succeed than deterministic rules that have to make reference to morpho-syntactic clues such as to-infinitives and gerunds that are largely non-existent in Chinese.",
        "Without these clues, we believe a preprocessing approach that does not take advantage of skeletal parses is unlikely to succeed either.",
        "The work we report here also builds on emerging work in Chinese EC detection.",
        "Yang and Xue (2010) reported work on detecting just the presence and absence of empty categories without further classifying them.",
        "Chung and Gildea (2010) reported work on just detecting just a small subset of the empty categories posited in the Chinese TreeBank.",
        "Kong and Zhou (2010) worked on Chinese zero anaphora resolution, where empty category detection is a subtask.",
        "More recently, Cai et al(2011) has successfully integrated EC detection into phrase-structure based syntactic parsing and reported state-of-the-art results in both English and Chinese."

        "We described a novel approach to detecting empty categories (EC) represented in dependency trees and a new metric for measuring EC detection accuracy.",
        "The new metric takes into account not only the position and type of an EC, but also the head it is a dependent of in a dependency structure.",
        "We also proposed new features that are more suited for this new approach.",
        "Tested on a subset of the Chinese Treebank, we show that our system improved significantly over the best previously reported results despite using a more stringent evaluation metric, with most of the gain coming from an improved representation.",
        "In the future, we intend to work toward resolving ECs to their antecedents when EC detection can be done with adequate accuracy.",
        "We also plan to test our approach on the Penn (English) Treebank, with the first step being converting the Penn Treebank to a dependency representation with the ECs preserved."
