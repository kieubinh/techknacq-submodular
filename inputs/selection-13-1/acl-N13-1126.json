        "Many languages still lack access to core NLP tools, such as part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers.",
        "This is largely due to the reliance on fully supervised learning methods, which require large quantities of manually annotated training data.",
        "Recently, methods for cross-lingual transfer have appeared as a promising avenue for overcoming this hurdle for both part-of-speech tagging (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011) and syntactic dependency parsing (Hwa et al., 2005; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Ganchev et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011; Naseem et al., ?Work primarily carried out while at Google, NY.",
        "2012).",
        "While these methods do not yet compete with fully supervised approaches, they can drastically outperform both unsupervised methods (Klein and Manning, 2004) and weakly supervised methods (Naseem et al., 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).",
        "A promising approach to cross-lingual transfer of syntactic dependency parsers is to use multiple source languages and to tie model parameters across related languages.",
        "This idea was first explored for weakly supervised learning (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Snyder et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010) and recently by Naseem et al. (2012) for multi-source cross-lingual transfer.",
        "In particular, Naseem et al. showed that by selectively sharing parameters based on typological features of each language, substantial improvements can be achieved, compared to using a single set of parameters for all languages.",
        "However, these methods all employ generative models with strong independence assumptions and weak feature representations, which upper bounds their accuracy far below that of feature-rich discriminative parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; Nivre, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we improve upon the state of the art in cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsers from multiple source languages by adapting feature-rich discriminatively trained parsers to a specific target language.",
        "First, in ?4 we show how selective sharing of model parameters based on typological traits can be incorporated into a delexicalized discriminative graph-based parsing model.",
        "This requires a careful decomposition of features into language-generic and language-specific sets in order to tie specific target language parameters to their relevant source language counterparts.",
        "The resulting parser outperforms the method of Naseem et al. (2012) on 12 out of 16 evaluated languages.",
        "Second, in ?5 we introduce a train",
        "ing method that can incorporate diverse knowledge sources through ambiguously predicted labelings of unlabeled target language data.",
        "This permits effective relexicalization and target language adaptation of the transfer parser.",
        "Here, we experiment with two different knowledge sources: arc sets, which are filtered by marginal probabilities from the cross-lingual transfer parser, are used in an ambiguity-aware self-training algorithm (?5.2); these arc sets are then combined with the predictions of a different transfer parser in an ambiguity-aware ensemble-training algorithm (?5.3).",
        "The resulting parser provides significant improvements over a strong baseline parser and achieves a 13% relative error reduction on average with respect to the best model of Naseem et al. (2012), outperforming it on 15 out of the 16 evaluated languages."

        "In contrast to annotation projection approaches (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009; Spreyer and Kuhn, 2009), delexicalized transfer methods do not rely on any bitext.",

(2011) proposed a mixture model in which the parameters of a generative target language parser is expressed as a linear interpolation of source language parameters, whereas S?gaard (2011) showed that target side language models can be used to selectively subsample training sentences to improve accuracy.",

        "However, this weighting did not provide significant improvements over uniform weighting.",
        "The aforementioned approaches work well for transfer between similar languages.",
        "However, their assumptions cease to hold for typologically divergent languages; a target language can rarely be described as a linear combination of data or model parameters from a set of source languages, as languages tend to share varied typological traits; this critical insight is discussed further in ?4.",
        "To account for this issue, Naseem et al. (2012) recently introduced a novel generative model of dependency parsing, in which the generative process is factored into separate steps for the selection of dependents and their ordering.",
        "The parameters used in the selection step are all language independent, capturing only head-dependent attachment preferences.",

        "In the transfer scenario, where no supervision is available in the target language, this parser achieves the hitherto best published results across a number of languages; in particular for target languages with a word order divergent from the source languages.",
        "However, the generative model of Naseem et al. is quite impoverished.",
        "In the fully supervised setting, it obtains substantially lower accuracies compared to a standard arc-factored graph-based parser (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Averaged across 16 languages,2 the generative model trained with full supervision on the target language obtains an accuracy of 67.1%.",

        "Even when delexicalized, this model reaches 78.9%.",
        "This gap in supervised accuracy holds for all 16 languages.",
