        "Research in REG primarily focuses on the subtask of selecting a set of properties that may be used to construct the final surface expression, e.g., ?color:orange, size:large, type:plate?.",
        "This property selection task is optimized to meet different goals: for example, to be identical to those a person would generate in the same situation, or to be unique to the intended referent and no other item in the discourse.",
        "We focus on the task of generating referring expressions for visible objects, specifically with the goal of generating descriptive, human-like referring expressions.",

      "heading": "2 Motivation & Overview",
      "text": [
        "Most implemented algorithms for referring expression generation focus on unique identification of a referent, determining the set of properties that distinguish a particular target object from the other objects in the scene (the contrast set) (Dale, 1989; Reiter and Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer et al., 2003; Areces et al., 2008).",
        "This view of reference was first outlined by Olson (1970), ?the specification of an intended referent relative to a set of alternatives?.",
        "A substantial body of evidence now shows that contrastive value relative to alternatives is not the only factor motivating speakers?",
        "property choices, specifically in visual domains.",
        "The phenomena of overspecification and redundancy, where speakers select properties that have little or no contrastive value, was observed in early developmental studies in visual domains (Ford and Olson, 1975; Whitehurst, 1976; Sonnenschein, 1985) as well as later studies on adult speakers in visual domains (Pechmann, 1989; Engelhardt et al., 2006; Koolen et al., 2011).",
        "The related phenomenon of underspecification, where speakers select a set of properties that do not linguistically specify the referent, has also received some attention, particularly in visual domains (Clark et al., 1983; Kelleher et al., 2005).",
        "These findings make sense in light of visual evidence that some properties ?pop out?",
        "in the scene (Treisman and Gelade, 1980), and speakers may begin referring before scanning the full set of scene objects (Pechmann, 1989), selecting those properties that are salient for them (Horton and Keysar, 1996; Bard et al., 2009) without spending a great amount of cognitive effort considering the perception of a hearer (Keysar and Henly, 2002).",
        "We take this evidence to suggest an approach for a visual reference algorithm that generates natural, human-like reference by generating visual properties that are salient for a speaker.1 We can understand what is salient visually (what does the visual system first respond to, what guides attention?",
        "), linguistically (what do people tend to mention in visual scenes?",
        "), and cognitively, which we will not have room to discuss in this paper (what is atypical for",
        "difficult to obtain from a two-dimensional image.",
        "We find it easy to perceive the background object as larger than the one in the front; but they are technically the same size in the image (from Murray et al. (2006)).",
        "this object?",
        "); as well as in terms of broader notions of salience, e.g., discourse salience (Krahmer and Theune, 2002).",
        "This suggests a paradigm shift in the generation task when referring to visible objects, if the goal is to produce human-like reference.",
        "In particular, this suggests moving from selecting properties that rule out other scene objects to selecting properties that are salient for the speaker (visually, conversationally, based on previous experiences, etc.).",
        "This mirrors related research on the tradeoff between audience design and egocentrism in language production (Clark and Murphy, 1982; Horton and Keysar, 1996; Bard et al., 2009; Gann and Barr, 2013).",
        "Under-and overspecification naturally fall out from such an approach, with no need to specifically model either phenomenon.",
        "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the set of properties that are visually salient and the set of properties that are linguistically salient largely overlap.",
        "Color is the first property our visual system processes, followed soon after by size (Murray et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2008; Schwarzkopf et al., 2010); and people tend to use color (Pechmann, 1989; Viethen et al., 2012) and size when identifying objects, with size common when there is another object of the same type in the scene (Brown-Schmidt and Tanenhaus, 2006).",
        "Following this, our algorithm gives a privileged position to these properties, processing them first.",
        "Using computer vision techniques to determine an object's color works reasonably well (Berg et al., 2011), and the relevant visual features for this task may be useful in future work to return several possible color labels that capture differences in lexical choice (cf. Reiter and Sripada (2002)).",
        "Detecting size does not work well (Forsyth,",
        "2011); and when it does, it will likely not take the form supposed in recent generation work.",
        "Most REG algorithms use a predefined single-featured value, such as ?big?",
        "; however, given an image-based input, obtaining such a value requires (1) determining how the object is situated in a three-dimensional space, difficult to obtain from a two-dimensional image (see Figure 1); and (2) determining what the value should be: object detectors currently can provide the height and width of the location where an object is likely to exist (its bounding box), as well as the x-and y-axis locations of the pixels within the object detection; but a value from these features like ?big?, ?tall?, or ?long?",
        "requires further reasoning.",
        "As such, we incorporate the top-performing size algorithm introduced in Mitchell et al. (2011), which takes as input the height and widths of objects in the image and outputs a size value or NONE, indicating that size should not be used to describe the object.",
        "In addition to color and size, location and orientation begin to be processed early on in the visual system (Treisman, 1985; Itti and Koch, 2001), with our first perception of location corresponding to basic cues of where an object is relative to our focus of attention.",
        "For an input image, this simple type of location corresponds to surface forms such as, e.g., ?on the right of the image?",
        "or ?at the top of the image?.",
        "Along with size, location and orientation make up the three primary relative properties that we aim to generate language for.",
        "After the simple forms for color, size, location, and orientation properties are processed, our visual system feeds forward to two parallel pathways, the so-called ?what?",
        "and ?where?",
        "pathways (Ungerlei-der and Mishkin, 1982), which process properties with growing complexity.",
        "The ?what?",
        "pathway includes absolute properties like shape and material, which computer vision has had some success detecting (Ferrari and Zisserman, 2007; Farhadi et al., 2009) while the ?where?",
        "pathway corresponds to more complex spatial orientation and location information, such as where objects are relative to one another and which way they are facing.",
        "To begin connecting this process to the generation of human-like descriptions of visible objects, we start with the following simplification: Color and size have a privileged status, the first properties processed.",
        "These are followed by the relative properties Figure 2: Initial model for generating visual reference.",
        "of location and orientation, which may feed forward to more complex location and orientation properties in one pathway; and absolute properties following color, like material and shape, which may be processed in another pathway.",
        "This gives us the basic model for generating reference to visible objects shown in Figure 2.",
        "To generate reference in this model, nodes correspond to general visual attributes and may generate forms for visual properties (attribute:value pairs).",
        "That is, a property such as color:red is generated from the attribute node color and a property such as size:tall is generated from the attribute node size.",
        "We are limited by existing REG corpora in which properties we can evaluate; in this paper, we examine the effect of the independent selection of color and size, followed by location and orientation.2 Generating human-like expressions in this setting begins to be possible by adopting recent proposals that REG handle speaker variation (Viethen and Dale, 2010) and the non-deterministic nature of reference (van Gompel et al., 2012; van Deemter et al., 2012b).",
        "We can capture such variation simply by estimating ?att, the likelihood that an attribute att generates a corresponding visual property.",
        "During generation, the algorithm passes through each attribute node, and uses this estimate to stochastically add each property to the output property set.",
        "Such a non-deterministic process means that the algorithm will not return the same output every time, which offers new challenges for evaluation.",
        "If we run the algorithm 1,000 times, we have a distribution over several possible output property sets.",
        "From this we can obtain the majority set and check if it matches the majority observed set.",
        "Similarly, we can 2We have also built an algorithm and corpus with more complex properties in order to tease out further details of visual reference, but must leave these details for follow up work; for now, we focus on the properties common to REG corpora.",
        "run the algorithm for as many instances as we have in our test data, and see how well the property sets it produces aligns to the observed property sets.",
        "We discuss evaluation using both methods in Section 6."

        "The task is to find the set of properties that uniquely specify the referent.",
        "This is known as a content selection problem, and the set of properties chosen by the algorithm is called a distinguishing description.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm (IA) proceeds by iterating through attributes in a predefined order (a preference order), and for each attribute, it checks whether specifying a value would rule out at least one item in the contrast set that has not already been ruled out.",
        "If it will, the attribute:value is added to the distinguishing description.",
        "This process continues until all contrast items (distractors) are ruled out or all available properties have been checked.",
        "We use the implementation of the IA available from the NLTK (Bird et al., 2009).3 In the Graph-Based Algorithm (GB), the objects in the discourse are represented within a labeled directed graph, and content selection is a subgraph construction problem.",
        "Each object is represented as a vertex, with properties for an object represented as self-edges on the object vertex, and spatial relations between objects represented as edges between vertices.",
        "The algorithm seeks to find the cheapest sub-graph, calculated from the edge costs.",

        "An important commonality between these algorithms, and much of the work on REG that they have influenced, is the focus on unique identification and operating deterministically.",
        "Both produce one property set (and only one), and stop once a target item has been uniquely identified (or else fail).",
        "Their driving goal is to rule out distractor objects.",
        "In the approach introduced here, the algorithm produces a distribution over several possible outputs, and the initial driving mechanism is based on likelihood estimates for each attribute independent of the other objects in the scene, rather than ruling out all distractors.",
        "This offers a way to capture some aspects of human-like reference, including under-and overspecification and speaker variation.",
        "Due to the fundamentally different objective of this algorithm, we will call the kind of expression it generates an identifying description, following Searle (1969).",

        "In contrast to most algorithms for the generation of referring expressions, which have aimed to produce distinguishing descriptions when these exist (Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012), the core idea behind this algorithm is to generate what is likely for a speaker in a visual domain.",

        "We are limited by available REG corpora to reliably assess methods for generating more complex absolute properties like shape and material, but adding such properties would help advance the generation of human-like reference in visual scenes and offers further points of connection between the generation process and computer vision property detection.",
