        "To obtain a higher quality annotated corpus, it is necessary to spend more time and money on data annotation.",
        "For this reason, one often has to accept some tradeoff between data quality and human effort.",
        "A significant proportion of corpora are unbalanced, where the distribution of class categories are heavily skewed towards one or a few categories.",
        "Unbalanced corpora are common in a number of different tasks, such as emotion detection (Ang et al., 2002; Alm et al., 2005), sentiment classification (Li et al., 2012), polarity of opinion (Carvalho et al., 2011), uncertainty and correctness of student answers in tutoring dialogue systems (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011; Dzikovska et al., 2012), text classification (Forman, 2003), information extraction (Hoffmann et al., 2011), and so on1.",
        "In this paper, we present a semi-automated annotation method that can reduce annotation effort for the class of binary unbalanced corpora.",
        "Here is our proposed annotation scheme: the first step is to build a high-recall classifier with some initial annotated data with an acceptable accuracy via a cost-sensitive approach.",
        "The second step is to apply this classifier to the rest of the unlabeled data, where the data are then classified with positive or negative labels.",
        "The last step is to manually check every positive label and correct it if it is wrong.",
        "To apply this method to work in practice, two research questions have to be addressed.",
        "The first one is how to get a high-recall classifier.",
        "High recall means only a low proportion of true positives are misclassified (false negatives).",
        "This property allows for only positive labels to be corrected by human annotators in the third step, so that annotation effort may be reduced.",
        "A related and separate research question concerns the overall quality of data when false negatives are not corrected: will a dataset anno",

        "In this paper, we will answer the two research questions in the context of one form of binary unbalanced task2: annotation of transcribed human-human dialogue for presence/absence of uncertainty.",

        "A number of semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed in the literature for reducing annotation effort, such as active learning (Cohn et al., 1994; Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Zhu et al., 2010), co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and self-training (Mihal-cea, 2004).",
        "Active learning reduces annotation by carefully selecting more useful samples.",
        "Co-training relies on several conditional independent classifiers to tag new unlabeled data and self-training takes the advantage of full unlabeled data.",
        "These semi-supervised learning methods demonstrate that with a small proportion of annotated data, a classifier can achieve comparable performance with all annotated data.",
        "However, these approaches still need considerable annotation effort when a large corpus has to be annotated.",
        "In that case, all predicted labels have to be rechecked by humans manually.",
        "In addition, none of them take advantage of unbalanced data.",
        "Another class of effort reduction techniques is pre-annotation, which uses supervised machine-learning systems to automatically assign labels to the whole data and subsequently lets human annotators correct them (Brants and Plaehn, 2000; Chiou et al., 2001; Xue et al., 2002; Ganchev et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2006; Rehbein et al., 2012).",
        "Generally speaking, our annotation method belongs to the class of pre-annotation methods.",
        "How-2This annotation scheme can also benefit other kinds of tasks.",
        "ever, our method improves pre-annotation for unbalanced data in two ways.",
        "Firstly, we lower the threshold for achieving a high recall classifier.",
        "Secondly, with pre-annotation, although people only perform a binary decision of whether the automatic classifier is either right or wrong, they have to go through all the unlabeled data one by one.",
        "In contrast, in our scheme, people go through only the positive predictions, which are much less than the whole unlabeled data, due to the unbalanced structure of the data.",
        "What's more, reducing the annotation effort is the goal of this paper but not building a high recall classifier such as Prabhakaran et al. (2012) and Ambati et al. (2010).",
        "The approach proposed by Tetreault and Chodorow (2008) is similar to us.",
        "However, they assumed they had a high recall classifier but did not explicitly show how to build it.",
        "In addition, they did not provide extrinsic evaluation to see whether a corpus generated by pre-annotation is good enough to be used in real applications."
