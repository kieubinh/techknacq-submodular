        "We present our work in generating Karmina, an old Malay poetic form for Indonesian language.",

        "One of the unique aspects of Karmina is in the absence of discourse relation between its hook and message.",
        "We approached the problem by generating the hooks and the messages in separate processes using predefined schemas and a manually built knowledge base.",
        "The Karminas were produced by randomly pairing the messages with the hooks, subject to the constraints imposed on the rhymes and on the structure similarity.",
        "Syllabifications were performed on the cue words of the hooks and messages to ensure the generated pairs have matching rhymes.",
        "We were able to generate a number of positive examples while still leaving room for improvement, particularly in the generation of the messages, which currently are still limited, and in filtering the negative results."

        "Computational creativity is an interesting area of research, since it deals with how a machine can actually produce something new and creative.",
        "Creative, in the sense that it is something that usually comes from human's imagination, which is quite abstract, and unexpected from a machine.",
        "In this work, we investigated the matter of creativity in language.",
        "In particular, we focused our work in the generation of Karmina, an old Malay poetic form for Indonesian language.",
        "Karmina is a poem that consists of two lines with around 8-12 syllables on each line.",
        "The first line is called the hook, which acts as the opening line of the poem.",
        "The second line is called the message, which contains the meaning of the poem.",
        "The language used in Karmina is usually less formal, i.e. closer to conversational language.",
        "Karmina resembles Pantun, a more well-known form of Malay poetic form, but is different from Pantun in the number of lines it has.",
        "It can probably be compared to a couplet in English, in terms of the number of lines and rhymes it must follows.",
        "Due to its short presentation, Karmina is also called a quick Pantun.",
        "One of the unique aspects of Karmina is in its hook and message relationship.",
        "The hook on the first line has no discourse relation with the message on the second line.",
        "Take as an example Karmina presented below in Indonesian: Gendang gendut tali kecapi Kenyang perut senanglah hati (Fat drum string of lute Full stomach makes a happy heart) and also our attempt to make one in English: Soft meatball is easy to chew Love them all but trust a few The hook in Karmina acts as the entrance of the poem and is used to engage interest or curiosity of the audience.",
        "It usually talks about something common in daily life, some unusual or less mean",
        "ingful information, or obvious facts, e.g. Buah pi-sang warnanya kuning (Banana is yellow).",
        "The message of Karmina contains the real meaning that wants to be delivered by the author.",
        "It might contain ideas, jokes, mockeries, or even advices.",
        "The sentence used in the message does not need to be formal.",
        "It creates its poetic form by omitting some function words, changing the word order, or by using the base form of the word instead of using a morphologically derived one.",
        "The rhyme scheme in Karmina is formally deemed to be a-a.",
        "But we found that most of the Karminas have the rhyme schemes of (a b)-(a b), with (a b) in the same line, as shown in the examples above.",
        "The position of the rhyme a in an (a b) line is usually located in the middle of the sentence and is determined by how to read the Karmina so that the rhymes on both lines match to each other.",
        "We chose to work with Karmina due to its simple and short presentation.",
        "It will be both challenging and interesting to answer the question of whether we can computationally generate a simple and short poem that contains a single idea (meaning), while at the same time maintain its poetic characteristics.",
        "From a cultural point of view, we considered this as one of the ways to conserve this poem, as well as to introduce it to others.",
        "We centered our work in generating Karmina with rhyme schemes of (a b)-(a b).",
        "We considered Karmina in this form to be more poetic and have more interesting structure.",
        "We present our work by first mentioning some related works in the area of poetry generation in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our approach for syllabification, hook and message generation, and the construction of the final Karmina.",
        "We present the results of our experiments in Section 4.",

        "Other previous work in a more general area of poetry is by Manurung et al. (2000).",

        "The appropriate strophic forms are selected based on this input.",
        "The process continues using a case based reasoning approach to produce the final poem.",
        "We consider our work to have different focus and pose different challenges.",
        "The first thing is that the meaning of a Karmina can be understood directly.",
        "This property might be different from other type of poetry which requires deeper interpretation.",
        "Hence, the problem usually lies in generating a poem with a deep embedded meaning.",
        "The second one is related to the property of the hook that should contain less important information (ignorable) compared to the message.",
        "We believe that we could fulfill these two requirements by defining proper schemas and constraints, and by controlling the words used.",
        "The last thing to consider is about the absence of discourse relation between the hook and the message.",
        "Our current approach to the problem is by generating the hooks and the messages separately using different knowledge base and different constraints.",
        "By this treatment, we expect the generated hooks and messages to be independent of each other."

        "We defined around 19 schemas for the hook.",
