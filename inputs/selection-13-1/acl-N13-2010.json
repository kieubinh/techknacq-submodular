        "As the number of images on the web continues to increase, the task of automatically describing images becomes especially important.",
        "Image captions can provide background information about what is seen in the image, can improve accessibility of websites for visually-impaired users, and can improve image retrieval by providing text to search user queries against.",
        "Typically, online search engines rely on collocated textual information to resolve queries, rather than analyzing visual content directly.",
        "Likewise, earlier image captioning research from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community use collocated information such as news articles or GPS coordinates, to decide what information to include in the generated caption (Deschacht and Moens, 2007; Aker and Gaizauskas, 2010; Fan et al., 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2010a).",
        "However, in some instances visual recognition is necessary because collocated information is missing, irrelevant, or unreliable.",
        "Recognition is a classic Computer Vision (CV) problem including tasks such as recognizing instances of object classes in images (such as car, cat, or sofa); classifying images by scene (such as beach or forest); or detecting attributes in an image (such as wooden or feathered).",
        "Recent works in image caption generation represent visual content via the output of trained recognition systems for a predefined set of visual classes.",
        "They then use linguistic models to correct noisy initial detections (Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011), and generate more natural-sounding text (Li et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2012; Kuznetsova et al., 2012).",
        "A key problem with this approach is that it assumes that image captioning is a grounding problem, with language acting only as labels for visual meaning.",
        "One good reason to challenge this assumption is that it imposes unrealistic constraints on the kinds of images that can be automatically described.",
        "Previous work only recognizes a limited number of visual classes ?",
        "typically no more than a few dozen in total ?",
        "because training CV systems requires a huge amount of hand-annotated data.",
        "For example, the PASCAL VOC dataset1 has 11,530 training im",
        "ages with 27,450 labeled objects, in order to learn only 20 object classes.",
        "Since training visual recognition systems is such a burden, ?general-domain?",
        "image captioning datasets are limited by the current technology.",
        "For example, the SBU-Flickr dataset (Ordonez et al., 2011), which contains 1 million images and captions, is built by first querying Flickr using a predefined set of queries, then further filtering to remove instances where the caption does not contain at least two words belonging to their term list.",
        "Furthermore, detections are too noisy to generate a good caption for the majority of images.",
        "For example, Kuznetsova et al. (2012) select their test set according to which images receive the most confident visual object detection scores.",
        "We instead direct our attention to the domain-specific image captioning task, assuming that we know a general object or scene category for the query image, and that we have access to a dataset of images and captions from the same domain.",
        "While some techniques may be unrealistic in assuming that high-quality collocated text is always available, assuming that there is no collocated information at all is equally unrealistic.",
        "Data sources such as file names, website text, Facebook likes, and web searches all provide clues to the content of an image.",
        "Even an image file by itself carries metadata on where and when it was taken, and the camera settings used to take it.",
        "Since visual recognition is much easier for domain-specific tasks, there is more potential for natural language researchers to do research that will impact the greater community.",
        "Finally, labeling visual content is often not enough to provide an adequate caption.",
        "The meaning of an image to a user is more than just listing the objects in the image, and can even change for different users.",
        "This problem is commonly known as ?bridging the semantic gap?",
        ": ?The semantic gap is the lack of coincidence between the information that one can extract from the visual data and the interpretation that the same data have for a user in a given situation.",
        "A linguistic description is almost always contextual, whereas an image may live by itself.?",
        "(Smeulders et al., 2000) challenges/VOC/ General-domain models of caption generation fail to capture context because they assume that all the relevant information has been provided in the image.",
        "However, training models on data from the same domain gives implicit context about what information should be provided in the generated text.",
        "This thesis proposes a framework for image captioning that does not require supervision in the form of hand-labeled examples.",
        "We train a topic model on a corpus of images and captions in the same domain, in order to jointly learn image features and natural language descriptions.",
        "The trained topic model is used to estimate the likelihood of words appearing in a caption, given an unseen query image.",
        "We then use these likelihoods to rewrite an extracted human-written caption to accurately describe the query image.",
        "We have implemented our framework using a dataset of online shopping images and captions, and propose to extend this model to other domains, including natural images."

        "The training data is used in two ways: for sentence extraction from the captions of training images that are visually similar to the query image overall; and for training a topic model of individual words and local image features, in order to capture fine-grained details.",
        "Finally, a sentence compression algorithm is used to remove details from the extracted captions that do not fit the query image.",
        "The work that we have done so far has been implemented using the Attribute Discovery Dataset (Berg et al., 2010), a publicly available dataset of shopping images and product descriptions.2 Here, we run our framework on the women's shoes section, which has over 14000 images and captions, representing a wide variety of attributes for texture, shapes, materials, colors, and other visual qualities.",
        "The women's shoes section is formally split",
        "into ten subcategories, such as wedding shoes, sneakers, and rainboots.",
        "However, many of the subcategories contain multiple visually distinct kinds of shoes.",
        "We do not make use of the subcategories, instead we group all of the categories of shoe images together.",
        "The shoes in the images are mostly posed against solid color backgrounds, while the captions have much more variability in length and linguistic quality.",
        "For our thesis work, we intend to extend our current framework to different domains of data, including natural images.",
        "However, it is important to point out that no part of the framework as it is currently implemented is specific to describing shoes or shopping images.",

        "We describe an ILP for caption generation, drawing inspiration from sentence compression work by Clarke and Lapata (2008).",

        "I(wi), where wi, ..., wn are words in the extracted caption, ?i is a binary decision variable which is true if we include wi in the compressed output, and I(wi) is a score for the accuracy of each word.",
        "For non-function words, 3To formulate this problem as a linear program, the probabilities are actually log probabilities, but we omit the logs in this paper to save space.",

        "Function words do not affect the accuracy of the generated caption, so I(wi) = 0.",
        "The second measure in the objective is a tri-gram language model, described in detail in Clarke (2008).",
        "In the original sentence compression task, the language model is a component as it naturally prefers shorter output sentences.",
        "However, our objective is not to generate a shorter caption, but to generate a more accurate caption.",
        "However, we still include the language model in the objective, with a weighting factor , as it helps remove unnecessary function words and help reduce the search space of possible sentence compressions.",
        "Constraints: The ILP constraints include sequential constraints to ensure the mathematical validity of the model, and syntactic constraints that ensure the grammatical correctness of the compressed sentence.",
        "We do not have space here to describe all of the constraints, but basically, using the ?semantic head?",
        "version of the headfinder from Collins (1999), we constrain that the head word of the sentence and the head word of the sentence's object cannot be deleted, and for any word that we include in the output sentence, we must include its head word as well.",
        "We also have constraints that define valid use of coordinating conjunctions and punctuation.",
        "We evaluate generated captions using automatic metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",
        "These metrics are commonly used in summarization and translation research and have been previously used in image captioning research to compare automatically generated captions to human-written captions for each image (Ordonez et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Kuznetsova et al., 2012).",
        "Although human-written captions may use synonyms to describe a visual object or attribute, or even describe entirely different attributes than what is described in the generated captions, computing the automatic metrics over a large test set finds statistically significant improvements in the accuracy of the extracted and compressed captions over extraction alone.",
        "For our proposed work (Section 4), we also plan to perform manual evaluations of our captions based on their content and language quality.",
        "However, cross-system comparisons would be more difficult because our method uses an entirely different kind of data.",

        "Our method is most similar to that of Feng and Lapata (2010a), who generate captions for news images.",
        "Like them, we train an LDA-like model on both images and text to find latent topics that generate both.",

        "Instead of domains such as handbags and shoes, we propose to cluster the training data based on visual scene domains such as mountains, beaches, and living rooms.",
        "We are particularly interested in the scene attributes and classifiers by Patterson and Hays (2012) which builds an attribute-based taxonomy of scene types using crowd-sourcing, rather than categorical scene types which are typically used.",
        "Visual recognition is generally much more difficult in natural scenes than in posed images, since lighting and viewpoints are not consistent, and objects may be occluded by other objects or truncated by the edge of the image.",
        "However, we are optimistic because we do not need to solve the general visual recognition task, since our model only learns how visual objects and attributes appear in specific domains of scenes, a much easier problem.",
        "Additionally, the space of likely objects and attributes to detect is limited by what typically appears in that type of scene.",
        "Finally, we can use the fact that our image captioning method is not grounded in our fa-vor, and assume that if an object is partially occluded or truncated in an image, than it is less likely that the photographer considered that object to be interesting, so it is not as important whether that object is described in the caption or not.",
        "Finally, there is also much that could be done to improve the text generation component on its own.",
        "Our framework currently extracts only a single caption sentence to compress, while recent work in summarization has focused on the problem of learning how to jointly extract and compress (Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011).",
        "Since a poor extraction choice can make finding an accurate compression impossible, we should also study different methods of extraction to learn about what kinds of features are most likely to help us find good sentences.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2.1, we have already found that global feature descriptors are better than bag of image word descriptors for extracting sentences to use in image caption compressions in the shopping dataset.",
        "As we extend our framework to other domains of images, we are interested in finding whether scene-based descriptors and classifiers in general are better at finding good sentences than local descriptors, and whether there is a connection between region and phrase-based detectors correlating better with sentence and phrase-length text, while local image descriptors are more related to single words.",
        "Finding patterns like this in visual text in general would be helpful for many other tasks besides image captioning."
