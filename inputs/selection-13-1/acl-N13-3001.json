        "Ambiguous terms that are found in biomedical documents include words, phrases and abbreviations (Schuemie et al., 2005).",
        "Identifying the correct interpretation of ambiguous terms is important to ensure that the text can be processed appropriately.",
        "Many WSD systems developed for biomedical documents are based on supervised learning, for example (McInnes et al., 2007; Martinez and Baldwin, 2011); these have the advantage of being more accurate than unsupervised approaches.",
        "However, WSD systems based on supervised learning rely on manually labeled examples consisting of instances of an ambiguous term marked with their correct interpretations.",
        "Manually labeled examples are very expensive to create and are consequently only available for a few hundred terms, with each new domain (with its specialist vocabulary) needing new examples la-beled.",
        "The majority of supervised WSD systems are limited to resolving a small number of ambiguous terms and, despite their accuracy, are not suitable for use within applications.",
        "An alternative approach is to use automatically labeled examples which can be generated without manual annotation (Leacock et al., 1998).",
        "These have been used to generate an all-words WSD system that assigns senses from WordNet (Zhong and Ng, 2010).",
        "For biomedical documents the UMLS Metathesaurus (Humphreys et al., 1998b) is a more suitable lexical resource than WordNet and techniques have been developed to create automatically labeled examples for this resource (Stevenson and Guo, 2010).",
        "However, to date, automatically labeled examples have only been used as substitutes for ambiguous terms for which manually labeled examples are not available, rather than using them to create a WSD system that can resolve a wider range of ambiguities in biomedical documents.",
        "DALE (Disambiguation using Automatically Labeled Examples) is an online WSD system for biomedical documents that was developed by creating automatically labeled examples for all ambiguous terms in the UMLS Metathesaurus.",
        "DALE is",
        "able to identify a meaning for any term that is ambiguous in the Metathesaurus and therefore has far greater coverage of ambiguous terms than other supervised WSD systems.",
        "Other all-words WSD systems for biomedical documents are unsupervised and do not have as high accuracy as supervised approaches, e.g. (McInnes, 2008; Agirre et al., 2010).",
        "An unsupervised WSD algorithm (Humphreys et al., 1998a) is included in MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) but is unable to resolve all types of sense distinction."

        "The WSD algorithm in DALE is based around a supervised algorithm (Stevenson et al., 2008) trained using automatically labeled examples.",
        "The examples are generated using two methods: Monosemous relatives and Co-occurring concepts (Stevenson and Guo, 2010).",
        "Both approaches take a single CUI, c, as input and use information from the UMLS Metathesaurus to search Medline and identify instances of c that can be used as labeled examples.",
        "The difference between the two approaches is that they make use of different information from the Metathesaurus.",
        "Both approaches are provided with a set of ambiguous CUIs from the UMLS Metathesaurus, which represent the possible meanings of an ambiguous term, and a target number of training examples to be generated for each CUI.",

        "For instance, ?C0025520?, ?C1524024?",
        "and ?C0079107?",
        "are the top three co-occurring CUIs of CUI ?C0015677?",
        "in MRCOC table.",
        "The strings associated with LUIs of these three CUIs can be used to retrieve examples of CUI ?C0015677?",
        "by searching for abstracts containing all the LUIs of the co-occurring CUIs.",

        "nlm.nih.gov), suggesting these CUIs do not tend to be mentioned within documents.",
        "100 examples were generated for each CUI since using an equal number of examples for each CUI produces the best WSD performance in the absence of other information about the likelihood of each CUI (Cheng et al., 2012).",
