        "Automatic translation between a spoken language and a signed language gives rise to some of the same difficulties as translation between spoken languages, but adds unique challenges of its own.",
        "Contrary to what one might expect, sign languages are not artificial languages, but natural languages that spontaneously arose within deaf communities; although they are typically named after the region where they are used, they are not derived from the local spoken language and tend to bear no similarity to it.",
        "Therefore, translation from any spoken language into the signed language of that specific region is at least as complicated as between any pairs of unrelated languages.",
        "The problem of automatic translation is compounded by the fact that the amount of computational resources to draw on is much smaller than is typical for major spoken languages.",
        "Moreover, the fact that sign languages employ a different transmission modality (gestures and expressions instead of sounds) means that existing writing systems are not easily adaptable to them.",
        "The resulting lack of a shared written form does nothing to improve the availability of sign language corpora; bilingual corpora, which are of particular importance to a translation system, are especially rare.",
        "In fact, various projects around the world are trying to ameliorate this sad state of affairs for specific Sign Languages (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2010; Braffort et al., 2010; Morrissey et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we describe the work we performed as concerns the translation of connectives from the Italian language into LIS, the Italian Sign Language (Lingua Italiana dei Segni).",
        "Because the communities of signers in Italy are relatively small and fragmented, and the language has a relatively short history, there is far less existing research and material to draw on than for, say, ASL (American Sign Language) or BSL (British Sign Language).",
        "Our work was undertaken within the purview of the ATLAS project (Bertoldi et al., 2010; Lom-bardo et al., 2010; Lombardo et al., 2011; Prinetto et al., 2011; Mazzei, 2012; Ahmad et al., 2012), which developed a full pipeline for translating Italian into LIS.",
        "ATLAS is part of a recent crop of projects devoted to developing automatic translation from language L spoken in geographic area G into the sign language spoken in G (Dreuw et al., 2010; Lo?pez-Luden?a et al., 2011; Almohimeed et al., 2011; Lu and Huenerfauth, 2012).",
        "Input is taken in the form of written Italian text, parsed, and converted into a semantic representation of its contents; from this semantic representation, LIS output is produced, using a custom serialization format called AEWLIS (which we will describe later).",
        "This representation is then augmented with space positioning information, and fed into a final renderer component that performs the signs using a virtual actor.",
        "ATLAS focused on a limited domain for which a bilingual Italian/LIS cor",
        "pus was available: weather forecasts, for which the Italian public broadcasting corporation (RAI) had long been producing special broadcasts with a signed translation.",
        "This yielded a corpus of 376 LIS sentences with corresponding Italian text: this corpus, converted into AEWLIS format, was the main data source for the project.",
        "Still, it is a very small corpus, hence the main project shied away from statistical NLP techniques, relying instead on rule-based approaches developed with the help of a native Italian/LIS bilingual speaker; a similar approach is taken e.g. in (Almohimeed et al., 2011) for Arabic."

        "The main semantic-bearing elements of an Italian sentence, such as nouns or verbs, typically have a LIS sign as their direct translation.",
        "We focus on a different class of elements, comprising conjunctions and prepositions, but also some adverbs and prepositional phrases; collectively, we refer to them as connectives.",
        "Since they are mainly structural elements, they are more heavily affected by differences in the syntax and grammar of Italian and LIS (and, presumably, in those of any spoken language and the ?corresponding?",
        "SL).",
        "Specifically, as we will see later, some connectives are translated with a sign, some connectives are dropped, whereas others affect the positioning of other signs, or just their syntactic proximity.",
        "It should be noted that our usage of the term ?connectives?",
        "is somewhat unorthodox.",
        "For example, while prepositions can be seen as connectives (Ferrari, 2008), only a few adverbs can work as connectives.",
        "From the Italian Treebank, we extracted all words or phrases that belonged to a syntactic category that can be a connective (conjunction, preposition, adverb or prepositional phrase).",
        "We then found that we could better serve the needs of ATLAS by running our analysis on the entire resulting list, without filtering it by eliminating the entries that are not actual connectives.",
        "In fact, semantic differences re-emerge through our analysis: e.g., the temporal adverbs ?domani?",
        "and ?dopodomani?",
        "are nearly always preserved, as they do carry key information (especially for weather forecasting) and are not structural elements.",
        "In performing our analysis, we pursued a different path from the main project, relying entirely on the bilingual corpus.",
        "Although the use of statistical techniques was hampered by the small size of the corpus, at the same time it presented an interesting opportunity to attack the problem from a different angle.",
        "In this paper we describe how we uncovered the translation distributions of the different connectives from Italian to LIS via tree alignment."

        "the connective word or phrase may map to a corresponding connective sign; ?",
        "the connective is not present as a sign, but may affect the morphology of the signs which translate words syntactically adjacent to the connective; ?",

        "The second hypothesis deserves some explanation.",
        "The earliest treatments of LIS assumed that each sign (lemma) could be treated as invariant.",
        "Attempts to represent LIS in writing simply replaced each sign with a chosen Italian word (or phrase, if necessary) with the same meaning.",
        "Although this is still a useful way of representing the basic lemma, more recent studies have noted that LIS signs can undergo significant morphological variations which are lost under such a scheme.",
        "The AEWLIS format, in fact, was designed to preserve them.",
        "Of course, morphological variations in LIS are not phonetic, like in a spoken language, but gestural (Volterra, 1987; Romeo, 1991).",
        "For example, the location in which a gesture is performed may be varied, or its speed, or the facial expressions that accompany it (Geraci et al., 2008).",
        "One particularly interesting axis of morphology is the positioning of the gesture in the signing space in front of the signer.",
        "This space is implicitly divided into a grid with a few different positions from left to right and from top to bottom (see HR ?",
        "High Right, and LH ?",
        "High Left, in Figure 2).",
        "Two or more signs can then be placed in different positions in this virtual space, and by performing other signs in the same positions the signer can express a backreference to the previously established entity at that location.",
        "One can even have a movement verb where the starting and ending positions of the gesture are positioned independently to indicate the source and destination of the movement.",
        "In other words, these morphological variations can perform a similar function to gender and number agreement in Italian backreferences, but they can also assume roles that in Italian would be performed by prepositions, which are connectives.",
