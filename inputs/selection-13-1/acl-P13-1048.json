        "Discourse of any kind is not formed by independent and isolated textual units, but by related and structured units.",
        "Discourse analysis seeks to uncover such structures underneath the surface of the text, and has been shown to be beneficial for text summarization (Louis et al., 2010; Marcu, 2000b), sentence compression (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005), text generation (Prasad et al., 2005), sentiment analysis (Somasundaran, 2010) and question answering (Verberne et al., 2007).",
        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), one of the most influential theories of discourse, represents texts by labeled hierarchical structures, called Discourse Trees (DTs), as exemplified by a sample DT in Figure 1.",
        "The leaves of a DT correspond to contiguous Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) (six in the example).",
        "Adjacent EDUs are connected by rhetorical relations (e.g., Elaboration, Contrast), forming larger discourse units (represented by internal ?This work was conducted at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.",
        "nodes), which in turn are also subject to this relation linking.",
        "Discourse units linked by a rhetorical relation are further distinguished based on their relative importance in the text: nucleus being the central part, whereas satellite being the peripheral one.",
        "Discourse analysis in RST involves two subtasks: discourse segmentation is the task of identifying the EDUs, and discourse parsing is the task of linking the discourse units into a labeled tree.",
        "While recent advances in automatic discourse segmentation and sentence-level discourse parsing have attained accuracies close to human performance (Fisher and Roark, 2007; Joty et al., 2012), discourse parsing at the document-level still poses significant challenges (Feng and Hirst, 2012) and the performance of the existing document-level parsers (Hernault et al., 2010; Subba and Di-Eugenio, 2009) is still considerably inferior compared to human gold-standard.",
        "This paper aims to reduce this performance gap and take discourse parsing one step further.",
        "To this end, we address three key limitations of existing parsers as follows.",
        "First, existing discourse parsers typically model the structure and the labels of a DT separately in a pipeline fashion, and also do not consider the sequential dependencies between the DT constituents, which has been recently shown to be critical (Feng and Hirst, 2012).",
        "To address this limitation, as the first contribution, we propose a novel document-level discourse parser based on probabilistic discriminative parsing models, represented as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Sutton et al., 2007), to infer the probability of all possible DT constituents.",
        "The CRF models effectively represent the structure and the label of a DT constituent jointly, and whenever possible, capture the sequential dependencies between the constituents.",
        "Second, existing parsers apply greedy and suboptimal parsing algorithms to build the DT for a document.",
        "To cope with this limitation, our CRF models support a probabilistic bottom-up parsing",
        "But he added: \"Some people use the purchasers?",
        "index as a leading indicator, some use it as a coincident indicator.",
        "But the thing it's supposed to measure -- manufacturing strength it missed altogether last month.\" <P>Elaboration",
        "second sentence has a well-formed discourse tree, but the first sentence does not have one.",
        "algorithm which is non-greedy and optimal.",
        "Third, existing discourse parsers do not discriminate between intra-sentential (i.e., building the DTs for the individual sentences) and multi-sentential parsing (i.e., building the DT for the document).",
        "However, we argue that distinguishing between these two conditions can result in more effective parsing.",
        "Two separate parsing models could exploit the fact that rhetorical relations are distributed differently intra-sententially vs. multi-sententially.",
        "Also, they could independently choose their own informative features.",
        "As another key contribution of our work, we devise two different parsing components: one for intra-sentential parsing, the other for multi-sentential parsing.",
        "This provides for scalable, modular and flexible solutions, that can exploit the strong correlation observed between the text structure (sentence boundaries) and the structure of the DT.",
        "In order to develop a complete and robust discourse parser, we combine our intra-sentential and multi-sentential parsers in two different ways.",
        "Since most sentences have a well-formed discourse sub-tree in the full document-level DT (for example, the second sentence in Figure 1), our first approach constructs a DT for every sentence using our intra-sentential parser, and then runs the multi-sentential parser on the resulting sentence-level DTs.",
        "However, this approach would disregard those cases where rhetorical structures violate sentence boundaries.",
        "For example, consider the first sentence in Figure 1.",
        "It does not have a well-formed sub-tree because the unit containing EDUs 2 and 3 merges with the next sentence and only then is the resulting unit merged with EDU 1.",
        "Our second approach, in an attempt of dealing with these cases, builds sentence-level sub-trees by applying the intra-sentential parser on a sliding window covering two adjacent sentences and by then consolidating the results produced by overlapping windows.",
        "After that, the multi-sentential parser takes all these sentence-level sub-trees and builds a full rhetorical parse for the document.",
        "While previous approaches have been tested on only one corpus, we evaluate our approach on texts from two very different genres: news articles and instructional how-to-do manuals.",
        "The results demonstrate that our contributions provide consistent and statistically significant improvements over previous approaches.",
        "Our final result compares very favorably to the result of state-of-the-art models in document-level discourse parsing.",
        "In the rest of the paper, after discussing related work in Section 2, we present our discourse parsing framework in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the intra-and multi-sentential parsing components.",
        "Section 5 presents the two approaches to combine the two stages of parsing.",
        "The experiments and error analysis, followed by future directions are discussed in Section 6.",
        "Finally, we summarize our contributions in Section 7."

        "Since we already have an accurate sentence-level discourse parser (Joty et al., 2012), a straightforward approach to document-level parsing could be to simply apply this parser to the whole document.",
        "However this strategy would be problematic because of scalability and modeling issues.",
        "Note that the number of valid trees grows exponentially with the number of EDUs in a document.",
        "Therefore, an exhaustive search over the valid trees is often unfeasible, even for relatively small documents.",
        "For modeling, the problem is two-fold.",
        "On the one hand, it appears that rhetorical relations are distributed differently intra-sententially vs. multi-sententially.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows a comparison between the two distributions of six most",
        "frequent relations on a development set containing 20 randomly selected documents from RST-DT.",
        "Notice that relations Attribution and Same-Unit are more frequent than Joint in intra-sentential case, whereas Joint is more frequent than the other two in multi-sentential case.",
        "On the other hand, different kinds of features are applicable and informative for intra-sentential vs. multi-sentential parsing.",
        "For example, syntactic features like dominance sets (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) are extremely useful for sentence-level parsing, but are not even applicable in multi-sentential case.",
        "Likewise, lexical chain features (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2004), that are useful for multi-sentential parsing, are not applicable at the sentence level.",
        "Based on these observations, our discourse parsing framework comprises two separate modules: an intra-sentential parser and a multi-sentential parser (Figure 3).",
        "First, the intra-sentential parser produces one or more discourse sub-trees for each sentence.",
        "Then, the multi-sentential parser generates a full DT for the document from these sub-trees.",
        "Both of our parsers have the same two components: a parsing model assigns a probability to every possible DT, and a parsing algorithm identifies the most probable DT among the candidate DTs in that scenario.",
        "While the two models are rather different, the same parsing algorithm is shared by the two modules.",
        "Staging multi-sentential parsing on top of intra-sentential parsing in this way allows us to exploit the strong correlation between the text structure and the DT structure as explained in detail in Section 5.",
        "Before describing our parsing models and the parsing algorithm, we introduce some terminology that we will use throughout the paper.",
        "Following (Joty et al., 2012), a DT can be formally represented as a set of constituents of the form R[i,m, j], referring to a rhetorical relation R between the discourse unit containing EDUs i through m and the unit containing EDUs m+1 through j.",

        "For example, this is true for 75% cases in our development set containing 20 news articles from RST-DT and for 79% cases in our development set containing 20 how-to-do manuals from the Instructional corpus.",
        "Based on this observation, we propose a sliding window approach.",
        "In this approach, our intra-sentential parser works with a window of two consecutive sentences, and builds a DT for the two sentences.",
        "For example, given the three sentences in Figure 7, our intra-sentential parser constructs a DT for S1-S2 and a DT for S2-S3.",
        "In this process, each sentence in a document except the first and the last will be associated with two DTs: one with the previous sentence (say DTp) and one with the next (say DTn).",
        "In other words, for each non-boundary sentence, we will have two decisions: one from DTp and one from DTn.",
        "Our parser consolidates the two decisions and generates one or more sub-trees for each sentence by checking the following three mutually exclusive conditions one after another: ?",
        "Same in both: If the sentence has the same (in terms of both structure and labels) well-formed sub-tree in both DTp and DTn, we take this sub-tree for the sentence.",
        "For example, in Figure 8(a), S2 has the same sub-tree in the two DTs, i.e. a DT for S1-S2 and a DT for S2-S3.",
        "The two decisions agree on the DT for the sentence.",
        "?",
        "Different but no cross: If the sentence has a well-formed sub-tree in both DTp and DTn, but the two sub-trees vary either in structure or in labels, we pick the most probable one.",
        "For example, consider the DT for S1-S2 in Figure 8(a) and the DT for S2-S3 in Figure 8(b).",
        "In both cases S2 has a well-formed sub-tree, but they differ in structure.",
        "We pick the sub-tree which has the higher probability in the two dynamic programming tables.",
        "?",
        "Cross: If either or both of DTp and DTn segment the sentence into multiple sub-trees, we pick the one with more sub-trees.",
        "For example, consider the two DTs in Figure 8(c).",
        "In the DT for S1-S2, S2 has three sub-trees (4-5,6,7), whereas in the DT for S2-S3, it has two (4-6,7).",
        "So, we extract the three sub-trees for S2 from the first DT.",
        "If the sentence has the same number of sub-trees in both DTp and DTn, we pick the one with higher probability in the dynamic programming tables.",
        "At the end, the multi-sentential parser takes all these sentence-level sub-trees for a document, and builds a full rhetorical parse for the document."
