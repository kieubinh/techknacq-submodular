        "In the last decade, dependency parsing has gradually been receiving visible attention.",
        "One of the reasons is the increased availability of dependency treebanks, be they results of genuine dependency annotation projects or converted automatically from previously existing phrase-structure treebanks.",
        "In both cases, a number of decisions have to be made during the construction or conversion of a dependency treebank.",
        "The traditional notion of dependency does not always provide unambiguous solutions, e.g. when it comes to attaching functional words.",
        "Worse, dependency representation is at a loss when it comes to representing paratactic linguistic phenomena such as coordination, whose nature is symmetric (two or more conjuncts play the same role), as opposed to the head-modifier asymmetry of dependencies.1 1We use the term modifier (or child) for all types of dependent nodes including arguments.",
        "The dominating solution in treebank design is to introduce artificial rules for the encoding of coordination structures within dependency trees using the same means that express dependencies, i.e., by using edges and by labeling of nodes or edges.",
        "Obviously, any tree-shaped representation of a coordination structure (CS) must be perceived only as a ?shortcut?",
        "since relations present in coordination structures form an undirected cycle, as illustrated already by Tesnie`re (1959).",
        "For example, if a noun is modified by two coordinated adjectives, there is a (symmetric) coordination relation between the two conjuncts and two (asymmetric) dependency relations between the conjuncts and the noun.",
        "However, as there is no obvious linguistic intuition telling us which tree-shaped CS encoding is better and since the degree of freedom has several dimensions, one can find a number of distinct conventions introduced in particular dependency treebanks.",
        "Variations exist both in topology (tree shape) and labeling.",
        "The main goal of this paper is to give a systematic survey of the solutions adopted in these treebanks.",
        "Naturally, the interplay of dependency and coordination links in a single tree leads to serious parsing issues.",
        "The present study does not try to decide which coordination style is the best from the parsing point of view.3 However, we believe that our survey will substantially facilitate experiments in this direction in the future, at least by exploring and describing the space of possible candidates.",
        "2CSs have been reported to be one of the most frequent sources of parsing errors (Green and Z?abokrtsky?, 2012; McDonald and Nivre, 2007; Ku?bler et al., 2009; Collins, 2003).",
        "Their impact on quality of dependency-based machine translation can also be substantial; as documented on an English-to-Czech dependency-based translation system (Popel and Z?abokrtsky?, 2009), 39% of serious translation errors which are caused by wrong parsing have to do with coordination.",
        "3There might be no such answer, as different CS conventions might serve best for different applications or for different parser architectures.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes some known problems related to CS.",
        "Section 3 shows possible ?styles?",
        "for representing CS.",
        "Section 4 lists treebanks whose CS conventions we studied.",

        "We proposed a taxonomy of those approaches 19As documented in Zeman et al. (2012), the normalization procedures used in HamleDT embrace many other phenomena as well (not only those related to coordination), and involve both structural transformation and dependency relation relabeling.",
        "20Table 1 shows that Latin and Ancient Greek treebanks have on average more than 6 CSs per 100 tokens, more than 2 conjuncts per CS, and Latin has also the highest number of shared modifiers per CS.",
        "Therefore the percentage of nodes affected by the roundtrip is the highest for these languages and the lower roundtrip UAS is not surprising.",
        "that have been argued for in literature or employed in real treebanks.",
        "We studied 26 existing treebanks of different languages.",
        "For each value of each dimension in Figure 1, we found at least one treebank where the value is used; even so, several treebanks take their own unique path that cannot be clearly classified under the taxonomy (the taxonomy could indeed be extended, for the price of being less clearly arranged).",
        "We discussed the convertibility between the various styles and implemented a universal tool that transforms between any two styles of the taxonomy.",
        "The tool achieves a roundtrip accuracy close to 100%.",
        "This is important because it opens the door to easily switching coordination styles for parsing experiments, phrase-to-dependency conversion etc.",
        "While the focus of this paper is to explore and describe the expressive power of various annotation styles, we did not address the learnability of the styles by parsers.",
        "That will be a complementary point of view, and thus a natural direction of future work for us."
