        "Bilingual sentence alignment is a fundamental task to undertake for the purpose of facilitating many important natural language processing applications such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), bilingual lexicography (Kla-vans et al., 1990), and cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999).",
        "Its objective is to identify correspondences between bilingual sentences in given bitexts.",
        "As summarized by Wu (2010), existing sentence alignment techniques rely mainly on sentence length and bilingual lexical resource.",
        "Approaches based on the former perform effectively on cognate languages but not on the others.",
        "For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo-European languages (Wu, 1994).",
        "Lexicon-based approaches resort to word correspondences in a bilingual lexicon to match bilingual sentences.",
        "A few sentence alignment methods and tools have also been explored to combine the two.",

        "Hunalign (Varga et al., 2005) is another sentence aligner that combines sentence length and a lexicon.",
        "Without a lexicon, it backs off to a length-based algorithm and then automatically derives a lexicon from the alignment result.",
        "Soon after, Ma (2006) develops the lexicon-based aligner Champollion, assuming that different words have different importance in aligning two sentences.",
        "Nevertheless, most existing approaches to sentence alignment follow the monotonicity assumption that coupled sentences in bitexts appear in a similar sequential order in two languages and crossings are not entertained in general (Langlais et al., 1998; Wu, 2010).",
        "Consequently the task of sentence alignment becomes handily solvable by means of such basic techniques as dynamic programming.",
        "In many scenarios, however, this prerequisite monotonicity cannot be guaranteed.",
        "For example, bilingual clauses in legal bitexts are often coordinated in a way not to keep the same clause order, demanding fully or partially crossing pairings.",
        "Figure 1 shows a real excerpt from a legislation corpus.",
        "Such monotonicity seriously impairs the existing alignment approaches founded on the monotonicity assumption.",
        "This paper is intended to explore the problem of non-monotonic alignment within the framework of semisupervised learning.",
        "Our approach is motivated by the above observation and based on the following two assumptions.",

        "The research of sentence alignment originates in the early 1990s.",
        "Gale and Church (1991) and Brown (1991) report the early works using length statistics of bilingual sentences.",
        "The general idea is that the closer two sentences are in length, the more likely they are to align.",
        "A notable difference of their methods is that the former uses sentence",
        "length in number of characters while the latter in number of tokens.",
        "Both use dynamic programming to search for the best alignment.",
        "As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence-length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates.",
        "The subsequent stage of sentence alignment research is accompanied by the advent of a handful of well-designed alignment tools.",
        "Moore (2002) proposes a three-pass procedure to find final alignment.",
        "Its bitext input is initially aligned based on sentence length.",
        "This step generates a set of strictly-selected sentence pairs for use to train an IBM translation model 1 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Its final step realigns the bitext using both sentence length and the discovered word correspondences.",
        "Hunalign (Varga et al., 2005), originally proposed as an ingredient for building parallel corpora, has demonstrated an outstanding performance on sentence alignment.",
        "Like many other aligners, it employs a similar strategy of combining sentence length and lexical data.",
        "In the absence of a lexicon, it first performs an initial alignment wholly relying on sentence length and then automatically builds a lexicon based on this alignment.",
        "Using an available lexicon, it produces a rough translation of the source text by converting each token to the one of its possible counterparts that has the highest frequency in the target corpus.",
        "Then, the relation matrix of a bitext is built of similarity scores for the rough translation and the actual translation at sentence level.",
        "The similarity of two sentences is calculated in terms of their common pairs and length ratio.",
        "To deal with noisy input, Ma (2006) proposes a lexicon-based sentence aligner - Champollion.",
        "Its distinctive feature is that it assigns different weights to words in terms of their tf-idf scores, assuming that words with low sentence frequencies in a text but high occurrences in some local sentences are more indicative of alignment.",
        "Under this assumption, the similarity of any two sentences is calculated accordingly and then a dynamic programming algorithm is applied to produce final alignment.",
        "Following this work, Li et al.",
        "(2010) propose a revised version of Champollion, attempting to improve its speed without performance loss.",
        "For this purpose, the input bitexts are first divided into smaller aligned fragments before applying Champollion to derive finer-grained sentence pairs.",
        "In another related work by Deng et al.",
        "(2007), a generative model is proposed, accompanied by two specific alignment strategies, i.e., dynamic programming and divisive clustering.",
        "Although a non-monotonic search process that tolerates two successive chunks in reverse order is involved, their work is essentially targeted at monotonic alignment."

        "In this paper we have proposed and tested a semisupervised learning approach to non-monotonic sentence alignment by incorporating both monolingual and bilingual consistency.",
        "The utility of monolingual consistency in maintaining the consonance of high-affinity monolingual sentences with their translations has been demonstrated.",
        "This work also exhibits that bilingual consistency of initial alignment of certain quality is useful to boost alignment performance.",
        "Our evaluation using real-world data from a legislation corpus shows that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods significantly when the bitext input is composed of non-monotonic sentences.",
        "Working on partially non-monotonic data, this approach also demonstrates a superior performance.",
        "Although initially proposed for non-monotonic alignment, it works well on monotonic alignment by incorporating the constraint of sentence sequence."
