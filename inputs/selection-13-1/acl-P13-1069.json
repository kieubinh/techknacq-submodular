        "Lemmatisation of word forms is the task of finding base forms (lemmas) for each token in running text.",
        "Typically, it is performed along POS tagging and is considered crucial for many NLP applications.",
        "Similar task may be defined for whole noun phrases (Deg?rski, 2011).",
        "By lemmatisation of noun phrases (NPs) we will understand assigning each NP a grammatically correct NP corresponding to the same phrase that could stand as a dictionary entry.",
        "The task of NP lemmatisation is rarely considered, although it carries great practical value.",
        "For instance, any keyword extraction system that works for a morphologically rich language must deal with lemmatisation of NPs.",
        "This is because keywords are often longer phrases (Turney, 2000), while the user would be confused to see inflected forms as system output.",
        "Similar situation happens when attempting at terminology extraction from domain corpora: it is usually assumed that domain terms are subclass of NPs (Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2013).",
        "In (1) we give an example Polish noun phrase (?the main city of the municipality?).",
        "Throughout the paper we assume the usage of the tagset of the National Corpus of Polish (Przepi?rkowski, 2009), henceforth called NCP in short.",
        "The orthographic form (1a) appears in instrumental case, singular.",
        "Phrase lemma is given as (1b).",
        "Lemmatisation of this phrase consists in reverting case value of the main noun (miasto) as well as its adjective modifier (g?",
        "?wne) to nominative (nom).",
        "Each form in the example is in singular number (sg), miasto has neuter gender (n), gmina is feminine (f).",
        "According to the lemmatisation principles accompanying the NCP tagset, adjectives are lemmatised as masculine forms (g?",
        "?wny), hence it is not sufficient to take word-level lemma nor the orthographic form to obtain phrase lemmatisation.",
        "Deg?rski (2011) discuses some similar cases.",
        "He also notes that this is not an easy task and lemma of a whole NP is rarely a concatenation of lemmas of phrase components.",
        "It is worth stressing that even the task of word-level lemmatisation is non-trivial for inflectional languages due to a large number of inflected forms and even larger number of syncretisms.",
        "According to Przepi?rkowski (2007), ?a typical Polish adjective may have 11 textually different forms (.",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "but as many as 70 different tags (2 numbers ?",
        "7 cases ?",
        "5 genders)?, which indicates the scale of the problem.",
        "What is more, several syntactic phenomena typical for Polish complicate NP lemmatisation further.",
        "E.g., adjectives may both precede and follow nouns they modify; many English prepositional phrases are realised in Polish using oblique case without any proposition (e.g., there is no standard Polish coun",
        "terpart for the preposition of as genitive case is used for this purpose).",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to noun phrase lemmatisation where the main phase is cast as a tagging problem and tackled using a method devised for such problems, namely Conditional Random Fields (CRF)."

        "NP lemmatisation received very little attention.",
        "This situation may be attributed to prevalence of works targeted at English, where the problem is next to trivial due to weak inflection in the language.",
        "The only work that contains a complete description and evaluation of an approach to this task we were able to find is the work of Deg?rski (2011).",
        "The approach consists in incorporating phrase lemmatisation rules into a shallow grammar developed for Polish.",
        "This is implemented by extending the Spejd shallow parsing framework (Buczyn?ski and Przepi?rkowski, 2009) with a rule action that is able to generate phrase lemmas.",
        "Deg?rski assumes that lemma of each NP may be obtained by concatenating each token's orthographic form, lemma or ?half-lemmatised?",
        "form (e.g. grammatical case normalised to nominative, while leaving feminine gender).",
        "The other assumption is to neglect letter case: all phrases are converted to lower case and this is not penalised during evaluation.",
        "For development and evaluation, two subsets of NCP were chosen and manually annotated with NP lemmas: development set (112 phrases) and evaluation set (224 phrases).",
        "Deg?rski notes that the selection was not entirely random: two types of NPs were deliberately omitted, namely foreign names and ?a few groups for which the proper lemmatisation seemed very unclear?.",
        "The final evaluation was performed in two ways.",
        "First, it is shown that the output of the entire system intersects only with 58.5% of the test set.",
        "The high error rate is attributed to problems with identifying NP boundaries correctly (29.5% of test set was not recognised correctly with respect to phrase boundaries).",
        "The other experiment was to limit the evaluation to those NPs whose boundaries were recognised correctly by the grammar (70.5%).",
        "This resulted in 82.9% success rate.",
        "The task of phrase lemmatisation bears a close resemblance to a more popular task, namely lemmatisation of named entities.",
        "Depending on the type of named entities considered, those two may be solved using similar or significantly different methodologies.",
        "One approach, which is especially suitable for person names, assumes that nominative forms may be found in the same source as the inflected forms.",
        "Hence, the main challenge is to define a similarity metric between named entities (Piskorski et al., 2009; Kocon?",
        "and Piasecki, 2012), which can be used to match different mentions of the same names.",
        "Other named entity types may be realised as arbitrary noun phrases.",
        "This calls for more robust lemmatisation strategies.",
        "Piskorski (2005) handles the problem of lemmatisation of Polish named entities of various types by combining specialised gazetteers with lemmatisation rules added to a handwritten grammar.",
        "As he notes, organisation names are often built of noun phrases, hence it is important to understand their internal structure.",
        "Another interesting observation is that such organisation names are often structurally ambiguous, which is exemplified with the phrase (2a), being a string of items in genitive case (?of the main library of the Higher School of Economics?).",
        "Such cases are easier to solve when having access to a collocation dictionary ?",
        "it may be inferred that there are two collocations here: Biblioteka G?",
        "?wna and Wyz?sza Szko?a",
        "While the paper reports detailed figures on named entity recognition performance, the quality of lemmatisation is assessed only for all entity types collectively: ?79.6 of the detected NEs were lemmatised correctly?",
        "(Piskorski, 2005).",
        "3 Phrase lemmatisation as a tagging problem The idea presented here is directly inspired by De-g?rski's observations.",
        "First, we will also assume",
        "that lemma of any NP may be obtained by concatenating simple transformations of word forms that make up the phrase.",
        "As we will show in Sec. 4, this assumption is virtually always satisfied.",
        "We will argue that there is a small finite set of inflectional transformations that are sufficient to lemmatise nearly every Polish NP.",
        "Consider example (1) again.",
        "Correct lemmatisation of the phrase may be obtained by applying a series of simple inflectional transformations to each of its words.",
        "The first two words need to be turned into nominative forms, the last one is already lemmatised.",
        "This is depicted in (3a).",
        "To show the real setting, this time we give full NCP tags and word-level lemmas assigned as a result of tagging.",
        "In the NCP tagset, the first part of each tag denotes grammatical class (adj stands for adjective, subst for noun).",
        "Adjectives are also specified for degree (pos ?",
        "positive degree).",
        "matised phrase, the desired tags (tags that would be attached to tokens of the lemmatised phrase) and the transformations needed to obtain lemma from orthographic forms.",
        "The notation cas=nom means that to obtain the desired form (e.g.",
        "g?",
        "?wne) you need to find an entry in a morphological dictionary that bears the same word-level lemma as the inflected form (g?",
        "?wny) and a tag that results from taking the tag of the inflected form (adj:sg:inst:n:pos) and setting the value of the tagset attribute cas (grammatical case) to the value nom (nominative).",
        "The transformation labelled = means that the inflected form is already equal to the desired part of the lemma, hence no transformation is needed.",
        "A tagset note is in order.",
        "In the NCP tagset each tag may be decomposed into grammatical class and attribute values, where the choice of applicable attributes depends on the grammatical class.",
        "For instance, nouns are specified for number, gender and case.",
        "This assumption is important for our approach to be able to use simple tag transformations in the form replace the value of attribute A with the new value V (A=V).",
        "This is not a serious limitation, since the same assumption holds for most tagsets developed for inflectional languages, e.g., the whole MULTEXT-East family (Erjavec, 2012), Czech tagset (Jakub?c?ek et al., 2011).",
        "Our idea is simple: by expressing phrase lemmatisation in terms of word-level transformations we can reduce the task to tagging problem and apply well known Machine Learning techniques that have been devised for solving such problems (e.g. CRF).",
        "An important advantage is that this allows to rely not only on the information contained within the phrase to be lemmatised, but also on tokens belonging to its local neighbourhood.",
        "Assuming that we have already trained a statistical model, we need to perform the following steps to obtain lemmatisation of a new text:",
        "1.",
        "POS tagging, 2.",
        "NP chunking, 3. tagging with transformations by applying the trained model, 4. application of transformations to obtain NP lemmas (using a morphological dictionary to generate forms).",
        "To train the statistical model, we need training data labelled with such transformations.",
        "Probably the most reliable way to obtain such data would be to let annotators manually encode a training corpus with such transformations.",
        "However, the task would be extremely tedious and the annotators would probably have to undergo special training (to be able to think in terms of transformations).",
        "We decided for a simpler solution.",
        "The annotators were given a simpler task of assigning each NP instance a lemma and a heuristic procedure was used to induce transformations by matching the manually annotated lemmas to phrases?",
        "orthographic forms using a morphological dictionary.",

        "We decided to perform the experiments using the data from Polish Corpus of Wroc?aw Univer",
        "sity of Technology1 (Broda et al., 2012).",
        "The corpus (abbreviated to KPWr from now on) contains manual shallow syntactic annotation which includes NP chunks and their syntactic heads.",
        "The main motivation to use this corpus was its very permissive licence (Creative Commons Attribution), which will not constrain any further use of the tools developed.",
        "What is more, it allowed us to release the data annotated manually with phrase lemmas and under the same licence2.",
        "One of the assumptions of KPWr annotation is that actual noun phrases and prepositional phrases are labelled collectively as NP chunks.",
        "To obtain real noun phrases, phrase-initial prepositions must be stripped off3.",
        "For practical reasons we decided to include automatic recognition of phrase-initial prepositions into our model: we introduced a special transformation for such cases (labelled p), having the interpretation that the token belongs to a phrase-initial preposition and should be discarded when generating phrase lemma.",
        "Prepositions are usually contained in single tokens.",
        "There are some cases of multi-word units which we treat as prepositions (secondary prepositions), e.g. ze wzgle?du na (with respect to).",

        "baseline, other transformations were substituted with ?lem?.",
        "The results of the full evaluation are presented in Tab.",
        "2.",
        "The first conclusion is that the figures are disappointingly low, but comparable with the 58.5% success rate reported in (Deg?rski, 2011).",
        "The other observation is that the proposed solution significantly outperforms both baseline, out of which the ?take-orthographic-form?",
        "(orth baseline) performs slightly better.",
        "Also, it turns out that the variation of the matching procedure using the ?lem?",
        "transformation (row labelled CRF lem) performs slightly worse than the procedure without this transformation (row CRF nolem).",
        "This supports the suspicion that relying on word-level lemmas may reduce the ability to generalise.",
        "Results corresponding to performance of the lemmatisation module alone are reported in Tab.",
        "3.",
        "The test has been performed using chunk boundaries and locations of syntactic heads taken from the reference corpus.",
        "In this settings recall and precision have the same interpretation, hence we simply refer to the value as accuracy (percentage of chunks that were lemmatised correctly).",
        "The figures are considerably higher than those reported in Tab.",
        "2, which shows the huge impact of chunking errors.",
        "It is worth noting that the best accuracy achieved is only slightly lower than that achieved by Deg?rski (82.9%), while our task is harder.",
        "As mentioned above, in Deg?rski's setting, the phrases that are too hard to parse are excluded from the test set.",
        "Those phrases are also likely to be hard cases for lemmatisation.",
        "The other important difference stems from phrase definitions used in both corpora; NPs in NCP are generally shorter than the chunks allowed in KPWr.",
        "Most notably, KPWr allows the inclusion of PP modifiers within NP chunks (Broda et al., 2012).",
        "It seems likely that the proposed algorithm would performed better when trained on data from NCP which assumes simpler NP definition.",
        "Note that the complex NP definition in KPWr also explains the huge gap between results of lemmatisation alone and lemmatisation including chunking errors.",
        "We also checked the extent to which the entries unknown to the morphological dictionary could lower the performance of lemmatisation.",
        "It turned out that only 8 words couldn't be transformed during evaluation due to lack of the entries that",
        "were sought in the morphological dictionary, out of which 5 were anyway handled correctly in the end by using the simple heuristic to output the ?=?",
        "transformation when everything else fails.",
        "A rudimentary analysis of lemmatiser output indicates that the most common error is the assignment of the orthographic form as phrase lemma where something else was expected.",
        "This seems to concern mostly many NPs that are left in plural, even simple ones (e.g. audycje telewizyjne ?TV programmes?",
        "), but there are also some cases of personal pronouns left in oblique case (was ?you-pl-accusative/genitive?).",
        "It seems that a part of these cases come from tagging errors (even if the correct transformation is obtained, the results of its application depend on the tag and lemma attached to the inflected form by the tagger).",
        "Not surprisingly, proper names are hard cases for the model (e.g. Pod Napie?ciem was lemmatised to napie?cie, which would be correct weren't it a title)."

        "We presented a novel approach to lemmatisation of Polish noun phrases.",
        "The main advantage of this solution is that it allows to separate the lemmatisation phrase from the chunking phrase.",
        "Deg?rski's rule-based approach (Deg?rski, 2011) was also built on top of an existing parser but, as he notes, to improve the lemmatisation accuracy, the grammar underlying the parser should actually be rewritten with lemmatisation in mind.",
        "The other advantage of the approach presented here is that it is able to learn from a corpus containing manually assigned phrase lemmas.",
        "Extending existing chunk-annotated corpora with phrase lemmas corresponds to a relatively simple annotation task.",
        "The performance figures obtained by our algorithm are comparable with that of Deg?rski's grammar, while the conditions under which our system was evaluated were arguably less favourable.",
        "To enable a better comparison it would be desirable to evaluate our approach against the phrases from NCP.",
        "The main disadvantage of the approach lies in the data preparation stage.",
        "It requires some semi-manual work to obtain labelling with transformations, which is language-and tagset-dependent.",
        "A very interesting alternative has been suggested by an anonymous reviewer: instead of considering tag-level transformations that require an exhaustive morphological dictionary, it would be simpler to rely entirely on string-to-string transformations that map inflected forms to their expected counterparts.",
        "Such transformations may be expressed in terms of simple edit scripts, which has already been successfully applied to word-level lemmatisation of Polish and other languages (Chrupa?a et al., 2008).",
        "This way, the training data labelled with transformations could be obtained automatically.",
        "What is more, application of such transformations also does not depend on the dictionary.",
        "It is not obvious how this would affect the performance of the module and, hence, needs to be evaluated.",
        "We plan this as our further work.",
        "Also, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the presented solution for other Slavic languages."
