        "In recent years, much work has been devoted to the improvement of word segmentation in a variety of ways.",
        "Typical approaches include the introduction of global training or complicated features (Zhang and Clark, 2007; Zhang and Clark, 2010), the investigation of word internal structures (Zhao, 2009; Li, 2011), the adjustment or adaptation of word segmentation standards (Wu, 2003; Gao et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009), the integrated solution of segmentation and related tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing (Zhou and Su, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Fung et al., 2004; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008), and the strategies of hybrid or stacked modeling (Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007; Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Sun, 2011b).",
        "In parsing, Pereira and Schabes (1992) proposed an extended inside-outside algorithm that infers the parameters of a stochastic CFG from a partially parsed treebank.",
        "It uses partial bracketing information to improve parsing performance, but it is specific to constituency parsing, and its computational complexity makes it impractical for massive natural annotations in web text.",
        "There are also work making use of word co-occurrence statistics collected in raw text or Internet n-grams to improve parsing performance (Nakov and Hearst, 2005; Pitler et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011; Bansal and Klein, 2011).",
        "When enriching the related work during writing, we found a work on dependency parsing (Spitkovsky et al., 2010) who utilized parsing constraints derived from hypertext annotations to improve the unsupervised dependency grammar induction.",
        "Compared with their method, the strategy we proposed is formal and universal, the discriminative learning strategy and the quantitative measurement of fuzzy knowledge enable more effective utilization of the natural annotation on the Internet when adapted to parsing."

        "We will also investigate more efficient algorithms to leverage more massive web text with natural annotations, and further extend the strategy to other NLP problems such as named entity recognition and parsing."
