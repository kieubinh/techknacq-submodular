        "Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are two critical and necessary initial procedures with respect to the majority of high-level Chinese language processing tasks such as syntax parsing, information extraction and machine translation.",
        "The traditional way of segmentation and tagging is performed in a pipeline approach, first segmenting a sentence into words, and then assigning each word a POS tag.",
        "The pipeline approach is very simple to implement, but frequently causes error propagation, given that wrong segmentations in the earlier stage harm the subsequent POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004).",
        "The joint approaches of word segmentation and POS tagging (joint S&T) are proposed to resolve these two tasks simultaneously.",
        "They effectively alleviate the error propagation, because segmentation and tagging have strong interaction, given that most segmentation ambiguities cannot be resolved without considering the surrounding grammatical constructions encoded in a POS sequence (Qian and Liu, 2012).",
        "In the past years, several proposed supervised joint models (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Jiang et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010) achieved reasonably accurate results, but the outstanding problem among these models is that they rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data, i.e., segmented texts with POS tags.",
        "However, the production of such labeled data is extremely time-consuming and expensive (Jiao et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2009).",
        "Therefore, semi-supervised joint S&T appears to be a natural solution for easily incorporating accessible unlabeled data to improve the joint S&T model.",
        "This study focuses on using a graph-based label propagation method to build a semi-supervised joint S&T model.",
        "Graph-based label propagation methods have recently shown they can outperform the state-of-the-art in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks, e.g., POS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), shallow semantic parsing for unknown predicate (Das and Smith, 2011).",
        "As far as we know, however, these methods have not yet been applied to resolve the problem of joint Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and POS tagging.",
        "Motivated by the works in (Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and Smith, 2011), for structured problems, graph-based label propagation can be employed to infer valuable syntactic information (n-gram-level label distributions) from labeled data to unlabeled data.",
        "This study extends this intuition to construct a similarity graph for propagating trigram-level label distributions.",
        "The derived label distributions are regarded as prior knowledge to regularize the learning of a sequential model, conditional random fields (CRFs) in this case, on both",
        "labeled and unlabeled data to achieve the semi-supervised learning.",
        "The approach performs the incorporation of the derived labeled distributions by manipulating a ?virtual evidence?",
        "function as described in (Li, 2009).",
        "Experiments on the data from the Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research (MSR) show that the proposed model results in significant improvement over other comparative candidates in terms of F-score and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recall.",
