        "The phrase-based approach (Koehn et al., 2003) to machine translation (MT) has transformed MT from a narrow research topic into a truly useful technology to end users.",
        "Leading translation systems (Chiang, 2007; Koehn et al., 2007; Marcu et al., 2006) all use some kind of multi-word translation unit, which allows translations to be produced from large canned units of text from the training corpus.",
        "Larger phrases allow for the lexical context to be considered in choosing the translation, and also limit the number of reordering decisions required to produce a full translation.",
        "Word-based translation models (Brown et al., 1993) remain central to phrase-based model training, where they are used to infer word-level alignments from sentence aligned parallel data, from which phrasal translation units are extracted using a heuristic.",
        "Although this approach demonstrably works, it suffers from a number of shortcomings.",
        "Firstly, many phrase-based phenomena which do not decompose into word translations (e.g., idioms) will be missed, as the underlying word-based alignment model is unlikely to propose the correct alignments.",
        "Secondly, the relationship between different phrase-pairs is not considered, such as between single word translations and larger multi-word phrase-pairs or where one large phrase-pair subsumes another.",
        "This paper develops a phrase-based translation model which aims to address the above shortcomings of the phrase-based translation pipeline.",
        "Specifically, we formulate translation using inverse transduction grammar (ITG), and seek to learn an ITG from parallel corpora.",
        "The novelty of our approach is that we develop a Bayesian prior over the grammar, such that a nontermi-nal becomes a ?cache?",
        "learning each production and its complete yield, which in turn is recursively composed of its child constituents.",
        "This is closely related to adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007a), which also generate full tree rewrites in a monolingual setting.",
        "Our model learns translations of entire sentences while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations.",
        "The model is richly parameterised, such that it can describe phrase-based phenomena while also explicitly modelling the relationships between phrase-pairs and their component expansions, thus ameliorating the disconnect between the treatment of words versus phrases in the current MT pipeline.",
        "We develop a Bayesian approach using a Pitman-Yor process prior, which is capable of modelling a diverse range of geometrically decaying distributions over infinite event spaces (here translation phrase-pairs), an approach shown to be state of the art for language modelling (Teh, 2006).",
        "We are not the first to consider this idea; Neu-big et al. (2011) developed a similar approach for learning an ITG using a form of Pitman-Yor adaptor grammar.",
        "However Neubig et al's work was flawed in a number of respects, most notably in terms of their heuristic beam sampling algorithm which does not meet either of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo criteria of ergodicity or detailed balance.",
        "Consequently their approach does not constitute a valid Bayesian model.",
        "In contrast, this paper provides a more rigorous and theoretically sound method.",
        "Moreover our approach results in consistent translation improvements across a number of translation tasks compared to Neubig et al's method, and a competitive phrase-based baseline."

        "?, generate their symbols in the reverse order in the target language.",
        "In the context of machine translation, ITG has been explored for statistical word alignment in both unsupervised (Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Pauls et al., 2010) and supervised (Haghighi et al., 2009; Cherry and Lin, 2006) settings, and for decoding (Petrov et al., 2008).",
        "Our paper fits into the recent line of work for jointly inducing the phrase table and word alignment (DeNero and Klein, 2010; Neubig et al., 2011).",
        "The work of DeNero and Klein (2010) presents a supervised approach to this problem, whereas our work is unsupervised hence more closely related to Neubig et al. (2011) which we describe in detail below.",
        "A number of other approaches have been developed for learning phrase-based models from bilingual data, starting with Marcu and Wong (2002) who developed an extension to IBM model 1 to handle multi-word units.",
        "This pioneering approach suffered from intractable inference and moreover, suffers from degenerate solutions (DeNero and Klein, 2010).",
        "Our approach is similar to these previous works, except that we impose additional constraints on how phrase-pairs can be tiled to produce a sentence pair, and moreover, we seek to model the embedding of phrase-pairs in one another, something not considered by this prior work.",
        "Another strand of related research is in estimating a broader class of synchronous grammars than ITGs, such as SCFGs (Blunsom et al., 2009b; Levenberg et al., 2012).",
        "Conceptually, our work could be readily adapted to general SCFGs using similar techniques.",
        "This work was inspired by adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007a), a monolingual grammar formalism whereby a non-terminal rewrites in a single step as a complete subtree.",
        "The model prior allows for trees to be generated as a mixture of a cache and a base adaptor grammar.",
        "In our case, we have generalised to a bilingual setting using an ITG.",
        "Additionally, we have extended the model to allow recursive nesting of adapted non-terminals, such that we end up with an infinitely recursive formulation where the top-level and base distributions are explicitly linked together.",
        "As mentioned above, ours is not the first work attempting to generalise adaptor grammars for machine translation; (Neubig et al., 2011) also developed a similar approach based around ITG using a Pitman-Yor Process prior.",
        "Our approach improves upon theirs in terms of the model and inference, and critically, this is borne out in our experiments where we show uniform improvements in translation quality over a baseline system, as compared to their almost entirely negative results.",
        "We believe that their approach had a number of flaws: For inference they use a beam-search, which may speed up processing but means that they are no longer sampling from the true distribution, nor a distribution with the same support as the posterior.",
        "Moreover they include a Metropolis-Hastings correction step, which is required to correct the samples to account for repeated substructures which will be otherwise underrepresented.",
        "Consequently their approach does not constitute a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, but rather a complex heuristic.",
        "The other respect in which this work differs from Neubig et al. (2011) is in terms of model formulation.",
        "They develop an ITG which generates phrase-pairs as terminals, while we employ a more restrictive word-based model which forces the decomposition of every phrase-pair.",
        "This is an important restriction as it means that we jointly learn",
        "a word and phrase based model, such that word based phenomena can affect the phrasal structures.",
        "Finally our approach models separately the three different types of ITG production (monotone, swap and lexical emission), allowing for a richer parameterisation which the model exploits by learning different hyper-parameter values."

        "Similar patterns are seen in the monotone rules, along with some common canned phrases.",
        "Note that ?in Iraq?",
        "appears twice, once as an inversion in UR-EN and another time in monotone order for AR-EN.",
        "Secondly, we analyse the values learned for the model hyper-parameters; Figure 4.",
        "(a) shows the posterior distribution over the hyper-parameter values.",
        "There is very little spread in the inferred values, suggesting the sampling chains may have converged.",
        "Furthermore, there is a large difference between the learned hyper-parameters for the monotone rules versus the swap rules.",

        "Specifically, as the discount a or the concentration b parameters increases we expect for a relative increase in the number of types.",
        "If the number of observed monotone and swap rules were equal, then there would be a higher chance in reusing the monotone rules.",
        "However, the number of observed monotone and swap rules are not equal, as plotted in Figure 4.(b).",
        "Similar results were observed for the other language pairs (figures omitted for space reasons).",
        "Thirdly, we performed a manual evaluation for the quality of the phrase-pairs learned exclusively by our method vs pialign.",
        "For each method, we considered the top-100 high frequency phrase-pairs which are specific to that method.",
        "Then we asked a bilingual human expert to identify reasonably well phrase-pairs among these top-100 phrase-pairs.",
        "The results are summarized in Table 5, and show that we learn roughly twice as many reasonably good phrase-pairs for AR-EN and FA-EN compared to pialign.",
        "Conclusions We have presented a novel method for learning a phrase-based model of translation directly from parallel data which we have framed as learning an inverse transduction grammar (ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior.",
        "This has led to a model which learns translations of entire sentences, while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations.",

        "Our experiments on Urdu-English, Arabic-English, and Farsi-English translation tasks all demonstrate improvements over competitive baseline systems."
