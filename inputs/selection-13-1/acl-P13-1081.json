        "In addition, the pro-drop problem can also degrade the word alignment quality in the training data.",

        "would have been aligned with the dropped-pro (cf.",

        "Since empty categories do not exist in the surface form of a language, they are often deemed elusive and recovering ECs is even figuratively called ?chasing the ghost?",
        "(Yang and Xue, 2010).",
        "In this work we demonstrate that, with the availability of large-scale EC annotations, it is feasible to predict and recover ECs with high accuracy.",
        "More importantly, with various approaches of modeling the recovered ECs in SMT, we are able to achieve significant improvements1.",

        "Our effort of recovering ECs is a two-step process: first, at training time, ECs in the Chinese Treebank are moved and preserved in the portion of the tree structures pertaining to surface words only.",
        "Original ECs and their subtrees are then deleted without loss of information; second, a model is trained on transformed trees to predict and recover ECs.",
        "Empty categories heavily depend on syntactic tree structure.",

        "To facilitate presentation, we first distinguish a solid vs. an empty non-terminal node.",
        "A non-terminal node is solid if and only if it contains at least one child node that spans one or more surface words (as opposed to an EC); accordingly, an empty node is a non-terminal node that spans only ECs.",
        "In the left half of Figure 2, the NP node that is the immediate child of IP has only one child node spanning an EC ?",
        "(-NONE- *pro*), and is thus an empty node; while all other non-terminal nodes have at least one surface word as their child and are thus all solid nodes.",
        "We decide to attach an EC to its lowest solid ancestor node.",
        "That is, the EC is moved up to the first solid node in the syntactic tree.",
        "After ECs are attached, all empty nodes and ECs are deleted from the tree.",
        "In order to uniquely recover ECs, we also need to encode the position information.",
        "To this end, the relative child index of an EC is affixed to the EC tag.",
        "Take the NP node spanning the *pro* in Figure 2 as an example, the *pro* is moved to the lowest solid ancestor, IP node, and its position is encoded by @1 since the deleted NP is the second child of the IP node (we use 0 based indices).",
        "With this transformation, we are able to recover not only the position of an EC, but its type as well.",
        "A special tag NULL is attached to non-terminal nodes without EC.",

        "We believe this is one of the reasons why our model has better accuracy than that of (Yang and Xue, 2010) (cf. Table 7).",
        "In summary, a projected tag consists of an EC type (such as *pro*) and the EC's position information.",

        "On top of that, adding sparse features helps by another 0.3 on newswire and 0.2 to 0.4 on weblog.",
        "Overall, the Hiero and tree-to-string systems are improved by about 1 point for newswire and 0.4 to 0.7 for weblog.",

        "Empty categories have been studied in recent years for several languages, mostly in the context of reference resolution and syntactic processing for English, such as in (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Gabbard et al., 2006).",
        "More recently, EC recovery for Chinese started emerging in literature.",
        "In (Guo et al., 2007), non-local dependencies are migrated from English to Chinese for generating proper predicate-argument-modifier structures from surface context free phrase structure trees.",
        "In (Zhao and Ng, 2007), a decision tree learning algorithm is presented to identify and resolve Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns.",
        "and achieves a performance comparable to a heuristic rule-based approach.",
        "Similar to the work in (Dienes and Dubey, 2003), empty detection is formulated as a tagging problem in (Yang and Xue, 2010), where each word in the sentence receives a tag indicating whether there is an EC before it.",
        "A maximum entropy model is utilized to predict the tags, but different types of ECs are not distinguished.",
        "In (Cai et al., 2011), a language-independent method was proposed to integrate the recovery of empty elements into syntactic parsing.",
        "As shown in the previous section, our model outperforms the model in (Yang and Xue, 2010) and (Cai et al., 2011) significantly using the same training and test data.",
        "(Luo and Zhao, 2011) also tries to predict the existence of an EC in Chinese sentences, but the ECs in the middle of a tree constituent are lumped into a single position and are not uniquely recoverable.",
        "There exists only a handful of previous work on applying ECs explicitly to machine translation so far.",
        "One of them is the work reported in (Chung and Gildea, 2010), where three approaches are compared, based on either pattern matching, CRF, or parsing.",
        "However, there is no comparison between using gold trees and automatic trees.",
        "There also exist a few major differences on the MT part between our work and theirs.",
        "First, in addition to the preprocessing of training data and inserting recovered empty categories, we implement sparse features to further boost the performance, and tune the feature weights directly towards maximizing the machine translation metric.",
        "Second, there is no discussion on the quality of word alignment in (Chung and Gildea, 2010), while we show the alignment improvement on a hand-aligned set.",
        "Last, they use a phase-based system trained on only 60K sentences, while we conduct experiments on more advanced Hiero and tree-to-string systems, trained on 2M sentences in a much larger corpus.",
        "We directly take advantage of the augmented parse trees in the tree-to-string grammar, which could have larger impact on the MT system performance."

        "In this paper, we presented a novel structured approach to EC prediction, which utilizes a maximum entropy model with various syntactic features and shows significantly higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "We also applied the predicted ECs to a large-scale Chinese-to-English machine translation task and achieved significant improvement over two strong MT base",
        "lines, i.e. a hierarchical phase-based system and a tree-to-string syntax-based system.",
        "More work remain to be done next to further take advantages of ECs.",
        "For example, the recovered ECs can be encoded in a forest as the input to the MT decoder and allow the decoder to pick the best MT output based on various features in addition to the sparse features we proposed in this work.",
        "Many promising approaches can be explored in the future."
