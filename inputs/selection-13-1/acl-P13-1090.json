        "It can efficiently handle semantic ambiguity by extending standard topic models with two new features.",
        "First, it encodes word n-gram features from labeled source and unlabeled target data.",
        "Second, by going beyond a bag-of-words approach, it takes into account the inherent sequential nature of utterances to learn semantic classes based on context.",
        "(ii) Retrospective Learner is a new learning technique that adapts to the unlabeled target data.",

        "Semantic tagging is used in natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize words of semantic importance in an utterance, such as entities.",
        "Typically, a semantic tagging model require large amount of domain specific data to achieve good performance (Tur and DeMori, 2011).",
        "This requires a tedious and time intensive data collection and labeling process.",
        "In the absence of large labeled training data, the tagging model can behave poorly on test data (target domain).",
        "This is usually caused by data mismatch issues and lack of coverage that arise when the target data does not match the training data.",
        "To deal with these issues, we present a new semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach, which mainly has two components.",
        "It initially starts with training supervised Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the source training data which has been semantically tagged.",
        "Using the trained model, it decodes unlabeled dataset from the target domain.",
        "With the data mismatch issues in mind, to correct errors that the supervised model make on the target data, the SSL model leverages the additional information by way of a new clustering method.",
        "Our first contribution is a new probabilistic topic model, Markov Topic Regression (MTR), which uses rich features to capture the degree of association between words and semantic tags.",
        "First, it encodes the n-gram context features from the labeled source data and the unlabeled target data as prior information to learn semantic classes based on context.",
        "Thus, each latent semantic class corresponds to one of the semantic tags found in labeled data.",
        "MTR is not invariant to reshuffling of words due to its Markovian property; hence, word-topic assignments are also affected by the topics of the surrounding words.",
        "Because of these properties, MTR is less sensitive to the errors caused by the semantic ambiguities.",
        "Our SSL uses MTR to smooth the semantic tag posteriors on the unlabeled target data (decoded using the CRF model) and later obtains the best tag sequences.",
        "Using the labeled source and automati",
        "cally labeled target data, it retrains a new CRF-model.",
        "Although our iterative SSL learning model can deal with the training and test data mismatch, it neglects the performance effects caused by adapting the source domain to the target domain.",
        "In fact, most SSL methods used for adaptation, e.g., (Zhu, 2005), (Daume?-III, 2010), (Subramanya et al., 2010), etc., do not emphasize this issue.",
        "With this in mind, we introduce a new iterative training algorithm, Retrospective Learning, as our second contribution.",
        "While retrospective learning iteratively trains CRF models with the automatically annotated target data (explained above), it keeps track of the errors of the previous iterations so as to carry the properties of both the source and target domains.",
        "In short, through a series of experiments we show how MTR clustering provides additional information to SSL on the target domain utterances, and greatly impacts semantic tagging performance.",
        "Specifically, we analyze MTR's performance on two different types of semantic tags: named-entities and descriptive tags as shown in Table 1.",
        "Our experiments show that it is much harder to detect descriptive tags compared to named-entities.",
        "Our SSL approach uses probabilistic clustering method tailored for tagging natural language utterances.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore the unlabeled data to iteratively adapt the semantic tagging models for target domains, preserving information from the previous iterations.",
        "With the hope of spurring related work in domains such as entity detection, syntactic tagging, etc., we extend the earlier work on SSL part-of-speech (POS) tagging and show in the experiments that our approach is not only useful for semantic tagging but also syntactic tagging.",
        "The remainder of this paper is divided as follows: ?2 gives background on SSL and semantic clustering methods, ?3 describes our new clustering approach, ?4 presents the new iterative learning, ?5 presents our experimental results and ?6 concludes our paper."

        "(II) Semantic Clustering.",
        "A common property of several context-based word clustering techniques, e.g., Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992), Clustering by Committee (Pantel, 2003), etc., is that they mainly cluster based on local context such as nearby words.",
        "Standard topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), use a bag-of-words approach, which disregards word order and clusters words together that appear in a similar global context.",
        "Such models have been effective in discovering lexicons in many NLP tasks, e.g., named-entity recognition (Guo et al., 2009), word-sense disambiguation (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010), syntactic/semantic parsing (Griffiths et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2010), speaker identification (Nyugen et al., 2012), etc.",
        "Recent topic models consider word sequence information in documents (Griffiths et al., 2005; Moon et al., 2010).",
        "The Hidden Topic Markov Model (HTMM) by (Gruber et al., 2005), for instance, models sentences in documents as Markov chains, assuming all words in a sentence have the same topic.",
        "While MTR has a similar Markovian property, we encode features on words to allow each word in an utterance to sample from any of the given semantic tags, as in ?what are [scary]genre movies by [Hitchcock]director??.",
        "In LDA, common words tend to dominate all topics causing related words to end up in different topics.",
        "In (Petterson et al., 2010), the vector-based features of words are used as prior information in LDA so that the words that are synonyms end up in same topic.",
        "Thus, we build a semantically rich topic model, MTR, using word context features as side information.",
        "Using a smoothing prior for each word-topic pair (instead of a constant ?",
        "smoother), MTR assures that the words are distributed over topics based on how similar they are.",
        "(e.g., ?scary?",
        "and ?spooky?, which have similar context features, go into the same semantic tag, ?genre?).",
