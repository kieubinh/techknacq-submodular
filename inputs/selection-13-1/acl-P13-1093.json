        "These evaluations are performed using a novel set of syntactic features, including measures of complexity.",
        "Our results show that sentence length, the mean number of clauses per utterance, and the Stajner-Mitkov measure of complexity are highly informative syntactic features, that classification accuracy varies greatly by the age of the speaker, and that accuracy up to 91.7% can be achieved by support vector machines given a sufficient amount of data."

        "The challenge of disambiguating between truth and deception is critical in determining the admissibility of court testimony.",
        "Unfortunately, the testimony of maltreated children is often not admitted in court due to concerns about truthfulness since children can be instructed to deny transgressions or misled to elicit false accusations (Lyon and Dorado, 2008).",
        "However, the child is often the only witness of the transgression (Undeutsch, 2008); automatically determining truthfulness in such situations is therefore a paramount goal so that justice may be served effectively."

        "Research in the detection of deception in adult speech has included analyses of verbal and non-verbal cues such as behavioral changes, facial expression, speech dysfluencies, and cognitive complexity (DePaulo et al., 2003).",
        "Despite statistically significant predictors of deception such as shorter talking time, fewer semantic details, and less coherent statements, DePaulo et al. (2003) found that the median effect size is very small.",
        "Deception without special motivation (e.g., everyday ?white lies?)",
        "exhibited almost no discernible cues of deception.",
        "However, analysis of moderating factors showed that cues were significantly more numerous and salient when lies were about transgressions.",
        "Literature on deception in children is relatively limited.",
        "In one study, Lewis et al. (1989) studied 3-year-olds and measured behavioral cues, such as facial expression and nervous body movement, before and after the elicitation of a lie.",
        "Verbal responses consisted of yes/no answers.",

        "However, verbal cues of deception were not analyzed.",
        "Crucially, Lewis et al. (1989) showed that humans are no more accurate in deciphering truth from deception in child speech than in adult speech, being only about 50% accurate.",
        "More recently, researchers have used linguistic features to identify deception.",
        "Newman et al. (2003) inferred deception in transcribed, typed, and handwritten text by identifying features of linguistic style such as the use of personal pronouns",
        "and exclusive words (e.g., but, except, without).",
        "These features were obtained with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool and used in a logistic regression classifier which achieved, on average, 61% accuracy on test data.",
        "Feature analysis showed that deceptive stories were characterized by fewer self-references, more negative emotion words, and lower cognitive complexity, compared to non-deceptive language.",
        "Another recent stylometric experiment in automatic identification of deception was performed by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009).",
        "The authors used a dataset of truthful and deceptive typed responses produced by adult subjects on three different topics, collected through the Amazon Mechanical Turk service.",
        "Two classifiers, Na?",
        "?ve Bayes (NB) and a support vector machine (SVM), were applied on the tokenized and stemmed statements to obtain best classification accuracies of 70% (abortion topic, NB), 67.4% (death penalty topic, NB), and 77% (friend description, SVM), where the baseline was taken to be 50%.",
        "The large variability of classifier performance based on the topic of deception suggests that performance is context-dependent.",
        "The authors note this as well by demonstrating significantly lower results of 59.8% for NB and 57.8% for SVM when cross-topic classification is performed by training each classifier on two topics and testing on the third.",
        "The Mihalcea-Strapparava mturk dataset was further used in a study by Feng et al. (2012) which employs lexicalized and unlexicalized production rules to obtain deep syntactic features.",
        "The cross-validation accuracy obtained on the three topics was improved to 77% (abortion topic), 71.5% (death penalty topic), and 85% (friend description).",
        "The results nevertheless varied with topic.",
        "Another experiment using syntactic features for identifying sentences containing uncertain or unreliable information was conducted by Zheng et al. (2010) on an adult-produced dataset of abstracts and full articles from BioScope, and on paragraphs from Wikipedia.",
        "The results demonstrated that using syntactic dependency features extracted with the Stanford parser improved performance on the biological dataset, while an ensemble classifier combining a conditional random field (CRF) and a MaxEnt classifier performed better than individual classifiers on the Wikipedia dataset.",
        "A meta-analysis of features used in deception detection was performed by Hauch et al. (2012) and revealed that verbal cues based on lexical categories extracted using the LIWC tool show statistically significant, though small, differences between truth-and lie-tellers.",
        "Vartapetiance and Gillam (2012) surveyed existing cues to verbal deception and demonstrated that features in LIWC are not indicative of deception in online content, recommending that the features used to identify deception and the thresholds between deception and truth be based on the specific data set.",
        "In the speech community, analysis of deceptive speech has combined various acoustic, prosodic, and lexical features (Hirschberg et al., 2005).",
        "Gra-ciarena et al. (2006) combined two independent systems ?",
        "an acoustic Gaussian mixture model based on Mel cepstral features, and a prosodic support vector machine based on features such as pitch, energy, and duration ?",
        "and achieved an accuracy of 64.4% on a test subset of the Columbia-SRI-Colorado (CSC) corpus of deceptive and non-deceptive speech (Hirschberg et al., 2005).",
        "While previous studies have achieved some promising results in detecting deception with lexical, acoustic, and prosodic features, syntax remains relatively unexplored compared to LIWC-based features.",
        "Syntactic complexity as a cue to deception is consistent with literature in social psychology which suggests that emotion suppression (e.g., inhibition of guilt and fear) consumes cognitive resources, which can influence the underlying complexity of utterances (Richards and Gross, 1999; Richards and Gross, 2000).",
        "Additionally, the use of syntactic features is motivated by their successful use on adult-produced datasets for detecting deceptive or uncertain utterances (Feng et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010), as well as in other applications, such as the evaluation of changes in text complexity (Stajner and Mitkov, 2012), the identification of personality in conversation and text (Mairesse et al., 2007), and the detection of dementia through syntactic changes in writing (Le et al., 2011).",
        "Past work has focused on identifying deceptive speech produced by adults.",
        "The problem of determining validity of child testimony in high-stakes child abuse court cases motivates the analysis of child-produced deceptive language.",
        "Further, the use of binary classification schemes in previous work does not account for partial truths often encountered in real-life scenarios.",
        "Due to the rarity of real deceptive data, studies typically use arti",
        "ficially produced deceptive language which falls unambiguously in one of two classes: complete truth or complete deception (Newman et al., 2003; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009).",
        "Studies which make use of real high-stakes courtroom data containing partial truths, such as the Italian DECOUR corpus analyzed by Fornaciari and Poesio (2012), preprocess the dataset to eliminate any partially truthful utterances.",
        "Since utterances of this kind are common in real language, their elimination from the dataset is not ideal.",
        "The present study evaluates the viability of a novel set of 17 syntactic features as markers of deception in five classifiers.",
        "Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first application of automatic deception detection to a real-life dataset of deceptive speech produced by maltreated children.",

        "Features are selected in mRMR by minimizing redundancy (i.e., the average mutual information between features) and maximizing the relevance (i.e., the mutual information between the given features and the class) (Peng et al., 2005).",
        "This approach selects five features: verb phrases per T-unit (VP/T), passive sentences (PAS), coordinate phrases per clause (CP/C), sentence complexity (COM), and complex nominals per clause (CN/C).",

        "While past research has used logistic regression as a binary classifier (Newman et al., 2003), our experiments show that the best-performing classifiers allow for highly non-linear class boundaries; SVM and RF models achieve between 62.5% and 91.7% accuracy across age groups ?",
