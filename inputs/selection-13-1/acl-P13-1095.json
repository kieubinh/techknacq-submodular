        "The second row represents our method, while the last row represents the result of our method when the weights are set as optimal, i.e., those achieving the best BLEU on the test data.",
        "This result can be considered as an upper bound on BLEU score.",
        "The results demonstrate that model adaptation is useful for generating the responses that elicit the goal emotion.",
        "We can clearly observe the improvement in the BLEU from 0.64 to 1.05.",
        "On the other hand, there still remains a gap between the last two rows (i.e., proposed and optimal).",
        "We think this is partly because the current test data is too small to reliably tune parameters.",
        "Human evaluation We next asked two human workers to manually evaluate the generation results.",
        "In this evaluation, the baseline (no adaptation in Table 10) and proposed method generated a response for each of the 396 utterances in the test data.",
        "For the resulting 792 utterance-response pairs, the two workers manually assessed the appropriateness of the response.",
        "Each response was judged whether it is grammatical and meaningful.",
        "If the response was regarded as so by either of the workers, it was further judged whether it elicits the goal emotion or not.",
        "To make the comparison fair, we did not expose to the workers which system generated the response.",
        "In addition, the responses generated by the two systems were presented in a random order.",
        "As the result, 147 and 157 responses of the baseline and proposed method were regarded as appropriate, i.e., ecliting the goal emotion, by either of the workers; 74 and 92 responses were regarded as appropirate by both of the workers.",
        "These results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
        "Especially, we can confirm that the proposed method can generate responses that elicit addresee's emotion more clearly.",
        "We investigated the agreement between the two workers in this evaluation.",
        "We found that the ?",
        "coefficient is 0.59, which indicates moderate agreement.",
        "This supports the reliability of our evaluation.",
        "erated by the no adaptation baseline and proposed method.",
        "In the first two examples, the proposed method successfully generates responses that elicit the goal emotions: JOY and TRUST.",
        "From these examples, we can consider that the adapted model assigns large probability to phrases such as congratulations or OK.",
        "In the last example, the system also succeeded in eliciting the goal emotion: ANTICIPATION.",
        "For this example, we can interpret that the speaker of the response (i.e., the system) feels anticipation, and consequently the emotion of the addressee is affected by the emotion of the speaker (i.e., the system).",
        "Interestingly, a similar phenomenon is also observed in real conversation (Kim et al., 2012)."

        "A similar technique would be useful for prediction the emotion of an addressee as well.",

        "At this moment, we are unaware of any statistical response generators that model the emotion of the user.",
        "Some researchers have explored generating jokes or humorous text (Dybala et al., 2010; Labtov and Lipson, 2012).",
        "Those attempts are similar to our work in that they also aim at eliciting a certain emotion in the addressee.",
        "They are, however, restricted to elicit a specific emotion.",
        "The linear interpolation of translation and/or language models is a widely-used technique for adapting machine translation systems to new domains (Sennrich, 2012).",
