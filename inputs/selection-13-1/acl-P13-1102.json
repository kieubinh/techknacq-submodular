        "Such analysis is useful because it is reasonable to expect more complex models to exhibit similar properties as well.",
        "The problem of inferring PCFG rule probabilities from training data consisting of yields or strings alone is interesting from both cognitive and engineering perspectives.",
        "Cognitively it is implausible that children can perceive the parse trees of the language they are learning, but it is more reasonable to assume that they can obtain the terminal strings or yield of these trees.",
        "Unsupervised methods for learning a grammar from terminal strings alone is also interesting from an engineering perspective because such training data is cheap and plentiful, while the manually parsed data required by supervised methods are expensive to produce and relatively rare.",
        "Cohen and Smith (2012) show that inferring PCFG rule probabilities from strings alone is computationally intractable, so we should not expect to find an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for the unsupervised problem.",
        "Instead, approximation algorithms are standardly used.",
        "For example, the Inside-Outside (IO) algorithm efficiently implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure for approximating a Maximum Likelihood estimator (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "Bayesian estimators for PCFG rule probabilities have also been attracting attention because they provide a theoretically-principled way of incorporating prior information.",

        "PCFGs have the interesting property (which we expect most linguistically more realistic models to also possess) that the distributions they define are not always properly normalized or ?tight?.",
        "In a non-tight PCFG the partition function (i.e., sum of the ?probabilities?",
        "of all the trees generated by the PCFG) is less than one.",
        "(Booth and Thompson, 1973, called such non-tight PCFGs ?inconsistent?, but we follow Chi and Geman (1998) in calling them ?non-tight?",
        "to avoid confusion with the consistency of statistical estimators).",
        "Chi (1999) showed that renormalized non-tight PCFGs (which he called ?Gibbs CFGs?)",
        "define the same class of distributions over trees as do tight PCFGs with the same rules, and provided an algorithm for mapping any PCFG to a tight PCFG with the same rules that defines the same distribution over trees.",
        "An obvious question is then: how does tightness affect the inference of PCFGs?",
        "Chi and Geman (1998) studied the question for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation, and showed that ML es",
        "timates are always tight for both the supervised case (where the input consists of parse trees) and the unsupervised case (where the input consists of yields or terminal strings).",
        "This means that ML estimators can simply ignore issues of tightness, and rest assured that the PCFGs they estimate are in fact tight.",
        "The situation is more subtle with Bayesian estimators.",
        "We show that for the special case of linear PCFGs (which include HMMs) with non-degenerate priors the posterior puts zero mass on non-tight PCFGs, so tightness is not an issue with Bayesian estimation of such grammars.",
        "However, because all of the commonly used priors (such as the Dirichlet or the logistic normal) assign non-zero probability across the whole probability simplex, in general the posterior may assign non-zero probability to non-tight PCFGs.",
        "We discuss three different possible approaches to this in this paper:",
        "1. the only-tight approach, where we modify the prior so it only assigns non-zero probability to tight PCFGs, 2. the renormalization approach, where we renormalize non-tight PCFGs so they define a probability distribution over trees, and 3. the sink-element approach, where we reinter",
        "pret non-tight PCFGs as assigning non-zero probability to a ?sink element?, so both tight and non-tight PCFGs are properly normalized.",

        "We conclude by studying the effect of requiring tightness on the estimation of some simple PCFGs.",

        "8 The expressive power of the three approaches Probably the most important question to ask with respect to the three different approaches to non-tightness is whether they differ in terms of expressive power.",
        "Clearly the three approaches differ in terms of the grammars they admit (the only-tight approach requires the prior to only assign non-zero probability to tight PCFGs, while the other two approaches permit the prior to assign non-zero probability to non-tight PCFGs as well).",
        "However, if we regard a grammar as merely a device for defining a distribution over trees and a prior as defining a distribution over distributions over trees, it is reasonable to ask whether the class of distributions over distributions of trees that each of these approaches define are the same or differ.",
        "We believe, but have not proved, that all three approaches define the same class of distributions over distributions of trees in the following sense: any prior used with one of the approaches can be transformed into a different prior that can be used with one of the other approaches, and yield the same posterior over trees conditioned on a string, marginalizing out the parameters.",
        "This does not mean that the three approaches are equivalent, however.",

        "While the differences between these conditional probabilities are not great, the conditional probabilities are clearly different, so the three approaches do in fact define different distributions over trees under a uniform prior on rule probabilities.",
        "9 Empirical effects of the three approaches in unsupervised grammar induction In this section we present experiments using the three samplers just described in an unsupervised grammar induction problem.",
        "Our goal here is not to improve the state-of-the-art in unsupervised grammar induction, but to try to measure empirical differences in the estimates produced by the three different approaches to tightness just described.",
        "The bottom line of our experiments is that we could not detect any significant difference in the estimates produced by samplers for these three different approaches.",
        "In our experiments we used the English Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We use the part-of-speech tag sequences of sentences shorter than 11 words in sections 2?21.",
        "The grammar we use is the PCFG version of the dependency model with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004), as it appears in Smith (2006).",
        "We used a symmetric Dirichlet prior with hy-perparameter ?",
        "= 0.1.",
        "For each of the three approaches for handling tightness, we ran 100 times the samplers in ?7, each for 1,000 iterations.",
        "We discarded the first 900 sweeps of each run, and calculated the F1-scores of the sampled trees every 10th sweep from the last 100 sweeps.",
        "For each run we calculated the average F1-score over the 10 sweeps we evaluated.",
        "We thus have 100 average F1-scores for each of the samplers.",
        "Figure 1 plots the density of F1 scores (compared to the gold standard) resulting from the Gibbs sampler, using all three approaches.",
        "The mean value for each of the approaches is 0.41 with standard deviation 0.06 (only-tight), 0.41 with standard deviation 0.05 (renormalization) and 0.42 with standard deviation 0.06 (sink element).",
        "In addition, the only-tight approach results in an average of 437 (s.d., 142) rejected proposals in 1,000 samples, while the renormalization approach results in an average of 232 (s.d., 114) rejected proposals in 1,000 samples.",
        "(It's not surprising that the only-tight approach results in more rejections as it keeps proposing new ?",
        "until a tight proposal is found, while the renormalization approach simply uses the old ?).",
        "We performed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (which are non-parametric tests designed to determine if two distributions are different; see DeGroot, 1991) on each of the three pairs of 100 F1-scores.",
        "None of the tests were close to significant; the p-values were all above 0.5.",
        "Thus our experiments provided no evidence that the samplers produced different distributions over trees, although it's reasonable to expect that these distributions do indeed differ.",
        "In terms of running time, our implementation of the renormalization approach was several times slower than our implementations of the other two approaches because we used the naive fixed-point algorithm to compute the partition function: perhaps this could be improved using one of the more sophisticated partition function algorithms described in Nederhof and Satta (2008)."
