        "Transfer of linguistic systems of a mother tongue to another language, namely mother tongue interference, is often observable in the writing of non-native speakers.",
        "The reader may be able to determine the mother tongue of the writer of the following sentence from the underlined article error: The alien wouldn't use my spaceship but the hers.",
        "The answer would probably be French or Spanish; the definite article is allowed to modify possessive pronouns in these languages, and the usage is sometimes negatively transferred to English writing.",
        "Researchers such as Swan and Smith (2001), Aarts and Granger (1998), Davidsen-Nielsen and Harder (2001), and Altenberg and Tapper (1998) work on mother tongue interference to reveal overused/underused words, part of speech (POS), or grammatical items.",
        "In contrast, very little is known about how strongly mother tongue interference is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues.",
        "At one extreme, one could argue that it is so strongly transferred to texts in another language that the linguistic relations between mother tongues are perfectly preserved in the texts.",
        "At the other extreme, one can counter it, arguing that other features such as non-nativeness are more influential than mother tongue interference.",
        "One possible reason for this is that a large part of the distinctive language systems of a mother tongue may be eliminated when transferred to another language from a speaker's mother tongue.",
        "For example, Slavic languages have a rich inflectional case system (e.g., Czech has seven inflectional cases) whereas French does not.",
        "However, the difference in the richness cannot be transferred into English because English has almost no inflectional case system.",
        "Thus, one cannot determine the mother tongue of a given non-native text from the inflectional case.",
        "A similar argument can be made about some parts of gender, tense, and aspect systems.",
        "Besides, Wong and Dras (2009) show that there are no significant differences, between mother tongues, in the misuse of certain syntactic features such as subject-verb agreement that have different tendencies depending on their mother tongues.",
        "Considering these, one could not be so sure which argument is correct.",
        "In any case, to the best of our knowledge, no one has yet answered this question.",
        "In view of this background, we take the first step in addressing this question.",
        "We hypothesize that: Hypothesis: Mother tongue interference is so strong that the relations in a language family are preserved in texts written in another language.",
        "In other words, mother tongue interference is so strong that one can reconstruct a language fam",
        "ily tree from non-native texts.",
        "One of the major contributions of this work is to reveal and visualize a language family tree preserved in non-native texts, by examining the hypothesis.",
        "This becomes important in native language identification1 which is useful for improving grammatical error correction systems (Chodorow et al., 2010) or for providing more targeted feedback to language learners.",
        "As we will see in Sect.",
        "6, this paper reveals several crucial findings that contribute to improving native language identification.",
        "In addition, this paper shows that the findings could contribute to reconstruction of language family trees (Enright and Kondrak, 2011; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Barbanc?on et al., 2007; Batagelj et al., 1992; Nakhleh et al., 2005), which is one of the central tasks in historical linguistics.",

        "To examine the hypothesis, we reconstruct a language family tree from English texts written by non-native speakers of English whose mother tongue is one of the Indo-European languages (Beekes, 2011; Ramat and Ramat, 2006).",
        "If the reconstructed tree is sufficiently similar to the original Indo-European family tree, it will support the hypothesis.",
        "If not, it suggests that some features other than mother tongue interference are more influential.",
        "The approach we use for reconstructing a language family tree is to apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Han and Kamber, 2006) to English texts written by non-native speakers.",
        "Researchers have already performed related work on reconstructing language family trees.",
        "For instance, Kroeber and Chrie?tien (1937) and Ellega?rd (1959) proposed statistical methods for measuring the similarity metric between languages.",
        "More recently, Batagelj et al. (1992) and Kita (1999) proposed methods for reconstructing language family trees using clustering.",
        "Among them, the 1Recently, native language identification has drawn the attention of NLP researchers.",
        "For instance, a shared task on native language identification took place at an NAACL-HLT 2013 workshop.",
        "most related method is that of Kita (1999).",
        "In his method, a variety of languages are modeled by their spelling systems (i.e., character-based n-gram language models).",
        "Then, agglomerative hierarchical clustering is applied to the language models to reconstruct a language family tree.",
        "The similarity used for clustering is based on a divergence-like distance between two language models that was originally proposed by Juang and Rabiner (1985).",
        "This method is purely data-driven and does not require human expert knowledge for the selection of linguistic features.",
        "Our work closely follows Kita's work.",
        "However, it should be emphasized that there is a significant difference between the two.",
        "Kita's work (and other previous work) targets clustering of a variety of languages whereas our work tries to reconstruct a language family tree preserved in non-native English.",
        "This significant difference prevents us from directly applying techniques in the literature to our task.",
        "For instance, Batagelj et al. (1992) use basic vocabularies such as belly in English and ventre in French to measure similarity between languages.",
        "Obviously, this does not work on our task; belly is belly in English writing whoever writes it.",
        "Kita's method is also likely not to work well because all texts in our task share the same spelling system (i.e., English spelling).",
        "Although spelling is sometimes influenced by mother tongues, it involves a lot more including overuse, underuse, and misuse of lexical, grammatical, and syntactic systems.",
        "To solve the problem, this work adopts a word-based language model in the expectation that word sequences reflect mother tongue interference.",
        "At the same time, its simple application would cause a serious side effect.",
        "It would reflect the topics of given texts rather than mother tongue interference.",
        "Unfortunately, there exists no such English corpus that covers a variety of language speakers with uniform topics; moreover the availability of non-native corpora is still somewhat limited.",
        "This also means that available non-native corpora may be too small to train reliable word-based language models.",
        "The next section describes two methods (language model-based and vector-based), which address these problems."

        "Besides, there are a large number of language pairs to compare.",
        "Thus, we need an efficient and effective way to analyze the experimental results.",
        "To address these problems, we did the following.",
        "First, we focused on only a few Englishes out of the 11.",
        "Because one of the authors had some knowledge of French, we selected French-English as the main target.",
        "This naturally made us select the other Italic Englishes as its counterparts.",

        "Second, we used a method for extracting interesting trigrams from the corpus data.",
        "The method compares three out of the 11 corpora (for example, French-, Spanish-, and Russian-Englishes).",
        "If we remove instances of a trigram from each set, the clustering tree involving",
        "the three may change.",
        "For example, the removal of but the hers may result in a cluster tree merging French-and Russian-Englishes before French-and Spanish-Englishes.",
        "Even if it does not change, the distances may change in that direction.",
        "We an-alyzed what trigrams had contributed to the clustering results with this approach.",
        "To formalize this approach, we will denote a trigram by t. We will also denote its relative frequency in the language data Di by rti.",
        "Then, the change in the distances caused by the removal of t from Di, Dj , and Dk is quantified by",

        "rti)2 to that between Di and Dj in the vector-based method.",
        "Thus, the greater s is, the higher the chance that the cluster tree changes.",
        "Therefore, we can obtain a list of interesting trigrams by sorting them according to s. We could do a similar calculation in the language model-based method using the conditional probabilities.",
        "However, it requires a more complicated calculation.",
        "Accordingly, we limit ourselves to the vector-based method in this analysis, noting that both methods generated similar cluster trees.",
        "Table 2 shows the top 15 interesting trigrams where Di, Dj , and Dk are French-, Spanish-, and Russian-Englishes, respectively.",

        "The definite article is used more frequently in the Italic-Englishes than in the Germanic Englishes (except for Dutch-English).",

        "Researchers including Wong and Dras (2009), Wong et al. (2011; 2012), and Koppel et al. (2005) work on native language identification and show that machine learning-based methods are effective.",
        "Wong and Dras (2009) propose using information about grammatical errors such as errors in determiners to achieve better performance while they show that its use does not improve the performance, contrary to the expectation.",
        "Related to this, other researchers (Koppel and Ordan, 2011; van Halteren, 2008) show that machine learning-based methods can also predict the source language of a given translated text although it should be emphasized that it is a different task from native language identification because translation is not typically performed by non-native speakers but rather native speakers of the target language11.",
        "The experimental results show that n-grams containing articles are predictive for identifying native languages.",
        "This indicates that they should be used in the native language identification task.",
        "Importantly, all n-grams containing articles should be used in the classifier unlike the previous methods that are based only on n-grams containing article errors.",
        "Besides, no articles should be explicitly coded in n-grams for taking the overuse/underuse of articles into consideration.",
        "We can achieve this by adding a special symbol such as ?",
        "to the beginning of each NP whose head noun is a common noun and that has no determiner in it as in ?I like ?",
        "orange juice.?",
        "In addition, the length of noun-noun compounds and the position of adverbs should also be considered in native language identification.",
        "In particular, the former can be modeled by the Pois-son distribution as follows.",
        "The Poisson distribution gives the probability of the number of events occurring in a fixed time.",
        "In our case, the number of events in a fixed time corresponds to the number of consecutive repetitions of common nouns in NPs, which in turn corresponds to the length.",
        "To be precise, the probability of a noun-noun compound with length l is given by",
        "where ?",
        "corresponds to the average length.",

        "It turned out that the reconstructed tree was different from the canonical tree (available at http: //web.hyogo-u.ac.jp/nagata/acl/).",
        "However, we need further investigation to confirm it because each subcorpus in Europarl is variable in many dimensions including its size and style (e.g., overuse of certain phrases such as ladies and gentlemen).",

        "This holds for the other Englishes although we cannot show them because of the space limitation.",
        "Consequently, Equation (5) should be useful in native language identification.",
        "Fortunately, it can be naturally integrated into existing classifiers.",
        "In the domain of historical linguistics, researchers have used computational and corpus-based methods for reconstructing language family trees.",
        "Some (Enright and Kondrak, 2011; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Barbanc?on et al., 2007; Batagelj et al., 1992; Nakhleh et al., 2005) apply clustering techniques to the task of language family tree reconstruction.",
        "Others (Kita, 1999; Rama and Singh, 2009) use corpus statistics for the same purpose.",
        "These methods reconstruct language family trees based on linguistic features that exist within words including lexical, phonological, and morphological features.",
        "The experimental results in this paper suggest the possibility of the use of non-native texts for reconstructing language family trees.",
        "It allows us to use linguistic features that exist between words, as seen in our methods, which has been difficult with previous methods.",
        "Language involves the features between words such as phrase construction and syntax as well as the features within words and thus they should both be considered in reconstruc-12The theoretical and observed values are so close that it is difficult to distinguish between the two lines in Fig. 7.",

        "In this paper, we have shown that mother tongue interference is so strong that the relations between members of the Indo-European language family are preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers.",
        "To show this, we have used clustering to reconstruct a language family tree from 11 sets of non-native English texts.",
        "It turned out that the reconstructed tree correctly groups them into the Italic, Germanic, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European family tree.",
        "Based on the resulting trees, we have then hypothesized that the following relation holds in mother tongue interference: interfamily distance > non-nativeness > intrafamily distance.",
        "We have further explored several intriguing linguistic features that play an important role in mother tongue interference: (i) article use, (ii) NP construction, and (iii) adverb position, which provide several insights for improving the tasks of native language identification and language family tree reconstruction."
