        "The vast majority of contemporary research that investigates statistical properties of language deals with characterizing words by extracting information about their behavior from large corpora.",
        "Thus, co-occurrence of words in n-word windows, syntactic structures, sentences, paragraphs, and even whole documents is captured in vector-space models built from text corpora (Turney and Pan-tel, 2010; Basili and Pennacchiotti, 2010; Erk and Pado?, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Jones and Mewhort, 2007; PadÃ³ and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998; Landauer and Du-mais, 1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Salton et al., 1975).",
        "However, little is known about typical profiles of texts in terms of co-occurrence behavior of their words.",
        "Some information can be inferred from the success of statistical techniques in predicting certain structures in text.",
        "For example, the fact that a text segmentation algorithm that uses information about patterns of word co-occurrences can detect subtopic shifts in a text (Riedl and Bie-mann, 2012; Misra et al., 2009; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) tells us that texts contain some proportion of more highly associated word pairs (those in subsequent sentences within the same topical unit) and of less highly associated pairs (those in sentences from different topical units).1 Yet, does each text have a different distribution of highly associated, mildly associated, unassoci-ated, and disassociated pairs of words, or do texts tend to strike a similar balance of these?",
        "What are the proportions of the different levels of association, how much variation there exists, and are there systematic differences between various kinds of texts?",
        "We present research that makes a first step in addressing these questions.",
        "From the applied perspective, our interest is in quantifying differences between well-written and poorly written essays, for the purposes of automated scoring of essays.",
        "We therefore concentrate on essay data for the main experiments reported in this paper, although some additional corpora will be used for illustration purposes.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents our methodology for building word association profiles for texts.",
        "Section 3 illustrates the profiles for three corpora from different genres.",
        "Section 4.2 presents our study of the relationship between writing quality and patterns of word associations, with section 4.5 showing the results of adding a feature based on word association profile to a state-of-art essay scoring system.",
        "Related work is reviewed is section 5.",
        "1Note that the classical approach to topical segmentation of texts, TextTiling (Hearst, 1997), uses only word repetitions.",
        "The cited approaches use topic models that are in turn estimated using word co-occurrence."

        "In order to describe the word association profile of a text, three decisions need to be made.",
        "The first decision is how to quantify the extent of co-occurrence between two words; we will use point-wise mutual information (PMI) estimated from a large and diverse corpus of texts.",
        "The second is which pairs of words in a text to consider when building a profile for the text; we opted for all pairs of content word types occurring in a text, irrespective of the distance between them.",
        "We consider word types, not tokens; no lemmatization is performed.",
        "The third decision is how to represent the co-occurrence profiles; we use a histogram where each bin represents the proportion of word pairs in the given interval of PMI values.",
        "The rest of the section gives more detail about these decisions.",
        "To obtain comprehensive information about typical co-occurrence behavior of words of English, we build a first-order co-occurrence word-space model (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Ba-roni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "The model was generated from a corpus of texts of about 2.5 billion words, counting co-occurrence in a paragraph,2 using no distance coefficients (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007).",
        "About 2 billion words come from the Gigaword 2003 corpus (Graff and Cieri, 2003).",
        "Additional 500 million words come from an in-house corpus containing popular science and fiction texts.",
        "Occurrence counts of 2.1 million word types and of 1,279 million word type pairs are efficiently compressed using the TrendStream technology (Flor, 2013), resulting in a database file of 4.7GB.",
        "Trend-Stream is a trie-based architecture for storage, retrieval, and updating of very large word n-gram datasets.",
        "We store pairwise word associations as bigrams; since associations are unordered, only one of the orders in actually stored in the database.",
        "There is an extensive literature on the use of word-association measures for NLP, especially for detection of collocations (Pecina, 2010; Evert, 2008; Futagi et al., 2008).",
        "The use of point-wise mutual information with word-space models is noted in (Zhang et al., 2012; Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Turney, 2001).",
        "Point-wise mutual information is defined as follows (Church and Hanks, 1990):",
        "Differently from Church and Hanks (1990), we disregard word order when computing P (x, y).",
        "All probabilities are estimated using frequencies.",
        "We define WAPT ?",
        "a word association profile of a text T ?",
        "as the distribution of PMI(x, y) for all pairs of content3 word types (x, y) ?T.",
        "All pairs of word types for which the associations database returned a null value (the pair has never been observed in the same paragraph) are excluded from the calculation.",
        "For our main dataset (described later as setA, section 4.1), the average percentage of non-null values per text is 92%.",
        "To represent the WAP of a text, we use a 60-bin histogram spanning all PMI values.",
        "The lowest bin (shown in Figures 1 and 2 as PMI = ?5) contains pairs with PMI?",
        "?5; the topmost bin (shown in Figures 1 and 2 as PMI = 4.83) contains pairs with PMI> 4.67, while the rest of the bins contain word pairs (x, y) with ?5 <PMI(x, y) ?",
        "4.67.",
        "Each bin in the histogram (apart from the top and the bottom ones) corresponds to a PMI interval of 0.167.",
        "We chose a relatively fine-grained binning and performed no optimization for grid selection; for more sophisticated gridding approaches to study non-linear relationships in the data, see Reshef et al. (2011).",
        "We will say that a text A is tighter than text B if the WAP of A is shifted towards the higher end of PMI values relative to text B.",
        "The intuition behind the terminology is that texts with higher proportions of highly associated pairs are likelier to be more focused, dealing with a small number of topics at greater length, as opposed to texts that bring various different themes into the text to various extents.",
        "Thus, the text ?The dog barked and wagged its tail?",
        "is much tighter than the text ?Green ideas sleep furiously?, with all the six content word pairs scoring above PMI=5.5 in the first and below PMI=2.2 in the second.4"

        "We observe that the shape of the WAP is very stable across essays, and the variation around the average is quite limited.",

        "To get an idea about possible variation in the distribution, we consider two additional corpora from different genres.",
        "We use a corpus of Wall Street Journal 1987 articles from the TIPSTER collection.5 We picked articles of 250 to 700 words in length, in order to keep the length of texts comparable to the essay data, while varying the genre; 770 such articles were found.",
        "The dashed (orange) line in Figure 1 shows the distribution of average values for the WSJ collection (wsj-av).",

        "Yet, the picture at the right tail is remarkably similar to that of the essays, with 9% of word pairs, on average, having PMI>2.17.",
        "The second additional corpus contains 140 literary texts written or adapted for readers in grades 3 and 4 in US schools (Sheehan et al., 2008).",
        "In terms of length, these texts fall into the same range as the other corpora, averaging 507 words.",
        "5LDC93T3A in LDC catalogue The average WAP for these texts is shown with a thin solid (purple) line with circular markers in Figure 1 (Grades 3-4).",
        "These texts are much tighter than texts in the other two collections, as the distribution is shifted to the right.",
        "The right tail, with PMI>2.17, holds 19% of all word pairs in these texts ?",
        "more than twice the proportion in essays written by college graduates or in texts from the WSJ.",
        "It is instructive to check whether the overuse of highly associated pairs is felt during reading.",
        "These texts strike an adult reader as overly explicit, taking the space to state things that an adult reader would readily infer or assume.",
        "For example, consider the following opening paragraph: ?Grandma Rose gave Daniel a recorder.",
        "A recorder is a musical instrument.",
        "Daniel learned to play by blowing on the recorder.",
        "It didn't take lots of air.",

        "Thus, texts seem to be mainly made of pairs of weakly associated words ?",
        "about half the pairs of word types lie between PMI of 0.5 and 1.5, in all the examined collections (52% for essays, 44% for each of WSJ and young reader corpora).",

        "Most of the attention in the computational linguistics research that deals with analysis of the lexis of texts has so far been paid to what in our terms would be the very high end of the word association profile.",
        "Thus, following Halliday and Hasan (1976), Hoey (1991), and Morris and Hirst (1991), the notion of lexical cohesion has been used to capture repetitions of words and occurrence of words with related meanings in a text.",
        "Lexically cohesive words are traced through the text, forming lexical chains or graphs, and these representations are used in a variety of applications, such as segmentation, keyword extraction, sum-marization, sentiment analysis, temporal indexing, hypelink generation, error correction (Guinaudeau et al., 2012; Marathe and Hirst, 2010; Ercan and Cicekli, 2007; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005; Inkpen and De?silets, 2005; Gurevych and Strube, 2004; Stokes et al., 2004; Silber and McCoy, 2002; Green, 1998; Al-Halimi and Kazman, 1998; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "To our knowledge, lexical cohesion has not so far been used for automated scoring of essays.",
        "Our results suggest that this direction is promising, as merely the proportion of highly associated word pairs is already contributing a clear signal regarding essay quality; it is possible that additional information can be derived from richer representations common in the lexical cohesion literature.",
        "Aspects related to the distribution of words in essays have been studied in relation to essay scoring.",
        "One line of work focuses on assessing coherence of essays.",
        "Foltz et al. (1998) use Latent 11We also performed a cross-validation test on setA p1p6, where we estimated a regression model on setA-pi and evaluate it on setA-pj, for all i, j ?",
        "{1, .., 6}, i 6= j, and compared the performance with that of e-rater alone on setA-pj, yielding 30 different train-test combinations.",
        "The results were similar to those of the blind test presented here, with e-rater+HAT significantly improving upon e-rater alone, using Wilcoxon test, W=374, n=29, p<0.05.",
        "Semantic Analysis to model the smoothness of transitions between adjacent segments of an essay.",
        "Higgins et al. (2004) compare sentences from certain discourse segments in an essay to determine their semantic similarity, such as comparing thesis statements to conclusions or thesis statements to essay prompts.",
        "Additional approaches include evaluation of coherence based on repeated reference to entities (Burstein et al., 2010; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008; Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004).",
        "Our approach is different in that it does not measure the flow of the text, that is, the sequencing and repetition of the words, but rather assesses the choice of vocabulary as a whole.",
        "Topic models have been proposed as a technique for capturing clusters of related words that tend to occur in the same documents in a given collection.",
        "A text is modeled as being composed of a small number of topics, and words in the text are generated conditioned on the selected topics (Gruber et al., 2007; Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Since (a) topics encapsulate clusters of highly associated words, and (b) topics for a given text are modeled as being chosen independently from each other, we expect a negative correlation between the number of topics in a document and the tightness of the word association profile of the text.",
        "An alternative representation of word association profile would be a weighted graph, where the weights correspond to pairwise associations between words.",
        "Thus, for longer texts, graph analysis techniques would be applicable.",
        "Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) analyze the graphs induced from large repositories like WordNet or databases of free associations, and find them to be scale-free and small-world; it is an open question whether word association graphs induced from book-length texts would exhibit similar properties.",
        "In the theoretical tradition, our work is closest in spirit to Michael Hoey's theory of lexical priming (Hoey, 2005), positing that users of language internalize patterns of occurrence and non-occurrence of words not only with other words, but also in certain positions in a text, in certain syntactic environments, and in certain evaluative contexts, and use these when creating their own texts.",
        "We believe that word association profiles reflect the artwork that goes into using those internalized associations between words when creating a text, achieving the right mix of strong and weak, positive and negative associations."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we described a new representation of the content vocabulary of a text we call word association profile that captures the proportions of highly associated, mildly associated, unassoci-ated, and disassociated pairs of words selected to coexist in the given text by its author.",
        "We observed that the shape of the distribution is quite stable across various texts, with about half the pairs having a mild association; the allocation of pairs to the higher and the lower levels of association does vary across genres and target audiences.",
        "We further presented a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles.",
        "For a dataset of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics in a standardized test for graduate school admission and scored by professional raters, we showed that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and disassociated pairs, and lower percentagese of mildly associated pairs of words.",
        "We hypothesize that this pattern is consistent with the better essays demonstrating both a better topic development (hence the higher percentage of highly related pairs) and a more creative use of language resources, as manifested in a higher percentage of word pairs that generally do not tend to appear together.",
        "Finally, we demonstrated that the information provided by word association profiles leads to a significant improvement in a highly competitive, state-of-art essay scoring system that already measures various aspects of writing quality.",
        "In future work, we intend to investigate in more detail the contribution of various kinds of words to word association profiles, as well as pursue application to evaluation of text complexity."
