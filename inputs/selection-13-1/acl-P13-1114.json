        "Text normalization is an important first step towards enabling many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks over informal text.",
        "While many of these tasks, such as parsing, perform the best over fully grammatically correct text, most existing text normalization approaches narrowly define the task in the word-to-word sense; that is, the task is seen as that of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard words to their in-vocabulary standard forms.",
        "In this paper, we take a parser-centric view of normalization that aims to convert raw informal text into grammatically correct text.",
        "To understand the real effect of normalization on the parser, we tie normalization performance directly to parser performance.",
        "Additionally, we design a customizable framework to address the often overlooked concept of domain adaptability, and illustrate that the system allows for transfer to new domains with a minimal amount of data and effort.",

        "Text normalization is the task of transforming informal writing into its standard form in the language.",
        "It is an important processing step for a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition, information extraction, parsing, and machine translation (Sproat et al., 2001).",
        "?This work was conducted at IBM.",
        "The use of normalization in these applications poses multiple challenges.",
        "First, as it is most often conceptualized, normalization is seen as the task of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard word tokens to their in-vocabulary standard forms.",
        "However, the scope of the task can also be seen as much wider, encompassing whatever actions are required to convert the raw text into a fully grammatical sentence.",
        "This broader definition of the normalization task may include modifying punctuation and capitalization, and adding, removing, or reordering words.",
        "Second, as with other NLP techniques, normalization approaches are often focused on one primary domain of interest (e.g., Twitter data).",
        "Because the style of informal writing may be different in different data sources, tailoring an approach towards a particular data source can improve performance in the desired domain.",
        "However, this is often done at the cost of adaptability.",
        "This work introduces a customizable normalization approach designed with domain transfer in mind.",
        "In short, customization is done by providing the normalizer with replacement generators, which we define in Section 3.",
        "We show that the introduction of a small set of domain-specific generators and training data allows our model to outperform a set of competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization.",
        "Additionally, the flexibility of the model also allows it to attempt to produce fully grammatical sentences, something not typically handled by word-to-word normalization approaches.",
        "Another potential problem with state-of-the-art normalization is the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics.",
        "The normalization task is most frequently motivated by pointing to the need for clean text for downstream processing applications, such as syntactic parsing.",
        "However, most studies of normalization give little insight into whether and to what degree the normalization process improves",
        "the performance of the downstream application.",
        "For instance, it is unclear how performance measured by the typical normalization evaluation metrics of word error rate and BLEU score (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) translates into performance on a parsing task, where a well placed punctuation mark may provide more substantial improvements than changing a non-standard word form.",
        "To address this problem, this work introduces an evaluation metric that ties normalization performance directly to the performance of a downstream dependency parser.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss previous approaches to the normalization problem.",
        "Section 3 presents our normalization framework, including the actual normalization and learning procedures.",
        "Our instantiation of this model is presented in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5 we introduce the parser driven evaluation metric, and present experimental results of our model with respect to several baselines in three different domains.",
        "Finally, we discuss our experimental study in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."

        "The recent rise of heavily informal writing styles such as Twitter and SMS messages set off a new round of interest in the normalization problem.",
        "Research on SMS and Twitter normalization has been roughly categorized as drawing inspiration from three other areas of NLP (Kobus et al., 2008): machine translation, spell checking, and automatic speech recognition.",

        "Although it is almost universally used as a motivating factor, most normalization work does not directly focus on improving downstream applications.",
        "While a few notable exceptions highlight the need for normalization as part of text-to-speech systems (Beaufort et al., 2010; Pennell and Liu, 2010), these works do not give any direct insight into how much the normalization process actually improves the performance of these systems.",
        "To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first to clearly link the output of a normalization system to the output of the downstream application.",

        "The results presented in the previous section suggest that domain transfer using the proposed normalization framework is possible with only a small amount of effort.",
        "The relatively modest set of additional replacement generators included in each data set alowed the domain-specific approaches to significantly outperform the generic approach.",
        "In the call-center case, performance improvements could be seen by referencing a very small amount of development data.",
        "In the SMS case, the presence of a domain-specific dictionary allowed for performance improvements without the need for any development data at all.",
        "It is likely, though not established, that employing further development data would result in further performance improvements.",
        "We leave further investigation to future work.",
        "The results in Section 5.2 establish a point that has often been assumed but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been explicitly shown: performing normalization is indeed beneficial to dependency parsing on informal text.",
        "The parse of the normalized text was substantially better than the parse of the original raw text in all domains, with absolute performance increases ranging from about 18-25% on subjects and objects.",
        "Furthermore, the results suggest that, as hypothesized, preparing an informal text for a parsing task requires more than simple word-to-word normalization.",
        "The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization approach.",
        "Perhaps most interestingly, the proposed approach performs on par with, and in several cases superior to, gold standard word-to-word annotations.",
        "This result gives strong evidence for the conclusion that parser-targeted normalization requires a broader understanding of the scope of the normalization task.",
        "While the work presented here gives promising results, there are still many behaviors found in informal text that prove challenging.",
        "One such example is the word reordering seen in Figure 4.",
        "Although word reordering could be incorporated into the model as a combination of a deletion and an insertion, the model as currently devised cannot easily link these two replacements to one another.",
        "Additionally, instances of reordering proved hard to detect in practice.",
        "As such, no reordering-based replacement generators were implemented in the presented system.",
        "Another case that proved difficult was the insertion of missing tokens.",
        "For instance, the informal sentence ?Day 3 still don't freaking",
        "feel good!:(?",
        "could be formally rendered as ?It is day 3 and I still do not feel good!?.",
        "Attempts to address missing tokens in the model resulted in frequent false positives.",
        "Similarly, punctuation insertion proved to be challenging, often requiring a deep analysis of the sentence.",
        "For example, contrast the sentence ?I'm watching a movie I don't know its name.?",
        "which would benefit from inserted punctuation, with ?I'm watching a movie I don't know.",
        "?, which would not.",
        "We feel that the work presented here provides a foundation for future work to more closely examine these challenges."

        "This work presents a framework for normalization with an eye towards domain adaptation.",
        "The proposed framework builds a statistical model over a series of replacement generators.",
        "By doing so, it allows a designer to quickly adapt a generic model to a new domain with the inclusion of a small set of domain-specific generators.",
        "Tests over three different domains suggest that, using this model, only a small amount of domain-specific data is necessary to tailor an approach towards a new domain.",
        "Additionally, this work introduces a parser-centric view of normalization, in which the performance of the normalizer is directly tied to the performance of a downstream dependency parser.",
        "This evaluation metric allows for a deeper understanding of how certain normalization actions impact the output of the parser.",
        "Using this metric, this work established that, when dependency parsing is the goal, typical word-to-word normalization approaches are insufficient.",
        "By taking a broader look at the normalization task, the approach presented here is able to outperform not only state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization approaches but also manual word-to-word annotations.",
        "Although the work presented here established that more than word-to-word normalization was necessary to produce parser-ready normalizations, it remains unclear which specific normalization tasks are most critical to parser performance.",
        "We leave this interesting area of examination to future work."
