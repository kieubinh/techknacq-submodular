        "Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009).",
        "Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages.",
        "As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language.",
        "A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed.",
        "On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data.",
        "It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster.",
        "On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch.",
        "There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages.",
        "This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language.",
        "The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages.",
        "Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pado?",
        "and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links.",
        "However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a source-language model on it.",
        "An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language.",
        "This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages.",
        "McDonald et al. (2011) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of-speech tags as the shared representation of words.",
        "A later extension of Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance.",
        "In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example ?in August?",
        "vs ?in Britain?.",
        "However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen",
        "tations, such as the cross-lingual clustering mentioned above or cross-lingual distributed word representations of Klementiev et al. (2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion.",
        "In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing cross-lingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one.",

        "Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied extensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wro?blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pado?",

        "The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (2011).",
        "A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation.",
        "There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012), but both work on word level.",
        "This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language.",
        "Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Hajic?, 2002).",
        "A side-effect of using adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks.",

        "It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages.",
        "While an",
        "notation projection approaches require sentence-and word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient.",
        "In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example.",
        "Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language.",
        "Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language."
