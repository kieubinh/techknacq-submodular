        "When reusing text from the web, humans may follow a three step approach shown in Figure 1: searching for appropriate sources on a given topic, copying of text from selected sources, modification and paraphrasing of the copied text.",
        "A considerable body of research deals with the detection of text reuse, and, in particular, with the detection of cases of plagiarism (i.e., the reuse of text with the intent of disguising the fact that text has been reused).",
        "Similarly, a large number of commercial software systems is being developed whose purpose is the detection of plagiarism.",
        "Both the developers of these systems as well as researchers working on the subject matter frequently claim their approaches to be searching the entire web or, at least, to be scalable to web size.",
        "However, there is hardly any evidence to substantiate this claim?rather the opposite can be observed: commercial plagiarism detectors have not been found to reliably identify plagiarism from the web (K?hler and Weber-Wulff, 2010), and the evaluation of research prototypes even under laboratory conditions shows that there is still a long way to go (Potthast et al., 2010b).",
        "We explain the disappointing state of the art by the lack of realistic, large-scale evaluation resources.",
        "With our work, we want to contribute to closing the gap.",
        "In this regard the paper in hand introduces the Webis text reuse corpus 2012 (Webis-TRC-12), which, for the first time, emulates the entire process of reusing text from the web, both at scale and in a controlled environment.",
        "The corpus comprises a number of features that set it apart from previous ones: (1) the topic of each document in the corpus is derived from a topic of the TREC Web Track, and the sources to copy from have been retrieved manually from the ClueWeb corpus.",
        "(2) The search for sources is logged, including click-through and browsing data.",
        "(3) A fine-grained edit history has been recorded for each document.",
        "(4) A total of 297 documents were written with an average length of about 5700 words, whereas diversity is ensured via crowdsourcing.",

        "In general, we identify two distinct writing-style types to perform text reuse, namely to build up an essay during writing, or, to first gather material and then to boil down a text until the essay is completed.",
        "Later in this section, we will analyze this observation in greater detail.",
        "Within the plots, a number of events can be spotted that occurred during writing: in the top left plot, encircled as area A, the insertion of a new piece of text can be observed.",
        "Though marked as original text at first, the writer worked on this passage and then revealed that it was reused from another source.",
        "At area B in the top right plot, one can observe the reorganization of two passages as they exchange places from one edit to another.",
        "Area C in the bottom right plot shows that the writer, shortly before completing this essay, reorganized substantial parts.",
        "Area D in the same plot shows how the writer went about boiling down the text by incorporating contents from different passages that have been collected beforehand and, then, from one edit to another, discarded most of the rest.",
        "The sawtooth shaped pattern in area E in the bottom left plot reveals that, even though the writer of this essay adopts a build-up style, she still pastes passages from her sources into the text one at a time, and then individually boils down each.",
        "Our visualizations also include information about the text positions where writers have been working at a given point in time; these positions are shown as blue dots in the plots.",
        "In this regard distinct writing patterns are discernible of writers who go through a text linearly versus those who do not.",

        "We found that 40% are instances of build-up reuse, 45% are instances of boil-down reuse, and 13% fall in between, excluding 2% of the essays as outliers due to errors or for being too short.",
        "The in-between cases show that a writer actually started one way and then switched to the respective other style of reuse so that the resulting essays could not be attributed to a single category.",
        "An important question that arises out of this observation is whether different writers habitually exert different reuse styles or whether they apply them at random.",
        "To obtain a better overview, we envision the applied reuse style of an essay by the skyline curve of its edit history visualization (i.e., by the curve that plots the length of an essay after each edit).",

        "patterns.",
        "For eight of our writers Figure 4 shows this characteristic.",
        "The plots are ordered by the shape of the averaged curve, starting from a linear increase (left) to a compound of steep increase to a certain length after which the curve levels out (right).",
        "The former shape corresponds to writers who typically apply build-up reuse, while the latter can be attributed to writers who typically apply boil-down reuse.",
        "When comparing the plots we notice a very interesting effect: it appears that writers who conduct boil-down reuse vary more wildly in their behavior.",
        "The reuse style of some writers, however, falls in between the two extremes.",
        "Besides the visual analysis, Table 4 shows the distribution of reuse styles",
        "shows the normalized length of an essay over the edits that went into it during writing.",

        "This includes corpus statistics about important variables, but also exploratory studies of search behaviors and strategies for reusing text.",
