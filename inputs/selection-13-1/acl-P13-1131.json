        "Inference rules for predicates have been identified as an important component in semantic applications, such as Question Answering (QA) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and Information Extraction (IE) (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006).",
        "For example, the inference rule ?X treat Y ?",
        "X relieve Y?",
        "can be useful to extract pairs of drugs and the illnesses which they relieve, or to answer a question like ?Which drugs relieve headache??.",
        "Along this vein, such inference rules constitute a crucial component in generic modeling of textual inference, under the Textual Entailment paradigm (Dagan et al., 2006; Dinu and Wang, 2009).",
        "Motivated by these needs, substantial research was devoted to automatic learning of inference rules from corpora, mostly in an unsupervised distributional setting.",
        "This research line was mainly initiated by the highly-cited DIRT algorithm (Lin and Pantel, 2001), which learns inference for binary predicates with two argument slots (like the rule in the example above).",
        "DIRT represents a predicate by two vectors, one for each of the argument slots, where the vector entries correspond to the argument words that occurred with the predicate in the corpus.",
        "Inference rules between pairs of predicates are then identified by measuring the similarity between their corresponding argument vectors.",
        "This general scheme was further enhanced in several directions, e.g. directional similarity (Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) and meta-classification over similarity values (Berant et al., 2011).",
        "Consequently, several knowledge resources of inference rules were released, containing the top scoring rules for each predicate (Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011; Nakashole et al., 2012).",
        "The above mentioned methods provide a single confidence score for each rule, which is based on the obtained degree of argument-vector similarities.",
        "Thus, a system that applies an inference rule to a text may estimate the validity of the rule application based on the pre-specified rule score.",
        "However, the validity of an inference rule may depend on the context in which it is applied, such as the context specified by the given predicate's arguments.",
        "For example, ?AT&T acquire T-Mobile ?",
        "AT&T purchase T-Mobile?, is a valid application of the rule ?X acquire Y ?",
        "X purchase Y?, while ?Children acquire skills ?",
        "Children purchase skills?",
        "is not.",
        "To address this issue, a line of works emerged which computes a context-sensitive reliability score for each rule application, based on the given context.",
        "The major trend in context-sensitive inference models utilizes latent or class-based methods for context modeling (Pantel et al., 2007; Szpektor et al., 2008; Ritter et al., 2010; Dinu and Lapata, 2010b).",
        "In particular, the more recent methods (Ritter et al., 2010; Dinu and Lapata, 2010b) mod-eled predicates in context as a probability distribution over topics learned by a Latent Dirichlet Allo",
        "cation (LDA) model.",
        "Then, similarity is measured between the two topic distribution vectors corresponding to the two sides of the rule in the given context, yielding a context-sensitive score for each particular rule application.",
        "We notice at this point that while context-insensitive methods represent predicates by argument vectors in the original fine-grained word space, context-sensitive methods represent them as vectors at the level of latent topics.",
        "This raises the question of whether such coarse-grained topic vectors might be less informative in determining the semantic similarity between the two predicates.",
        "To address this hypothesized caveat of prior context-sensitive rule scoring methods, we propose a novel generic scheme that integrates word-level and topic-level representations.",
        "Our scheme can be applied on top of any context-insensitive ?base?",
        "similarity measure for rule learning, which operates at the word level, such as Cosine or Lin (Lin, 1998).",
        "Rather than computing a single context-insensitive rule score, we compute a distinct word-level similarity score for each topic in an LDA model.",
        "Then, when applying a rule in a given context, these different scores are weighed together based on the specific topic distribution under the given context.",
        "This way, we calculate similarity over vectors in the original word space, while biasing them towards the given context via a topic model.",
        "In order to promote replicability and equal-term comparison with our results, we based our experiments on publicly available datasets, both for unsupervised learning of the evaluated models and for testing them over a random sample of rule applications.",
        "We apply our two-level scheme over three state-of-the-art context-insensitive similarity measures.",
        "The evaluation compares performances both with the original context-insensitive measures and with recent LDA-based context-sensitive methods, showing consistent and robust advantages of our scheme.",

        "Figures in parentheses indicate optimal number of LDA topics.",
        "to compute MAP values and corresponding statistical significance, we randomly split each test set into 30 subsets.",
        "For each method we computed Average Precision on every subset and then took the average over all subsets as the MAP value.",
        "Since all tested context-sensitive approaches are based on LDA topics, we varied for each method the number of LDA topics K that optimizes its performance, ranging from 25 to 1600 topics.",

        "= 50K for K >= 600.",
        "Table 4 presents the optimal MAP performance of each tested measure.",
        "Our main result is that our model outperforms all other methods, both context-insensitive and context-sensitive, by a relative increase of more than 10% for all three similarity measures that we tested.",
        "This improvement is statistically significant at p < 0.01 for BInc and Lin, and p < 0.015 for Cosine, using paired t-test.",
        "This shows that our model indeed successfully leverages contextual information beyond the basic context-agnostic rule scores and is robust across measures.",
        "Surprisingly, both baseline topic-level context-sensitive methods, namely DC and SC, underperformed compared to their context-insensitive baselines.",
        "While Dinu and Lapata (Dinu and Lapata, 2010b) did show improvement over context-insensitive DIRT, this result was obtained on the verbs of the Lexical Substitution Task in SemEval (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), which was manually created with a bias for context-sensitive substitutions.",
        "However, our result suggests that topic-level models might not be robust enough when applied to a random sample of inferences.",
        "An interesting indication of the differences between our word-topic model, WT, and topic-only models, DC and SC, lies in the optimal number of LDA topics required for each method.",
        "The number of topics in the range 25-100 performed almost equally well under the WT model for all base measures, with a moderate decline for higher numbers.",
        "The need for this rather small number of topics is due to the nature of utilization of topics in WT.",
        "Specifically, topics are leveraged for high-level domain disambiguation, while fine grained word-level distributional similarity is computed for each rule under each such domain.",
        "This works best for a relatively low number of topics.",
        "However, in higher numbers, topics relate to narrower domains and then topic biased word level similarity may become less effective due to potential sparseness.",
        "On the other hand, DC and SC rely on topics as a surrogate to predicate-argument co-occurrence features, and thus require a relatively large number of them to be effective.",
        "Delving deeper into our test-set, Zeichner et al. provided a more detailed annotation for each invalid rule application.",
        "Specifically, they annotated whether the context under which the rule is applied is valid.",
        "For example, in ?John bought my car 9 John sold my car?",
        "the inference is invalid due to an inherently incorrect rule, but the context is valid.",
        "On the other hand in ?my boss raised my salary 9 my boss constructed my salary?",
        "the context {?my boss?, ?my salary?}",
        "for applying ?raise?",
        "construct?",
        "is invalid.",
        "Following, we split the test-set for the base Lin measure into two test-sets: (a) test-setvc, which includes all correct rule applications and incorrect ones only under valid contexts, and (b) test-setivc, which includes again all correct rule applications but incorrect ones only under invalid contexts.",
        "Table 5 presents the performance of each compared method on the two test sets.",
        "On test-setivc, where context mismatches are abundant, our model outperformed all other baselines (statistically significant at p < 0.01).",
        "In addition, this time DC slightly outperformed CI.",
        "This result more explicitly shows the advantages of integrating word-level and context-sensitive topic-level similarities for differentiating valid and invalid contexts for rule applications.",
        "Yet, many invalid rule applications occur under valid contexts due to inherently incorrect rules, and we want to make sure that also in this scenario our model does not fall behind the context-insensitive measure.",
        "Indeed, on test-setvc, in which context mismatches are rare, our algorithm is still better than the original measure, indicating that WT can be safely applied to distributional similarity measures without concerns of reduced performance in different context scenarios."

        "This paper addressed the problem of computing context-sensitive reliability scores for predicate inference rules.",
        "In particular, we proposed a novel scheme that applies over any base distributional similarity measure which operates at the word level, and computes a single context-insensitive score for a rule.",
        "Based on such a measure, our scheme constructs a context-sensitive similarity measure that computes a reliability score for predicate inference rules applications in the context of given arguments.",
        "The contextualization of the base similarity score was obtained using a topic-level LDA model, which was used in a novel way.",
        "First, it provides a topic bias for learning separate per-topic word-level similarity scores between predicates.",
        "Then, given a specific candidate rule application, the LDA model is used to infer the topic distribution relevant to the context specified by the given arguments.",
        "Finally, the context-sensitive rule application score is computed as a weighted average of the per-topic word-level similarity scores, which are weighed according to the inferred topic distribution.",
        "While most works on context-insensitive predicate inference rules, such as DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), are based on word-level similarity measures, almost all prior models addressing context-sensitive predicate inference rules are based on topic models (except for (Pantel et al., 2007), which was outperformed by later models).",
        "We therefore focused on comparing the performance of our two-level scheme with state-of-the-art prior topic-level and word-level models of distributional similarity, over a random sample of inference rule applications.",
        "Under this natural setting, the two-level scheme consistently outperformed both types of models when tested with three different base similarity measures.",
        "Notably, our model shows stable performance over a large subset of the data",
        "where context sensitivity is rare, while topic-level models tend to underperform in such cases compared to the base context-insensitive methods.",
        "Our work is closely related to another research line that addresses lexical similarity and substitution scenarios in context.",
        "While we focus on lexical-syntactic predicate templates and instantiations of their argument slots as context, lexical similarity methods consider various lexical units that are not necessarily predicates, with their context typically being the collection of words in a window around them.",
        "Various approaches have been proposed to address lexical similarity.",
        "A number of works are based on a compositional semantics approach, where a prior representation of a target lexical unit is composed with the representations of words in its given context (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Erk and Pado?, 2008; Thater et al., 2010).",
        "Other works (Erk and Pado?, 2010; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) use a rather large word window around target words and compute similarities between clusters comprising instances of word windows.",
        "In addition, (Dinu and Lapata, 2010a) adapted the predicate inference topic model from (Dinu and Lapata, 2010b) to compute lexical similarity in context.",
        "A natural extension of our work would be to extend our two level model to accommodate context-sensitive lexical similarity.",
        "For this purpose we will need to redefine the scope of context in our model, and adapt our method to compute context-biased lexical similarities accordingly.",
        "Then we will also be able to evaluate our model on the Lexical Substitution Task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), which has been commonly used in recent years as a benchmark for context-sensitive lexical similarity models.",
        "In a different NLP task, Eidelman et al. (2012) utilize a similar approach to ours for improving the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "They learn an LDA model on the source language side of the training corpus with the purpose of identifying implicit sub-domains.",
        "Then they utilize the distribution over topics inferred for each document in their corpus to compute separate per-topic translation probability tables.",
        "Finally, they train a classifier to translate a given target word based on these tables and the inferred topic distribution of the given document in which the target word appears.",
        "A notable difference between our approach and theirs is that we use predicate pseudo-documents consisting of argument instantiations to learn our LDA model, while Eidelman et al. use the real documents in a corpus.",
        "We believe that combining these two approaches may improve performance for both textual inference and SMT and plan to experiment with this direction in future work."
