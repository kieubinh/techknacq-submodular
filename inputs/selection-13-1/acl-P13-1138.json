        "NLG is the process of generating natural-sounding text from non-linguistic inputs.",
        "A typical NLG system contains three main components: (1) Document (Macro) Planning - deciding what content should be realized in the output and how it should be structured; (2) Sentence (Micro) planning - generating a detailed sentence specification and selecting appropriate referring expressions; and",
        "(3) Surface Realization - generating the final text",
        "after applying morphological modifications based on syntactic rules (see e.g., Bateman and Zock (2003), Reiter and Dale (2000) and McKeown (1985)).",
        "However, document planning is arguably one of the most crucial components of an NLG system and is responsible for making the texts express the desired communicative goal in a coherent structure.",
        "If the document planning stage fails, the communicative goal of the generated text will not be met even if the other two stages are perfect.",
        "While most traditional systems simplify development by using a pipelined approach where (1-3) are executed in a sequence, this can result in errors at one stage propagating to successive stages (see e.g., Robin and McKeown (1996)).",
        "We propose a hybrid framework that combines (1-3) by converting data to text in one single process.",
        "Most NLG systems fall into two broad categories: knowledge-based and statistical.",
        "Knowledge-based systems heavily depend on having domain expertise to come up with hand-crafted rules at each stage of a pipeline.",
        "Although knowledge-based systems can produce high quality text, they are (1) very expensive to build, involving a lot of discussion with the end users of the system for the document planning stage alone; (2) have limited linguistic coverage, as it is time consuming to capture linguistic variation; and (3) one has to start from scratch for each new domain because the developed components cannot be reused.",
        "Statistical systems, on the other hand, are fairly inexpensive, more adaptable and rely on having historical data for the given domain.",
        "Coverage is likely to be high if more historical data is available.",
        "The main disadvantage with statistical systems is that they are more prone to errors and the output text may not be coherent as there are less constraints on the generated text.",
        "Our framework is a hybrid of statistical and template-based systems.",
        "Many knowledge-based systems use templates to generate text.",
        "A template structure contains ?gaps?",
        "that are filled to generate the output.",
        "The idea is to create a lot of templates from the historical data and select the right template based on some constraints.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hybrid statistical-template-based system that combines all three stages of NLG.",
        "Experiments with different variants of our system (for biography and weather subject matter domains) demonstrate that our system generates reasonable texts.",
        "Also, in addition to the standard metrics used to evaluate NLG systems (e.g., BLEU, NIST, etc.",
        "), we present a unique text evaluation metric called syntactic variability to measure the linguistic variation of generated texts.",
        "This metric applies to the document collection level and is based on computing the number of unique template sequences among all the generated texts.",
        "A higher number indicates the texts are more variable and natural-sounding whereas a lower number shows they are more redundant.",
        "We argue that this metric is useful for evaluating template-based systems and for any type of text generation for domains where linguistic variability is favored (e.g., the user is expected to go through more than one document in the same session).",

        "Typically, knowledge-based NLG systems are implemented by rules and, as mentioned above, have a pipelined architecture for the document and sentence planning stages and surface realization (Hovy, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993).",
        "However, document planning is arguably the most important task (Sripada et al., 2001).",
        "It follows that approaches to document planning are rule-based as well and, concomitantly, are usually domain specific.",
        "For example, Bouayad-Agha, et al. (2011) proposed document planning based on an ontology knowledge base to generate football summaries.",
        "For rule?based systems, rules exist for selecting content to grammatical choices to post-processing (e.g., pronoun generation).",
        "These rules are often tailored to a given system, with input from multiple experts; consequently, there is a high associated development cost (e.g., 12 person months for the SUMTIME-METEO system (Belz, 2007)).",
        "Statistical approaches can reduce extensive development time by relying on corpus data to ?learn?",
        "rules for one or more components of an NLG system (Langkilde and Knight, 1998).",
        "For example, Duboue and McKeown (2003) proposed a statistical approach to extract content selection rules for biography descriptions.",
        "Further, statistical approaches should be more adaptable to different domains than their rule-based equivalents (An-geli et al., 2012).",
        "For example, Barzilay and Lapata (2005) formulated content selection as a classification task to produce football summaries and Kelly et al. (2009) extended Barzilay and Lapata's approach for generating match reports for cricket.",
        "The present work builds on Howald et al. (2013) where, in a given corpus, a combination of domain specific named entity tagging and clustering sentences (based on semantic predicates) were used to generate templates.",
        "However, while the system consolidated both sentence planning and surface realization with this approach (described in more detail in Section 3), the document plan was given via the input data and sequencing information was present in training documents.",
        "For the present research, we introduce a similar method that leverages the distributions of document?level features in the training corpus to incorporate a statistical document planning component.",
        "Consequently, we are able to create a streamlined statistical NLG architecture that balances natural",
        "human?like variability with appropriate and accurate information."

        "Two sets of crowdsourced human evaluation tasks (run on CrowdFlower) were constructed to compare against the automatic metrics: (1) an understandability evaluation of the entire text on a three-point scale: Fluent = no grammatical or informative barriers; Understandable = some grammatical or informative barriers; Disfluent = significant grammatical or informative barriers; and (2) a sentence?level preference between sentence pairs (e.g., ?Do you prefer Sentence A (from DocOrig) or the corresponding Sentence B (from DocBase/DocSys)?).",

        "We also omitted those evaluators with a disproportionately high response rate.",
        "No other data was collected on the contributors (although geographic data (country, region, city) and IP addresses were available).",
        "For the sentence?level preference task, the pair orderings were randomized to prevent click bias.",
        "For the text?understandability task, 40 documents were chosen at random from the DocOrig test set alng with the corresponding 40 DocSys and DocBase generations (240 documents total/120 for each domain).",
        "8 judgments per document were solicited from the crowd (1920 total judgments, 69.51 average agreement) and are summarized in Figures 3 and 4 (biography and weather respectively).",
        "If the system is performing well and the ranking model is actually contributing to increased performance, the accepted trend should be that the DocOrig texts are more fluent and preferred compared to both the DocSys and DocBase systems.",
        "However, the differences between DocOrig and DocSys will not be significant, the differences between DocOrig and DocBase and DocSys and DocBase will be significantly different.",
        "Focusing on fluency ratings, it is expected that the DocOrig generations will have the highest fluency (as they are human generated).",
        "Further, if the DocSys is performing well, it is expected that the fluency rating will be less than the DocOrig and higher than DocBase.",
        "Figure 3, which shows the biography text evaluations, demonstrates this acceptable distribution of performances.",
        "For the weather discourses, as evident from Figure 4, the acceptable trend holds between the DocSys and DocBase generations, and the DocSys generation fluency is actually slightly higher than DocOrig.",
        "This is possibly because the DocOrig texts are from a particular subject matter - weather forecasts for offshore oil rigs in the U.K. - which may be difficult for people in general to understand.",
        "Nonetheless, the demonstrated trend is favorable to our system.",
        "In terms of significance, there are no statistically significant differences between the systems for weather (DocOrig vs. DocSys - ?2=.347, d.f.=1, p=.555; DocOrig vs. DocBase - ?2=.090, d.f.=1, p=.764; DocSys vs. DocBase - ?2=.790, d.f.=1, p=.373).",
        "While this is a good result for comparing DocOrig and DocSys generations, it is not for the other pairs.",

        "For biography, the trend fits nicely both numerically and in terms of statistical significance (DocOrig vs. DocSys - ?2=5.094, d.f.=1, p=.024; DocOrig vs. DocBase - ?2=35.171, d.f.=1, p<.0001; DocSys vs. DocBase - ?2=14.000, d.f.=1, p<.0001).",

        "Similar to the text?understandability task, an acceptable performance pattern should include the DocOrig texts being preferred to both DocSys and DocBase generations and the DocSys generation preferred to the DocBase.",
        "The closer the DocSys generation is to the DocOrig, the better DocSys is performing.",
        "The biography domain illus",
        "In contrast, for weather domain, sentences from DocBase system were preferred to our system's (Figure 6).",
        "We looked at the cases where the preferences were in favor of DocBase.",
        "It appears that because of high syntactic variability, our system can produce quite complex sentences where as the non-experts seem to prefer shorter and simpler sentences because of the complexity of the text.",
        "In terms of significance, there are no statistically significant differences between the systems for weather (DocOrig vs. DocSys - ?2=6.48,",
        "the fluency metric above in that the DocBase system is outperforming the DocOrig generations to an almost statistically significant difference - the remaining comparisons follow the trend.",
        "We believe that this is for similar reasons stated above - i.e., the generation may be a more digestible version of a technical document.",
        "More problematic is the results of the biography evaluations.",
        "Here there is a statistically significant difference between the DocSys and DocOrig and no statistically significant difference between the DocSys and DocBase generations (DocOrig vs. DocSys - ?2=76.880, d.f.=1, p<.0001; DocOrig vs. DocBase - ?2=38.720, d.f.=1, p<.0001; DocSys vs. DocBase - ?2=.720, d.f.=1, p=.396).",
        "Again, this distribution of preferences is numerically similar to the trend we would like to see, but the statistical significance indicates that there is some ground to make up.",

        "For example, the dis-fluent ratings were highest for the DocBase generations and lowest for the DocOrig generations.",
        "Also, the fluent ratings were highest for the DocOrig generations, and while the combined fluent and understandable are higher for DocSys as compared to DocBase, the DocBase generations had a 10% higher fluent score (58.22%) as compared to the DocSys fluent score (47.97%).",
        "Based on notes from the reviewers, the succinctness of the the DocBase generations are preferred in some ways as they are in keeping with certain editorial standards.",

        "adaptable.",
        "Our experiments with both experts and non?experts demonstrate that the system-generated texts are comparable to human?",
        "authored texts.",
        "The development time to adapt our system to new domains is small compared to other NLG systems; around a week to adapt the system to weather and biography domains.",
        "Most of the development time was spent on creating the domain-specific entity taggers for the weather domain.",
        "The development time would be reduced to hours if the historical data for a domain is readily available with the corresponding input data.",
        "The main limitation of our system is that it requires significant historical data.",
        "Our system does consolidate many traditional components (macro-and micro-planning, lexical choice and aggregation),5 but the system cannot be applied to the domains with no historical data.",
        "The quality and the linguistic variability of the generated text is directly proportional to the amount of historical data available.",
        "We also presented a new automatic metric to evaluate generated texts at document collection level to identify boilerplate texts.",
        "This metric computes ?syntactic repetitiveness?",
        "by counting the number of unique template sequences across the given document collection.",
        "Future work will focus on extending our framework by adding additional features to the model that could improve the quality of the generated text.",
        "For example, most NLG pipelines have a separate component responsible for referring expression generation (Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012).",
        "While we address the associated concern of data consumption in Section 3.5, we currently do not have any features that would handle referring expression generation.",
        "We believe that this is possible by identifying referring expressions in templates and adding features to the model to give higher scores to the templates having relevant referring expressions.",
        "We also would like to investigate using all the top-scored templates instead of the highest-scoring template.",
        "This would help achieve better syntactic-variability scores by producing more natural-sounding texts.",
        "5Lexical choice and aggregation are ?handled?",
        "insofar as their existence in the historical data."
