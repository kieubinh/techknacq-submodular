        "In contrast, detecting novel senses has not received as much attention, and is typically addressed within word sense induction, rather than as a distinct SENSESPOTTING task.",
        "Novel sense detection has been mostly motivated by the study of language change over time.",
        "Most approaches model changes in co-occurrence patterns for word types when moving between corpora of old and modern language (Sagi et al., 2009; Cook and Stevenson, 2010; Gulordava and Baroni, 2011).",
        "Since these type-based models do not capture polysemy in the new language, there have been a few attempts at detecting new senses at the token-level as in SENSESPOTTING.",
        "Lau et al. (2012) leverage a common framework to address sense induction and disambiguation based on topic models (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Sense induction is framed as learning topic distributions for a word type, while disambiguation consists of assigning topics to word tokens.",
        "This model can interestingly be used to detect newly coined senses, which might coexist with old senses in recent language.",
        "Bam-man and Crane (2011) use parallel Latin-English data to learn to disambiguate Latin words into English senses.",
        "New English translations are used as evidence that Latin words have shifted sense.",
        "In contrast, the SENSESPOTTING task consists of detecting when senses are unknown in parallel data.",
        "Such novel sense induction methods require manually annotated datasets for the purpose of evaluation.",
        "This is an expensive process and therefore evaluation is typically conducted on a very small scale.",
        "In contrast, our SENSESPOTTING task leverages automatically word-aligned parallel corpora as a source of annotation for supervision during training and evaluation.",
        "The impact of domain on novel senses has also received some attention.",
        "Most approaches operate at the type-level, thus capturing changes in the most frequent sense of a word when shifting domains (McCarthy et al., 2004; McCarthy et al., 2007; Erk, 2006; Chan and Ng, 2007).",
        "Chan and Ng (2007) notably show that detecting changes in predominant sense as modeled by domain sense priors can improve sense disambiguation, even after performing adaptation using active learning.",
        "Finally, SENSESPOTTING has not been addressed directly in MT.",
        "There has been much interest in translation mining from parallel or comparable corpora for unknown words, where it is easy to identify which words need translations.",
        "In contrast, SENSESPOTTING detects when words have new senses and, thus, frequently a new translation.",
        "Work on active learning for machine translation has focused on collecting translations for longer unknown segments (e.g., Bloodgood and Callison-Burch (2010)).",
        "There has been some interest in detecting which phrases that are hard to translate for a given system (Mohit and Hwa, 2007), but difficulties can arise for many reasons: SENSESPOTTING focuses on a single problem."
