        "Grammatical error correction is an important task of natural language processing (NLP).",
        "It has many potential applications and may help millions of people who learn English as a second language (ESL).",
        "As a research field, it faces the challenge of processing ungrammatical language, which is different from other NLP tasks.",
        "The task has received much attention in recent years, and was the focus of two shared tasks on grammatical error correction in 2011 and 2012 (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012).",
        "To detect and correct grammatical errors, two different approaches are typically used -- knowledge engineering or machine learning.",
        "The first relies on handcrafting a set of rules.",
        "For example, the superlative adjective best is preceded by the article the.",
        "In contrast, the machine learning approach formulates the task as a classification problem based on learning from training data.",
        "For example, an article classifier takes a noun phrase (NP) as input and predicts its article using class labels a/an, the, or ?",
        "(no article).",
        "Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.",
        "One can readily handcraft a set of rules to incorporate various prior knowledge from grammar books and dictionaries, but rules often have exceptions and it is difficult to build rules for all grammatical errors.",
        "On the other hand, the machine learning approach can learn from texts written by ESL learners where grammatical errors have been annotated.",
        "However, training data may be noisy and classifiers may need prior knowledge to guide their predictions.",
        "Another consideration in grammatical error correction is how to deal with multiple errors in an input sentence.",
        "Most previous work deals with errors individually: different classifiers (or rules) are developed for different types of errors (article classifier, preposition classifier, etc).",
        "Classifiers are then deployed independently.",
        "An example is a pipeline system, where each classifier takes the output of the previous classifier as its input and proposes corrections of one error type.",
        "One problem of this pipeline approach is that the relations between errors are ignored.",
        "For example, assume that an input sentence contains a cats.",
        "An article classifier may propose to delete a, while a noun number classifier may propose to change cats to cat.",
        "A pipeline approach will choose one of the two corrections based purely on which error classifier is applied first.",
        "Another problem is that when applying a classifier, the surrounding words in the context are assumed to be correct, which is not true if grammatical errors appear close to each other in a sentence.",
        "In this paper, we formulate grammatical error correction as a task suited for joint inference.",
        "Given an input sentence, different types of errors are jointly corrected as follows.",
        "For every possible error correction, we assign a score which measures how grammatical the resulting sentence is if the correction is accepted.",
        "We then choose a set of corrections which will result in a corrected sentence that is judged to be the most grammatical.",
        "The inference problem is solved by integer linear programming (ILP).",
        "Variables of ILP are indicators of possible grammatical error corrections, the objective function aims to select the best set of corrections, and the constraints help to enforce a valid and grammatical output.",
        "Furthermore, ILP not only provides a method to solve the inference problem, but also allows for a natural integration of grammatical constraints into a machine learning approach.",
        "We will show that ILP fully utilizes individual error classifiers, while prior knowledge on grammatical error correction can be easily expressed using linear constraints.",
        "We evaluate our proposed ILP approach on the test data from the Helping Our Own (HOO) 2011 shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011).",
        "Experimental results show that the ILP formulation is competitive with state-of-the-art grammatical error correction systems.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives the related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces a basic ILP formulation.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 improve the basic ILP formulation with more constraints and second order variables, respectively.",
        "Section 6 presents the experimental results.",
        "Section 7 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work The knowledge engineering approach has been used in early grammatical error correction systems (Murata and Nagao, 1993; Bond et al., 1995; Bond and Ikehara, 1996; Heine, 1998).",
        "However, as noted by (Han et al., 2006), rules usually have exceptions, and it is hard to utilize corpus statistics in handcrafted rules.",
        "As such, the machine learning approach has become the dominant approach in grammatical error correction.",
        "Previous work in the machine learning approach typically formulates the task as a classification problem.",
        "Article and preposition errors are the two main research topics (Knight and Chander, 1994; Han et al., 2006; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011).",
        "Features used in classification include surrounding words, part-of-speech tags, language model scores (Gamon, 2010), and parse tree structures (Tetreault et al., 2010).",
        "Learning algorithms used include maximum entropy (Han et al., 2006; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), averaged perceptron, naive Bayes (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011), etc.",
        "Besides article and preposition errors, verb form errors also attract some attention recently (Liu et al., 2010; Tajiri et al., 2012).",
        "Several research efforts have started to deal with correcting different errors in an integrated manner (Gamon, 2011; Park and Levy, 2011; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a).",
        "Gamon (2011) uses a high-order sequential labeling model to detect various errors.",
        "Park and Levy (2011) models grammatical error correction using a noisy channel model, where a predefined generative model produces correct sentences and errors are added through a noise model.",
        "The work of (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a) is probably the closest to our current work.",
        "It uses a beam-search decoder, which iteratively corrects an input sentence to arrive at the best corrected output.",
        "The difference between their work and our ILP approach is that the beam-search decoder returns an approximate solution to the original inference problem, while ILP returns an exact solution to an approximate inference problem.",
        "Integer linear programming has been successfully applied to many NLP tasks, such as dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke, 2006; Martins et al., 2009), semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2005), and event extraction (Riedel and Mc-Callum, 2011).",
        "3 Inference with First Order Variables The inference problem for grammatical error correction can be stated as follows: ?Given an input sentence, choose a set of corrections which results in the best output sentence.?",
        "In this paper, this problem will be expressed and solved by integer linear programming (ILP).",
        "To express an NLP task in the framework of ILP requires the following steps: 1.",
        "Encode the output space of the NLP task using integer variables; 2.",
        "Express the inference objective as a linear objective function; and 3.",
        "Introduce problem-specific constraints to refine the feasible output space.",
        "In the following sections, we follow the above formulation.",
        "For the grammatical error correction task, the variables in ILP are indicators of the corrections that a word needs, the objective function measures how grammatical the whole sentence is if some corrections are accepted, and the constraints guarantee that the corrections do not conflict with each other.",
        "1457 3.1 First Order Variables Given an input sentence, the main question that a grammatical error correction system needs to answer is: What corrections at which positions?",
        "For example, is it reasonable to change the word cats to cat in the sentence A cats sat on the mat?",
        "Given the corrections at various positions in a sentence, the system can readily come up with the corrected sentence.",
        "Thus, a natural way to encode the output space of grammatical error correction requires information about sentence position, error type (e.g., noun number error), and correction (e.g., cat).",
        "Suppose s is an input sentence, and |s| is its length (i.e., the number of words in s).",
        "Define first order variables: Zkl,p ?",
        "{0, 1}, (1) where p?",

        "Deletion of a word is represented as k = ?.",
        "For example, Za Art,1 = 1 means that the article (Art) at position 1 of the sentence should be a.",
        "If Za Art,1 = 0, then the article should not be a. Table 1 contains the error types handled in this work, their possible corrections and applicable positions in a sentence.",
        "3.2 The Objective Function The objective of the inference problem is to find the best output sentence.",
        "However, there are exponentially many different combinations of corrections, and it is not possible to consider all combinations.",
        "Therefore, instead of solving the original inference problem, we will solve an approximate inference problem by introducing the following decomposable assumption: Measuring the output quality of multiple corrections can be decomposed into measuring the quality of the individual corrections.",
        "Let s?",
        "be the resulting sentence if the correction Zkl,p is accepted for s, or for simplicity denoting it as s Zkl,p???",

        "This linear objective function aims to select a set of Zkl,p, such that the sum of their weights is the largest among all possible candidate corrections, which in turn gives the most grammatical sentence under the decomposable assumption.",
        "Although the decomposable assumption is a strong assumption, it performs well in practice, and one can relax the assumption by using higher order variables (see Section 5).",
