        "The Web provides an extremely large volume of textual content on diverse topics and areas.",
        "Such data is beneficial for constructing a large scale monolingual (Microsoft Web N-gram Services, 2010; Google N-gram Corpus, 2006) and bilingual (Nie et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2006; Ishisaka et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2009) corpus that can be used for training statistical models for NLP tools, as well as for building a large-scale knowledge-base (Suchanek et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2009; Fader et al., 2011; Nakashole et al., 2012).",
        "With recent advances in statistical machine translation (SMT) systems and their wide adoption in Web services through APIs (Microsoft Translator, 2009; Google Translate, 2006), a large amount of text in Web pages is translated by SMT systems.",
        "According to Rarrick et al. (2011), their Web crawler finds that more than 15% of English-Japanese parallel documents are machine translation.",
        "Machine-translated sentences are useful if they are of sufficient quality and indistinguishable from human-generated sentences; however, the quality of these machine-translated sentences is generally much lower than sentences generated by native speakers and professional translators.",
        "Therefore, a method to detect and filter such SMT results is desired to best make use of Web-mined data.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose a method for automatically detecting Web-text translated by SMT systems1.",
        "We especially target machine-translated text produced through the Web APIs that is rapidly increasing.",
        "We focus on the phrase salad phenomenon (Lopez, 2008), which characterizes translations by existing SMT systems, i.e., each phrase in a sentence is semantically and syntactically correct but becomes incorrect when combined with other phrases in the sentence.",
        "Based on this trait, we propose features for evaluating the likelihood of machine-translated sentences and use a classifier to determine whether the sentence is generated by the SMT systems.",
        "The primary contributions of the proposed method are threefold.",
        "First, unlike previous studies that use parallel text and bilingual features, such as (Rarrick et al., 2011), our method only requires monolingual text as input.",
        "Therefore, our method can be used in monolingual Web data mining where bilingual information is unavailable.",
        "Second, the proposed features are designed to be computationally light so that the method is suitable for handling a large-scale Web-mined data.",
        "Our method determines if an input sentence contains phrase salads using a simple yet effective features, i.e., language models (LMs) and automatically obtained non-contiguous phrases that are frequently used by people but difficult for SMT systems to generate.",
        "Third, our method computes features using both human-generated text and SMT 1In this paper, the term machine-translated is used for indicating translation by SMT systems.",
        "results to capture a phrase salad by contrasting these features, which significantly improves detection accuracy.",
        "We evaluate our method using Japanese and English datasets, including a human evaluation to assess its performance.",
        "The results show that our method achieves an accuracy of 95.8% for sentences and 80.6% for noisy Web-text."

        "By evaluating the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) of translated documents (by their decoder) against the target-side documents, machine translation (MT) results are detected.",
        "Rarrick et al. (2011) extract a variety of features, such as the number of tokens and character types, from sentences in both the source and target languages to capture words that are mistranslated by MT systems.",
        "With these features, the likelihood of a bilingual sentence pair being machine-translated can be determined.",
        "Confidence estimation of MT results is also a related area.",
        "These studies aim to precisely replicate human judgment in terms of the quality of machine-translated sentences based on features extracted using a syntactic parser (CorstonOliver et al., 2001; Gamon et al., 2005; Avramidis et al., 2011) or essay scoring system (Parton et al., 2011), assuming that their input is always machine-translated.",
        "In contrast, our method aims at making a binary judgment to distinguish machine-translated sentences from a mixture of machine-translated and human-generated sentences.",
        "In addition, although methods for confidence estimation can assume sentences of a known source language and reference translations as inputs, these are unavailable in our problem setting.",
        "Another related area is automatic grammatical error detection for English as a second language (ESL) learners (Leacock et al., 2010).",
        "We use common features that are also used in this area.",
        "They target specific error types commonly made by ESL learners, such as errors in prepositions and subject-verb agreement.",
        "In contrast, our method does not specify error types and aims to detect machine-translated sentences focusing on the phrase salad phenomenon produced by SMT systems.",
        "In addition, errors generated by ESL learners and SMT systems are different.",
        "ESL learners make spelling and grammar mistakes at the word level but their sentence are generally structured while SMT results are unstructured due to phrase salads.",
        "Works on translationese detection (Baroni and Bernardini, 2005; Kurokawa et al., 2009; Ilisei et al., 2010) aim to automatically identify human-translated text by professionals using text generated by native speakers.",
        "These are related, but our work focuses on machine-translated text.",
        "The closest to our approach is the method proposed by Moore and Lewis (2010).",
        "It automatically selects data for creating a domain-specific LM.",
        "Specifically, the method constructs LMs using corpora of target and non-target domains and computes a cross-entropy score of an input sentence for estimating the likelihood that the input sentence belongs to the target or non-target domains.",
        "While the context is different, our work uses a similar idea of data selection for the purpose of detecting low-quality sentences translated by SMT systems."

        "The Word LMs show the best accuracy that outperforms Cross-Entropy by 3.4% and Lexical Feature by 6.3%.",
        "This high accuracy is achieved by contrasting fluency in human-generated and machine-translated text to capture the phrase salad phenomenon.",
        "The accuracy of Word LM trained only on human-generated sentences is limited to 65.5%.",
        "On the other hand, the accuracy of Word LM trained on machine-translated sentences shows a better performance (84.4%).",

        "It is interesting that Lexical Feature achieves a high accuracy of 87.8% despite its simplicity.",
        "Since Lexical Feature is a bag-of-words model, it can consider distant words in a sentence.",
        "This is effective for capturing a phrase salad that occurs among distant phrases, which N gram cannot cover.",
        "As for Cross-Entropy, a simple subtraction of cross-entropy scores cannot well contrast the fluency in human-generated and machine-translated text and results in poorer accuracy than Word LMs.",
        "The accuracy of POS LMs (91.3%) is slightly lower than that of Word LMs due to the limited vocabulary, i.e., the number of POSs.",
        "The accuracy of FW LMs and GPs are even lower.",
        "This is convincing since these features cannot have reasonable values when a sentence does not include a function word and gappy-phrase.",
        "However, these features are complementary to Word LMs as we will see in the next paragraph.",
        "Effect of Feature Combination Table 5 shows the accuracy when combining features.",
        "Sign tests show that the accuracy scores of these feature combinations are significantly different (p .01) against the accuracy of Word LMs.",
        "The results show that the features complement each other.",
        "The",
        "accuracy (%) of proposed method on the different errors combination of all features reaches an accuracy of 95.8%, which improves the accuracy of Word LMs by 1.7%.",
        "This result supports that FW LMs and GPs are effective to capture a phrase salad occurring in distant phrases and complement the evidence in N grams that is captured by LMs.",
        "This effect becomes more obvious in the human evaluation.",
        "We also evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method at a document level.",
        "Due to the high accuracy at the sentence-level, we use a voting method to judge a document, i.e., deciding if the document is machine-translated when ?% of its sentences are judged as machine-translated.",

        "It indicates that the accuracy of Word LMs is improved by feature combination; from 1.4% on sentences of ?Has wrong inflections?",
        "to 4.7% on sentences of ?Misses content words?.",
        "Effect of Sentence Length The accuracy of the proposed method is significantly affected by sentence length (the number of words in a sentence).",

        "The proposed method shows the similar trend with the human annotations, and even the accuracy of human annotations significantly drops on such short sentences.",
        "This result indicates that SMT results on short sentences tend to be of sufficient quality and indistinguishable from human-generated sentences.",
        "Since such high-quality machine-translations do not harm the quality of Web-mined data, we do not need to detect them.",

        "This is because POS LMs need more evidence to compensate for their limited vocabulary.",
        "FW LMs become stable at 3-gram because the possible number of function words in a sentence should be small.",
        "When we change the size of the development dataset with 10% increments, the accuracy curve is stabilized when the size is 40% of all set.",
