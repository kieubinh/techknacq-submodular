        "We identify common linguistic cues for these classes, including factive verbs, implicatives, hedges, and subjective intensifiers.",
        "These insights help us develop features for a model to solve a new prediction task of practical importance: given a biased sentence, identify the bias-inducing word.",

        "Writers and editors of reference works such as encyclopedias, textbooks, and scientific articles strive to keep their language unbiased.",
        "For example, Wikipedia advocates a policy called neutral point of view (NPOV), according to which articles should represent ?fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources?",
        "(Wikipedia, 2013b).",
        "Wikipedia's style guide asks editors to use nonjudgmental language, to indicate the relative prominence of opposing points of view, to avoid presenting uncontroversial facts as mere opinion, and, conversely, to avoid stating opinions or contested assertions as facts.",
        "Understanding the linguistic realization of bias is important for linguistic theory; automatically detecting these biases is equally significant for computational linguistics.",
        "We propose to address both by using a powerful resource: edits in Wikipedia that are specifically designed to remove bias.",
        "Since Wikipedia maintains a complete revision history, the edits associated with NPOV tags allow us to compare the text in its biased (before) and unbiased (after) form, helping us better understand the linguistic realization of bias.",
        "Our work thus shares the intuition of prior NLP work applying Wikipedia's revision history (Nelken and Yamangil, 2008; Yatskar et al., 2010; Max and Wisniewski, 2010; Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010).",
        "The analysis of Wikipedia's edits provides valuable linguistic insights into the nature of biased language.",
        "We find two major classes of bias-driven edits.",
        "The first, framing bias, is realized by subjective words or phrases linked with a particular point of view.",
        "In (1), the term McMansion, unlike homes, appeals to a negative attitude toward large and pretentious houses.",
        "The second class, epistemological bias, is related to linguistic features that subtly (often via presupposition) focus on the believability of a proposition.",
        "In (2), the assertive stated removes the bias introduced by claimed, which casts doubt on Kuypers?",
        "statement.",

        "Usually, smaller cottage-style houses have been demolished to make way for these homes.",
        "(2) a. Kuypers claimed that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints.",
        "b. Kuypers stated that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints.",
        "Bias is linked to the lexical and grammatical cues identified by the literature on subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2011), sentiment (Liu et al., 2005; Turney, 2002), and especially stance",
        "or ?arguing subjectivity?",
        "(Lin et al., 2006; So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Yano et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011; Conrad et al., 2012).",
        "For example, like stance, framing bias is realized when the writer of a text takes a particular position on a controversial topic and uses its metaphors and vocabulary.",
        "But unlike the product reviews or debate articles that overtly use subjective language, editors in Wikipedia are actively trying to avoid bias, and hence biases may appear more subtly, in the form of covert framing language, or presuppositions and entailments that may not play as important a role in other genres.",
        "Our linguistic analysis identifies common classes of these subtle bias cues, including factive verbs, implicatives and other entailments, hedges, and subjective intensifiers.",
        "Using these cues could help automatically detect and correct instances of bias, by first finding biased phrases, then identifying the word that introduces the bias, and finally rewording to eliminate the bias.",
        "In this paper we propose a solution for the second of these tasks, identifying the bias-inducing word in a biased phrase.",
        "Since, as we show below, this task is quite challenging for humans, our system has the potential to be very useful in improving the neutrality of reference works like Wikipedia.",
        "Tested on a subset of non-neutral sentences from Wikipedia, our model achieves 34% accuracy?and up to 59% if the top three guesses are considered?on this difficult task, outperforming four baselines and nearing humans tested on the same data."

        "Unlike the blogs, online debates and opinion pieces which have been the major focus of previous work, bias in reference works is undesirable.",
        "As a result, the expression of bias is more implicit, making it harder to detect by both computers and humans.",
        "Of the two classes of bias that we uncover, framing bias is indeed strongly linked to subjectivity, but epistemological bias is not.",
        "In this respect, our research is comparable to Greene and Resnik's (2009) work on identifying implicit sentiment or perspective in journalistic texts, based on semantico-syntactic choices.",
        "Given that the data that we use is not supposed to be opinionated, our task consists in detecting (implicit) bias instead of classifying into side A or B documents about a controversial topic like ObamaCare (Conrad et al., 2012) or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Lin et al., 2006; Greene and Resnik, 2009).",
        "Our model detects whether all the relevant perspectives are fairly represented by identifying statements that are one-sided.",
        "To this end, the features based on subjectivity and sentiment lexicons turn out to be helpful, and incorporating more features for stance detection is an important direction for future work.",
        "Other aspects of Wikipedia structure have been used for other NLP applications.",
        "The Wikipedia revision history has been used for spelling correction, text summarization (Nelken and Yamangil, 2008), lexical simplification (Yatskar et al., 2010), paraphrasing (Max and Wisniewski, 2010), and textual entailment (Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010).",

        "Our study of bias in Wikipedia has implications for linguistic theory and computational linguistics.",
        "We show that bias in reference works falls broadly into two classes, framing and epistemological.",
        "The cues to framing bias are more explicit and are linked to the literature on subjectivity; cues to epistemological bias are subtle and implicit, linked to presuppositions and entailments in the text.",
        "Epistemological bias has not received much attention since it does not play a major role in overtly opinionated texts, the focus of much research on stance recognition.",
        "However, our logistic regression model reveals that epistemological and other features can usefully augment the traditional sentiment and subjectivity features for addressing the difficult task of identifying the bias-inducing word in a biased sentence.",
        "Identifying the bias-inducing word is a challenging task even for humans.",
        "Our linguistically-informed model performs nearly as well as humans tested on the same task.",
        "Given the subtlety of some of these biases, an automated system that highlights one or more potentially biased words would provide a helpful tool for editors of reference works and news reports, not only making them aware of unnoticed biases but also saving them hours of time.",
        "Future work could investigate the incorporation of syntactic features or further features from the stance detection literature.",
        "Features from the literature on veridicality (de Marneffe et al., 2012) could be informative of the writer's commitment to the truth of the events described, and document-level features could help assess the extent to which the article provides a balanced account of all the facts and points of view.",
        "Finally, the NPOV data and the bias lexicon that we release as part of this research could prove useful in other bias related tasks."
