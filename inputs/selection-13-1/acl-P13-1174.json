        "minds (Mohammad and Turney, 2010).",
        "Although some researchers have explored formal and statistical treatments of those implicit and implied sentiments (e.g. Wiebe et al. (2005), Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Greene and Resnik (2009), Davidov et al. (2010)), automatic analysis of them largely remains as a big challenge.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on understanding the connotative sentiments of words, as they play an important role in interpreting subtle shades of sentiment beyond denotative or surface meaning of text.",
        "For instance, consider the following: Geothermal replaces oil-heating; it helps reducing greenhouse emissions.1 Although this sentence could be considered as a factual statement from the general standpoint, the subtle effect of this sentence may not be entirely objective: this sentence is likely to have an influence on readers?",
        "minds in regard to their opinion toward ?geothermal?.",
        "In order to sense the subtle overtone of sentiments, one needs to know that the word ?emissions?",
        "has generally negative connotation, which geothermal reduces.",
        "In fact, depending on the pragmatic contexts, it could be precisely the intention of the author to transfer his opinion into the readers?",
        "minds.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is a broad-coverage connotation lexicon that determines the connotative polarity of even those words with ever so subtle connotation beneath their surface meaning, such as ?Literature?, ?Mediterranean?, and ?wine?.",
        "Although there has been a number of previous work that constructed sentiment lexicons (e.g., Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Wilson et al. (2005a), Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007), Qiu et al.",
        "(2009)), which seem to be increasingly and inevitably expanding over words with (strongly) connotative sentiments rather than explicit sentiments alone (e.g., ?gun?",
        "), little prior work has directly tackled this problem of learning connotation,2 and much of the subtle connotation of many seemingly objective words is yet to be determined."

        "A central premise to our approach is that it is collocational statistics of words that affect and shape the polarity of connotation.",

        "is from the Latin ?com?",
        "(?together or with?)",
        "and ?notare?",
        "(?to mark?).",
        "It is important to clarify, however, that we do not simply assume that words that collocate share the same polarity of connotation.",
        "Although such an assumption played a key role in previous work for the analogous task of learning sentiment lexicon (Velikovich et al., 2010), we expect that the same assumption would be less reliable in drawing subtle connotative sentiments of words.",

        "sense.",
        "Therefore, in order to attain a broad coverage lexicon while maintaining good precision, we guide the induction algorithm with multiple, carefully selected linguistic insights: [1] distributional similarity, [2] semantic parallelism of coordination, [3] selectional preference, and [4] semantic prosody (e.g., Sinclair (1991), Louw (1993), Stubbs (1995), Stefanowitsch and Gries (2003))), and also exploit existing lexical resources as an additional inductive bias.",
        "We cast the connotation lexicon induction task as a collective inference problem, and consider approaches based on three distinct types of algorithmic framework that have been shown successful for conventional sentiment lexicon induction: Random walk based on HITS/PageRank (e.g., Kleinberg (1999), Page et al. (1999), Feng et al. (2011) Heerschop et al. (2011), Montejo-Ra?ez et al. (2012)) Label/Graph propagation (e.g., Zhu and Ghahra(2011) but with practical limitations.",

        "We provide comparative empirical results over several variants of these approaches with comprehensive evaluations including lexicon-based, human judgments, and extrinsic evaluations.",
        "It is worthwhile to note that not all words have connotative meanings that are distinct from denotational meanings, and in some cases, it can be difficult to determine whether the overall sentiment is drawn from denotational or connotative meanings exclusively, or both.",
        "Therefore, we encompass any sentiment from either type of meanings into the lexicon, where non-neutral polarity prevails over neutral one if some meanings lead to neutral while others to non-neutral.4 Our work results in the first broad-coverage connotation lexicon,5 significantly improving both the coverage and the precision of Feng et al. (2011).",
