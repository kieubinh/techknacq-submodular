        "The simplest models may use lexical information alone.",
        "The seminal Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) has proved very powerful, performing nearly as well as more complicated models in some phrasal systems (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "With minor improvements to initialization (Moore, 2004) (which may be important (Toutanova and Galley, 2011)), it can be quite competitive.",
        "Subsequent IBM models include more detailed information about context.",
        "Models 2 and 3 incorporate a positional model based on the absolute position of the word; Models 4 and 5 use a relative position model instead (an English word tends to align to a French word that is nearby the French word aligned to the previous English word).",

        ": the number of French words that align to any English word.",
        "Although these latter models covered a broad range of phenomena, estimation techniques and MAP inference were challenging.",
        "The authors originally recommended heuristic procedures based on local search for both.",
        "Such methods work reasonably well, but can be computationally inefficient and have few guarantees.",
        "Thus, many researchers have switched to the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996) and variants with more parameters (He, 2007).",
        "This captures the positional information in the IBM models in a framework that admits exact parameter estimation inference, though the objective function is not concave: local maxima are a concern.",
        "Modeling fertility is challenging in the HMM framework as it violates the Markov assumption.",
        "Where the HMM jump model considers only the prior state, fertility requires looking across the whole state space.",
        "Therefore, the standard forward-backward and Viterbi algorithms do not apply.",
        "Recent work (Zhao and Gildea, 2010) described an extension to the HMM with a fertility model, using MCMC techniques for parameter estimation.",
        "However, they do not have a efficient means of MAP inference, which is necessary in many applications such as machine translation.",
