        "For years, the standard way to do statistical machine translation parameter tuning has been to use minimum error-rate training, or MERT (Och, 2003).",
        "However, as researchers started using models with thousands of parameters, new scalable optimization algorithms such as MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) and PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) have emerged.",
        "As these algorithms are relatively new, they are still not quite well understood, and studying their properties is an active area of research.",
        "For example, Nakov et al. (2012) have pointed out that PRO tends to generate translations that are consistently shorter than desired.",
        "They have blamed this on inadequate smoothing in PRO's optimization objective, namely sentence-level BLEU+1, and they have addressed the problem using more sensible smoothing.",
        "We wondered whether the issue could be partially relieved simply by tuning on longer sentences, for which the effect of smoothing would naturally be smaller.",
        "To our surprise, tuning on the longer 50% of the tuning sentences had a disastrous effect on PRO, causing an absolute drop of three BLEU points on testing; at the same time, MERT and MIRA did not have such a problem.",
        "While investigating the reasons, we discovered hundreds of monsters creeping under PRO's surface... Our tale continues as follows.",
        "We first explain what monsters are in Section 2, then we present a theory about how they can be slayed in Section 3, we put this theory to test in practice in Section 4, and we discuss some related efforts in Section 5.",
        "Finally, we present the moral of our tale, and we hint at some planned future battles in Section 6."

        "As a result, PRO keeps jumping up and down and converges to random values, as Figure 1 shows.",
        "By default, PRO's parameters are averaged over iterations, and thus the final result is quite mediocre, but selecting the highest tuning score does not solve the problem either: for example, on Figure 1, PRO never achieves a BLEU better than that for the default initialization parameters.",
