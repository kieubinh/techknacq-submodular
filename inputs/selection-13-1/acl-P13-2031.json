        "Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a critical and a necessary initial procedure with respect to the majority of high-level Chinese language processing tasks such as syntax parsing, information extraction and machine translation, since Chinese scripts are written in continuous characters without explicit word boundaries.",
        "Although supervised CWS models (Xue, 2003; Zhao et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Sun, 2011) proposed in the past years showed some reasonably accurate results, the outstanding problem is that they rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data.",
        "However, the production of segmented Chinese texts is time-consuming and expensive, since hand-labeling individual words and word boundaries is very hard (Jiao et al., 2006).",
        "So, one cannot rely only on the manually segmented data to build an everlasting model.",
        "This naturally provides motivation for using easily accessible raw texts to enhance supervised CWS models, in semi-supervised approaches.",
        "In the past years, however, few semi-supervised CWS models have been proposed.",
        "Xu et al. (2008) described a Bayesian semi-supervised model by considering the segmentation as the hidden variable in machine translation.",
        "Sun and Xu (2011) enhanced the segmentation results by interpolating the statistics-based features derived from unlabeled data to a CRFs model.",
        "Another similar trial via ?feature engineering?",
        "was conducted by Wang et al. (2011).",
        "The crux of solving semi-supervised learning problem is the learning on unlabeled data.",
        "Inspired by multi-view learning that exploits redundant views of the same input data (Ganchev et al., 2008), this paper proposes a semi-supervised CWS model of co-regularizing from two different views (intrinsically two different models), character-based and word-based, on unlabeled data.",
        "The motivation comes from that the two types of model exhibit different strengths and they are mutually complementary (Sun, 2010; Wang et al., 2010).",
        "The proposed approach begins by training a character-based and word-based model on labeled data respectively, and then both models are regularized from each view by their segmentation agreements, i.e., the identical outputs, of unlabeled data.",
        "This paper introduces segmentation agreements as gainful knowledge for guiding the learning on the texts without label information.",
        "Moreover, in order to better combine the strengths of the two models, the proposed approach uses a joint scoring function in a log-linear combination form for the decoding in the segmentation phase."
