        "Story segmentation refers to partitioning a multimedia stream into homogenous segments each embodying a main topic or coherent story (Allan, 2002).",
        "With the explosive growth of multimedia data, it becomes difficult to retrieve the most relevant components.",
        "For indexing broadcast news programs, it is desirable to divide each of them into a number of independent stories.",
        "Manual segmentation is accurate but labor-intensive and costly.",
        "Therefore, automatic story segmentation approaches are highly demanded.",
        "Lexical-cohesion based approaches have been widely studied for automatic broadcast news story segmentation (Beeferman et al., 1997; Choi, 1999; Hearst, 1997; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2006; ?corresponding author Lo et al., 2009; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Yamron et al., 1999; Tur et al., 2001).",

        "Moreover, polysemy and synonymy are not considered.",
        "To deal with these problems, some topic model techniques which provide conceptual level matching have been introduced to text and story segmentation task (Hearst, 1997).",
        "Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) is a typical instance and used widely.",
        "PLSA is the probabilistic variant of latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Choi et al., 2001), and offers a more solid statistical foundation.",
        "PLSA provides more significant improvement than LSA for story segmentation (Lu et al., 2011; Blei and Moreno, 2001).",
        "Despite the success of PLSA, there are concerns that the number of parameters in PLSA grows linearly with the size of the corpus.",
        "This makes PLSA not desirable if there is a considerable amount of data available, and causes serious over-fitting problems (Blei, 2012).",
        "To deal with this issue, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (L-DA) (Blei et al., 2003) has been proposed.",
        "LDA has been proved to be effective in many segmentation tasks (Arora and Ravindran, 2008; Hall et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Riedl and Biemann, 2012; Chien and Chueh, 2012).",

        "To further improve the segmentation performance, using latent topic distributions and LE instead of term frequencies to represent text blocks is studied in this paper.",
        "We study the effects of the size of training data and the number of latent topics on the LDA-based and the PLSA-based approaches.",
