        "Thus, the same task will be carried out for English and a morphologically rich language.",

        "Light verb constructions (e.g. to give advice) are a subtype of multiword expressions (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "They consist of a nominal and a verbal component where the verb functions as the syntactic head, but the semantic head is the noun.",
        "The verbal component (also called a light verb) usually loses its original sense to some extent.",
        "Although it is the noun that conveys most of the meaning of the construction, the verb itself cannot be viewed as semantically bleached (Apresjan, 2004; Alonso Ramos, 2004; Sanroma?n Vilas, 2009) since it also adds important aspects to the meaning of the construction (for instance, the beginning of an action, such as set on fire, see Mel?c?uk (2004)).",
        "The meaning of LVCs can be only partially computed on the basis of the meanings of their parts and the way they are related to each other, hence it is important to treat them in a special way in many NLP applications.",
        "LVCs are usually distinguished from productive or literal verb + noun constructions on the one hand and idiomatic verb + noun expressions on the other (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007).",
        "Variativ-ity and omitting the verb play the most significant role in distinguishing LVCs from productive constructions and idioms (Vincze, 2011).",
        "Variativity reflects the fact that LVCs can be often substituted by a verb derived from the same root as the nominal component within the construction: productive constructions and idioms can be rarely substituted by a single verb (like make a decision ?",
        "decide).",
        "Omitting the verb exploits the fact that it is the nominal component that mostly bears the semantic content of the LVC, hence the event denoted by the construction can be determined even without the verb in most cases.",
        "Furthermore, the very same noun + verb combination may function as an LVC in certain contexts while it is just a productive construction in other ones, compare He gave her a",
        "ring made of gold (non-LVC) and He gave her a ring because he wanted to hear her voice (LVC), hence it is important to identify them in context.",
        "In theoretical linguistics, Kearns (2002) distinguishes between two subtypes of light verb constructions.",
        "True light verb constructions such as to give a wipe or to have a laugh and vague action verbs such as to make an agreement or to do the ironing differ in some syntactic and semantic features and can be separated by various tests, e.g. passivization, WH-movement, pronom-inalization etc.",
        "This distinction also manifests in natural language processing as several authors pay attention to the identification of just true light verb constructions, e.g. Tu and Roth (2011).",
        "However, here we do not make such a distinction and aim to identify all types of light verb constructions both in English and in Hungarian, in accordance with the annotation principles of SZPFX.",
        "The canonical form of a Hungarian light verb construction is a bare noun + third person singular verb.",
        "However, they may occur in non-canonical versions as well: the verb may precede the noun, or the noun and the verb may be not adjacent due to the free word order.",
        "Moreover, as Hungarian is a morphologically rich language, the verb may occur in different surface forms inflected for tense, mood, person and number.",
        "These features will be paid attention to when implementing our system for detecting Hungarian LVCs."

        "the Szeged Treebank (Vincze and Csirik, 2010) and Wiki50 (Vincze et al., 2011b) ?, which were manually annotated for LVCs on the basis of similar principles as SZPFX, so we exploited these corpora when defining our features.",
        "To automatically identify LVCs in running texts, a machine learning based approach was applied.",
        "This method first parsed each sentence and extracted potential LVCs.",
        "Afterwards, a binary classification method was utilized, which can automatically classify potential LVCs as an LVC or not.",
        "This binary classifier was based on a rich feature set described below.",
        "The candidate extraction method investigated the dependency relation among the verbs and nouns.",
        "Verb-object, verb-subject, verb-prepositional object, verb-other argument (in the case of Hungarian) and noun-modifier pairs were collected from the texts.",
        "The dependency labels were provided by the Bohnet parser (Bohnet, 2010) for English and by magyarlanc 2.0 (Zsibrita et al., 2013) for Hungarian.",
        "The features used by the binary classifier can be categorised as follows: Morphological features: As the nominal component of LVCs is typically derived from a verbal stem (make a decision) or coincides with a verb (have a walk), the VerbalStem binary feature focuses on the stem of the noun; if it had a verbal nature, the candidates were marked as true.",
        "The POS-pattern feature investigates the POS-tag sequence of the potential LVC.",
        "If it matched one pattern typical of LVCs (e.g. verb + noun) the candidate was marked as true; otherwise as false.",
        "The English auxiliary verbs, do and have often occur as light verbs, hence we defined a feature for the two verbs to denote whether or not they were auxiliary verbs in a given sentence.The POS code of the next word of LVC candidate was also applied as a feature.",
        "As Hungarian is a morphologically rich language, we were able to define various morphology-based features like the case of the noun or its number etc.",
        "Nouns which were historically derived from verbs but were not treated as derivation by the Hungarian morphological parser were also added as a feature.",
        "Semantic features: This feature also exploited the fact that the nominal component is usually derived from verbs.",
        "Consequently, the activity or event semantic senses were looked for among the upper level hyperonyms of the head of the noun phrase in English WordNet 3.11 and in the Hungarian WordNet (Miha?ltz et al., 2008).",
        "Orthographic features: The suffix feature is also based on the fact that many nominal components in LVCs are derived from verbs.",
        "This feature checks whether the lemma of the noun ended in a given character bi-or trigram.",
        "The number of words of the candidate LVC was also noted and applied as a feature.",
        "Statistical features: Potential English LVCs and their occurrences were collected from 10,000 English Wikipedia pages by the candidate extraction method.",
        "The number of occurrences was used as a feature when the candidate was one of the syntactic phrases collected.",
        "Lexical features: We exploit the fact that the most common verbs are typically light verbs.",
        "Therefore, fifteen typical light verbs were selected from the list of the most frequent verbs taken from the Wiki50 (Vincze et al., 2011b) in the case of English and from the Szeged Treebank (Vincze and",
        "Csirik, 2010) in the case of Hungarian.",
        "Then, we investigated whether the lemmatised verbal component of the candidate was one of these fifteen verbs.",
        "The lemma of the noun was also applied as a lexical feature.",
        "The nouns found in LVCs were collected from the above-mentioned corpora.",
        "Afterwards, we constructed lists of lemmatised LVCs got from the other corpora.",
        "Syntactic features: As the candidate extraction methods basically depended on the dependency relation between the noun and the verb, they could also be utilised in identifying LVCs.",
        "Though the dobj, prep, rcmod, partmod or nsubjpass dependency labels were used in candidate extraction in the case of English, these syntactic relations were defined as features, while the att, obj, obl, subj dependency relations were used in the case of Hungarian.",
        "When the noun had a determiner in the candidate LVC, it was also encoded as another syntactic feature.",
        "Our feature set includes language-independent and language-specific features as well.",
        "Language-independent features seek to acquire general features of LVCs while language-specific features can be applied due to the different grammatical characteristics of the two languages or due to the availability of different resources.",
        "Table 1 shows which features were applied for which language.",
        "We experimented with several learning algorithms and decision trees have been proven performing best.",

        "The J48 classifier was trained with the above-mentioned features and we evaluated it in a 10-fold cross validation.",
        "The potential LVCs which are extracted by the candidate extraction method but not marked as positive in the gold standard were classed as negative.",
        "As just the positive LVCs were annotated on the SZPFX corpus, the F?=1 score interpreted on the positive class was employed as an evaluation metric.",
        "The candidate extraction methods could not detect all LVCs in the corpus data, so some positive elements in the corpora were not covered.",

        "Table 2 lists the results got on the two different parts of SZPFX using the machine learning-based approach and the baseline dictionary matching.",
        "The dictionary matching approach yielded the highest precision on the English part of SZPFX, namely 73.71%.",
        "However, the machine learning-based approach proved to be the most successful as it achieved an F-score that was 18.26 higher than that with dictionary matching.",
        "Hence, this method turned out to be more effective regarding recall.",
        "At the same time, the machine learning and dictionary matching methods got roughly the same precision score on the Hungarian part of SZPFX, but again the machine learning-based approach achieved the best F-score.",

      "heading": "6 Discussion",
      "text": [
        "According to the results, our base system is robust enough to achieve approximately the same results on two typologically different languages.",
        "Language-specific features further contribute to the performance as shown by the ablation analysis.",
        "It should be also mentioned that some of the base features (e.g. POS-patterns, which we thought would be useful for English due to the fixed word order) were originally inspired by one of the languages and later expanded to the other one (i.e. they were included in the base feature set) since it was also effective in the case of the other language.",
        "Thus, a multilingual approach may be also beneficial in the case of monolingual applications as well.",
        "The most obvious difference between the performances on the two languages is the recall scores (the difference being 6.87 percentage points between the two languages).",
        "This may be related to the fact that the distribution of light verbs is quite different in the two languages.",
        "While the top 15 verbs covers more than 80% of the English LVCs, in Hungarian, this number is only 63% (and in order to reach the same coverage, 38 verbs should be included).",
        "Another difference is that there are 102",
        "different verbs in English, which follow the Zipf distribution, on the other hand, there are 157 Hungarian verbs with a more balanced distributional pattern.",
        "Thus, fewer verbs cover a greater part of LVCs in English than in Hungarian and this also explains why lexical features contribute more to the overall performance in English.",
        "This fact also indicates that if verb lists are further extended, still better recall scores may be achieved for both languages.",
        "As for the effectiveness of morphological and syntactic features, morphological features perform better on a language with a rich morphological representation (Hungarian).",
        "However, syntax plays a more important role in LVC detection in English: the added value of syntax is higher for the English corpora than for the Hungarian one, where syntactic features are also encoded in suffixes, i.e. morphological information.",
        "We carried out an error analysis in order to see how our system could be further improved and the errors reduced.",
        "We concluded that there were some general and language-specific errors as well.",
        "Among the general errors, we found that LVCs with a rare light verb were difficult to recognize (e.g. to utter a lie).",
        "In other cases, an originally deverbal noun was used in a lexicalised sense together with a typical light verb ((e.g. buildings are given (something)) and these candidates were falsely classed as LVCs.",
        "Also, some errors in POS-tagging or dependency parsing also led to some erroneous predictions.",
        "As for language-specific errors, English verb-particle combinations (VPCs) followed by a noun were often labeled as LVCs such as make up his mind or give in his notice.",
        "In Hungarian, verb + proper noun constructions (Hamletet ja?tssza?k (Hamlet-ACC play-3PL.DEF) ?they are playing Hamlet?)",
        "were sometimes regarded as LVCs since the morphological analysis does not make a distinction between proper and common nouns.",
        "These language-specific errors may be eliminated by integrating a VPC detector and a named entity recognition system into the English and Hungarian systems, respectively.",
        "Although there has been a considerable amount of literature on English LVC identification (see Section 3), our results are not directly comparable to them.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that different authors aimed to identify a different scope of linguistic phenomena and thus interpreted the concept of ?light verb construction?",
        "slightly differently.",
        "For instance, Tu and Roth (2011) and Tan et al. (2006) focused only on true light verb constructions while only object?verb pairs are considered in other studies (Stevenson et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Cook et al., 2007; Bannard, 2007; Tu and Roth, 2011).",
        "Several other studies report results only on light verb constructions formed with certain light verbs (Stevenson et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2006; Tu and Roth, 2011).",
        "In contrast, we aimed to identify all kinds of LVCs, i.e. we did not apply any restrictions on the nature of LVCs to be detected.",
        "In other words, our task was somewhat more difficult than those found in earlier literature.",
        "Although our results are somewhat lower on English LVC detection than those attained by previous studies, we think that despite the difficulty of the task, our method could offer promising results for identifying all types of LVCs both in English and in Hungarian."
