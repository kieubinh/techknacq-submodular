        "Parallel corpora as an important component of a statistical machine translation system are unfortunately unavailable for all pairs of languages, particularly in low resource languages and also producing it consumes time and cost.",
        "So, new ideas have been developed about how to make a MT system which has lower dependency on parallel data like using comparable corpora for improving performance of a MT system with small parallel corpora or making a MT system without parallel corpora.",
        "Comparable corpora have segments with the same translations.",
        "These segments might be in the form of words, phrases or sentences.",
        "So, this extracted information can be added to the parallel corpus or might be used for adaption of the language model or translation model.",
        "Comparable corpora are easily available resources.",
        "All texts that are about the same topic can be considered as comparable corpora.",
        "Another idea for solving the scarce resource problem is to use a high resource language as a pivot to bridge between source and target languages.",
        "In this paper we use the bridge technique to make a source-target system and we will prune the phrase table of this system.",
        "In Section 2, the related works of the bridge approach are considered, in Section 3 the proposed approach will be explained and it will be shown how to prune the phrase table using context vectors, and experiments on German-English-Farsi systems will be presented in Section 4."

        "There are different strategies of bridge techniques to make a MT system.",
        "The simplest way is to build two MT systems in two sides: one system is source-pivot and the other is pivot-target system, then in the translation stage the output of the first system is given to the second system as an input and the output of the second system is the final result.",
        "The disadvantage of this method is its time consuming translation process, since until the first system's output is not ready; the second system cannot start the translation process.",
        "This method is called cascading of two translation systems.",
        "In the other approach the target side of the training corpus of the source-pivot system is given to the pivot-target system as its input.",
        "The output of the pivot-target system is parallel with the source side of the training corpus of the source-pivot system.",
        "A source-to-target system can be built by using this noisy parallel corpus which in it each source sentence is directly translated to a target sentence.",
        "This method is called the pseudo corpus approach.",
        "Another way is combining the phrase tables of the source-pivot and pivot-target systems to directly make a source-target phrase table.",
        "This combination is done if the pivot phrase is",
        "identical in both phrase tables.",
        "Since one phrase has many translations in the other language, a large phrase table will be produced.",
        "This method is called combination of phrase tables approach.",
        "Since in the bridge language approach two translation systems are used to make a final translation system, the errors of these two translation systems will affect the final output.",
        "Therefore in order to decrease the propagation of these errors, a language should be chosen as pivot which its structure is similar to the source and target languages.",
        "But even by choosing a good language as pivot there are some other errors that should be handled or decreased such as the errors of ploysemous words and etc.",
        "For making a MT system using pivot language several ideas have been proposed.",
        "Wu and Wang (2009) suggested a cascading method which is explained in Section 1.",
        "Bertoldi (2008) proposed his method in bridging at translation time and bridging at training time by using the cascading method and the combination of phrase tables.",
        "Bakhshaei (2010) used the combination of phrase tables of source-pivot and pivot-target systems and produced a phrase table for the source-target system.",
        "Paul (2009) did several experiments to show the effect of pivot language in the final translation system.",
        "He showed that in some cases if training data is small the pivot should be more similar to the source language, and if training data is large the pivot should be more similar to the target language.",
        "In Addition, it is more suitable to use a pivot language that its structure is similar to both of source and target languages.",
        "Saralegi (2011) showed that there is not transitive property between three languages.",
        "So many of the translations produced in the final phrase table might be wrong.",
        "Therefore for pruning wrong and weak phrases in the phrase table two methods have been used.",
        "One method is based on the structure of source dictionaries and the other is based on distributional similarity.",
        "Rapp (1995) suggested his idea about the usage of context vectors in order to find the words that are the translation of each other in comparable corpora.",
        "In this paper the combination of phrase tables approach is used to make a source-target system.",
        "We have created a base source-target system just similar to previous works.",
        "But the contribution of our work compared to other works is that here we decrease the size of the produced phrase table and improve the performance of the system.",
        "Our pruning method is different from the method that Saralegi (2011) has used.",
        "He has pruned the phrase table by computing distributional similarity from comparable corpora or by the structure of source dictionaries.",
        "Here we use context vectors to determine the concept of phrases and we use the pivot language to compare source and target vectors."
