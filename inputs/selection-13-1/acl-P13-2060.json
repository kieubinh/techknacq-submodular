        "The idea behind ensemble learning is to combine multiple models, weak learners, in an attempt to produce a strong model with less error.",
        "It has also been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks in NLP (Tomeh et al., 2010; Surdeanu and Manning, 2010; F. T. Martins et al., 2008; Sang, 2002) and recently has attracted attention in the statistical machine translation community in various work (Xiao et al., 2013; Song et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2010; Lagarda and Casacuberta, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to adopt stacking (Wolpert, 1992), an ensemble learning technique, to SMT.",
        "We manipulate the full set of training data, creating k disjoint sets of held-out and held-in data sets as in k-fold cross-validation and build a model on each partition.",
        "This creates a diverse ensemble of statistical machine translation models where each member of the ensemble has different feature function values for the SMT log-linear model (Koehn, 2010).",
        "The weights of model are then tuned using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the held-out fold to provide k weak models.",

        "model by stacking another meta-learner on top of weak models to combine them into a single model.",
        "The particular second-tier model we use is a model combination approach called ensemble decoding which combines hypotheses from the weak models on-the-fly in the decoder.",
        "Using this approach, we take advantage of the diversity created by manipulating the training data and obtain a significant and consistent improvement over a conventionally trained SMT model with a fixed training and tuning set."

        "Two well-known instances of general framework of ensemble learning are bagging and boosting.",
        "Bagging (Breiman, 1996a) (bootstrap aggregating) takes a number of samples with replacement from a training set.",
        "The generated sample set may have 0, 1 or more instances of each original training instance.",
        "This procedure is repeated a number of times and the base learner is applied to each sample to produce a weak learner.",
        "These models are aggregated by doing a uniform voting for classification or averaging the predictions for regression.",
        "Bagging reduces the variance of the base model while leaving the bias relatively unchanged and is most useful when a small change in the training data affects the prediction of the model (i.e. the model is unstable) (Breiman, 1996a).",
        "Bagging has been recently applied to SMT (Xiao et al., 2013; Song et al., 2011) Boosting (Schapire, 1990) constructs a strong learner by repeatedly choosing a weak learner and applying it on a re-weighted training set.",

(2010)'s method, each system gives up 20% of the training data in exchange for more diversity, but in contrast, our method not only uses all available data for training, but promotes diversity through allowing each model to tune on a different data set; iv) our approach takes advantage of held out data (the tuning set) in the training of base models which is beneficial especially when little parallel data is available or tuning/test sets and training sets are from different domains.",
