        "TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye.",
        "We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC).",
        "We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input.",
        "The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L,DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences.",

        "Difficulty in translation stems from the fact that most words are polysemous and sentences can be long and have complex structure.",

        "(length-8) 2.",
        "I was returning from my old office yesterday.",
        "(length-8) Clearly, sentence 1 is more difficult to process and translate than sentence 2, since it has lexical ambiguity (?Shoot?",
        "as an act of firing a shot or taking a photograph?)",
        "and structural ambiguity (Shot with a gun or policeman with a gun?).",
        "To produce fluent and adequate translations, efforts have to be put to analyze both the lexical and syntactic properties of the sentences.",
        "The most recent work on studying translation difficulty is by Campbell and Hale (1999) who identified several areas of difficulty in lexis and grammar.",
        "?Reading?",
        "researchers have focused on developing readability formulae, since 1970.",
        "The Flesch-Kincaid Readability test (Kincaid et al., 1975), the Fry Readability Formula (Fry, 1977) and the Dale-Chall readability formula (Chall and Dale, 1999) are popular and influential.",
        "These formulae use factors such as vocabulary difficulty (or semantic factors) and sentence length (or syntactic factors).",
        "In a different setting, Malsburg et al.",
        "(2012) correlate eye fixations and scanpaths of readers with sentence processing.",
        "While these approaches are successful in quantifying readability, they may not be applicable to translation scenarios.",
        "The reason is that, translation is not merely a reading activity.",
        "Translation requires coordination between source text comprehension and target text production (Dragsted, 2010).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work on predicting TDI is the first of its kind.",
        "The motivation of the work is as follows.",
        "Currently, for domain specific Machine Translation systems, parallel corpora are gathered through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing.",
        "In such",
        "ceived difficulty during translation a scenario, translators are paid on the basis of sentence length, which ignores other factors contributing to translation difficulty, as stated above.",
        "Our proposed Translation Difficulty Index (TDI) quantifies the translation difficulty of a sentence considering both lexical and structural properties.",
        "This measure can, in turn, be used to cluster sentences according to their difficulty levels (viz. easy, medium, hard).",
        "Different payment and schemes can be adopted for different such clusters.",
        "TDI can also be useful for training and evaluating second language learners.",
        "For example, appropriate examples at particular levels of difficulty can be chosen for giving assignments and monitoring progress.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized in the following way.",
        "Section 2 describes TDI as function of translation processing time.",
        "Section 3 is on measuring translation processing time through eye tracking.",
