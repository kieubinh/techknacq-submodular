        "Currently, most methods on statistical machine translation (SMT) are developed for translation of languages with limited morphology (e.g., English, Chinese).",
        "They assumed that word was the atomic translation unit (ATU), always ignoring the internal morphological structure of word.",
        "This assumption can be traced back to the original IBM word-based models (Brown et al., 1993) and several significantly improved models, including phrase-based (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) and syntactic (Quirk et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006) models.",
        "These improved models worked well for translating languages like English with large scale parallel corpora available.",
        "Different from languages with limited morphology, words of agglutinative languages are formed mainly by concatenation of stems and affixes.",
        "Generally, a stem can attach with several affixes, thus leading to tens of hundreds of possible inflected variants of lexicons for a single stem.",
        "Modeling each lexical form as a separate word will generate high out-of-vocabulary rate for SMT.",
        "Theoretically, ways like morphological analysis and increasing bilingual corpora could alleviate the problem of data sparsity, but most agglutinative languages are less-studied and suffer from the problem of resource-scarceness.",
        "Therefore, previous research mainly focused on the different inflected variants of the same stem and made various transformation of input by morphological analysis, such as (Lee, 2004; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Bisazza and Federico, 2009; Wang et al., 2011).",
        "These work still assume that the atomic translation unit is word, stem or morpheme, without considering the difference between stems and affixes.",
        "In agglutinative languages, stem is the base part of word not including inflectional affixes.",
        "Affix, especially inflectional affix, indicates different grammatical categories such as tense, person, number and case, etc., which is useful for translation rule disambiguation.",
        "Therefore, we employ stem as the atomic translation unit and use affix information to guide translation rule selection.",
        "Stem-granularity translation rules have much larger coverage and can lower the OOV rate.",
        "Affix based rule selection takes advantage of auxiliary syntactic roles of affixes to make a better rule selection.",
        "In this way, we can achieve a balance between rule coverage and matching accuracy, and ultimately improve the translation performance."

        "We can see that, although the source part of the two translation rules are identical, their affix distributions are quite different.",

        "We can achieve this by calculating similarity between the affix distributions of the translation rule and the span.",
        "The affix distribution can be obtained by keeping the related affixes for each rule instance during translation rule extraction ((A) in Figure 1).",
        "After extracting and scoring stem-granularity rules in a traditional way, we extract stem-granularity rules again by keeping affix information and compute the affix distribution with tf-idf (Salton and Buckley, 1987).",

        "In this model, the feature weights are represented by the classic tf-idf (Salton and Buckley, 1987):",

        "By comparing the similarity of affix distributions, we are able to decide whether a translation rule is suitable for a span to be translated.",

        "Therefore, for a specific span to be translated, we first analyze it to get the corresponding stem sequence and related affix distribution represented as a vector.",
        "Then the stem sequence is used to search the translation rule table.",
        "If the source part is matched, the similarity will be calculated for each candidate translation rule by cosine similarity (as in equation 3).",
        "Therefore, in addition to the traditional translation features on stem level, our model also adds the affix similarity score as a dynamic feature into the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002)."
