        "We propose a bilingual lexical cohesion trigger model to capture lexical cohesion for document-level SMT.",

        "Then we use mutual information to measure the strength of the dependency between the trigger and triggered item.",
        "We integrate this model into a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system.",

        "The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work and highlights the differences between previous methods and our model.",
        "Section 3 elaborates the proposed bilingual lexical cohesion trigger model, including the details of identifying lexical cohesion devices, measuring dependency strength of bilingual lexical cohesion triggers and integrating the model into SMT.",
