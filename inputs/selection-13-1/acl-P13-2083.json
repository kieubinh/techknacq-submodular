        "They have been successfully used in a variety of NLP tasks including information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), question answering (Tellex et al., 2003), word-sense discrimination (Schütze, 1998) and disambiguation (McCarthy et al., 2004), semantic similarity computation (Wong and Raghavan, 1984; McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and selectional preference modeling (Erk, 2007).",
        "A shortcoming of DSMs is that they ignore the syntax within the context, thereby reducing the distribution to a bag of words.",
        "Composing the ?",
        "*Equally contributing authors distributions for 'Lincoln', 'Booth', and 'killed' gives the same result regardless of whether the input is 'Booth killed Lincoln' or 'Lincoln killed Booth'.",
        "But as suggested by Pantel and Lin (2000) and others, modeling the distribution over preferential attachments for each syntactic relation separately yields greater expressive power.",
        "Thus, to remedy the bag-of-words failing, we extend the generic DSM model to several relation-specific distributions over syntactic neighborhoods.",
        "In other words, one can think of the Structured DSM (SDSM) representation of a word/phrase as several vectors defined over the same vocabulary, each vector representing the word's selectional preferences for its various syntactic arguments.",
        "We argue that this representation not only captures individual word semantics more effectively than the standard DSM, but is also better able to express the semantics of compositional units.",
        "We prove this on the task of judging event coreference.",
        "Experimental results indicate that our model achieves greater predictive accuracy on the task than models that employ weaker forms of composition, as well as a baseline that relies on state-of-the-art window based word embeddings.",
        "This suggests that our formalism holds the potential of greater expressive power in problems that involve underlying semantic compositionality."
