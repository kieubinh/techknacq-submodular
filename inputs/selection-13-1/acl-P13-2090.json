        "The language that people use to express opinions and sentiment is extremely diverse.",
        "This is true for well-formed data, such as news and reviews, and it is particularly true for data from social media.",
        "Communication in social media is informal, abbreviations and misspellings abound, and the person communicating is often trying to be funny, creative, and entertaining.",
        "Topics change rapidly, and people invent new words and phrases.",
        "The dynamic nature of social media together with the extreme diversity of subjective language has implications for any system with the goal of analyzing sentiment in this domain.",
        "General, domain-independent sentiment lexicons have low coverage.",
        "Even models trained specifically on social media data may degrade somewhat over time as topics change and new sentiment-bearing terms crop up.",
        "For example, the word ?occupy?",
        "would not have been indicative of sentiment before 2011.",
        "Most of the previous work on sentiment lexicon construction relies on existing natural language processing tools, e.g., syntactic parsers (Wiebe, 2000), information extraction (IE) tools (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) or rich lexical resources such as WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "However, such tools and lexical resources are not available for many languages spoken in social media.",
        "While English is still the top language in Twitter, it is no longer the majority.",
        "Thus, the applicability of these approaches is limited.",
        "Any method for analyzing sentiment in microblogs or other social media streams must be easily adapted to (1) many low-resource languages, (2) the dynamic nature of social media, and (3) working in a streaming mode with limited or no supervision.",
        "Although bootstrapping has been used for learning sentiment lexicons in other domains (Turney and Littman, 2002; Banea et al., 2008), it has not yet been applied to learning sentiment lexicons for microblogs.",
        "In this paper, we present an approach for bootstrapping subjectivity clues from Twitter data, and evaluate our approach on English, Spanish and Russian Twitter streams.",
        "Our approach: ?",
        "handles the informality, creativity and the dynamic nature of social media; ?",
        "does not rely on language-dependent tools; ?",
        "scales to the hundreds of new under-explored languages and dialects in social media; ?",
        "classifies sentiment in a streaming mode.",
        "To bootstrap subjectivity clues from Twitter streams we rely on three main assumptions: i. sentiment-bearing terms of similar orientation tend to co-occur at the tweet level (Turney and Littman, 2002); ii.",
        "sentiment-bearing terms of opposite orientation do not co-occur at the tweet level (Ga-mon and Aue, 2005); iii.",
