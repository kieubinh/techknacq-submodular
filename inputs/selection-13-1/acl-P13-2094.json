        "With the development of e-commerce, more and more people like to buy products on the web and express their opinions about the products by writing reviews.",
        "These reviews usually contain valuable information for other people's reference when they buy the same or similar products.",
        "In some applications, it is useful to categorize a review into either positive or negative, but in many real-world scenarios, it is important to provide numerical ratings rather than binary decisions.",
        "The task of review rating prediction aims to automatically predict the rating scores of unrated product reviews.",
        "It is considered as a finer-grained task than the binary sentiment classification task.",
        "Review rating prediction has been modeled as a multi-class classification or regression task, and the regression based methods have shown better performance than the multi-class classification based methods in recent studies (Li et al. 2011).",
        "Therefore, we focus on investigating regression-based methods in this study.",
        "Traditionally, the review rating prediction task has been investigated in a monolingual setting, which means that the training reviews with human ratings and the test reviews are in the same language.",
        "However, a more challenging task is to predict the rating scores of the reviews in a target language (e.g. German) by making use of the rated reviews in a different source language (e.g. English), which is called Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction.",
        "Considering that the resources (i.e. the rated reviews) for review rating prediction in different languages are imbalanced, it would be very useful to make use of the resources in resource-rich languages to help address the review rating prediction task in resource-poor languages.",
        "The task of cross-language review rating prediction can be typically addressed by using machine translation services for review translation, and then applying regression methods based on the monolingual training and test sets.",
        "However, due to the poor quality of machine translation, the reviews translated from one language A to another language B are usually very different from the original reviews in language B, because the words or syntax of the translated reviews may be erroneous or non-native.",
        "This phenomenon brings great challenges for existing regression algorithms.",
        "In this study, we propose a new co-regression algorithm to address the above problem by leveraging unlabeled reviews in the target language.",
        "Our algorithm can leverage both views of the reviews in the source language and the target language to collaboratively determine the confidently predicted ones out of the unlabeled reviews, and then use the selected examples to enlarge the training set.",
        "Evaluation results on several datasets show that our proposed co-regression algorithm can consistently improve the prediction results."

        "In addition to predicting the overall rating of a full review, multi-aspect rating prediction has also been investigated (Lu et al. 2011b; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Zhu et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2009; Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "All the above previous works are working under a monolingual setting, and to the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous work on cross-language review rating prediction.",
        "It is noteworthy that a few studies have been conducted for the task of cross-lingual sentiment classification or text classification, which aims to make use of labeled data in a language for the binary classification task in a different language (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Banea et al., 2008; Wan 2009; Lu et al. 2011a; Meng et al. 2012; Shi et al., 2010; Prettenhofer and Stein 2010).",
        "However, the binary classification task is very different from the regression task studied in this paper, and the proposed methods in the above previous works cannot be directly applied."

No labeled reviews in the target language are allowed to be used.",

        "In co-training for classification, some confidently classified examples by one classifier are provided for the other classifier, and vice versa.",
        "Each of the two classifiers can improve by learning from the newly labeled examples provided by the other classifier.",
        "The intuition is the same for co-regression.",
        "However, in the classification scenario, the confidence value of each prediction can be easily obtained through consulting the classifier.",
        "For example, the SVM classifier provides a confidence value or probability for each prediction.",
        "However, in the regression scenario, the confidence value of each prediction is not provided by the regressor.",
        "So the key question is how to get the confidence value of each labeled example.",
        "In (Zhou and Li, 2005), the assumption is that the most confidently labeled example of a regressor should be with such a property, i.e. the error of the regressor on the labeled example set (i.e. the training set) should decrease the most if the most confidently labeled example is utilized.",
        "In other words, the confidence value of each labeled example is measured by the decrease of the error (e.g. mean square error) on the labeled set of the regressor utilizing the information provided by the example.",
        "Thus, each example in the unlabeled set is required to be checked by training a new regression model utilizing the example.",
        "However, the model training process is usually very time-consuming for many regression algorithms, which significantly limits the use of the work in (Zhou and Li, 2005).",

        "Moreover, the confidence of the labeled examples is assessed based only on the labeled example set (i.e. the training set), which makes the generalization ability of the regressor not good.",
        "In order to address the above problem, we propose a new confidence evaluation strategy based on the consensus of the two regressors.",
        "Our intuition is that if the two regressors agree on the prediction scores of an example very well, then the example is very confidently labeled.",
        "On the contrary, if the prediction scores of an example by the two regressors are very different, we can hardly make a decision whether the example is confidently labeled or not.",
        "Therefore, we use the absolute difference value between the prediction scores of the two regressors as the confidence value of a labeled example, and if the example is chosen, its final prediction score is the average of the two prediction scores.",
        "Based on this strategy, the confidently labeled examples can be easily and efficiently chosen from the unlabeled set as in the co-training algorithm, and these examples are then added into the labeled set for retraining the two regressors.",
