        "Nowadays, there is a huge amount of textual data coming from different sources of information.",
        "Wikipedia1 , for example, is a free encyclopedia that currently contains 4,208,409 English articles2.",
        "Even Social Networks play a role in the construction of data that can be useful for Information Extraction tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, and so forth.",
        "From another point of view, there is the need of having more structured data in the forms of ontologies, in order to allow semantics-based retrieval and reasoning.",
        "Ontology Learning is a task that permits to automatically (or semi-automatically) extract structured knowledge from plain text.",
        "Manual construction of ontologies usually requires strong efforts from domain experts,",
        "In this paper, we focus on the extraction of hypernym relations.",
        "The first step of such task relies on the identification of what (Navigli and Velardi, 2010) called definitional sentences, i.e., sentences that contain at least one hypernym relation.",
        "This subtask is important by itself for many tasks like Question Answering (Cui et al., 2007), construction of glossaries (Klavans and Muresan, 2001), extraction of taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations (Navigli, 2009; Snow et al., 2004), enrichment of concepts (Gangemi et al., 2003; Cataldi et al., 2009), and so forth.",
        "Hypernym relation extraction involves two aspects: linguistic knowlege, and model learning.",
        "Patterns collapse both of them, preventing to face them separately with the most suitable techniques.",
        "First, patterns have limited expressivity; then, linguistic knowledge inside patterns is learned from small corpora, so it is likely to have low coverage.",
        "Classification strictly depends on the learned patterns, so performance decreases, and the available classification techniques are restricted to those compatible with the pattern approach.",
        "Instead, we use a syntactic parser for the first aspect (with all its native and domain-independent knowledge on language expressivity), and a state-of-the-art approach to learn models with the use of Support Vector Machine classifiers.",
        "Our assumption is that syntax is less dependent than learned patterns from the length and the complexity of textual expressions.",
        "In some way, patterns grasp syntactic relationships, but they actually do not use them as input knowledge."

        "In this section we present the current state of the art concerning the automatic extraction of definitions and hypernym relations from plain text.",
        "We will use the term definitional sentence referring to the more general meaning given by (Navigli and Velardi, 2010): A sentence that provides a for",
        "mal explanation for the term of interest, and more specifically as a sentence containing at least one hypernym relation.",
        "So far, most of the proposed techniques rely on lexico-syntactic patterns, either manually or semi-automatically produced (Hovy et al., 2003; Zhang and Jiang, 2009; Westerhout, 2009).",
        "Such patterns are sequences of words like ?is a?",
        "or ?refers to?, rather than more complex sequences including part-of-speech tags.",
        "In the work of (Westerhout, 2009), after a manual identification of types of definitions and related patterns contained in a corpus, he successively applied Machine Learning techniques on syntactic and location features to improve the results.",
        "A fully-automatic approach has been proposed by (Borg et al., 2009), where the authors applied genetic algorithms to the extraction of English definitions containing the keyword ?is?.",
        "In detail, they assign weights to a set of features for the classification of definitional sentences, reaching a precision of 62% and a recall of 52%.",
        "Then, (Cui et al., 2007) proposed an approach based on soft patterns, i.e., probabilistic lexico-semantic patterns that are able to generalize over rigid patterns enabling partial matching by calculating a generative degree-of-match probability between a test instance and the set of training instances.",
        "Similarly to our approach, (Fahmi and Bouma, 2006) used three different Machine Learning algorithms to distinguish actual definitions from other sentences also relying on syntactic features, reaching high accuracy levels.",
        "The work of (Klavans and Muresan, 2001) relies on a rule-based system that makes use of ?cue phrases?",
        "and structural indicators that frequently introduce definitions, reaching 87% of precision and 75% of recall on a small and domain-specific corpus.",
        "As for the task of definition extraction, most of the existing approaches use symbolic methods that are based on lexico-syntactic patterns, which are manually crafted or deduced automatically.",
        "The seminal work of (Hearst, 1992) represents the main approach based on fixed patterns like ?NPx is a/an NPy?",
        "and ?NPx such as NPy?, that usually imply < x IS-A y >.",
        "The main drawback of such technique is that it does not face the high variability of how a relation can be expressed in natural language.",
        "Still, it generally extracts single-word terms rather than well-formed and compound concepts.",
        "(Berland and Charniak, 1999) proposed similar lexico-syntactic patterns to extract part-whole relationships.",
        "(Del Gaudio and Branco, 2007) proposed a rule-based approach to the extraction of hypernyms that, however, leads to very low accuracy values in terms of Precision.",
        "(Ponzetto and Strube, 2007) proposed a technique to extract hypernym relations from Wikipedia by means of methods based on the connectivity of the network and classical lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "(Yamada et al., 2009) extended their work by combining extracted Wikipedia entries with new terms contained in additional web documents, using a distributional similarity-based approach.",
        "Finally, pure statistical approaches present techniques for the extraction of hierarchies of terms based on words frequency as well as co-occurrence values, relying on clustering procedures (Candan et al., 2008; Fortuna et al., 2006; Yang and Callan, 2008).",
        "The central hypothesis is that similar words tend to occur together in similar contexts (Harris, 1954).",
        "Despite this, they are defined by (Biemann, 2005) as prototype-based ontologies rather than formal terminological ontologies, and they usually suffer from the problem of data sparsity in case of small corpora."
