        "Given a query representing the topic to be summarized, our first task is to find the set of relevant documents from the corpus.",
        "The simplest way to do this for a corpus of scientific publications is to do a query search using exact match or a standard TF*IDF system such Lucene, rank the documents using either citation counts or pager-ank in the bibliometric citation network, and select the top n documents.",
        "However, comparing",
        "Many corpus based methods have been proposed to deal with the sense disambiguation problem when given de nition for each possible sense of a target word or a tagged corpus with the instances of each possible sense, e.g., supervised sense disambiguation (Leacock et al. , 1998), and semi-supervised sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "Most researchers working on word sense disambiguation (WSD) use manually sense tagged data such as SemCor (Miller et al. , 1993) to train statistical classifiers, but also use the information in SemCor on the overall sense distribution for each word as a backoff model.",

        "The reason for the low performance of C-Lexrank as compared to Lexrank on this data set can be attributed to the fact that the input sentence set is derived from a much more diverse set of papers which can have a high diversity in lexical choice when describing the same factoid.",
        "Thus simple lexical similarity is not enough to find good clusters in this sentence set.",
        "The lower Unnormalized RU scores compared to Pyramid scores indicate that we are selecting sentences containing highly weighted factoids, but we do not select the most informative sentences that contain a large number of factoids.",
        "This also shows that we select some redundant factoids, since Unnormalized RU contains a penalty for redundancy.",
        "This is again, explained by the fact that the simple lexical diversity based model in C-Lexrank is not able to detect the same factoids being present in two sentences.",
