        "1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic.",
        "For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%.",
        "However, many widely-spoken languages ?",
        "including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda ?",
        "have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages.",
        "However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives of human translations of books, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available.",
        "This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers.",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (2011).",
        "In this approach, a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned.",
        "These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manually-labelled data in the target language).",

        "Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008).",
        "A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus.",
        "After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "Das and Petrov (2011) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language.",
        "Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data.",
        "First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices.",
        "Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes",
        "to-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only.",
        "while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes.",
        "A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger.",
        "The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results."

        "In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3.",

(2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language.",
        "Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with different inference algorithms such as ExpectationMaximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging.",
