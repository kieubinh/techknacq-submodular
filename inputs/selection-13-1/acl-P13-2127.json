        "In spite of a part of the annotation being made with a contrastive study in mind, no parallel text was used to avoid using translated text.",
        "For English and Danish we used freely available reference corpora (Ide and Macleod, 2001; Andersen et al., 2002) and, for Spanish, a corpus built from newswire and technical text (Vivaldi, 2009).",
        "For most of the English examples we used the words in Rumshisky (2007), except for Location/Organization.",
        "For Danish and Spanish we translated the words from English.",
        "We expanded the lists using each language's wordnet (Pedersen et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2012) as thesaurus to make the total of occurrences reach 500 after we had removed homonyms and other forms of semantic variation outside of the purview of regular polysemy.",
        "For Location/Organization we have used high-frequency names of geopolitical locations from each of the corpora.",
        "Many of them are corpus-specific (e.g. Madrid is more frequent in the Spanish corpus) but a set of words is shared: Afghanistan, Africa, America, China, England, Europe,Germany, London.",
        "Every dot type has its particularities that we had to deal with.",
        "For instance, English has lexical alternatives for the meat of several common animals, like venison or pork instead of deer and pig.",
        "This lexical phenomenon does not impede metonymy for the animal names, it just makes it less likely.",
        "In order to assess this, we have included 20 examples of cow.",
        "The rest of the dataset consists of animal names that do not participate in this lexical alternation, like eel, duck, chicken, or sardine.",
        "We call the first sense in the pair of metonyms that make up the dot type the literal sense, and the second sense the metonymic sense, e.g.",
        "Location is the literal sense in Location/Organization.",
        "Each block of 500 sentences belonging to a dot type was an independent annotation subtask with an isolated description.",
        "The annotator was shown an example and had to determine whether the headword in the example had the literal, metonymic or the underspecified sense.",
        "Figure 1 shows an instance of the annotation process.",
        "This annotation scheme is designed with the intention of capturing literal, metonymic and underspecified senses, and we use an inventory of three possible answers, instead of using Markert and Nissim's (Markert and Nissim, 2002; Nissim and Markert, 2005) approach with fine-grained sense distinctions, which are potentially more difficult to annotate and resolve automatically.",
        "Markert and Nissim acknowledge a mixed sense they define as being literal and metonymic at the same time.",
        "For English we used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) with five annotations per example by turk-ers certified as Classification Masters.",
        "Using AMT provides annotations very quickly, possibly at the expense of reliability, but it has been proven suitable for sense-disambiguation task (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "Moreover, it is not possible to obtain annotations for every language using AMT.",
        "Thus, for Danish and Spanish, we obtained annotations from volunteers, most of them native or very proficient non-natives.",

        "5 Assigning sense by majority voting Each example has more than one annotation and we need to determine a single sense tag for each example.",
        "However, if we assign senses by majority voting, we need a backoff strategy in case of ties.",

        "The preference for the underspecified sense varies greatly, from the very infrequent for English in Animal/Meat to the two Danish datasets where the underspecified sense evens with the metonymic one.",
        "However, the Danish examples have mostly three annotators, and chance disagreement is the highest for this language in this setup, i.e., the chance for an underspecified sense in Danish to be assigned by our backoff strategy is the highest.",
        "Columns V and B show respectively whether the underspecified senses are a result of majority voting or backoff.",
        "In contrast to volunteers, turk-ers disprefer the underspecified option and most of the English underspecified senses are assigned by backoff.",
        "However, it cannot be argued that turkers have overused clicking on the first option (a common spamming behavior) because we can see that two of the English dot types (eng:artinfo, eng:procres) have majority of metonymic senses, which are always second in the scheme (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "1).",
        "Looking at the amount of underspecified senses that have been obtained by majority voting for Danish and Spanish, we suggest that the level of abstraction required by this annotation is too high for turkers to perform at a level compara",
        "ble to that of our volunteer annotators.",
        "(metonymic+underspecified) examples for the Location/Organization words that are common across languages.",
        "We can see that individual words show sense skewdness.",
        "This skewdness is a consequence of the kind of text in the corpus: e.g. America has a high proportion of non-literal senses in the ANC, where it usually means ?the population or government of the US?.",
        "Similarly, it is literal less than 50% of the times for the other two languages.",

        "This EM method can also be understood as a clustering that assigns the value of the closest calculated latent variable (the sense tag) to each data point (the distribution of annotations).",
        "Datasets that show less variation between senses calculated using majority voting and using MACE will be more reliable.",
        "Along the sense distribution in the first three columns, Table 4 provides the proportion of the senses that is different between majority voting and MACE (D), and the size of the intersection (I) of the set of underspecified examples by voting and by MACE, namely the overlap of the U columns of Tables 3 and 4.",
        "Table 4 shows a smoother distribution of senses than Table 3, as majority classes are down-weighted by MACE.",
        "It takes very different decisions than majority voting for the two English datasets with lowest agreement (eng:artinfo, eng:procres) and for the Danish datasets, which have the fewest annotators.",
        "For these cases, the diferences oscillate between 0.206 and 0.296.",
        "Although MACE increases the frequency of the underspecified senses for all datasets but one (eng:locorg), the underspecified examples in Table 3 are not subsumed by the MACE results.",
