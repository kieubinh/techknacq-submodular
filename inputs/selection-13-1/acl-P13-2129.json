        "Although diathesis alternations have been used as features for manual verb classification, and there is recent work on incorporating such features in computational models of human language acquisition, work on large scale verb classification has yet to examine the potential for using diathesis alternations as input features to the clustering process.",
        "This paper proposes a method for approximating diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus data and shows, using a state-of-the-art verb clustering system, that features based on alternation approximation outperform those based on independent subcategorization frames.",
        "Our alternation-based approach is particularly adept at leveraging information from less frequent data."

        "Diathesis alternations (DAs) are regular alternations of the syntactic expression of verbal arguments, sometimes accompanied by a change in meaning.",
        "For example, The man broke the window ?",
        "The window broke.",
        "The syntactic phenomena are triggered by the underlying semantics of the participating verbs.",
        "Levin (1993)'s seminal book provides a manual inventory both of DAs and verb classes where membership is determined according to participation in these alternations.",
        "For example, most of the COOK verbs (e.g. bake, cook, fry .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "can all take various DAs, such as the causative alternation, middle alternation and instrument subject alternation.",
        "In computational linguistics, work inspired by Levin's classification has exploited the link between syntax and semantics for producing classifications of verbs.",
        "Such classifications are useful for a wide variety of purposes such as semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), predicting unseen syntax (Parisien and Stevenson, 2010), argument zoning (Guo et al., 2011) and metaphor identification (Shutova et al., 2010).",
        "While Levin's classification can be extended manually (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), a large body of research has developed methods for automatic verb classification since such methods can be applied easily to other domains and languages.",
        "Existing work on automatic classification relies largely on syntactic features such as subcatego-rization frames (SCF)s (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Sun and Korhonen, 2011; Vlachos et al., 2009; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002).",
        "There has also been some success incorporating selectional preferences (Sun and Korhonen, 2009).",
        "Few have attempted to use, or approximate, diathesis features directly for verb classification although manual classifications have relied on them heavily, and there has been related work on identifying the DAs themselves automatically using SCF and semantic information (Resnik, 1993; McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999; McCarthy, 2000; Tsang and Stevenson, 2004).",
        "Exceptions to this include Merlo and Stevenson (2001), Joanis et al. (2008) and Parisien and Stevenson (2010, 2011).",
        "Merlo and Stevenson (2001) used cues such as passive voice, animacy and syntactic frames coupled with the overlap of lexical fillers between the alternating slots to predict a 3-way classification (unergative, unac-cusative and object-drop).",
        "Joanis et al. (2008) used similar features to classify verbs on a much larger scale.",
        "They classify up to 496 verbs using 11 different classifications each having between 2 and 14 classes.",
        "Parisien and Stevenson (2010, 2011) used hierarchical Bayesian models on slot frequency data obtained from child-directed speech parsed with a dependency parser to model acquisition of SCF, alternations and ultimately verb classes which provided predictions for unseen syntactic behaviour of class members.",
        "In this paper, like Sun and Korhonen (2009); Joanis et al. (2008) we seek to automatically classify verbs into a broad range of classes.",
        "Like Joanis et al., we include evidence of DA, but we do not manually select features attributed to specific alternations but rather experiment with syntactic evidence for alternation approximation.",
        "We use the verb clustering system presented in Sun and Korhonen (2009) because it achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets, including those of Joanis et al., even without the additional boost in performance from the selectional preference data.",
        "We are interested in the improvement that can be achieved to verb clustering using approximations for DAs, rather than the DA per se.",
        "As such we make the simple assumption that if a pair of SCFs tends to occur with the same verbs, we have a potential occurrence of DA.",
        "Although this approximation can give rise to false positives (pairs of frames that co-occur frequently but are not DA) we are nevertheless interested in investigating its potential usefulness for verb classification.",
        "One attractive aspect of this method is that it does not require a predefined list of possible alternations."
