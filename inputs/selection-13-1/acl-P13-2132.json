        "The task of retrieving the nearest neighbours to a given query document permeates the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Nearest neighbour search has been used for applications as diverse as automatically detecting document translation pairs for the purposes of training a statistical machine translation system (SMT) (Krstovski and Smith, 2011), the large-scale generation of noun similarity lists (Ravichandran et al., 2005) to an unsupervised method for extracting domain specific lexical variants (Stephan Gouws and Metzle, 2011).",
        "There are two broad approaches to nearest neighbour based search: exact and approximate techniques, which are differentiated by their ability to return completely correct nearest neighbours (the exact approach) or have some possibility of returning points that are not true nearest neighbours (the approximate approach).",
        "Approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search using hashing techniques has recently gained prominence within NLP.",
        "The hashing-based approach maps the data into a substantially more compact representation referred to as a fingerprint, that is more efficient for performing similarity computations.",
        "The resulting compact binary representation radically reduces memory requirements while also permitting fast sub-linear time retrieval of approximate nearest neighbours.",
        "Hashing-based ANN techniques generally comprise two main steps: a projection stage followed by a quantisation stage.",
        "The projection stage performs a neighbourhood preserving embedding, mapping the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.",
        "The quantisation stage subsequently reduces the cardinality of this representation by converting the real-valued projections to binary.",
        "Quantisation is a lossy transformation which can have a significant impact on the resulting quality of the binary encoding.",
        "Previous work has quantised each projected dimension into a uniform number of bits (Indyk and Motwani, 1998) (Kong and Li, 2012) (Kong et al., 2012) (Moran et al., 2013).",
        "We demonstrate that uniform allocation of bits is suboptimal and propose a data-driven scheme for variable bit allocation.",
        "Our approach is distinct from previous work in that it provides a general objective function for bit allocation.",
        "VBQ makes no assumptions on the data and, in addition to LSH, it applies to a broad range of other projection functions."

        "LSH for cosine distance draws a large number of random hyperplanes within the input feature space, effectively dividing the space into non-overlapping regions (or buckets).",

        "The Manhattan distance between the NBC encoded data points is then used for nearest neighbour search.",
        "The authors demonstrated that MQ could better preserve the neighbourhood structure between the data points as compared to SBQ with Hamming distance.",

        "Our proposed quantisation scheme, Variable Bit Quantisation (VBQ), assigns a variable number of bits to each hyperplane subject to a maximum upper limit on the total number of bits1.",

        "Quantisation for LSH is performed by projecting the data points onto the normal vectors (n1, n2) to the hyperplanes (h1, h2).",
        "This leads to two projected dimensions.",
        "Thresholding these projected dimensions at zero, and determining which side of zero a given data-point falls, yields the bit encoding for a given data-point.",

        "Similar to vanilla LSH, the data-points are projected onto the normal vectors, to yield two projected dimensions.",
        "This is illustrated on the topmost diagram in Figure 1(b).",
        "VBQ differs in how these projected dimensions are thresh-olded to yield the bit encoding: rather than one threshold situated at zero, VBQ employs one or more thresholds and positions these thresholds in an adaptive manner based upon maximisation of an F-measure.",
        "Using multiple thresholds enables more than one bit to be assigned per hyperplane2.",
        "Figure 1(b) (middle, bottom) depicts the F-measure driven threshold optimisation along the projected dimensions.",

        "In our toy example, data points with the same shape symbol form a positive pair, while points with different symbols are negative pairs.",
        "Intuitively, the thresholds should be positioned in such a way as to maximize the number of positive pairs that fall within the same thresholded region, while also ensuring the negative pairs fall into different regions.",
        "This intuition can be captured by an F-measure which counts the number of positive pairs that are found within the same thresholded regions (true positives, TP), the number of negative pairs found within the same regions (false positives, FP), and the number of positive pairs found in different regions of the threshold partitioned dimension (false negatives, FN).",
        "For n2, three thresholds are optimal, given they perfectly preserve the neighbourhood structure.",
