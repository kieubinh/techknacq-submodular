        "In this paper, we argue that generally more informative clusters can be learned when evidence from multiple languages is considered while creating the clusters.",
        "We propose a novel bilingual word clustering objective (?2).",
        "The first term deals with each language independently and ensures that the data is well-explained by the clustering in a sequence model (?2.1).",
        "The second term ensures that the cluster alignments induced by a word alignment have high mutual information across languages (?2.2).",
        "Since the objective consists of terms representing the entropy monolingual data (for each language) and parallel bilingual data, it is particularly attractive for the usual situation in which there is much more monolingual data available than parallel data.",
        "Because of its similarity to the variation of information metric (Meila?, 2003), we call this bilingual term in the objective the aligned variation of information."
