        "The main motivation for building Question Answering (QA) systems is that they relieve a user of a need to translate his problem to a machine-readable form.",
        "To make it possible, we need to equip a computer system with an ability to understand requests in a natural language, find answers in a knowledge base and formulate them in the natural language.",
        "The aim of this paper is to deal with the first of these steps, i.e. question analysis module.",
        "It accepts the question as an input and returns a data structure containing relevant information, herein called question model.",
        "It consists of two elements: a question type and a search query.",
        "The question type classifies a question to one of the categories based on its structure.",
        "A general question type takes one of the following values: verification (Czy Lee Oswald zabi?",
        "Johna Kennedy?ego?, Eng.",
        "Did Lee Oswald kill John Kennedy?",
        "), option choosing (Kt?ry z nich zabi?",
        "Johna Kennedy?ego: Lance Oswald czy Lee Oswald?, Eng.",
        "Which one killed John Kennedy: Lance Oswald or Lee Oswald?",
        "), named entity (Kto zabi?",
        "Johna Kennedy?ego?, Eng.",
        "Who killed John Kennedy?",
        "), unnamed entity (Czego uz?y?",
        "Lee Oswald, z?eby zabic?",
        "Johna Kennedy?ego?, Eng.",
        "What did Lee Oswald use to kill John Kennedy?",
        "), other name for a given named entity (Jakiego pseudonimu uz?ywa?",
        "John Kennedy w trakcie s?uz?by wojskowej?, Eng.",
        "What nickname did John Kennedy use during his military service?)",
        "and multiple entities (Kt?rzy prezydenci Stan?w Zjednoczonych zostali zabici w trakcie kadencji?, Eng.",
        "Which U.S. presidents were assassinated in office?).",
        "There are many others possible, such as definition or explanation questions, but they require specific techniques for answer finding and remain beyond the scope of this work.",
        "For example, the Question Answering for Machine Reading Evaluation (QA4MRE) competition (Pe?as et al., 2012) included these complex questions (e.g. What caused X?, How did X happen?, Why did X happen?).",
        "In case of named entity questions, it is also useful to find its named entity type, corresponding to a type of an entity which could be provided as an answer.",
        "A list of possible options, suited to questions about general knowledge, is given in Table 1.",
        "As some of the categories include others (e.g. CITY is a PLACE), the goal of a classifier is to find the narrowest available.",
        "The need for a search query is motivated by performance reasons.",
        "A linguistic analysis applied to a source text to find the expected answer is usually resource-consuming, so it cannot be performed on the whole corpus (in case of this experiment 839,269 articles).",
        "To avoid it, we transform the question into the search query, which is subsequently used in a search engine, incorporating a full-text index of the corpus.",
        "As a result we get a list of documents, possibly related to the question.",
        "Although the query generation plays an auxiliary role, failure at this stage may lead both to too long processing times (in case of excessive number of returned documents) and lack of a final answer (in",
        "named entity types and numbers of their occurrences in the test set.",
        "case of not returning a relevant document)."

        "The problem of determination of the general question type is not frequent in existing QA solutions, as most of the public evaluation tasks, such as the TREC question answering track (Dang et al., 2007) either provide it explicitly or focus on one selected type.",
        "However, when it comes to named entity type determination, a proper classification is indispensable for finding an answer of a desired type.",
        "Some of the interrogative pronouns, such as gdzie (Eng.",
        "where) or kiedy (Eng.",
        "when) uniquely define this type, so the most obvious approach uses a list of manually defined patterns.",
        "For example, Lee et al. (2005) base solely on such rules, but need to have 1273 of them.",
        "Unfortunately, some pronouns (i.e. jaki, Eng.",
        "what, and kt?ry, Eng.",
        "which) may refer to different types of entities.",

        "the question focus (znany malarz, Eng.",
        "famous painter), following the pronoun, should be analysed, as its type corresponds to a named entity type (a PERSON in this case).",
        "Such approach is applied in a paper by Harabagiu et al. (2001), where the Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) serves as an ontology to determine foci types.",
        "Finally, one could use a machine learning (ML) approach, treating the task as a classification problem.",
        "To do that, a set of features (such as occurrences of words, beginning pronouns, etc.)",
        "should be defined and extracted from every question.",
        "Li and Roth (2002) implemented this solution, using as much as 200,000 features, and also evaluated an influence of taking into account hierarchy of class labels.",
        "C?eh and Ojster?ek (2009) used this approach in a Slovene QA system for closed domain (students?",
        "faculty-related questions) with a SVM (support vector machines) classifier.",
        "The presented problem of question classification for Polish question answering is studied in a paper by Przyby?a (2013).",
        "The type determination part presented here bases on that solution, but includes several improvements.",
        "To find relevant documents, existing QA solutions usually employ one of the widely available general-purpose search engines, such as Lucene.",
        "Words of the question are interpreted as keywords and form a boolean query, where all the constituents are considered required.",
        "This procedure suffices only in case of a web-based QA, where we can rely on a high redundancy of the WWW, which makes finding a similar expression probable enough.",
        "Such an approach, using the Google search engine is presented by Brill et al. (2002).",
        "When working with smaller corpora, one needs to take into account different formulations of the desired information.",
        "Therefore, an initial query is subject to some modifications.",
        "First, some of the keywords may be dropped from the query; Moldovan et al. (2000) present 8 different heuristics of selecting them, based on quotation marks, parts of speech, detected named entities and other features, whereas Katz et al. (2003) drop terms in order of increasing IDF.",
        "C?eh and Ojster?ek (2009) start term removal from the end of the sentence.",
        "Apart from simplifying the query, its expansion is",
        "also possible.",
        "For example, Hovy et al. (2000) add synonyms for each keyword, extracted from WordNet while Katz et al. (2003) introduce their inflectional and derivational morphological forms."

        "Among the possible ways to combine them are: intersection (corresponding to using only the parents common for all word senses), union (the parents of any word sense), voting (the parents common for the majority of word senses) and selecting only the first word sense (which usually is the most common in the language).",
        "The experiments have shown a better precision of classification using the first word sense (84.35%) than other techniques (intersection - 72.00%, union - 80.95%, voting - 79.07%).",
