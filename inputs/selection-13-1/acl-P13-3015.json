        "Complex Word (CW) identification is an important task at the first stage of lexical simplification and errors introduced or avoided here will affect final results.",

        "Lexical simplification is the task of identifying and replacing CWs in a text to improve the overall understandability and readability.",
        "This is a difficult task which is computationally expensive and often inadequately accurate.",

        "?sio and Gasperin, 2010).",
        "Syntactic simplification, statistical machine translation and semantic simplification (or explanation generation) are all current methods of text simplification.",
        "Text simplification is typically deployed as an assistive technology (Devlin and Tait, 1998; Alu?",
        "?sio and Gasperin, 2010), although this is not always the case.",
        "It may also be used alongside other technologies such as summarisation to improve their final results.",
        "Identifying CWs is a task which every lexical simplification system must perform, either explicitly or implicitly, before simplification can take place.",
        "CWs are difficult to define, which makes them difficult to identify.",
        "For example, take the following sentence: The four largest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and there are approximately 3,000 smaller islands in the chain.",
        "In the above sentence, we might identify the proper nouns (Honshu, Hokkaido, etc.)",
        "as complex (as they may be unfamiliar) or we may choose to discount them from our scheme altogether, as proper nouns are unlikely to have any valid replacements.",
        "If we discount the proper nouns then",
        "the other valid CW would be ?approximately?.",
        "At 13 characters it is more than twice the average of 5.7 characters per word and has more syllables than any other word.",
        "Further, CWs are often identified by their frequency (see Section 2.1) and here,",
        "?approximately?",
        "exhibits a much lower frequency than the other words.",
        "There are many reasons to evaluate the identification of CWs.",
        "This research stems primarily from the discovery that no previous comparison of current techniques exists.",
        "It is hoped that by providing this, the community will be able to identify and evaluate new techniques using the methods proposed herein.",
        "If CW identification is not performed well, then potential candidates may be missed, and simple words may be falsely identified.",
        "This is dangerous as simplification will often result in a minor change in a text's semantics.",
        "For example, the sentence: The United Kingdom is a state in northwest Europe.",
        "May be simplified to give: The United Kingdom is a country in northwest Europe.",
        "In this example from the corpus used in this research, the word ?state?",

        "Whilst this is a valid synonym in the given context, state and country are not necessarily semantically identical.",
        "Broadly speaking, state refers to a political entity, whereas country refers to a physical space within a set of borders.",

        "With more data for training the model, this variability may be reduced.",
