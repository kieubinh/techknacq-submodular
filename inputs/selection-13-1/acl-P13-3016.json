        "On a social media website, there may be millions of users and large numbers of comments.",
        "The comments in social media are related to the real world in such fields as marketing and politics.",
        "An-alyzing comments in social media has been shown to be effective in predicting the behaviors of stock markets and of voters in elections (Bollen et al., 2011; Tumasjan et al., 2010; O?Connor et al., 2010).",
        "Because of their effects on the real world, some complaints may harm the reputation of a corporation or an individual and cause serious damage.",
        "Consider a comment such as ?Working for Company A is really awful?",
        "as an example.",
        "The complaint gives viewers a negative impression of Company A and can increase the number of people who think the company is bad.",
        "Some complaints are expressed by a specific user who is always criticizing a specific target entity (in this example, Company A).",
        "We call this user a chronic critic of that entity, a person who is deliberately trying to harm the reputation of the entity.",
        "That is, a chronic critic is trying to run a negative campaign against the entity.",
        "If the entity is aware of its own chronic critics, then it is able to take prompt action to stop the malicious complaints.",
        "When the complaints are false, the entity can use that defense.",
        "In contrast, if the chronic critics are justified, then the entity should address the concerns to limit the damage.",
        "Hence, to handle malicious rumors, it is important to detect the chronic critics.",
        "However, it is generally quite difficult for a computer to detect a chronic critic's comments, since especially the comments in social media are often quite informal.",
        "In addition, there are complexities such as sarcasm and incomplete contexts.",
        "For example, if Company A has been involved in a widely recognized fiasco, then some chronic critics might sarcastically write ?good job?",
        "or ?wonderful?",
        "about Company A.",
        "They are using positive words, but in the context they are effectively criticizing Company A.",
        "Some chronic critics bash a target entity solely with sarcasm, so they damage the target with positive words.",
        "It is exceedingly difficult to directly detect these chronic critics based on their comments.",
        "In an example of an incomplete context, if one author starts an exchange with a comment such as ?The new product from Company A is difficult to use?",
        "and another user responds with something like ?Fool?, we cannot easily recognize the meaning of this comment as related to ?Company A being foolish because the product really is difficult to use?",
        "or whether ?the user is the fool because the product is easy for other people to use?.",
        "To find chronic critics for a given entity, we need to identify the actual target of the complaints.",
        "Take the comment ?Company B is much worse than Company A?",
        "for",
        "example.",
        "This comment is probably complaining about Company B but not Company A.",
        "In contrast, most of the previous work on sentiment analysis in social media does not consider these kinds of problems (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Davidov et al., 2010; Speriosu et al., 2011).",
        "Switching to the behavior of each user, in social media we often see that users who have similar ideas will tend to cooperate with each other.",
        "In fact, previous work suggests that users who have the same opinions tend to create links to each other (Conover et al., 2011b; Yang et al., 2012).",
        "Because chronic critics share the purpose of attacking some target's reputation, they may also decide to cooperate.",
        "For this reason, to detect chronic critics, we believe that information about the connections among users will be effective.",
        "In this paper, we present a method that combines opinion mining based on NLP and graph analysis of the connections among users to recognize the chronic critics.",
        "In the experiments, we demonstrate the difficulty in detecting chronic critics by analyzing only the individual comments.",
        "In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of using the connections between users, i.e., using the proposed method.",
        "For our experiments, we used Twitter, a popular social media service.",

        "Because we want to investigate the opinions of each user in public, we an-alyze public tweets, excluding the private conversations between users.",
