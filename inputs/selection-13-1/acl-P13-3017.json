        "Learning syntactic categories of words (i.e. part-of-speech or POS tagging) is an important preprocessing step for many natural language processing applications because grammatical rules are not functions of individual words, instead, they are functions of word categories.",
        "Unlike supervised POS tagging systems, POS induction systems make use of unsupervised methods.",
        "They categorize the words without any help of annotated data.",
        "POS induction is a popular topic and several studies (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010) have been performed.",
        "Token based methods (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) categorize word occurrences into syntactic groups.",
        "Type based methods (Clark, 2003; Blunsom and Cohn, 2011) on the other hand, categorize word types and yield the ambiguity problem unlike the token based methods.",
        "Type based methods suffer from POS ambiguity because one POS tag is assigned to each word type.",
        "However, occurrences of many words may have different POS tags.",
        "Two examples below are drawn from the dataset we worked on.",
        "They illustrate a situation where two occurrences of the ?offers?",
        "have different POS tags.",
        "In the first sentence ?offers?",
        "is a noun, whereas, in the second sentence it is a verb.",
        "(1) ?Two rival bidders for Connaught BioSciences extended their offers to acquire the Toronto-based vaccine manufacturer Friday.?",
        "(2) ?The company currently offers a",
        "word-processing package for personal computers called Legend.?",
        "In this study, we try to extend the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS tagger (Yatbaz et al., 2012) by solving the ambiguity problem it suffers because it has a type based approach.",
        "The clustering based studies (Schu?tze, 1995) (Mintz, 2003) represent the context of a word with a vector using neighbour words.",
        "Similarly, (Yatbaz et al., 2012) proposes to use word context.",
        "They claim that the substitutes of a word have similar syntactic categories and they are determined by the context of the word.",
        "In addition, we suggest that the occurrences with different part-of-speech categories of a word should be seen in different contexts.",
        "In other words, if we categorize the contexts of a word type we can determine different POS tags of the word.",
        "We represent the context of a word by constructing substitute vectors using possible substitutes of the word as (Yatbaz et al., 2012) suggests.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the substitute vector of the occurrence of ?offers?",
        "in (1).",
        "There is a row for each word in the vocabulary.",
        "For instance, probability of occurring ?agreement?",
        "in the position of ?offers?",
        "is 80% in this context.",
        "To resolve ambiguity",
        "sentence.",
        "of a target word, we separate occurrences of the word into different groups depending on the context information represented by substitute vectors.",
        "We conduct two experiments.",
        "In the first experiment, for each word type we investigated, we separate all occurences into two categories using substitute vectors.",
        "In the second one we guess the number of the categories we should separate for each word type.",
        "Both experiments achieve better than (Yatbaz et al., 2012) for highly ambiguous words.",
        "The level of ambiguity can be measured with perplexity of word's gold tag distribution.",
        "For instance,the gold tag perplexity of word ?offers?",
        "in the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus we worked on equals to 1.966.",
        "Accordingly, the number of different gold tags of ?offers?",
        "is 2.",
        "Whereas, perplexity of ?board?",
        "equals to 1.019.",
        "Although the number of different tags for ?board?",
        "is equal to 2, only a small fraction of the tags of board differs from each other.",
        "We can conclude that ?offers?",
        "is more ambiguous than ?board?.",
        "In this paper we present a method to solve POS ambiguity for a type based POS induction approach.",

        "We claim that if we categorize contexts a word type occurs in, we can address ambiguity by separating its occurrences before POS induction.",
        "In order to do that, we represent contexts of word occurrences with substitute vectors.",
        "A substitute vector is formed by the whole vocabulary of words and their corresponding probabilities of occurring in the position of the target word.",
        "To calculate these probabilities, as described in (Yatbaz et al., 2012), a 4-gram language model is built with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) on approximately 126 million tokens of Wall Street Journal data (1987-1994) extracted from CSR-III Text (Graff et al., 1995).",
        "We generate substitute vectors for all tokens in our dataset.",
        "We want to cluster occurrences of our target words using them.",
        "In each substitute vector, there is a row for every word in the vocabulary.",
        "As a result, the dimension of substitute vectors is equal to 49,206.",
        "Thus, in order not to suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we reduce dimensions of substitute vectors.",
        "Before reducing the dimensions of these vectors, distance matrices are created using Jensen distance metric for each word type in step (a) of Figure 1.",
        "We should note that these matrices are created with substitute vectors of each word type, not with all of the substitute vectors.",
        "In step (b) of Figure 1, to reduce dimensionality, the ISOMAP algorithm (Tenenbaum et al., 2000) is used.",
        "The output vectors of the ISOMAP algorithm are in 64 dimensions.",
        "We repeated our experiments for different numbers of dimensions and the best results are achieved when vectors are in 64 dimensions.",
        "In step (c) of Figure 1, after creating vectors in lower dimension, using a modified k-means algorithm (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007) 64- dimensional vectors are clustered for each word type.",
        "The number of clusters given as an input to k-means varies with experiments.",
        "We induce number of POS tags of a word type at this step.",
        "Previous work (Yatbaz et al., 2012) demonstrates that clustering substitute vectors of all word types alone has limited success in predicting part-of-speech tag of a word.",
        "To make use of both word identity and context information of a given type, we use S-CODE co-occurrence modeling (Maron et al., 2010) as (Yatbaz et al., 2012) does.",
        "Given a pair of categorical variables, the S-CODE model represents each of their values on a unit sphere such that frequently co-occurring values are located closely.",
        "We construct the pairs to feed S-CODE as follows.",
        "In step (d) of Figure 1, the first part of the pair is the word identity concatenated with cluster ids we got from the previous step.",
        "The cluster ids separate word occurrences seen in different context groups.",
        "By doing that, we make sure that the occurrences",
        "if they are seen in different context groups.",
        "The second part of the pair is a substitute word.",
        "For an instance of a target word, we sample a substitute word according to the target word's substitute vector probabilities.",
        "If occurrences of two different or the same word types have the same substitutes, they should be seen in the similar contexts.",
        "As a result, words occurring in the similar contexts will be close to each other on the unit sphere.",
        "Furthermore, they will have the same POS tags.",
        "We should note that the co-occurrence input file contains all word types.",
        "In step (e) of Figure 1, on the output of the S-CODE sphere, the words occurring in the similar contexts and having the same word-identity are closely located.",
        "Thus, we observe clusters on the unit sphere.",
        "For instance, verb occurrences of ?offers?",
        "are close to each other on the unit sphere.",
        "They are also close to other verbs.",
        "Furthermore,",
        "they are separated with occurrences of ?offers?",
        "which are nouns.",
        "Lastly, in step (f) of Figure 1, we run k-means clustering method on the S-CODE sphere and split word-substitute word pairs into 45 clusters because the treebank we worked on uses 45 part-of-speech tags.",
        "The output of clustering induces part-of-speech categories of words tokens."

        "Even using the gold number of different tags in Experiment 3 does not result in a significantly accurate system.",
