        "Distributional Semantic Models (DSM) can be traced back to the hypothesis proposed by Harris (1954) whereby the meaning of a word can be inferred from its context.",
        "Several implementations of Harris's hypothesis have been proposed in the last two decades (see Turney and Pantel (2010) for a review), but comparatively little has been done to develop reliable evaluation tools for these implementations.",
        "Models evaluation is however an issue of crucial importance for practical applications, i.g., when trying to optimally set the model's parameters for a given task, and for theoretical reasons, i.g., when using such models to approximate semantic knowledge.",
        "Some evaluation techniques involve assigning probabilities to different models given the observed corpus and applying maximum likelihood estimation (Lewandowsky and Farrell, 2011).",
        "However, computational complexity may prevent the application of such techniques, besides these probabilities may not be the best predictor for the model performance on a specific task (Blei, 2012).",
        "Other commonly used methods evaluate DSMs by comparing their semantic representation to a be-haviorally derived gold standard.",
        "Some standards are derived from the TOEFL synonym test (Lan-dauer and Dumais, 1997), or the Nelson word associations norms (Nelson et al., 1998).",
        "Others use results from semantic priming experiments (Hutchison et al., 2008) or lexical substitutions errors (Andrews et al., 2009).",
        "Baroni and Lenci (2011) set up a more refined gold standard for English specifying different kinds of semantic relationship based on dictionary resources (like Word-Net and ConceptNet).",
        "These behavior-based evaluation methods are all resource intensive, requiring either linguistic expertise or human-generated data.",
        "Such methods might not always be available, especially in languages with fewer resources than English.",
        "In this situation, researchers usually select a small set of high-frequency target words and examine their nearest neighbors (the most similar to the target) using their own intuition.",
        "This is used in particular to set the model parameters.",
        "However, this rather informal method represents a ?cherry picking?",
        "risk (Kievit-Kylar and Jones, 2012), besides it is only possible for languages that the researcher speaks.",
        "Here we introduce a method that aims at providing a rapid and quantitative evaluation for DSMs using an internal gold standard and requiring no external resources.",
        "It is based on a simple same-different task which detects pseudo-synonyms randomly introduced in the corpus.",
        "We claim that this measure evaluates the intrinsic ability of the model to capture lexical semantic similarity.",
        "We validate it against two behavior-based evaluations (Free association norms and the TOEFL synonym test) on semantic representations extracted from a Wikipedia corpus using one of the most commonly used distributional semantic models : the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Dumais (1997)).",
        "In this model, we construct a word-document matrix.",
        "Each word is represented by a row, and",
        "each document is represented by a column.",
        "Each matrix cell indicates the occurrence frequency of a given word in a given context.",
        "Singular value decomposition (a kind of matrix factorization) is used to extract a reduced representation by truncating the matrix to a certain size (which we call the semantic dimension of the model).",
        "The cosine of the angle between vectors of the resulting space is used to measure the semantic similarity between words.",
        "Two words end up with similar vectors if they co-occur multiple times in similar contexts."

        "All that is required is the existence of a semantic similarity measure between pairs of words.",
        "However, further work is needed to evaluate the robustness of this measure in models other than LSA.",
        "It is important to keep in mind that the correlation of our measure with the behavior-based methods only indicates that SDT-?",
        "can be trusted, to some extent, in evaluating these semantic tasks.",
        "It does not necessarily validate its ability to assess the entire semantic structure of a distributional model.",
        "Indeed, the behavior-based methods are dependent on particular tasks (i.g., generating associates, or responding to a multiple choice synonym test) hence they represent only an indirect evaluation of a model, viewed through these specific tasks.",
        "It is worth mentioning that Baroni and Lenci (2011) introduced a comprehensive technique that tries to assess simultaneously a variety of semantic relations like meronymy, hypernymy and coordination.",
        "Our measure does not enable us to assess these relations, but it could provide a valuable tool to explore other fine-grained features of the semantic structure.",
        "Indeed, while we introduced SDT-?",
        "as a global measure over a set of test words, it can also be computed word by word.",
        "Indeed, we can compute how well a given semantic model can detect that ?Art1?",
        "and ?Art2?",
        "are the same word, by comparing their semantic distance to that of random pairs of words.",
        "Such a word-specific measure could assess the semantic stability of different parts of the lexicon such as concrete vs. abstract word categories, or the distribution properties of different linguistic categories (verb, adjectives, ..).",
        "Future work is needed to assess the extent to which the SDT-?",
        "measure and its word-level variant provide a general framework for DSMs evaluation without external resources.",
        "Finally, one concern that could be raised by our method is the fact that splitting words may affect the semantic structure of the model we want to assess because it may alter the lexical distribution in the corpus, resulting in unnaturally sparse statistics.",
        "There is in fact evidence that corpus attributes can have a big effect on the extracted model (Srid-haran and Murphy, 2012; Lindsey et al., 2007).",
        "However, as shown by the high correlation scores, the introduced pseudo-synonyms do not seem to have a dramatic effect on the model, at least as far as the derived SDT-?",
        "measure and its predictive power is concerned.",
        "Moreover, we showed that in order to apply the method, we do not need to use the whole lexicon, on the contrary, a small test set of about 500 random mid-frequency words (which represents less than 2.5 % of the total vocabulary) was shown to lead to better results.",
        "However, even if the results are not directly affected in our case, future work needs to investigate the exact effect word splitting may have on the semantic model."
