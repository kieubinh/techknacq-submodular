        "This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral.",
        "In this manner, readers can follow the main events happening in the world, both from the perspective of mainstream as well as social media and the public's perception on them.",
        "This system will be part of the EMM media monitoring framework working live and it will be demonstrated using Google Earth."

        "In the context of the Web 2.0, the importance of Social Media has been constantly growing in the past years.",
        "People use Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, blogs and Web forums to give and get advice, share information on products, opinions and real-time information about ongoing and future events.",
        "In particular Twitter, with its half a billion active members, was used during disasters, protests, elections, and other events to share updates, opinions, comments and post links to on-line resources (e.g. news, videos, pictures, blog posts, etc.).",
        "As such, Twitter can be used as a complementary source of information, from which we can retrieve additional facts, but also learn about the attitude of the people towards certain events.",
        "On the one hand, news from the traditional media focus on the factual side of events, important for the society or at least large groups of people.",
        "On the other hand, social media reflects subjective interpretations of facts, with different levels of relevance (societal or only individual).",
        "Therefore, the events reported in online news can be considered a point of intersection for both types of media, which are able to offer complementary views on these events.",
        "In this context, we describe a system that we developed as an additonal component to the EMM (Europe Media Monitor)1 news monitoring framework, linking mainstream news to related texts from social media and detecting the opinion (sentiment) users express on these topics.",
        "In the EMM news monitoring system, the different news sites are monitored and new articles are scraped from them, with a refresh rate of 10 minutes.",
        "Subsequently, news items are clustered and the most important ones are displayed (top 10).",
        "These are called ?stories?.",
        "Our system subsequently links these stories to messages from Twitter (tweets) and extracts the related URLs they contain.",
        "Finally, it analyzes the sentiments expressed in the tweets by using a hybrid knowledge-based and statistical sentiment detection module.",

        "The system will be demonstrated using the Google Earth interface (Figure 2), presenting the characteristics of the event described in the story (type, date, location, the first words in the article that is the centroid of the news cluster for that story).",
        "In addition, we present new information that we extract from Twitter - links (URLs) that we find from the tweets we retrieved linked to the story and positive, negative and neutral sentiment, respectively, as a proportion of the total number of"

        "The work presented herein is mostly related to the linking of events with social media texts and sentiment analysis from Twitter.",
        "Although Twitter was used as an information source in the context of different crisis events, relatively little work focused on linking and extracting content about events which are known a priori, e.g., Becker et al. [2011].",
        "In this context, the main challenge is to determine relevant keywords to search for event-related tweets and rank them according to their relevance.",
        "Related approaches (e.g., Verma et al. [2011]) report on the use of semantic features (e.g., objectivity, impersonality, formality, etc.)",
        "for detecting tweets with content relevant to situational awareness during mass emergencies.",
        "Other approaches elaborate on machine learning-based techniques for Named Entity Recognition (NER) from tweets, which are subsequently employed as search query terms ( Ritter et al. [2011], Liu et al. [2011]).",
        "Related research on sentiment analysis from Twitter was done by Alec Go and Huang [2009], Pak and Paroubek [2010] and Agarwal et al. [2011].",
        "Alec Go and Huang [2009] and Pak and Paroubek [2010] exploit the presence of emoticons that represent positive or negative feelings to build a training set of tweets with sentiment labels, using which they build models based on n-gram features and part-of-speech tags.",
        "Agarwal et al. [2011] employ emoticons dictionaries and replace certain elements such as URLs and topics with predefinded labels.",
        "They employ syntactic features and specialized tree kernels and obtain around 75% to 80% accuracy for the sentiment classification.",
        "The main contributions of our system reside in the linking of mainstream news to the complementary content found in social media (tweets and, through them, to the links to additional information sources like blogs, flickr, youtube, etc.)",
        "and the analysis of sentiment on these important news.",
        "For events such as ?The Arab Spring?, protests, financial news (e.g. the fluctuations of the Euro, the bailout of different European countries, the rise in unemployment rate, etc.",
        "), it was seen that the sentiment expressed in social media has a high impact on the subsequent development of the story2 (Saif et al. [2012], Bollen et al. [2011]).",
        "The impact of sentiment expressed in social media is also visible for topics which apparently have an apriori valence (e.g. disasters, crisis, etc.).",
        "Nevertheless, in these cases, people communicate using the social media platforms not only to express their negative feelings, but also their will to help, their situation, their messages of encouragement, their gratefulness for the help and so on.",
        "Secondly, the methods employed in our system are simple, work fast and efficient and can be easily adapted to other languages.",
        "Finally, the methods presented take into account the specificity of social media languages, applying methods to normalize the language and adapting the features considered for the supervised learning process."
