        "In recent years, Visual Analytics systems have increasingly been used for the investigation of linguistic phenomena in a number of different areas, starting from literary analysis (Keim and Oelke, 2007) to the cross-linguistic comparison of language features (Mayer et al., 2010a; Mayer et al., 2010b; Rohrdantz et al., 2012a) and lexical semantic change (Rohrdantz et al., 2011; Heylen et al., 2012; Rohrdantz et al., 2012b).",
        "Visualization has also found its way into the field of computational linguistics by providing insights into methods such as machine translation (Collins et al., 2007; Albrecht et al., 2009) or discourse parsing (Zhao et al., 2012).",
        "One issue in computational linguistics is the interpretability of results coming from machine learning algorithms and the lack of insight they offer on the underlying data.",
        "This drawback often prevents theoretical linguists, who work with computational models and need to see patterns on large data sets, from drawing detailed conclusions.",
        "The present paper shows that a Visual Analytics system facilitates ?analytical reasoning [...] by an interactive visual interface?",
        "(Thomas and Cook, 2006) and helps resolving this issue by offering a customizable, in-depth view on the statistically generated result and simultaneously an at-a-glance overview of the overall data set.",
        "In particular, we focus on the visual representation of automatically generated clusters, in itself not a novel idea as it has been applied in other fields like the financial sector, biology or geography (Schreck et al., 2009).",
        "But as far as the literature is concerned, interactive systems are still less common, particularly in computational linguistics, and they have not been designed for the specific needs of theoretical linguists.",
        "This paper offers a method of visually encoding clusters and their internal coherence with an interactive user interface, which allows users to adjust underlying parameters and their views on the data depending on the particular research question.",
        "By this, we partly open up the ?black box?",
        "of machine learning.",
        "The linguistic phenomenon under investigation, for which the system has originally been designed, is the varied behavior of nouns in N+V CP complex predicates in Urdu (e.g., memory+do = ?to remember?)",
        "(Mohanan, 1994; Ahmed and Butt, 2011), where, depending on the lexical semantics of the noun, a set of different light verbs is chosen to form a complex predicate.",
        "The aim is an automatic detection of the different groups of nouns, based on their light verb distribution.",
        "Butt et al. (2012) present a static visualization for the phenomenon, whereas the present paper proposes an interactive system which alleviates some of the previous issues with respect to noise detection, filtering, data interaction and cluster coherence.",
        "For this, we proceed as follows: section 2 explains the proposed Visual Analytics system, followed by the linguistic case study in section 3.",
        "Section 4 concludes the paper."

        "four light verbs under investigation, namely kar ?do?, ho ?be?, hu ?become?",
        "and rakH ?put?",
        "; an exemplary input file is shown in Figure 1.",
        "From a data analysis perspective, we have four-dimensional data objects, where each dimension corresponds to a bigram frequency previously extracted from a corpus.",
        "Note that more than four dimensions can be loaded and analyzed, but for the sake of simplicity we focus on the four-dimensional Urdu example for the remainder of this paper.",
        "Moreover, it is possible to load files containing absolute bigram frequencies and relative frequencies.",
        "When loading absolute frequencies, the program will automatically calculate the relative frequencies as they are the input for the clustering.",
        "The absolute frequencies, however, are still available and can be used for further process"

        "The smaller the distance between two data objects, the more similar they are.",
        "For visualization, the high dimensional data is projected onto the two-dimensional space of a computer screen using a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm1.",
        "In the 2D projection, the distances between data objects in the high-dimensional space, i.e. the dissimilarities of the bigram distributions, are preserved as accurately as possible.",
        "However, when projecting a high-dimensional data space onto a lower dimension, some distinctions necessarily level out: two data objects may be far apart in the high-dimensional space, but end up closely together in the 2D projection.",
        "It is important to bear in mind that the 2D visualization is often quite insightful, but interpre",

        "The visualization area is mainly built with the pic-colo2d library4 and initially shows data objects as colored circles with a variable diameter, where color indicates cluster membership (four clusters in this example).",
        "Hovering over a dot displays information on the particular noun, the cluster membership and the light verb distribution in the description area to the right.",
        "By using the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in and out of the visualization.",
        "A very important feature for the task at hand is the possibility to select multiple data objects for further processing or for filtering, with a list of selected data objects shown in the description area.",
        "By right-clicking on these data objects, the user can assign a unique class (and class color) to them.",
        "Different clustering methods can be employed using the options item in the menu bar.",
        "Another feature of the system is that the user can fade in the cluster centroids (illustrated by a larger dot in the respective cluster color in Figure 2), where the overall feature distribution of the cluster can be examined in a tooltip hovering over the corresponding centroid.",
        "To gain further insight into the data distribution based on the 2D projection, the user can choose between several ways to visualize the individual data objects, all of which are shown in Figure 3.",

        "Here, the line endings are connected, forming a ?star?.",

        "Filter by means of bigram occurrence By activating the bigram occurrence filtering, it is possible to only show those nouns, which occur in bi-grams with a certain selected subset of all features (light verbs) only.",
        "This is especially useful when examining possible commonalities.",
        "Filter selected words Another opportunity of showing only items of interest is to select and display them separately.",
        "The PCA is recalculated for these data objects and the visualization is stretched to the whole area.",
        "Filter selected cluster Additionally, the user can visualize a specific cluster of interest.",
        "Again, the PCA is recalculated and the visualization stretched to the whole area.",
        "The cluster can then be manually fine-tuned and cleaned, for instance by removing wrongly assigned items.",
        "Due to the nature of the data, much overplotting occurs.",
        "For example, there are many words, which only occur with one light verb.",
        "The PCA assigns the same position to these words and, as a consequence, only the top bigram can be viewed in the visualization.",
        "In order to improve visual access to overplotted data objects, several methods that allow for a more differentiated view of the data have been included and are described in the following paragraphs.",
        "Change transparency of data objects By modifying the transparency with the given slider, areas with a dense data population can be readily identified, as shown in the following example: Repositioning of data objects To reduce the overplotting in densely populated areas, data objects can be repositioned randomly having a fixed deviation from their initial position.",
        "The degree of deviation can be interactively determined by the user employing the corresponding slider: The user has the option to reposition either all data objects or only those that are selected in advance.",
        "Frequency filtering If the initial data contains absolute bigram frequencies, the user can filter the visualized words by frequency.",
        "For example, many nouns occur only once and therefore have an observed probability of 100% for co-occurring with one of the light verbs.",
        "In most cases it is useful to filter such data out.",
        "Scaling data objects If the user zooms beyond the maximum zoom factor, the data objects are scaled down.",

        "Other filtering mechanisms, e.g. the removal of low frequency items which occur due to data sparsity issues, can be removed from the overall data set by adjusting the parameters.",
        "A linguistically-relevant improvement lies in the display of cluster centroids, in other words the typical noun + light verb distribution of a cluster.",
