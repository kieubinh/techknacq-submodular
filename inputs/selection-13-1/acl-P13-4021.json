        "Computing text similarity is key to several natural language processing applications such as automatic essay grading, paraphrase recognition, or plagiarism detection.",
        "However, only a few text similarity measures proposed in the literature are released publicly, and those then typically do not comply with any standardization.",
        "We are currently not aware of any designated text similarity framework which goes beyond simple lexical similarity or contains more than a small number of measures, even though related frameworks exist, which we discuss in Section 6.",
        "This fact was also realized by the organizers of the pilot Semantic Textual Similarity Task at SemEval-2012 (see Section 5), as they argue for the creation of an open source framework for text similarity (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "In order to fill this gap, we present DKPro Similarity, an open source framework for text similarity.",
        "DKPro Similarity is designed to complement DKPro Core1, a collection of software components for natural language processing based on the Apache UIMA framework (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).",
        "Our goal is to provide a comprehensive repository of text similarity measures which are implemented in a common framework using standardized interfaces.",
        "Besides the already available measures, DKPro Similarity is easily extensible and intended to allow for custom implementations, for which it offers various templates and examples.",

        "DKPro Similarity is designed to operate in either of two modes: The standalone mode allows to use text similarity measures as independent components in any experimental setup, but does not offer means for further language processing, e.g. lemmatization.",
        "The UIMA-coupled mode tightly integrates similarity computation with full-fledged Apache UIMA-based language processing pipelines.",
        "That way, it allows to perform any number of languge processing steps, e.g. coreference or named-entitiy resolution, along with the text similarity computation.",
        "Stand-alone Mode In this mode, text similarity measures can be used independently of any language processing pipeline just by passing them a pair of texts as (i) two strings, or (ii) two lists of strings (e.g. already lemmatized texts).",
        "We therefore provide an API module, which contains Java interfaces and abstract base classes for the measures.",
        "That way, DKPro Similarity allows for a maximum flexibility in experimental design, as the text similarity measures can easily be integrated with any existing experimental setup:",
        "The above code snippet instantiates the Greedy String Tiling measure (Wise, 1996) and then computes the text similarity between the given pair of texts.",
        "The resulting similarity score is normalized into [0, 1] where 0 means not similar at all, and 1 corresponds to perfectly similar.3 By using the common TextSimilarityMeasure interface, it is easy to replace Greedy String Tiling with any measure of choice, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998) or Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "We give an overview of measures available in DKPro Similarity in Section 3.",
        "UIMA-coupled Mode In this mode, DKPro Similarity allows text similarity computation to be directly integrated with any UIMA-based language processing pipeline.",
        "That way, it is easy to use text similarity components in addition to other UIMA-based components in the same pipeline.",
        "For example, an experimental setup may require to first compute text similarity scores and then to run a classification algorithm on the resulting scores.",
        "In Figure 1, we show a graphical overview of the integration of text similarity measures (right) with a UIMA-based pipeline (left).",
        "The pipeline starts by reading a given dataset, then performs any number of preprocessing steps such as to-kenization, sentence splitting, lemmatization, or stopword filtering, then runs the text similarity computation, before executing any subsequent post-processing steps and finally returning the processed texts in a suitable format for evaluation or manual inspection.",
        "As all text similarity measures in DKPro Similarity conform to standardized interfaces, they can be easily exchanged in the text similarity computation step.",
        "With DKPro Similarity, we offer various subclasses of the generic UIMA components which are specifically tailored towards text similarity experiments, e.g. corpus readers for standard evaluation datasets as well as evaluation components for running typical evaluation metrics.",
        "By lever-aging UIMA's architecture, we also define an 3Some string distance measures such as the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) return a raw distance score where less distance corresponds to higher similarity.",

        "additional interface to text similarity measures: The JCasTextSimilarityMeasure inherits from TextSimilarityMeasure, and adds a method for two JCas text representations:4 double getSimilarity (JCas text1, JCas text2); The additional interface allows to implement measures which have full access to UIMA's document structure.",
        "That way, it is possible to create text similarity measures which can use any piece of information that has been annotated in the processed documents, such as dependency trees or morphological information.",
