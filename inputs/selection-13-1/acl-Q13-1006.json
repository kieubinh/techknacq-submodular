        "Unsupervised learning of syntax is difficult for NLP systems, yet infants perform this task routinely.",
        "Previous work in NLP has focused on using the implicit syntactic information available in part-of-speech (POS) tags (Klein and Manning, 2004), punctuation (Seginer, 2007; Spitkovsky et al., 2011b; Ponvert et al., 2011), and syntactic similarities between related languages (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Cohen et al., 2011).",
        "However, these approaches likely use the data in a very different way from children: neither POS tags nor punctuation are observed during language acquisition (although see Spitkovsky et al. (2011a) and Christodoulopoulos et al. (2012) for encouraging results using unsupervised POS tags), and many children learn in a broadly monolingual environment.",
        "This paper explores a possible source of information that NLP systems typically ignore: word duration, or the length of time taken to pronounce each word.",
        "There are good reasons to think that word duration might be useful for learning syntax.",
        "First, the well-established Prosodic Bootstrapping hypothesis (Gleitman and Wanner, 1982) proposes that infants use acoustic-prosodic cues (such as word duration) to help them identify syntactic structure, because prosodic and syntactic structures sometimes coincide.",
        "More recently, we proposed (Pate and Goldwater, 2011) that infants might use word duration as a direct cue to syntactic structure (i.e., without requiring intermediate prosodic structure), because words in high-probability syntactic structures tend to be pronounced more quickly (Gahl and Garnsey, 2004; Gahl et al., 2006; Tily et al., 2009).",
        "Like most recent work on unsupervised parsing, we focus on learning syntactic dependencies.",
        "Our work is based on Headden et al. (2009)'s Bayesian version of the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) (Klein and Manning, 2004), using interpolated backoff techniques to incorporate multiple information sources per token.",
        "However, whereas Headden et al. used words and POS tags as input, we use words and word duration information, presenting three variants of their model that use this information in slightly different ways.1 1By using neither gold-standard nor learned POS tags as input, our work differs from nearly all previous work on unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "While learned tags might be plausible",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate acoustic cues into an unsupervised system for learning full syntactic parses.",
        "The methods in this paper were inspired by our previous approach (Pate and Goldwater, 2011), which showed that word duration measurements could improve the performance of an unsupervised lexicalized syntactic chunker over a words-only baseline.",
        "However, that work was limited to HMM-like sequence models, tested on adult-directed speech (ADS) only, and none of the models outperformed uniform-branching baselines.",
        "Here, we extend our results to full dependency parsing, and experiment on transcripts of both spontaneous ADS and child-directed speech (CDS).",
        "Our models using word duration outperform words-only baselines, along with the Common Cover Link parser of Seginer (2007), and the Unsupervised Partial Parser of Ponvert et al. (2011), unsupervised lexicalized parsers that have obtained state-of-the-art results on standard newswire treebanks (though their performance here is worse, as our input lacks punctuation).",
        "We also outperform uniform-branching baselines."

        "Prosody is the structure of speech as conveyed by rhythm and intonation, which are, in turn, conveyed by such measurable phenomena as variation in fundamental frequency, word duration, and spectral tilt.",
        "Prosodic structure is typically analyzed as imposing a shallow, hierarchical grouping structure on speech, with the ends of prosodic phrases (constituents) being cued in part by lengthening the last word of the phrase (Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986).",
        "The Prosodic Bootstrapping hypothesis (Gleitman and Wanner, 1982) points out that prosodic phrases are often also syntactic phrases, and proposes that language-acquiring infants exploit this correlation.",
        "Specifically, if infants can learn about prosodic phrase structure using word duration (and fundamen-in a model of language acquisition, gold tags certainly are not.",
        "tal frequency), they may be able to identify syntactic phrases more easily using word strings and prosodic trees than using word strings alone.",
        "Several behavioral experiments support the connection between prosody and syntax and the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis specifically.",
        "For example, there is evidence that adults use prosodic information for syntactic disambiguation (Millotte et al., 2007; Price et al., 1991) and to help in learning the syntax of an artificial language (Morgan et al., 1987), while infants can use acoustic-prosodic cues for utterance-internal clause segmentation (Seidl, 2007).",
        "On the computational side, we are aware of only our previous HMM-based chunkers (Pate and Goldwater, 2011), which learned shallow syntax from words, words and word durations, or words and hand-annotated prosody.",
        "Using these chunkers, we found that using words plus prosodic annotation worked better than just words, and words plus word duration worked even better.",
        "While these results are consistent with the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis, we suggested that predictability bootstrapping (see below) might be a more plausible explanation.",
        "Other computational work has combined prosody with syntax, but only in supervised systems, and typically using hand-annotated prosodic information.",
        "For example, Huang and Harper (2010) used annotated prosodic breaks as a kind of punctuation in a supervised PCFG, while prosodic breaks learned in a semi-supervised way have been used as features for parse reranking (Kahn et al., 2005) or PCFG state-splitting (Dreyer and Shafran, 2007).",
        "In contrast to these methods, our approach observes neither parse trees nor prosodic annotations."

        "It is well-established that talkers tend to pronounce words more quickly when they are more predictable, as measured by, e.g., word frequency, n-gram probability, or whether or not the word has been previously mentioned (Aylett and Turk, 2004; Bell et al., 2009).",
        "However, syntactic proba",
        "bility also seems to matter, with studies showing that verbs tend to be pronounced more quickly when they are in their preferred syntactic frame?transitive vs. intransitive or direct object vs. sentential complement (Gahl and Garnsey, 2004; Gahl et al., 2006; Tily et al., 2009).",
        "While this syntactic evidence is only for verbs, together with the evidence that effects of other notions of predictability, it suggests that such syntactic effects may also be widespread.",
        "If so, the duration of a word could give clues as to whether it is being used in a high-probability or low-probability structure, and thus what the correct structure is.",
        "We found that our syntactic chunkers benefited more from duration information than prosodic annotations, providing some preliminary evidence in favor of predictability bootstrapping, but not ruling out prosodic bootstrapping.",
        "So, we are left with two plausible mechanisms by which word duration could help with learning syntax.",
        "Slow pronunciations may cue the end of a prosodic phrase, which is sometimes also the end of a syntactic phrase.",
        "Alternatively, slow pronunciations may indicate that the hidden syntactic structure is low probability, facilitating the induction of a probabilistic grammar.",

        "As far as we know, our work is also the first test of a DMV-based model on transcribed conversational speech and the first to outperform uniform-branching baselines without using either POS tags or punctuation in the input.",

        "We found that several ways of incorporating duration were useful, although the extra sparsity of Joint emissions was not justified in any of our investigations.",
        "Our results are consistent with both the prosodic and predictability bootstrapping hypotheses of language acquisition, providing the first computational support for these using a full syntactic parsing model and tested on child-directed speech.",
        "While our models do not provide a mechanistic account of how children might use duration information to help with learning syntax, they do show that this information is useful in principle, even without any knowledge of latent prosodic structure or its relationship to syntax.",
        "In addition, our results suggest it may be useful to explore using word duration to enrich NLP tasks in speech-related technologies, such as syntactically-inspired language models for text-to-speech generation.",
        "In the future, we also hope to investigate why duration is helpful, designing experiments to tease apart the role of prosody and predictability in learning syntax."
