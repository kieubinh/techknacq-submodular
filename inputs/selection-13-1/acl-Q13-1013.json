        "Lexical-semantic resources (LSRs) are a cornerstone for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) and information extraction.",
        "However, the growing demand for large-scale resources in different languages is hard to meet.",
        "The Princeton WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is widely used for English, but for most languages corresponding resources are considerably smaller or missing.",
        "Collaboratively constructed resources like Wiktionary (WKT) and OmegaWiki (OW) provide a viable option for such cases and seem especially suitable for smaller languages (Matuschek et al., 2013), but there are still considerable gaps in coverage which need to be filled.",
        "A related problem is that there usually does not exist a single resource which works best for all purposes, as different LSRs cover different words, senses and information types.",
        "These considerations have sparked increasing research efforts in the area of word sense alignment (WSA).",
        "It has been shown that aligned resources can indeed lead to better performance than using the resources individually.",
        "Examples include semantic parsing using FrameNet (FN), WN, and VerbNet (VN) (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005), word sense disambiguation using an alignment of WN and Wikipedia (WP) (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) and semantic role labeling using a combination of PropBank, VN and FN in the SemLink project (Palmer, 2009).",
        "Some of these approaches to WSA either rely heavily on manual labor (e.g. Shi and Mihalcea (2005)) or on information which is only present in few resources such as the most frequent sense (MFS) (Suchanek et al., 2008).",
        "This makes it difficult to apply them to a larger set of resources.",
        "In earlier work, we presented the large-scale resource UBY (Gurevych et al., 2012).",
        "It contains nine resources in two languages which are mapped to a uniform representation using the LMF standard (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2012).",
        "They are thus structurally interoperable.",
        "UBY contains pairwise sense alignments between a subset of these resources, and this work also presented a framework for creating alignments based on the similarity of glosses (Meyer and Gurevych, 2011).",
        "However, it is not clear to what extent this approach can be applied to resources which lack this kind of information (see Section 3).",
        "In summary, aligning senses is a key requirement for semantic interoperability of LSRs to increase the",
        "coverage and effectiveness in NLP tasks.",
        "Still, existing efforts are mostly focused on specific types of resources (most often requiring glosses) or application scenarios.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach to alleviate this and present Dijkstra-WSA, a novel, robust algorithm for word sense alignment which is applicable to a wide variety of resource pairs and languages.",
        "For the first time, we apply a graph-based algorithm which works on full graph representations of both resources to word sense alignment.",
        "This enables us to take a more abstract perspective and reduce the problem of identifying equivalent senses to the problem of matching nodes in these graphs.",
        "Also for the first time, we comparatively evaluate a WSA algorithm on a variety of different datasets with different characteristics.",
        "The key properties of Dijkstra-WSA are: Robustness The entities within the LSRs which are to be aligned (usually senses or synsets) are mod-eled as nodes in the graph.",
        "These nodes are connected by an edge if they are semantically related.",
        "While, for instance, semantic relations lend themselves very well to deriving edges, different possibilities for graph construction are equally valid as the algorithm is agnostic to the origin of the edges.",
        "Language-independence No external resources such as corpora or other dictionaries are needed; the graph construction and alignment only rely on the information from the considered LSRs.",
        "Flexibility The graph construction as well as the actual alignment are highly parameterizable to accommodate different requirements regarding precision or recall.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we give a precise problem description and introduce the resources covered in our experiments, in Section 3 we discuss some related work, while our graph-based algorithm Dijkstra-WSA is presented in Section 4.",
        "We describe an evaluation on four datasets with different properties, including an error analysis, in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6, pointing out directions for future work."

        "This approach was later extended to cross-lingual alignment between the German OW and WN (Gurevych et al., 2012) using a machine translation component.",

        "Note that 1:1 alignments were enforced in any case, as the high polysemy of the dataset in conjunction with the dense WP link structure rendered 1:n alignments very imprecise.",

        "A weighting of edges (e.g. based on gloss similarities) has not been considered at all, but would be easily applicable to the existing framework.",
