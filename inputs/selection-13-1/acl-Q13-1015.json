        "Mapping natural language to meaning representations is a central challenge of NLP.",
        "There has been much recent progress in unsupervised distributional semantics, in which the meaning of a word is induced based on its usage in large corpora.",
        "This approach is useful for a range of key applications including question answering and relation extraction (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Poon and Domingos, 2009; Yao et al., 2011).",
        "Because such a semantics can be automically induced, it escapes the limitation of depending on relations from hand-built training data, knowledge bases or ontologies, which have proved of limited use in capturing the huge variety of meanings that can be expressed in language.",
        "However, distributional semantics has largely developed in isolation from the formal semantics literature.",
        "Whilst distributional semantics has been effective in modelling the meanings of content words such as nouns and verbs, it is less clear that it can be applied to the meanings of function words.",
        "Semantic operators, such as determiners, negation, conjunctions, modals, tense, mood, aspect, and plurals are ubiquitous in natural language, and are crucial for high performance on many practical applications?",
        "but current distributional models struggle to capture even simple examples.",
        "Conversely, computational models of formal semantics have shown low recall on practical applications, stemming from their reliance on ontologies such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) to model the meanings of content words (Bobrow et al., 2007; Bos and Markert, 2005).",
        "For example, consider what is needed to answer a question like Did Google buy YouTube?",
        "from the following sentences:",

        "Google purchased YouTube 2.",
        "Google's acquisition of YouTube 3.",

        "Google will buy YouTube or Microsoft 6.",
        "Google didn't takeover YouTube",
        "All of these require knowledge of lexical semantics (e.g. that buy and purchase are synonyms), but some also need interpretation of quantifiers, negatives, modals and disjunction.",
        "It seems unlikely that",
        "distributional or formal approaches can accomplish the task alone.",
        "We propose a method for mapping natural language to first-order logic representations capable of capturing the meanings of function words such as every, not and or, but which also uses distributional statistics to model the meaning of content words.",
        "Our approach differs from standard formal semantics in that the non-logical symbols used in the logical form are cluster identifiers.",
        "Where standard semantic formalisms would map the verb write to a write?",
        "symbol, we map it to a cluster identifier such as relation37, which the noun author may also map to.",
        "This mapping is learnt by offline clustering.",
        "Unlike previous distributional approaches, we perform clustering at the level of predicate-argument structure, rather than syntactic dependency structure.",
        "This means that we abstract away from many syntactic differences that are not present in the semantics, such as conjunctions, passives, relative clauses, and long-range dependencies.",
        "This significantly reduces sparsity, so we have fewer predicates to cluster and more observations for each.",
        "Of course, many practical inferences rely heavily on background knowledge about the world?such knowledge falls outside the scope of this work."

        "For example, the lexicon may contain the entry: write ` (S\\NP)/NP : ?y?x.write?",
        "(x,y) Crucially, there is a transparent interface between the syntactic category and the semantics.",
        "For example the transitive verb entry above defines the verb syntactically as a function mapping two noun-phrases to a sentence, and semantically as a binary relation between its two argument entities.",

        "We learn these by first mapping to a deterministic logical form (using predicates",
        "such as author?",
        "and write?",
        "), using a process similar to Boxer, and then clustering predicates based on their arguments.",
        "This lexicon can then be used to parse new sentences, and integrates seamlessly with CCG theories of formal semantics.",
        "Typing predicates?for example, determining that writing is a relation between people and books?",
        "has become standard in relation clustering (Schoen-mackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2012).",
        "We demonstate how to build a typing model into the CCG derivation, by subcategorizing all terms representing entities in the logical form with a more detailed type.",
        "These types are also induced from text, as explained in Section 5, but for convenience we describe them with human-readable labels, such as PER, LOC and BOOK.",
        "A key advantage of typing is that it allows us to model ambiguous predicates.",
        "Following Berant et al.",
        "(2011), we assume that different type signatures of the same predicate have different meanings, but given a type signature a predicate is unambiguous.",
        "For example a different lexical entry for the verb born is used in the contexts Obama was born in Hawaii and Obama was born in 1961, reflecting a distinction in the semantics that is not obvious in the syntax1.",
        "Typing also greatly improves the efficiency of clustering, as we only need to compare predicates with the same type during clustering (for example, we do not have to consider clustering a predicate between people and places with predicates between people and dates).",
        "In this work, we focus on inducing binary relations.",
        "Many existing approaches have shown how to produce good clusterings of (non-event) nouns (Brown et al., 1992), any of which could be simply integrated into our semantics?but relation clustering remains an open problem (see Section 9).",
        "N-ary relations are binarized, by creating a binary relation between each pair of arguments.",
        "For example, for the sentence Russia sold Alaska to the United States, the system creates three binary relations?",
        "corresponding to sellToSomeone(Russia, Alaska), buyFromSomeone(US, Alaska), sellSome-thingTo(Russia, US).",

        "Note that this allows us to compare semantic relations across different syntactic types?for example, both transitive verbs and argument-taking nouns can be seen as expressing binary semantic relations between entities.",

        "Initial semantic lexical entries for almost all words can be generated automatically from the syntactic category and POS tag (obtained from the parser), as the syntactic category captures the underlying predicate-argument structure.",
        "We use a Davidsonian-style representation of arguments (Davidson, 1967), which we binarize by creating a separate predicate for each pair of arguments of a word.",
