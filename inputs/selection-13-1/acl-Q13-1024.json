        "Word alignment is the task of identifying word correspondences between parallel sentence pairs.",
        "Word alignment has become a vital component of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, since it is required by almost all state-of-the-art SMT systems for the purpose of extracting phrase tables or even syntactic transformation rules (Koehn et al., 2007; Galley et al., 2004).",
        "During the past two decades, generative word alignment models such as the IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996) have been widely used, primarily because they are trained on bilingual sentences in an unsupervised manner and the implementation is freely available in the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "However, the word alignment quality of generative models is still far from satisfactory for SMT systems.",
        "In recent years, discriminative alignment models incorporating linguistically motivated features have become increasingly popular (Moore, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Riesa and Marcu, 2010; Saers et al., 2010; Riesa et al., 2011).",
        "These models are usually trained with manually annotated parallel data.",
        "However, when moving to a new language pair, large amount of hand-aligned data are usually unavailable and expensive to create.",
        "A more practical way to improve large-scale word alignment quality is to introduce syntactic knowledge into a generative model and train the model in an unsupervised manner (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Lopez and Resnik, 2005; DeNero and Klein, 2007; Pauls et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we take dependency cohesion (Fox, 2002) into account, which assumes phrases dominated by disjoint dependency subtrees tend not to overlap after translation.",
        "Instead of treating dependency cohesion as a hard constraint (Lin and Cherry, 2003) or using it as a feature in discriminative models (Cherry and Lin, 2006b), we treat dependency cohesion as a distortion constraint, and integrate it into a modified HMM word alignment model to softly influence the probabilities of alignment candidates.",
        "We also propose an approximate EM algorithm and an explicit Gibbs sampling algorithm to train the model in an unsupervised manner.",
        "Experiments on a large-scale Chinese-English translation task demonstrate that our model achieves improvements in both word alignment quality and machine translation quality.",
