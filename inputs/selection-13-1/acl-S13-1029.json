        "The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) shared task aims to find a unified way of measuring similarity between sentences.",
        "In fact, sentence similarity is a core element of tasks trying to establish how two pieces of text are related, such as Textual Entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2006), and Paraphrase Recognition (Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "The STS shared task was introduced for SemEval-2012 and was selected as its first shared task.",
        "Similar in spirit, STS differs from the well-known RTE shared tasks in two important points: it defines a graded similarity scale to measure similarity of two texts, instead of RTE's binary yes/no decision and the similarity relation is considered to be symmetrical, whereas the entailment relation of RTE is inherently unidirectional.",
        "The leading systems in the 2012 competition used a variety of very simple lexical features.",
        "Each system combines a different set of related features.",
        "CLaC Labs investigated the different combination possibilities of these simple lexical features and measured their performance on the different data sets.",
        "Originally conceived to explore the space of all possible feature combinations for ?feature combination selection?, a two-step method emerged that deliberately compiles and trains all feature combinations exhaustively and then trains an SVM regressor using all combination models as its input features.",
        "It turns out that this technique is not nearly as prohibitive as imagined and achieves statistically significant improvements over the alternative of feature selection or of using any one single combination individually.",
        "We propose the method as a viable approach when the characteristics of the data are not well understood and no satisfactory training set is available."

        "In addition, they use MOSES, a statistical machine translation system (Koehn et al., 2007), to translate each English sentence into Dutch, German, and Spanish and back into English in an effort to increase their training set of similar text pairs.",
        "TakeLab (S?aric et al., 2012), in place two of the 2012 STS shared task, uses n-gram models, two WordNet-based measures, LSA, and dependencies to align subject-verb-object predicate structures.",
        "Including named-entities and number matching in the feature space improved performance of their support vector regressor.",

        "We were able to establish that unigrams and 4-skip bigrams are most versatile, but surprisingly that Roget's Thesaurus outperforms the two leading WordNet-based distance measures.",
