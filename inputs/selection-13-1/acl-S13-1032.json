        "Measures of text similarity have been used for a long time in applications in natural language processing and related areas.",
        "One of the earliest applications of text similarity is perhaps the vector-space model used in information retrieval, where the document most relevant to an input query is determined by ranking documents in a collection in reversed order of their angular distance with the given query (Salton and Lesk, 1971).",
        "Text similarity has also been used for relevance feedback and text classification (Rocchio, 1971), word sense disambiguation (Lesk, 1986; Sch√ºtze, 1998), and extractive summa-rization (Salton et al., 1997), in the automatic evaluation of machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002), ?carmen.banea@gmail.com ?",
        "rada@cs.unt.edu text summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003), text coherence (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005) and in plagiarism detection (Nawab et al., 2011).",
        "Earlier work on this task has primarily focused on simple lexical matching methods, which produce a similarity score based on the number of lexical units that occur in both input segments.",
        "Improvements to this simple method have considered stemming, stopword removal, part-of-speech tagging, longest subsequence matching, as well as various weighting and normalization factors (Salton and Buckley, 1997).",
        "While successful to a certain degree, these lexical similarity methods cannot always identify the semantic similarity of texts.",
        "For instance, there is an obvious similarity between the text segments ?she owns a dog?",
        "and ?she has an animal,?",
        "yet these methods will mostly fail to identify it.",
        "More recently, researchers have started to consider the possibility of combining the large number of word-to-word semantic similarity measures (e.g., (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995)) within a semantic similarity method that works for entire texts.",
        "The methods proposed to date in this direction mainly consist of either bipartite-graph matching strategies that aggregate word-to-word similarity into a text similarity score (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Islam and Inkpen, 2009; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011; Mohler et al., 2011), or data-driven methods that perform component-wise additions of semantic vector representations as obtained with corpus measures such as latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1997), explicit semantic analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), or salient semantic analysis",
        "(Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we describe the system variations with which we participated in the *SEM 2013 task on semantic textual similarity (Agirre et al., 2013).",
        "The system builds upon our earlier work on corpus-based and knowledge-based methods of text semantic similarity (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011; Mohler et al., 2011; Banea et al., 2012), while also incorporating opinion aware features.",
        "Our observation is that text is not only similar on a semantic level, but also with respect to opinions.",
        "Let us consider the following text segments: ?she owns a dog?",
        "and ?I believe she owns a dog.?",
        "The question then becomes how similar these text fragments truly are.",
        "Current systems will consider the two sentences semantically equivalent, yet to a human, they are not.",
        "A belief is not equivalent to a fact (and for the case in point, the person may very well have a cat or some other pet), and this should consequently lower the relatedness score.",
        "For this reason, we advocate that STS systems should also consider the opinions expressed and their equivalence.",
        "While the *SEM STS task is not formulated to evaluate this type of similarity, we complement more traditional corpus and knowledge-based methods with opinion aware features, and use them in a meta-learning framework in an arguably first attempt at incorporating this type of information to infer text-to-text similarity."

        "We explore several of these measures in depth in Section 3.3.1.",
        "On the other side, corpus-based measures such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1997), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), Second Order PMI (Islam and Inkpen, 2006), Hyperspace Analogues to Language (Burgess et al., 1998) and distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) employ probabilistic approaches to decode the semantics of words.",
        "They consist of unsupervised methods that utilize the contextual information and patterns observed in raw text to build semantic profiles of words.",
