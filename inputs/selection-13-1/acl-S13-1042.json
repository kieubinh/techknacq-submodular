        "Massive social media corpora, such as blogs, tweets, and Facebook statuses have recently peaked the interest of social scientists.",
        "Compared to traditional samples in tens or hundreds, social media sample sizes are orders of magnitude larger, often containing millions or billions of posts or queries.",
        "Such text provides potential for unobtrusive, inexpensive, and real-time measurement of psychological states (such as positive or negative affect) and aspects of subjective well-being (such as happiness and engagement).",
        "Social scientists have recently begun to use social media text in a variety of studies (Cohn et al., 2004; Kramer, 2010; Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010; Kamvar and Harris, 2011; Dodds et al., 2011; Golder and Macy, 2011).",
        "One of the most popular approaches to estimate psychological states is by using the word count method (Pennebaker et al., 2007), where one tracks the frequency of words that have been judged to be associated with a given state.",
        "Greater use of such words is taken to index the prevalence of the corresponding state.",
        "For example, the use of the word ?happy?",
        "is taken to index positive emotion, and ?angry?",
        "to index negative emotion.",
        "The most widely used tool to carry out such analysis, and the one we investigate in this paper, is Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2001; Pennebaker et al., 2007).",
        "LIWC, originally developed to analyze writing samples for emotion and control, has grown to include a variety of lexica for linguistic and psychosocial topics including positive and negative emotions, pronouns, money, work, and religion.",
        "The word count approach has high appeal to social scientists in need of a tool to approach social media, and although others have been used (see, for example (Gottschalk and Bechtel, 1998; Bollen et al., 2010), LIWC's lexica are generally perceived as a ?tried-and-tested?",
        "list of words (Miller, 2011).",
        "Unfortunately, the word count approach has some drawbacks when used as indicators for psychological states.",
        "Words are the unit of measurement, but words can carry many different meanings depending on context.",
        "Consider the Facebook posts below containing instances of ?play?, a word associated with positive emotion in LIWC.",

        "is a verb but it is used in a sense that is not directly associated with positive emotion.",
        "(1) and (2) demonstrate how lexical ambiguities (i.e. multiple parts-of-speech or word senses) can affect accuracy of words in a lexicon.",
        "Additionally, even when appearing as the expected part of speech and word sense, signal from a word may change due to its context, such as being within the scope of a negation as in (4), or describing something desired as in (5).",

        "...all work no play :-( 5. i sure wish i had about 50 hours a day to play cod Our goal is to characterize the errors of the widely used word count approach, and show that such lexica can be significantly improved by employing an ambiguity metric to refine such lexica.",
        "Rather than work on a new method of measuring psychological states, we work within the bounds of word count and ask how accurate it is and whether we can improve it without sacrificing its simplicity and scalability.",
        "We attempt to reduce the erroneous signal of the word count approach while maintaining legitimate signal simply by refining the lexicon.",
        "In other words, we would like to move closer to the goal in Figure 1, by eliminating words that often carry erroneous signal such as ?play?, and keeping words which often carry the sought-after signal, such as ?cheerful?.",
        "The difficulty in doing this is that we do not have the data to tell us which words are most likely to carry signal (even if we had such data we would like to develop a method that could be applied to any newly created lexica).",
        "Instead we leverage part-of-speech and word sense data to help us determine which words are lexically ambiguous.",
        "tive emotion (POSEMO) and text containing LIWC terms for POSEMO.",
        "Our approach of eliminating ambiguous words increases the precision at the expense of recall, a reasonable trade-off in social media where we are working with millions or even billions of word instances.",
        "Additionally, it is minimally-supervised, in that we do not require training data on human-state; instead we use existing hand-labeled corpora, such as SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), for word sense information.",
        "Not requiring training data also means our refinement is flexible; it can be applied to multiple domains and lexica, it makes few assumptions that might introduce problems of over-fitting, and it is parsimonious in that it merely improves an established approach.",
        "This paper makes two primary contributions: (1) an analysis of the types of errors common for the word count approach (Section 3), and (2) a general method for refining psychosocial lexica based on the ambiguity of words (Section 4).",
        "Before describing these contributions, we discuss related work, making the case for using social media in social science and surveying some work in computational linguistics.",
        "We then evaluate both the original LIWC lexicon and our refinement of it against human judgments of expression of positive and negative emotions on hand-annotated Facebook posts, and show the benefit of lexicon refinement for estimating well-being over time for large aggregates of posts.",
        "Finally, we discuss the implications of our work and possible future directions."
