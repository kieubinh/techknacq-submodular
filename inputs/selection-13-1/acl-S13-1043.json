        "Implicit arguments are a discourse-level phenomenon that has not been extensively studied in semantic processing.",
        "One reason for this lies in the scarce amount of annotated data sets available.",
        "We argue that more data of this kind would be helpful to improve existing approaches to linking implicit arguments in discourse and to enable more in-depth studies of the phenomenon itself.",
        "In this paper, we present a range of studies that empirically validate this claim.",
        "Our contributions are threefold: we present a heuristic approach to automatically identify implicit arguments and their antecedents by exploiting comparable texts; we show how the induced data can be used as training data for improving existing argument linking models; finally, we present a novel approach to modeling local coherence that extends previous approaches by taking into account non-explicit entity references."

        "Semantic role labeling systems traditionally process text in a sentence-by-sentence fashion, constructing local structures of semantic meaning (Palmer et al., 2010).",
        "Information relevant to these structures, however, can be non-local in natural language texts (Palmer et al., 1986; Fillmore, 1986, inter alia).",
        "In this paper, we view instances of this phenomenon, also referred to as implicit arguments, as elements of discourse.",
        "In a coherent discourse, each utterance focuses on a salient set of entities, also called ?foci?",
        "(Sidner, 1979) or ?centers?",
        "(Joshi and Kuhn, 1979).",
        "According to the theory of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995), the salience of an entity in a discourse is reflected by linguistic factors such as choice of referring expression and syntactic form.",
        "Both extremes of salience, i.e., contexts of referential continuity (Brown, 1983) and irrelevance, can also be reflected by the non-realization of an entity.",
        "Altough specific instances of non-realization, so-called zero anaphora, have been well-studied in discourse analysis (Sag and Hankamer, 1984; Tanenhaus and Carlson, 1990, inter alia), this phenomenon has widely been ignored in computational approaches to entity-based coherence modeling.",
        "It could, however, provide an explanation for local coherence in cases that are not covered by current models of Centering (cf. Louis and Nenkova (2010)).",
        "In this work, we propose a new model to predict whether realizing an argument contributes to local coherence in a given position in discourse.",
        "Example (1) shows a text fragment, in which argument realization is necessary in the first sentence but redundant in the second.",
        "(1) El Salvador is now the only Latin American country which still has troops in [Iraq].",
        "Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican Republic have withdrawn their troops [?].",
        "From a semantic processing perspective, a human reader can easily infer that ?Iraq?, the marked entity in the first sentence of Example (1), is also an implicit argument of the predicate ?withdraw?",
        "in the second sentence.",
        "This inference step is, however, difficult to model computationally as it involves an interplay of two challenging sub-tasks: first, a semantic processor has to determine that an argument is not realized (but inferrable); and second, a suit",
        "able antecedent has to be found within the discourse context.",
        "For the remainder of this paper, we refer to these steps as identifying and linking implicit arguments to discourse antecedents.",
        "As indicated by Example (1), implicit arguments are an important aspect in semantic processing, yet they are not captured in traditional semantic role labeling systems.",
        "The main reasons for this are the scarcity of annotated data, and the inherent difficulty of inferring discourse antecedents automatically.",
        "In this paper, we propose to induce implicit arguments and discourse antecedents by exploiting complementary (explicit) information obtained from monolingual comparable texts (Section 3).",
        "We apply the empirically acquired data in argument linking (Section 4) and coherence modeling (Section 5).",

        "Based on the original model, a few extensions have been proposed: for example, Filippova and Strube (2007) and Elsner and Charniak (2011b) suggested additional features to characterize semantic relatedness between entities and features specific to single entities, respectively.",

        "The role of implicit arguments has been studied early on in the context of semantic processing (Fillmore, 1986; Palmer et al., 1986).",
        "Yet, the phenomenon has mostly been ignored in semantic role labeling.",
        "First data sets, focusing on implicit arguments, have only recently become available: Ruppenhofer et al. (2010) organized a SemEval shared task on ?linking events and participants in discourse?, Gerber and Chai (2012) made available implicit argument annotations for the NomBank corpus (Meyers et al., 2008) and Moor et al. (2013) provide annotations for parts of the OntoNotes corpus (Weischedel et al., 2011).",
        "However, these resources are very limited: The annotations by Moor et al. and Gerber and Chai are restricted to 5 and 10 predicate types, respectively.",
        "The training set of the Se-mEval task contains only 245 resolved implicit arguments in total.",
