        "Additional context We experimented with context windows of 0, 1, 3, and 7 words preceding and following the token to be labeled (i.e. window sizes of 1, 3, 7, and 15).",
        "For each window size, we trained ATT1, ATT2 and ATT3 models.",
        "The ATT1 models had 18 basic features per token in the context window, for up to 15 tokens, so up to 270 basic features for each token to be labeled.",

        "We grouped our basic features (see Table 2) by type rather than by token, and the LLAMA front-end then produced ngram features.",

        "The absence of syntactic features causes F1 to drop slightly (less than 2.5% for all but the smallest window size), with recall decreasing while precision improves somewhat.",
        "Attribute F1 is also impacted minimally by the absence of semantic features, and about 2-5% by the absence of syntactic features for all but the smallest window size.1 Our results for time expression extraction and classification on the TempEval-3 test data are provided in Table 5.",
        "Here, the performance drops more in the absence of semantic and syntactic features; however, there is an interaction between length of time expression and performance drop which we may be able to ameliorate in future work by handling consistency issues in the BIO time expression extraction model better.",
        "1In Tables 4 and 5, we present results that are slightly different from our submission due to a minor fix in our models by removing some redundant feature values used twice.",
        "for type and value features A somewhat surprising finding is that both event and time expression extraction are subject to relatively tight constraints from the lexical context.",
        "We were surprised by how well the ATT3 (WORDS ONLY) models performed, especially in terms of precision.",
        "We were also surprised that the words only models with window sizes of 3 and 7 performed as well as the models with a window size of 15.",
