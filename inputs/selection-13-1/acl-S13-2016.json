        "It is well known finding words similarity, even when it is lexical or semantic can improve entailment recognition and paraphrase identification; and ultimately lead to improvements in a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Several areas like question answering, query expansion, information retrieval, and many others, depend on phrasal semantics (PS).",
        "PS, is concerned with how the meaning of a sentence is composed both from the meaning of the constituent words, and from extra meaning contained within the structural organization of the sentence itself (Dominey, 2005).",
        "The aim of SemEval 2013 competition is also discovering similarity, specifically in Evaluating Phrasal Semantics (EPS).",
        "The goal of this task is to evaluate how well systems can judge the semantic similarity of a word and a short sequence of words.",
        "That is, given a set of pairs of this type; classify it on negative (if the meaning of the word is semantically different to the meaning of the sequence) or positive (if the meaning of the sequence, as a whole, is semantically close to the meaning of the word).",
        "Based on this, we developed a system capable to detect if two phrases are semantically close.",
