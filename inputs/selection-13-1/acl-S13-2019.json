        ".",
        "To measure relatedness, most of those approaches rely on the structure of the semantic network, such as the semantic link path, depth (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Wu and Palmer, 1994), direction (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), or type (Tsatsaronis et al., 2010).",
        "Our phrasal semantic relatedness approach is inspired from those methods.",
        "However, our approach is based on the idea that the combination of the least costly types of relations that relate one concept to a set of concepts are a suitable indicator of their semantic relatedness.",

        "For example, Figure 1 shows part of the semantic network created around the word car.",
        "In this graph, single-line ovals represent words, while double-line ovals represent synsets.",
        "To compute the semantic relatedness between nodes in the semantic network, it is necessary to take into consideration the semantic relation involved between two nodes.",
