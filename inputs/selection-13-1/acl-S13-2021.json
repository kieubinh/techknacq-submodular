        "The Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) task in SemEval 2013 consists in detecting the entailment relationship between two topic-related text fragments (usually called T(ext) and H(ypothesis)) in different languages, which is a cross-lingual extension of TE task in (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).",
        "We say T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. Mehdad et al. (2010b) firstly proposed this problem within a new challenging application scenario, i.e., content synchronization.",
        "In consideration of the directionality, the task needs to assign one of the following entailment judg-ments to a pair of sentences (1) forward: unidirectional entailment from T to H; (2) backward: unidirectional entailment from H to T; (3) bidirectional: the two fragments entail each other (i.e., semantic equivalence); (4) non-entailment: there is no entailment between T and H. During the last decades, many researchers and communities have paid a lot of attention to resolve the TE detection (e.g., seven times of the Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge, i.e., from RTE1 to RET7, have been held) since identifying the relationship between two sentences is at the core of many NLP applications, such as text summa-rization (Lloret et al., 2008) or question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).",
        "For example, in text summarization, a redundant sentence should be omitted from the summary if this sentence can be entailed from other expressions in the summary.",
        "CLTE extends those tasks with lingual dimensionality, where more than one language is involved.",
        "Although it is a relatively new task, a basic solution has been provided in (Mehdad et al., 2010b), which brings the problem back to monolingual scenario using MT to translate H into the language of T. The promising performance indicates the potentialities of such a simple approach which integrates MT and monolingual TE algorithms (Castillo, 2011; Jimenez et al., 2012; Mehdad et al., 2010a).",
        "In this work, we regard CLTE as a multiclass classification problem, in which multiple feature types are used in conjunction with a multiclass SVM classifier.",
        "Specifically, our approach can be divided into three steps.",
        "Firstly, following (Espla`-Gomis et al., 2012; Meng et al., 2012), we use MT to",
        "bridge the gap of language differences between T and H. Secondly, we perform a preprocessing procedure to maximize the similarity of the two text fragments so as to make a more accurate calculation of surface text similarity measures.",
        "Besides several features described in previous work (Malakasiotis, 2009; Espla`-Gomis et al., 2012), we also propose several novel features regarding to sentence difference and semantic similarity.",
        "Finally, all these features are combined together and serves as input of a multiclass SVM classifier.",
        "After analyzing of the results obtained in preliminary experiments, we also cast this problem as a hierarchical classification problem.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes different features used in our systems.",
        "Section 3 presents the system settings including the datasets and preprocessing.",
        "Section 4 shows the results of different systems on different language pairs.",
