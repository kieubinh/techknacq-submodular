        "Lexical ambiguity remains one of the major problems for current machine translation systems.",
        "In the following French sentence ?Je cherche des ide?es pour manger de l?avocat?1, the word ?avocat?",
        "is clearly referring to the fruit, whereas both Google Translate2 as well as Babelfish3 translate the word as ?lawyer?.",
        "Although ?lawyer?",
        "is a correct translation of the word ?avocat?, it is the wrong translation in this context.",
        "Other language technology applications, such as Question Answering (QA) systems or information retrieval (IR) systems, also suffer from the poor contextual disambiguation of word senses.",
        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is still considered one of the most challenging problems within",
        "language technology today.",
        "It requires the construction of an artificial text understanding as the system should detect the correct word sense based on the context of the word.",
        "Different methodologies have been investigated to solve the problem; see for instance Agirre and Edmonds (2006) and Navigli (2009) for a detailed overview of WSD algorithms and evaluation.",
        "This paper reports on the second edition of the ?Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation?",
        "(CLWSD) task, that builds further on the insights we gained from the SemEval-2010 evaluation (Lefever and Hoste, 2010b) and for which new test data were annotated.",
        "The task is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation task for English nouns, the sense label of which is composed of translations in different target languages (viz. French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and German).",
        "The sense inventory is built up on the basis of the Europarl parallel corpus; all translations of a polysemous word were manually grouped into clusters, which constitute different senses of that given word.",
        "For the test data, native speakers assigned a translation cluster(s) to each test sentence and gave their top three translations from the predefined list of Europarl translations, in order to assign weights to the set of gold standard translations.",
        "The decision to recast the more traditional monolingual WSD task into a cross-lingual WSD task was motivated by the following arguments.",
        "Firstly, using multilingual unlabeled parallel corpora contributes to clearing the data acquisition bottleneck for WSD, because using translations as sense labels excludes the need for manually created sense-tagged corpora",
        "and sense inventories such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998).",
        "Moreover, as there is fairly little linguistic knowledge involved, the framework can be easily deployed for a variety of different languages.",
        "Secondly, a cross-lingual approach also deals with the sense granularity problem; finer sense distinctions are only relevant as far as they get lexicalized in different translations of the word.",
        "If we take the English word ?head?",
        "as an example, we see that this word is always translated as ?hoofd?",
        "in Dutch (both for the ?chief?",
        "and for the ?body part?",
        "sense of the word).",
        "At the same time, the subjectivity problem is tackled that arises when lexicographers have to construct a fixed set of senses for a particular word that should fit all possible domains and applications.",
        "In addition, the use of domain-specific corpora allows to derive sense inventories that are tailored towards a specific target domain or application and to train a dedicated CLWSD system using these particular sense inventories.",
        "Thirdly, working immediately with translations instead of more abstract sense labels allows to bypass the need to map abstract sense labels to corresponding translations.",
        "This makes it easier to integrate a dedicated WSD module into real multilingual applications such as machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007) or information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004).",
        "Many studies have already shown the validity of a cross-lingual approach to Word Sense Disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004; Tufis?",
        "et al, 2004; Chan and Ng, 2005; Specia et al., 2007; Apidi-anaki, 2009).",
        "The Cross-lingual WSD task contributes to this research domain by the construction of a dedicated benchmark data set where the ambiguous words were annotated with the senses from a multilingual sense inventory extracted from a parallel corpus.",
        "This benchmark data sets allows a detailed comparison between different approaches to the CLWSD task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 focuses on the task description and briefly recapitalizes the construction of the sense inventory and the annotation procedure of the test sentences.",
        "Section 3 presents the participating systems to the task, whereas Section 4 gives an overview of the experimental setup and results.",
        "Section 5 concludes this paper.",

        "Both for coach and match, two words consistently performing bad in all systems, there are very few training examples in the corpus (66 and 109 respectively).",
        "This could also explain why the NRC-SMT system, that also uses additional parallel data, achieves better results for coach than all other systems.",
