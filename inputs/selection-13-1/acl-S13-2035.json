        "Word ambiguity is a pervasive issue in Natural Language Processing.",
        "Two main techniques in computational lexical semantics, i.e., Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Word Sense Induction (WSI) address this issue from different perspectives: the former is aimed at assigning word senses from a predefined sense inventory to words in context, whereas the latter automatically identifies the meanings of a word of interest by clustering the contexts in which it occurs (see (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012) for a survey).",
        "Unfortunately, the paradigms of both WSD and WSI suffer from significant issues which hamper their success in real-world applications.",
        "In fact, the performance of WSD systems depends heavily on which sense inventory is chosen.",
        "For instance, the most popular computational lexicon of English, i.e., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides fine-grained distinctions which make the disambiguation task quite difficult even for humans (Edmonds and Kil-garriff, 2002; Snyder and Palmer, 2004), although disagreements can be solved to some extent with graph-based methods (Navigli, 2008).",
        "On the other hand, although WSI overcomes this issue by allowing unrestrained sets of senses, its evaluation is particularly arduous because there is no easy way of comparing and ranking different representations of senses.",
        "In fact, all the proposed measures in the literature tend to favour specific cluster shapes (e.g., singletons or all-in-one clusters) of the senses produced as output.",
        "Indeed, WSI evaluation is actually an instance of the more general and difficult problem of evaluating clustering algorithms.",
        "Nonetheless, many everyday tasks carried out by online users would benefit from intelligent systems able to address the lexical ambiguity issue effectively.",
        "A case in point is Web information retrieval, a task which is becoming increasingly difficult given the continuously growing pool of Web text of the most wildly disparate kinds.",
        "Recent work has addressed this issue by proposing a general evaluation framework for injecting WSI into Web search result clustering and diversification (Navigli and Crisa-fulli, 2010; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013).",
        "In this task the search results returned by a search engine for an input query are grouped into clusters, and diversified by providing a reranking which maximizes the meaning heterogeneity of the top ranking results.",
        "The Semeval-2013 task described in this paper1 adopts the evaluation framework of Di Marco and Navigli (2013), and extends it to both WSD and WSI systems.",
        "The task is aimed at overcoming the well-known limitations of in vitro evaluations, such as those of previous SemEval tasks on the topic (Agirre",
        "and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar et al., 2010), and enabling a fair comparison between the two disambiguation paradigms.",
        "Key to our framework is the assumption that search results grouped into a given cluster are semantically related to each other and that each cluster is expected to represent a specific meaning of the input query (even though it is possible for more than one cluster to represent the same meaning).",
        "For instance, consider the target query apple and the following 3 search result snippets:",
        "1.",
        "Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is... 2.",
        "The science of apple growing is called pomology... 3.",
        "Apple designs and creates iPod and iTunes...",
        "Participating systems were requested to produce a clustering that groups snippets conveying the same meaning of the input query apple, i.e., ideally {1, 3} and {2} in the above example."

        "For each ambiguous query the task required participating systems to cluster the top ranking snippets returned by a search engine (we used the Google Search API).",
        "WSI systems were required to identify the meanings of the input query and cluster the snippets into semantically-related groups according to their meanings.",
        "Instead, WSD systems were requested to sense-tag the given snippets with the appropriate senses of the input query, thereby implicitly determining a clustering of snippets (i.e., one cluster per sense)."

        "Following previous work on the topic (Bernardini et al., 2009; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013) we selected those queries for which a sense inventory exists as a disambiguation page in the English Wikipedia2.",
        "This guaranteed that the selected queries consisted of either a single word or a multi-word expression for which we had a collaboratively-edited list of meanings, including lexicographic and encyclopedic ones.",

        "(first row) vs. the queries sampled for our task (second row).",
        "up of > 4 words, since the length of the great majority of queries lay in the range [1, 4].",
        "In Table 1 we compare the percentage distribution of 1 to 4-word queries in the AOL query logs against our dataset of queries.",
        "Note that we increased the percentage of 3 and 4-word queries in order to have a significant coverage of those lengths.",
        "Anyhow, in both cases most queries contained from 1 to 2 words.",
        "Note that the reported percentage distributions of query length is different from recent statistics for two reasons: first, over the years users have increased the average number of words per query in order to refine their searches; second, we selected only queries which were either single words (e.g., apple) or multi-word expressions (e.g., mortal kom-bat), thereby discarding several long queries composed of different words (such as angelina jolie actress).",
        "Finally, we submitted each query to Google search and retrieved the 64 top-ranking results returned for each query.",
        "Therefore, overall the dataset consists of 100 queries and 6,400 results.",
