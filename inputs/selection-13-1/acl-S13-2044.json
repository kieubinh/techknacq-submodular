        "Building upon the previous work, we used the notions of trajectors, landmarks and spatial indicators as introduced by Kordjamshidi et al. (2010).",
        "In addition, we further expanded the set of spatial roles labels with motion indicators, paths, directions and distances to capture fine-grained spatial semantics of static spatial relations (as the ones which do not involve motions), and to accommodate dynamic spatial relations (the ones which do involve motions).",
        "Static spatial relations are defined as relations between still objects, whereas one object plays a central role in the spatial scene, which is called trajector, and the second one plays a secondary role, and it is called landmark.",
        "In language, a spatial relation between two objects is usually implemented by a preposition (in, on, at, etc.)",
        "or a prepositional phrase (on top of, inside of, etc.).",
        "A static spatial relation is defined as a tuple that contains a trajector, a landmark and a spatial indicator.",
        "In the annotation schema, these annotations are defined as follows: Trajector: Trajector is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that denotes a central object of a spatial scene.",
        "For example: ?",
        "[Trajector a lake] in the forest",
        "?",
        "[Trajector a flag] on top of the building Landmark: Landmark is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that denotes a secondary object of a spatial scene, to which a possible spatial relation (as between two objects in space) can be established.",
        "For example: ?",
        "a lake in [Landmark the forest] ?",
        "a flag on top of [Landmark the building] Spatial Indicator: Spatial Indicator is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that signals a spatial relation between objects (trajectors and",
        "landmarks) of a spatial scene.",

        "that holds between spatial markables in text as, e.g., between a trajector and a landmark and triggered by a spatial indicator.",
        "In spatial information theory the relations and properties are usually grouped into the domains of topological, directional, and distance relations and also shape (Stock, 1998).",
        "Three semantic classes for spatial relations were proposed: ?",
        "Region.",
        "This type refers to a region of space which is always defined in relation to a landmark, e.g., the interior or exterior.",
        "For example: a lake in the forest =?",
        "?Region, [Sp indicator in], [Trajector a lake], [Landmark the forest]?",
        "?",
        "Direction.",
        "This relation type denotes a direction along the axes provided by the different frames of reference, in case the trajector of motion is not characterized in terms of its relation to the region of a landmark.",
        "For example: a flag on top of the building =?",
        "?Direction, [Sp indicator on top of ], [Trajector a flag], [Landmark the building]?",
        "?",
        "Distance.",
        "Type Distance states information about the spatial distance of the objects and could be a qualitative expression, such as close, far or quantitative, such as 12 km.",
        "For example: the kids are close to the blackboard =?",
        "?Distance, [Distance close], [Trajector the kids], [Landmark the blackboard]?",
        "In addition to static spatial relations and their roles, SpRL-2013 introduces new spatial roles to capture dynamic spatial relations which involve motions.",
        "Let us demonstrate this with the following example: (1) In Brazil coming from the North-East I stepped into the small forest and followed down a dried creek.",
        "The text above describes a motion, and the reader can identify a number of concepts which are peculiar for motions: there is an object whose location is changing, the motion is performed in a specific spatial context, with a specific direction, and with a number of locations related to the object's motion.",
        "There has been an enormous effort in formalizing and annotating motions in natural language.",
        "While annotating motions was out of scope for the previous SpRL task and SpatialML (Mani et al., 2010), the most recent work on the Dynamic Interval Temporal Logic (DITL) (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2011) presents a framework for modeling motions as a change of state, which adapts linguistic background considering path constructions and manner-of-motion constructions.",
        "On this basis the Spa-tiotemporal Markup Language (STML) has been introduced for annotating motions in natural language.",
        "In STML, a motion is treated as a change of location over time, while differentiating between a number of spatial configurations along the path.",
        "Being well-defined for the formal representations of motion and reasoning, in which representations either take explicit reference to temporal frames or reify a spatial object for a path, all the previous work seems to be difficult to apply in practice when annotating motions in natural language.",
        "It can be attributed to possible vague descriptions of path in natural language when neither clear temporal event ordering, nor distinction between the start, end or intermediate path point can be made.",
        "In SpRL-2013, we simplify the previously introduced notion of path in order to provide practical motion annotations.",
        "For dynamic spatial relations we introduce the following roles:",
        "Trajector: Trajector is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase which denotes an object which moves, starts, interrupts, resumes a motion, or is forcibly involved in a motion.",
        "For example: ?",
        "... coming from the North-East [Trajector I] stepped into ... Motion Indicator: Motion indicator is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase which signals a motion of the trajector along a path.",

        "... [Motion coming] from the North-East I [Motion stepped into] ... and [Motion followed down] ...",
        "Path: Path is a spatial role label assigned to a word or phrase that denotes the path of the motion as the trajector is moving along, starting in, arriving in or traversing it.",
        "In SpRL-2013, as opposite to STML, the notion of path does not have the temporal dimension, thus whenever the motion is performed along a path, for which either a start, an intermediate, an end path point, or an entire path can be identified in text, they are labeled as path.",
        "In Example (1), a number of path labels can be identified: ?",
        "... coming [Path from the North-East] I stepped into [Path the small forest] and followed down [Path a dried creek].",
        "Landmark: The notion of path should not be confused with landmarks.",
        "For spatial annotations, landmark has been introduced as a spatial role label for a secondary object of the spatial scene.",
        "Being of great importance for static spatial relations, in dynamic spatial relations, landmarks are used to capture a spatial context of a motion as for example: ?",
        "In [Landmark Brazil] coming from the North-East ...",
        "Distance: In contrast to the previous SpRL annotation standard, in which distances and directions have been uniformly treated as signals, in SpRL2013 if the motion is performed for a certain distance, and such a distance is mentioned in text, the corresponding textual span is labeled as distance.",
        "Distance is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that denotes an absolute or relative distance of motion, or the distance between a trajector and a landmark in case of a static spatial scene.",
        "For",
        "example: ?",
        "[Distance 25 km] ?",
        "[Distance about 100 m] ?",
        "[Distance not far away] ?",
        "[Distance 25 min by car] Direction: Additionally, if the motion is performed in a certain (absolute or relative) direction, and such a direction is mentioned in text, the corresponding textual span is annotated as direction.",
