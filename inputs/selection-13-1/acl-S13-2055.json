        "In doing so they have assembled corpora in support of the following two subtasks: Task A - Contextual Polarity Disambiguation ?Given a message containing a marked instance of a word or phrase, determine whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context.?",
        "Task B - Message Polarity Classification ?Given a message, classify whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen.?",
        "This paper describes the systems submitted by Avaya Labs for participation in subtasks A and B.",
        "Our goal for this evaluation was to investigate the usefulness of dependency parses, polarity lexicons, and unlabeled tweets for sentiment classification on short messages.",
        "In total we built four systems for SemEval-2013 task 2.",
        "For task B we developed a constrained model using supervised learning, and an unconstrained model that used semi-supervised learning in the form of self-training and polarity lexicon expansion.",
