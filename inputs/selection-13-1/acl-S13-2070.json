        "For example, many new forms of expression and language features have emerged on Twitter, including expressions containing mentions, hashtags, emoticons, and abbreviations.",

        "Other examples include using looser descriptions of sentiment rather than rigid positive/negative labelings (Whitelaw et al., 2005) and investigating how connections between users can be used to predict sentiment (Tan et al., 2011).",
        "This task differs from past work in sentiment analysis of tweets because we aim to build a model capable of predicting the sentiment of sub-phrases within the tweet rather than considering the entire tweet.",
