        "We propose to use many features in order to improve a trained classifier of Twitter messages; these features extend the feature vector of uni-gram model by the concepts extracted from DBpedia, the verb groups and the similar adjectives extracted from WordNet, the Senti-features extracted using SentiWordNet and some useful domain specific features.",
        "We also built a dictionary for emotion icons, abbreviation and slang words in tweets which is useful before extending the tweets with different features.",
        "Adding these features has improved the f-measure accuracy 2% with SVM and 4% with NaiveBayes."

        "In recent years, the explosion of social media has changed the relation between the users and the web.",
        "The world has become closer and more ?real-time?",
        "than ever.",
        "People have increasingly been part of virtual society where they have created their content, shared it, interacted with others in different ways and at a very increasingly rate.",
        "Twitter is one of the most important social media, with 1 billion tweets1 posted per week and 637 million",
        "With the availability of such content, it attracts the attention from who want to understand the opinion and interestingness of individuals.",
        "Thus, it would be useful in various domains such as politics, financing, marketing and social.",
        "In this context, the efficacy of sentiment analysis of twitter has been demonstrated at improving prediction of box-office revenues of movies in advance of their release (Asur and Huberman, 2010).",
        "Sentiment Analysis has been used to study the impact of 13 twitter accounts of celebrated person on their followers (Bae and Lee, 2012) and for forecasting the interesting tweets which are more probably to be reposted by the followers many times (Naveed, Gottron et al., 2011).",
        "However, sentiment analysis of microblogs faces several challenges, the limited size of posts (e.g., maximum 140 characters in Twitter), the informal language of such content containing slang words and non-standard expressions (e.g. gr8 instead of great, LOL instead of laughing out loud, goooood etc.",
        "), and the high level of noise in the posts due to the absence of correctness verification by user or spelling checker tools.",
        "Three different approaches can be identified in the literature of Sentiment Analysis, the first approach is the lexicon based which uses specific types of lexicons to derive the polarity of a text, this approach is suffering from the limited size of lexicon and requires human expertise to build the lexicon (Joshi, Balamurali et al., 2011).",
        "The second one is machine learning approach which uses annotated texts with a given label to learn a statistical model and an early work was done on a movie review dataset (Pang, Lee et al., 2002).",
        "Both lexicon and machine learning approaches can be",
        "combined to achieve a better performance (Khuc, Shivade et al. 2012).",
        "The third one is social approach which exploits social network properties and data for enhancing the accuracy of the classification (Speriosu, Sudan et al., 2011; Tan, Lee et al. 2011; Hu, Tang et al., 2013) (Hu, Tang et al., 2013) (Tan, Lee et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper, we employ machine learning.",
        "Each text is represented by a vector in which the features have to be selected carefully.",
        "They can be the words of the text, their POS tags (part of speech), or any other syntactic or semantic features.",
        "We propose to exploit some additional features (section 3) for sentiment analysis that extend the representation of tweets by: ?",
        "the concepts extracted from DBpedia3, ?",
        "the related adjectives and verb groups extracted from WordNet4, ?",
        "some ?social?",
        "features such as the number of happy and bad emotion icons,",
        "?",
        "the number of exclamation and question marks, ?",
        "the existence of URL (binary feature), ?",
        "if the tweet is re-tweeted (binary feature), ?",
        "the number of symbols the tweet contains, ?",
        "the number of uppercase words, ?",
        "some other senti-features extracted from",
        "SentiWordNet5 such as the number of positive, negative and neutral words that allow estimating a score of the negativity, positivity and objectivity of the tweets, their polarity and subjectivity.",
        "We extended the unigram model with these features (section 4.2).",
        "We also constructed a dictionary for the abbreviations and the slang words used in Twitter in order to overcome the ambiguity of the tweets.",
        "We tested various combinations (section 4.2) of these features, and then we chose the one that gave the highest F-measure for negative and positive classes (submission for Tweet subtask B of sentiment analysis in twitter task of SemEval2013 (Wilson, Kozareva et al. 2013)).",
        "We tested different machine learning models: Na?ve Bayes, SVM, IcsiBoost6 but the submitted runs exploited SVM only6.",

(2011) extended their approach by using real valued prior polarity and by combining prior polarity with POS.",
        "They build models for classifying tweets into positive, negative and neutral sentiment classes and three models were proposed: a unigram model, a feature based model and a tree kernel based model which presented a new tree representation for tweets.",
