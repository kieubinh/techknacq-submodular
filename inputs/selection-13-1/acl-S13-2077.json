        "Microblogging is currently a very popular communication tool where millions of users share opinions on different aspects of life.",
        "For this reason it is a valuable source of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis.",
        "Working with such type of texts presents challenges for NLP beyond those typically encountered when dealing with more traditional texts, such as newswire data.",
        "Tweets are short, the language used is very informal, with creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, and #hash-tags.",
        "These characteristics need to be handled with specific approaches.",
        "This paper presents the approach adopted for the SemEval 2013 task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, in particular Task B on Message Polarity Classification in the Constrained setting (i.e., using the provided training data only).",
        "The goal of Task B on Message Polarity Classification is the following: given a message, decide whether it expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages conveying both a positive and a negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen.",
        "Two modalities are possible: (1) Constrained (using the provided training data only; other resources, such as lexica, are allowed; however, it is not allowed to use additional tweets/SMS messages or additional sentences with sentiment annotations); and (2) Unconstrained (using additional data for training, e.g., additional tweets/SMS messages or additional sentences annotated for sentiment).",
        "We participated in the Constrained modality.",
        "We adopted a supervised machine learning (ML) approach based on various contextual and semantic features.",
        "In particular, we exploited resources such as SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), LIWC (Pennebaker and Francis, 2001), and the lexicons described in Mohammad et al. (2009).",
        "Critical features include: whether the message contains intensifiers, adjectives, interjections, presence of positive or negative emoticons, possible message polarity based on SentiWordNet scores (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Gatti and Guerini, 2012), scores based on LIWC categories (Pennebaker and Francis, 2001), negated words, etc."

        "Our supervised ML-based approach relies on Support Vector Machines (SVMs).",
        "The SVM implementation used in the system is LIBSVM (Chang",
        "and Lin, 2001) for training SVM models and testing.",
        "Moreover, in the preprocessing phase we used TweetNLP (Owoputi et al., 2013), a POS tagger explicitly tailored for working on tweets.",
        "We adopted a 2 stage approach: (1) during stage 1, we performed a binary classification of messages according to the classes neutral vs subjective; (2) in stage 2, we performed a binary classification of subjective messages according to the classes positive vs negative.",
        "We performed various experiments on the training and development sets exploring the use of different features (see Section 2.1) to find the best configurations for the official submission."

      "text": [
        "We implement several features divided into three groups: contextual features, semantic features from context and semantic features from external resources.",
        "The complete list is reported in Table 1.",
        "Contextual features are features computed by considering only the tokens in the tweets/SMS and the associated part of speech.",
        "Semantic Features from Context are features based on words polarity.",
        "Emoticons were recognized through a list of emoticons extracted from Wikipedia1 and then manually labeled as positive or negative.",
        "Negated words (feature n. 18) are any token occurring between n't, not, no and a comma, excluding those tagged as function words.",
        "Feature n. 19 captures tokens (or sequences of tokens) labeled with a positive or negative polarity in the resource described in Mohammad et al. (2009).",
        "The intensifiers considered for Feature n. 20 have been identified by implementing a simple algorithm that detects tokens containing anomalously repeated characters (e.g. happyyyyy).",
        "Feature n. 21 was computed by training the system on the training data and predicting labels for the test data, and then using these labels as new features to train the system again.",
        "Semantic Features from external resources include word classes from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a tool that calculates the degree to which people use different categories of words related to psycholinguistic processes (Pennebaker and Francis, 2001).",
        "LIWC in",
        "cludes about 2,200 words and stems grouped into 70 broad categories relevant to psychological processes (e.g., EMOTION, COGNITION).",
        "Sample words are shown in Table 2.",
        "For each non-zero valued LIWC category of a corresponding tweet/SMS, we added a feature for that category and used the category score as the value of that feature.",
        "We call this LWIC string feature.",
        "Alternatively, we also added a separate feature for each non-zero valued LIWC category and set 1 as the value of that feature.",
        "This feature is called LWIC boolean.",
        "We also used words prior polarity - i.e. if a word out of context evokes something positive or negative.",
        "For this, we relied on SentiWordNet, a broad-coverage resource that provides polarities for (almost) every word.",
        "Since words can have multiple senses, we compute the prior polarity of a word starting from the polarity of each sense and returning its polarity strength as an index between 1 and 1.",
        "We tested 14 formulae that combine posterior polarities in different ways to obtain a word prior polarity, as reported in (Gatti and Guerini, 2012).",
        "For the SWNscoresMaximum feature, we select the prior polarity of the word in a tweet/SMS having the maximum absolute score among all words (of that tweet/SMS).",
        "For SWNscoresPolarityCount, we select the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) that is assigned to the majority of the words.",
