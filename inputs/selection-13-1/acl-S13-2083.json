        "Twitter is one of the most popular social network websites and has been growing at a very fast pace.",
        "The number of active users exceeds 500 million and the number of tweets posted by day exceeds 500 million (as of May 2012)5.",
        "Through the twitter applications, users shared opinions about personalities, politicians, products, companies, events, etc.",
        "This has been attracting the attention of different research communities interested in analyzing its content and motivated many natural language tasks, such as sentiment analysis, emotions detection, opinions retrieval, product recommendation or opinion summarization.",
        "One of the most popular sentiment analysis tasks is polarity classification.",
        "This task is a new field that classifies opinion texts as positive, negative or neutral (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Wiegand et al., 2010).",
        "Determining polarity might seem an easy task, as many words have some polarity by themselves.",
        "However, words do not always express the same sentiment, and in most cases the polarity of a word depends on the context in which the word is used.",
        "So, terms that clearly denote negative feelings can be neutral, or even positive, depending on their context.",
        "Hence, sentiment analysis systems should include semantic-level analysis in order to solve word ambiguity and correctly capture the meaning of each word according to its context.",
        "Also, complex linguistic processing is needed to deal with problems such as the effect of negations and informal language.",
        "Moreover, understanding the sentimental meaning of the different textual units is important to accurately determine the overall polarity",
        "of a text.",
        "In this paper, we present a system that has as main objective to analyze the sentiments of tweets and classify these as positive, negative or neutral.",
