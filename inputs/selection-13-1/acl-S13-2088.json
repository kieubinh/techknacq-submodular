        "One of the biggest challenges of working with tweets is their short length.",
        "Additionally, the language used in tweets is very informal, with creative spellings and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, such as, RT for ?re-tweet?",
        "and #hashtags, which are a type of tagging for tweets.",
        "Although several systems tackle the task of analyzing sentiments from tweets, the task of analyzing sentiments at term or phrase-level within a tweet has remained largely unexplored.",
        "This paper describes the details of our expression-level sentiment detection system that participated in the subtask A of SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "The goal is to mark expressions (a term or short phrases) in a tweet with their contextual polarity.",
        "This is challenging given the fact that the entire length of a tweet is restricted to just 140 characters.",
        "We describe the creation of an SVM classifier that is used to classify the contextual polarity of expressions within tweets.",
        "A feature set derived from various linguistic features, parts-of-speech tagging and prior sentiment lexicons was used to train the classifier."

        "However, most of these approaches classify entire tweets by their overall sentiment (positive, negative or neutral).",
        "The task at hand is to classify expressions with their contextual sentiment.",
        "Most of these expressions can be found in sentiment lexicons already annotated with their general polarity, but the focus of this task is to detect the polarity of that expression within the context of the tweet it appears in, and therefore, given the context, the polarity of the expression might differ from that found in any lexicon.",

        "Wilson, Wiebe and Hoffman (Wilson et al., 2005) explored the challenges of contextual polarity of sentiment expressions by first determining whether an expression is neutral or polar and then disambiguating the polarity of the polar expressions.",

        "The evaluation consisted of classifying 4435 expressions in a Twitter data set.",
