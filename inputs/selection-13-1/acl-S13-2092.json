        "In the past few years, the popularity of social media has increased.",

        "People post messages on a variety of topics, for example products, political issues, etc.",
        "Thus a big amount of user generated data is created day-by-day.",
        "The manual processing of this data is impossible, therefore automatic procedures are needed.",
        "In this paper we introduce an approach which is able to assign sentiment labels to Twitter messages.",
        "More precisely, it classifies tweets into positive, negative or neutral polarity classes.",
        "The system participated in the SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, Task?B Message Polarity Classification (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "In our approach we used a unigram based supervised model because it has been shown that it works well on short messages like tweets (Jiang et al., 2011; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011; Liu, 2010).",
        "We reduced the size of the dictionary by normalizing the messages and by stop word filtering.",
        "We also explored novel features which gave us information on the polarity of a tweet, for example we made use of the acronyms in messages.",

        "?",

        "To determine the polarity of a word, we used the SentiWordNet sentiment lexicon (Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "In this lexicon, a positive, negative and an objective real value belong to each word, which describes the polarity of the given word.",
        "We consider a word as positive if the related positive value is greater than 0.3, we consider it as negative if the related negative value is greater than 0.2 and we consider it as objective if the related objective value is greater than 0.8.",
        "The threshold of the objective value is high because most words are objective in this lexicon.",
        "After calculating the polarity of each word we created three new features for each tweet which are the number of positive, negative and objective words, respectively.",
        "We also checked if a negation word precedes a positive or negative word and if so we inverted its polarity.",
        "We also tried to group acronyms by their polarity.",
        "For this purpose we used an acronym lexicon which can be found on the www.internetslang.com website.",
        "For each acronym we used the polarity of each word in the acronym's description and we determined the polarity of the acronym by calculating the rate of positive and negative words in the description.",
        "This way we created two new features which are the number of positive and negative acronyms in a given message.",
        "Our intuition was that people like to use character repetitions in their words for expressing their happiness or sadness.",
        "Besides normalizing these tokens (see Section 2.1), we created a new feature as well, which represents the number of this kind of words in a tweet.",
        "Beyond character repetitions people like to write words or a part of the text in upper case in order to",
        "call the reader's attention.",
