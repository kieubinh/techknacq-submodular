        "Twitter and Twitter messages (tweets) are a modern way to express sentiment and feelings about aspects of the world.",
        "In this scenario, understanding the sentiment contained in a message is of vital importance in order to understand users behavior and for market analysis (Java et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2010).",
        "The research area that deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in texts is called sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "Sentiment analysis is usually associated with a text classification task.",
        "Sentiment classifiers are commonly categorized in two basic approaches: lexicon-based and machine learning (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "A lexicon-based classifier uses a lexicon to provide the polarity, or semantic orientation, of each word or phrase in the text.",
        "A machine learning classifier learns features (usually the vocabulary) from annotated corpus or labeled examples.",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid system for sentiment classification in Twitter messages.",
        "Our system combines three different approaches: rule-based, lexicon-based and machine learning.",
        "The purpose of our system is to better understand the use of a hybrid system in Twitter text and to verify the performance of this approach in an open evaluation contest.",
        "Our system participated in SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "The task objective was to determine the sentiment contained in Twitter messages.",
        "The task included two sub-tasks: a expression-level classification (Task A) and a message-level classification (Task B).",
        "Our system participated in Task B.",
        "In this task, for a given message, our system should classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "Our system was coded using Python and the CLiPS Pattern library (De Smedt and Daelemans, 2012).",
        "This last library provides the part-of-speech tagger and the SVM algorithm used in this work1."

        "It is responsible to determine the polarity if the previous classifiers failed to achieve the confidence level required to classification.",
        "The normalization component is responsible to correct and normalize the text before the classifiers use it.",
        "This architecture improves the classification process because it takes advantage of the multiple approaches.",
        "For example, the rule-based classifier is the most reliable classifier.",
        "It achieves good results when the text is matched by a high-confidence rule.",
        "However, due the freedom of language, rules may not match 100% of the unseen examples, consequently it has a low recall rate.",
        "Lexicon-based classifiers, for example, are very confident in the process to determine if a text is polar or neutral.",
        "Using sentiment lexicons, we can determine that sentences containing sentiment words are polar and sentences that do not contain such words are neutral.",
        "Moreover, the presence of a high number of positive or negative words in the text may be a strong indicative of the polarity.",
        "Finally, machine learning is known to be highly domain adaptive and to be able to find deep correlations (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "This last classifier might provide the final decision when the previous methods failed.",
