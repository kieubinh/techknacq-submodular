        "Our contribution to the SemEval 2013 Task 7 challenge (Dzikovska et al., 2013) presented here is based on our research in the A4 project1 of the SFB 833, which is dedicated to the question how meaning can be computationally compared in realistic situations.",
        "In realistic situations, utterances are not necessarily well-formed or complete, there may be individual differences in situative and world knowledge among the speakers.",
        "This can complicate or even preclude a complete linguistic analysis, leading us to the following research question: Which linguistic representations can be used effectively and robustly for comparing the meaning of sentences and text fragments computationally?",
        "In order to work on effective and robust processing, we base our work on reading comprehension exercises for foreign language learners, of which we are also collecting a large corpus (Ott et al., 2012).",
        "Our first system, CoMiC, is an alignment-based approach which exists in English and German variants (Meurers et al., 2011a; Meurers et al., 2011b).",
        "CoMiC uses various levels of linguistic abstraction from surface tokens to dependency parses.",
        "Further work that we are starting to tackle includes the utilization of Information Structure (Krifka, 2007) in the system.",
        "The second approach emerging from the research project is CoSeC (Hahn and Meurers, 2011; Hahn and Meurers, 2012), a semantics-based system for meaning comparison that was developed for German from the start and was ported to operate on English for this shared task.",
        "As a novel contribution in this paper, we present CoMeT (Comparing Meaning in Tu?bingen), a system that employs a meta-classifier for combining the output of CoMiC and CoSeC and three shallower bag approaches.",
        "In terms of the general context of our work, short answer assessment essentially comes in the two fla-vors of meaning comparison and grading, the first trying to determine whether or not two utterances convey the same meaning, the latter aimed at grading the abilities of students (cf. Ziai et al., 2012).",
        "Short answer assessment is also closely related to the field",
        "of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE, Dagan et al., 2009), which this year is directly reflected by the fact that SemEval 2013 Task 7 is the Joint Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge.",
        "Turning to the organization of this paper, section 2 introduces the three types of subsystems and the meta-classifier.",
        "In section 3, we report on the evaluation results of each subsystem both for our development set as well as for the official test set of the shared task.",

        "and Hatcher, 2005) querying the UkWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) was used, since all major search engines meanwhile have shut down their APIs.",
        "After the annotation of linguistic units has taken place, candidate alignment links are created within UIMA.",
        "In a simple example case, a candidate alignment link is a pair of tokens that is token identical in the student answer and in the reference answer.",
        "The same token in the student answer may also be part of a candidate alignment link that maps to another token in the reference answer that, e.g., has the same lemma, or is a possible synonym, or again is token identical.",
        "Other possible links are based on spelling-corrected tokens, semantic types, or high values of the PMI-IR similarity measure.",

        "Subsequently, a globally optimal alignment of linguistic units in the reference answer and student answer is determined using the Traditional Marriage Algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962).",

        "CoSeC is based on Lexical Resource Semantics (LRS, Richter and Sailer, 2004).",
        "Being an underspecified semantic formalism, LRS avoids the costly computation of all readings and provides access to the building blocks of the semantic representation, while additional constraints provide the information about their composition.",
        "As described in Hahn and Meurers (2011), LRS representations can be derived automatically using a two-step approach based on part-of-speech tags assigned by TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and dependency parses by MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "First, the dependency structure is transformed into a completely lexicalized syntax-semantics interface representation, which abstracts away from some form variation at the surface.",
        "These representations are then mapped to LRS representations.",
        "The approach is robust in that it always results in an LRS structure, even for ill-formed sentences.",
        "CoSeC then aligns the LRS representations of the reference answer and the student answer to each other and also to the representation of the question.",
        "The alignment approach takes into account local criteria, namely the semantic similarity of pairs of elements that are linked by the alignment, as well as global criteria measuring the extent to which the alignment",
        "preserves structure at the levels of variables and the subterm structure of the semantic formulas.",
        "Local similarity of semantic expressions is estimated using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PMI-IR (Turney, 2001) on the UkWaC (Baroni et al., 2009) as used in CoMiC, the Minimum Edit Distance (Levenshtein, 1966), and special parameters for comparing functional elements such as quantifiers and grammatical function labels.",
        "Based on the alignments, the system marks elements which are not linked to elements in the question or which are linked to the semantic contribution of an alternative in an alternative question as ?focused?.",
        "This is intended as a first approximation of the concept of focus in the sense of Information Structure (von Heusinger, 1999; Kruijff-Korbayova?",
        "and Steedman, 2003; Krifka, 2007), an active field of research in linguistics addressing the question how the information in sentences is packaged and integrated into discourse.",
        "Focus elements are expected to be particularly relevant for determining the correctness of an answer (Meurers et al., 2011b).",
        "Overall meaning comparison is then done based on a set of numerical scores computed from the alignments and their quality.",
        "For each of these scores, a threshold is empirically determined, over which the student answer is considered to be correct.",

        "Functional elements, i.e., quantifiers, predicates representing grammatical function labels, or the lambda operator, are weighted differently from other elements.",

        "Unlike the machine learning step in CoMiC, it does not generalize to 3-way or 5-way classification.",
        "The alignment algorithm uses several numerical parameters, such as weights for the different components measuring semantic similarities, weights for the different overall local and global criteria, and the weight of the weighted-target focus score.",
        "These parameters are optimized using Powells algorithm combined with grid-based line optimization (Press et al., 2002).",
        "To avoid overfitting, the parameters and the threshold are determined on disjoint partitions of the training set.",
        "In terms of linguistic abstractions, meaning assessment in CoSeC is based entirely on underspecified semantic representations.",

        "The question ID corresponding to the answer is added to each bag as a pseudo-word, allowing the machine learner to adjust to question-specific properties.",

        "On the one hand, this method ignores the presence of reference answers (although they could be added to the training set as additional correct answers), on the other hand it makes use of information not taken into account by alignment-based systems such as CoMiC or CoSeC.",
        "Concerning pre-processing, the linguistic analyses such as tokenization and lemmatization are identical to those of CoMiC, since the bag generator technically is just another output module of the UIMA-based pipeline used there.",

        "The bags are fed into a support vector-based machine learner.",

        "This is most likely due to the fact that it discriminates answers containing punctuation (not a letter of the alphabet) from those which do not.",

        "We presented our approach to Task 7 of SemEval 2013, consisting of a combination of surface-oriented bag models and the increasingly abstract alignment-based systems CoMiC and CoSeC.",
        "Predictions of all systems were combined using a meta classifier in order to produce the final result for CoMeT.",
        "The results presented show that our approach performs competitively, especially in the unseen answers test scenarios, where we obtained the best result of all participants in the 3-way task with the Beetle corpus (73.1% accuracy).",
        "As expected, the unseen topics scenario proved to be more challenging, with results at 67.6% accuracy in the 2-way task for CoMeT.",
        "Surprisingly, CoMeT performed consistently worse in the unseen questions scenarios, which we attribute to rather low CoSeC results there and to the way the meta classifier is trained, which currently does not take into account the test scenario it is trained for and instead uses the module and question IDs as fea",
        "tures, which turned out not to be an effective domain adaptation approach.",
        "In our future research, work on CoMiC will concentrate on integrating two aspects of the context: First, we are planning to develop an automatic approach to focus identification in order to pinpoint the essential parts of the student answers.",
        "Second, for data sets where a reading text is available, we will try to automatically determine the location of the relevant source information given the question, which can then be used as alternative or additional reference material for answer evaluation.",
        "The CoMiC system currently also relies on the Traditional Marriage Algorithm to select the optimal global alignment between student answer and reference answer.",
        "We plan to replace this algorithm by a machine learning component that can handle this selection in a data-driven way.",
        "For CoSeC, we plan to develop an extension that allows for n-to-m mappings, hence improving the alignment performance for multi-word units such as, e.g., phrasal verb constructions.",
        "The bag approaches could be augmented by exploring additional levels of abstractions, e.g., semantic equivalence classes constructed via WordNet lookup.",
        "In sum, while we will also plan to explore optimizations to the training setup of the meta-classifier (e.g., domain adaptation along the lines of Daumé III, 2007), the main focus of our further research lies in improving the individual sub-systems, which then again are expected to push the overall performance of the CoMeT meta-classifier system."
