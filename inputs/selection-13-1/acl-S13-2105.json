        "A drug-drug interaction (DDI) can be described as interplay between drugs taken during joint administration.",
        "DDIs usually lead to an increase or decrease in drug effects when compared to isolated treatment.",
        "For instance, sildenafil (Viagra) in combination with nitrates can cause a potentially live-threatening decrease in blood pressure (Cheitlin et al., 1999).",
        "It is therefore crucial to consider potential DDI effects when co-administering drugs to patients.",
        "As the level of medication generally is raising all over the world, the potential risk of unwanted side effects, such as DDIs, is constantly increasing (Haider et al., 2007).",
        "Only a fraction of knowledge about DDIs is contained in specialized databases such as DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011).",
        "These structured knowledge bases are often the primary resource of information for researchers.",
        "However, the majority of new DDI findings are still initially reported in scientific publications, which results in the situation that structured knowledge bases lag behind recently published research results.",
        "Thus, there is an urgent need for researchers and database curators to cope with the fast growth of biomedical literature (Hunter and Cohen, 2006).",
        "The SemEval 2013 ?",
        "Task 9.2 (Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from BioMedical Texts) is a competitive evaluation of methods for extracting mentions of drug-drug interactions from texts (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013).",
        "For training, the organizers provide a corpus annotated with drug-names and interactions between them.",
        "This corpus is composed of 572 articles collected from DrugBank and 142 PubMed abstracts.",
        "Interactions are binary (always between two drugs) and undirected, as target and agent roles are not annotated.",
        "Furthermore, the two interacting drugs are always mentioned within the same sentence.",
        "In contrast to the previous DDI-challenge 2011 (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011), four different DDI-subtypes (advise, effect, mechanism, and int) have been introduced.",

        "This framework has been successfully applied to other domains, such as the I2B2 relation extraction challenge (Solt et al., 2010), the previous DDI extraction challenge (Thomas et al., 2011), and to the extraction of neuroanatomical connectivity statements (French et al., 2012).",
        "Drug entities are blinded by replacing the entity name with a generic string to ensure the generality of the approach.",
        "Without entity blinding drug names are incorporated as features, which clearly affects generalization capabilities of a classifier on unseen entity mentions (Pyysalo et al., 2008).",
        "We decided to use the following methods provided by the framework: All-paths graph",
        "(APG) (Airola et al., 2008), shallow linguistic (SL) (Giuliano et al., 2006), subtree (ST) (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002), subset tree (SST) (Collins and Duffy, 2001), and spectrum tree (SpT) (Kuboyama et al., 2007) method.",

        "Regarding TEES, we have used the edge extraction functionality for performing relationship extraction.",
        "TEES considers features related to the tokens (e.g., part-of-speech tags), dependency chains, dependency path N-grams, entities (e.g., entity types) and external resources, such as hypernyms in WordNet.",
        "Moara is a case-based reasoning system for the extraction of relationships and events.",
        "During training, interaction pairs are converted into cases and saved into a HyperSQL database which are retrieved through case similarity during the classification.",
        "Cases are composed by the following features: the type of the entities (e.g.",
        "Brand and Group), the part-of-speech tag of the tokens between the two drugs (inclusive), the tags of the shortest dependency path between the two drugs, and the lemma of the nonentity tokens of the shortest dependency path using BioLemmatizer (Liu et al., 2012).",
        "We also consider the PHARE ontology (Coulet et al., 2011) in the lemma feature: When a lemma matches any of the synonyms contained in this ontology, the category of the respective term is considered instead.",
        "Case similarity is calculated by exact feature matching, except for the part-of-speech tags whose comparison is based on global alignment using insertion, deletion, and substitution costs as proposed by Spa-sic et al. (2005).",
        "SLW is inspired by SL (Giuliano et al., 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) and uses the Breeze2 library.",
        "We generate n-grams over sequences of arbitrary features (e.g. POS-tags, morphological and syntactical features) to describe the global context of an entity pair.",

        "In addition, we take the name of the classes of a pair's two entities as feature to capture that entities of some class (e.g.",
