        "Selecting a set of nonterminals for the synchronous CFGs underlying the hierarchical phrase-based models is usually done on the basis of a monolingual resource (like a syntactic parser).",
        "However, a standard bilingual resource like word alignments is itself rich with reordering patterns that, if clustered somehow, might provide labels of different (possibly complementary) nature to monolingual labels.",
        "In this paper we explore a first version of this idea based on a hierarchical decomposition of word alignments into recursive tree representations.",
        "We identify five clusters of alignment patterns in which the children of a node in a decomposition tree are found and employ these five as nonterminal labels for the Hiero productions.",

        "The Hiero model (Chiang, 2007; Chiang, 2005) formulates phrase-based translation in terms of a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) limited to the inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) family.",
        "While the original Hiero approach works with a single nonterminal label (X) (besides the start nonterminal S ), more recent work is dedicated to devising methods for extracting more elaborate labels for the phrase-pairs and their abstractions into SCFG productions, e.g., (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Li et al., 2012; Almaghout et al., 2011).",
        "All labeling approaches exploit monolingual parsers of some kind, e.g., syntactic, semantic or sense-oriented.",
        "The rationale behind monolingual labeling is often to make the probability distributions over alternative synchronous derivations of the Hiero model more sensitive to linguistically justified monolingual phrase context.",
        "For example, syntactic target-language labels in many approaches are aimed at improved target language modeling (fluency, cf. Hassan et al. (2007); Zollmann and Venugopal (2006)), whereas source-language labels provide suitable context for reordering (see Mylon-akis and Sima?an (2011)).",
        "It is usually believed that the monolingual labels tend to stand for clusters of phrase pairs that are expected to be inter-substitutable, either syntactically or semantically (see Marton et al. (2012) for an illuminating discussion).",
        "While we believe that monolingual labeling strategies are sound, in this paper we explore the complementary idea that the nonterminal labels could also signify bilingual properties of the phrase pair, particularly its characteristic word alignment patterns.",
        "Intuitively, an SCFG with nonterminal labels standing for alignment patterns should put more preference on synchronous derivations that mimic the word alignment patterns found in the training corpus, and thus, possibly allow for better reordering.",
        "It is important to stress the fact that these word alignment patterns are complementary to the monolingual linguistic patterns and it is conceivable that the two can be combined effectively, but this remains beyond the scope of this article.",
        "The question addressed in this paper is how to select word alignment patterns and cluster them into bilingual nonterminal labels?",
        "In this paper we explore a first instantiation of this idea starting out from the following simplifying assumptions:",
        "?",
        "The labels come from the word alignments only, ?",
        "The labels are coarse-grained, predefined clusters and not optimized for performance, ?",
        "The labels extend the binary set of ITG operators (monotone and inverted) into five such labels in order to cover non-binarizable alignment patterns.",
        "Our labels are based on our own tree decompositions of word alignments (Sima?an and Maillette de Buy Wenniger, 2011), akin to Normalized Decomposition Trees (NDTs) (Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "In this first attempt we explore a set of five nonterminal labels that characterize alignment patterns found directly under nodes in the NDT projected for every word alignment in the parallel corpus during training.",
        "There is a range of work that exploits the monotone and inverted orientations of binary ITG within hierarchical phrase-based models, either as feature functions of lexicalized Hiero productions (Chiang, 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), or as labels on non-lexicalized ITG productions, e.g., (Mylon-akis and Sima?an, 2011).",
        "As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt at exploring a larger set of such word alignment derived labels in hierarchical SMT.",
        "Therefore, we expect that there are many variants that could improve substantially on our strong set of assumptions."

        "SCFGs are defined over a finite set of nonterminals (start included), a finite set of terminals and a finite set of synchronous productions.",
        "A synchronous production in an SCFG consists of two context-free productions (source and target) containing the same number of nonterminals on the right-hand side, with a bijective (1-to-1 and onto) function between the source and target nonterminals.",
        "Like the standard Hiero model (Chiang, 2007), we constrain our work to SCFGs which involve at most two nonterminals in every lexicalized production.",
        "Given an SCFG G, a source sentence s is translated into a target sentence t by synchronous derivations d, each is a finite sequence of well-formed substitutions of synchronous productions from G, see (Chiang, 2006).",
        "Standardly, for complexity reasons, most models used make the assumption that the probability P(t |s) can be optimized through as single best derivation as follows: arg max",
        "This approximation can be notoriously problematic for labelled Hiero models because the labels tend to lead to many more derivations than in the original model, thereby aggravating the effects of this assumption.",
        "This problem is relevant for our work and approaches to deal with it are Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Tromble et al., 2008), Variational Decoding (Li et al., 2009) and soft labeling (Venugopal et al., 2009; Marton et al., 2012; Chiang, 2010).",

        "The Hiero baseline with Viterbi scores 28.57 BLEU while Hiero-AL scores 28.36 BLEU under the same conditions.",
        "It is puzzling that Hiero Viterbi (for 1000k) performs better than the same system with MBR decoding systems.",
        "But after submission we were told by Moses support that neither normal MBR nor Lattice MBR are operational in Moses Chart.",
        "This means that in fact the effect of MBR on our labels remains still undecided, and more work is still needed in this direction.",
        "The small decrease in performance for the",
        "labelled system relative to Hiero (in Viterbi) is possibly the result of the labelled system being more brittle and harder to tune than the Hiero system.",
        "This hypothesis needs further exploration.",
        "While a whole set of experimental questions remains open, we think that based on this preliminary but nevertheless considerable set of experiments, it seems that our labels do not always improve performance compared with the Hiero baseline.",
        "It is possible that these labels, under a more advanced implementation via soft constraints (as opposed to hard labeling), could provide the empirical evidence to our theoretical choices.",
        "A further concern regarding the labels is that our current choice (5 labels) is heuristic and not optimized for the training data.",
        "It remains to be seen in the future if proper learning of these labels as latent variables optimized for the training data or the use of soft constraints can shed more light on the use of alignment labels in hierarchical SMT."
