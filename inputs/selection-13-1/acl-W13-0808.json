        "The most prominent paradigms in statistical machine translation are phrase-based translation models (Koehn et al., 2003) and tree-based approaches using some form of a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) (Chiang, 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Hoang and Koehn, 2010), in particular inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997).",
        "The rules of the translation models are usually learned from word aligned parallel corpora.",
        "Synchronous grammars also induce alignments between words in the bitext when simultaneously recognizing words via the application of a synchronous rule (Wu, 1997).",
        "Due to their central role, it is important that a synchronous grammar formalism is powerful enough to generate all alignment configurations that occur in hand-aligned parallel corpora",
        "2009); (iii) bonbon alignment (Simard et al., 2005) that are taken to be a gold standard of translational equivalence (Wellington et al., 2006).",
        "The empirical adequacy of phrase-based and SCFG-based translation models has been put into question (Wellington et al., 2006; S?gaard and Kuhn, 2009; S?gaard and Wu, 2009; S?gaard, 2010) because they are unable to induce certain alignment configurations.",
        "In the alignments in Figure 1, the translation units a, b, c, and d cannot be independently generated by a binary SCFG.",
        "Due to a reordering component, phrase-based systems can handle (i), but neither (ii) nor (iii).",
        "Those phenomena however occur relatively frequently in hand-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "Wellington et al. (2006) found that complex structures such as inside-out alignments occur in 5% of English-Chinese sentence pairs and in the study of S?gaard and Kuhn (2009) between 1.6% (for Danish-English data) and 12.1% (for Danish-Spanish data) of all translation units are discontinuous, i.e. not derivable by ITGs in normal form.",
        "As Wellington et al. (2006) already noted for inside-out alignments, discontinuous constituents are required for binary synchronous derivations of the alignment configurations under consideration.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 2: the yields of A 2",
        "terminals are generated synchronously.",
        "Note that many other derivations that induce the same alignment structures are possible, but all of them involve at least one discontinuous constituent.",
        "and A 3 in (i) are discontinuous on the target side, in (iii) the yield of A 1 is discontinuous on the source side and the yield of A 2 is discontinuous on the target side.",
        "We therefore propose to augment tree-based approaches such that they can account for discontinuous constituents in the source and/or target derivation.",
        "This implies going beyond the power of context-free grammars.",
        "In the monolingual parsing community, linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) have been established as an appropriate formalism for the mod-eling of discontinuous structure (Maier and Lichte, 2011; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).",
        "LCFRS is an extension of CFG, in which non-terminals can span k ?",
        "1 continuous blocks of a string.",
        "k is termed the fanout of the non-terminal.",
        "If k = 1 for all non-terminals, the grammar is a CFG.",
        "Recent work shows that probabilistic data-driven parsing with LCFRS is indeed feasible and gives acceptable results (Maier, 2010; Evang and Kallmeyer, 2011; van Cranenburgh, 2012; Maier et al., 2012; Kallmeyer and Maier, 2013).",
        "It seems timely to transfer these findings to statistical machine translation.",
        "In this work, we introduce the notion of synchronous LCFRS for translation and show how the alignments in Figure 1 are induced.",
        "Since the parsing complexity of LCFRS, and thus of synchronous LCFRS as well, depends directly on k, the number of blocks that a non-terminal in the grammar may span, an investigation concerning the empirically required k is carried out on manually aligned data.",
        "For this purpose, we present a parallel parser for an all-accepting synchronous LCFRS that is used to validate hierarchical alignments for a given k. This extends the work of Wellington et al. (2006) and S?gaard (2010) from a methodological point of view, as will be explained in Section 5.",
        "In particular, we will revise the results that S?gaard (2010) presented concerning the coverage of ITG.",

        "Given the parsing complexity that comes with allowing discontinuities, this is a promising finding since it has already been shown for monolingual parsing that restricting the fanout to 2 drastically reduces parsing times (Maier et al., 2012).",
        "In the future, we might also investigate whether refraining from ill-nested structures (Maier and Lichte, 2011) is a reasonable option for tree-based machine translation in order to reduce complexity (Go?mez-Rodr?",
        "?guez et al., 2010).",

        "In practice, only source side parsing is performed for translation and various pruning methods are applied to reduce the search space (e.g. in Chiang (2005), Yamada and Knight (2002) and many others).",
        "It should also be mentioned that it is not clear yet how alignment reachability scores relate to machine translation quality and evaluation.",
        "We can nevertheless infer from the presented results that what is considered as translationally equivalent by the annotators of the data sets and their guidelines is beyond the search space of SCFG.",
        "A supplementary study could furthermore investigate translation unit error rates (S?gaard and Kuhn, 2009) for the data sets, under the assumption of a hierarchical SLCFRS alignment with a specific fan-out."
