        "At the same time, the different systems achieve similar success rates on each even though they show low agreement among themselves.",
        "This is taken to be evidence that there are several subtypes of metaphor-in-language and that the ideal metaphor identification system will first define these subtypes and then model the linguistic properties which can distinguish these subtypes from one another and from non-metaphors."

        "The VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (Steen, et al., 2010) consists of approximately 200,000 words taken from the British National Corpus's Baby Corpus and divided into four genres: academic, news, fiction, and conversation.",
        "It was manually annotated for metaphoric uses of words by five analysts using a version of the MIP method (Pragglejaz Group, 2007).",
        "For the purposes of this study, the corpus was divided into sentences, under the assumption that each sentence represents an utterance.",
        "There are 16,202 sentences in the corpus.",
        "Sentences which contain at least one metaphoric use of a word are la-beled as metaphoric sentences.",
        "This is done because a metaphorically used word is not metaphoric except in relation to its linguistic context; thus, a larger linguistic unit like the sentence is necessary for revealing metaphorically used words.",
        "The VU Amsterdam Corpus is annotated with several subclasses of metaphor-in-language.",
        "The subclasses included in this evaluation are MRW-Met (a metaphoric use of a metaphor related word);",
        "MRW-Lit (a literal use of a metaphor related word); PP (a possible personification resulting in a metaphor related word); Double (a metaphor related word which is involved in a double metaphor; for example, personification and a conceptual metaphor); WIDLII (possible metaphor related words which were considered ambiguous between metaphoric and non-metaphoric use).",
        "Table 1 shows a breakdown of the number of sentences in each of these subclasses in the corpus as a whole and as represented by each of the metaphor identification systems.",
        "Because each system uses different linguistic properties to identify metaphor-in-language and uses different methods to represent those properties, the systems differ in how many of the sentences are sufficiently represented.",
        "For example, the semantic similarity measurement system looks at pairwise similarity values while the abstractness measurement system looks at values for individual words.",
        "Thus, the abstractness system could potentially have twice as many data points as the similarity system.",
        "The numbers in Table 1 include only the sentences with a minimum number of data points.",
        "The evaluation results below do not take into account sentences for which a system has insufficient representation.",
        "However, it is important to note that the systems differ in how many sentences they adequately represent, which means that some (for example, the similarity system) are less able to identify metaphor-in-language because they have a less robust representation of the linguistic utterance.",
        "For the purposes of this study, metaphor identification was conceptualized as a sentence-level task.",
        "For example, the systems evaluated here could be used within a larger computational semantic system to separate metaphoric and non-metaphoric sentences for purposes of reasoning.",
        "One result of this choice is that some of the original systems need to be slightly reconceptualized; thus, it is better to say that these systems are inspired by the cited systems, rather than strict reimplementations of those systems.",
        "The similarity and abstractness systems originally were meant to decide which uses of a given verb are metaphoric and which are not metaphoric.",
        "In the present study, however, metaphor is not limited to verbs and the systems do not know which words in the sentence may be metaphoric (e.g., it could be any noun or any verb, etc.).",
        "Thus, these systems have been altered to determine whether there are any metaphorically used words anywhere in the sentence.",

        "While the original system used Normalized Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007) to measure semantic similarity, the evaluation in this study used Iosif's SemSim system (Iosif and Potamianos, 2012).",
        "There were two main reasons for not using the NGD measure: (1) SemSim offers more control because the corpus used to determine pairwise similarity is known and can be made similar to the test corpus; (2) SemSim is more transparent in terms of its methodology and its results are more stable over time.",
        "For this evaluation we used the Open American National Corpus (henceforth,",

        "As with all systems discussed below, Morpha (Guido, Carroll, and Pearce, 2001) was used for lemmatization and OpenNLP (Apache, 2011) was used for named entity recognition.",
        "The variables used in the original system had to be changed slightly because no particular word in the sentence is given a special focus.",
        "The following variables were used: (1) the number of similarity measurements for a given sentence; (2) the average similarity; (3) the standard deviation of similarity, in order to see how much divergence there was from the average; (4) the highest pairwise similarity; (5) the lowest pairwise similarity; (6) the difference between the highest and lowest pairwise similarity.",
        "One of the weaknesses of this particular implementation of the system is that it only considers words that are adjacent to one another (with function words removed).",

        "The method for clustering verbs is described in (Sun and Korhonen, 2009); (Sun, Korhonen, and Krymolowski, 2008) provide a resource of the most frequent 1,510 English verbs in the Gigaword corpus divided into 170 clusters.",

        "There are two versions of this last meta-system: the inclusive version identifies disputed sentences as metaphoric if either the similarity or abstractness system does, and the exclusive version only if the two agree.",
        "Table 11 shows the results of the evaluations of these meta-systems.",
        "The system with the fewest false positives is the one which requires four-way agreement before an utterance is identified as metaphor; however, this also has the fewest true positives.",
        "The performance of the exclusive meta-system for the top two systems has a better proportion of true to false positives, but also has an unfortunately high number of false negatives.",
        "The majority vote meta-system has more false than true positives and, thus, is not successful.",
        "The last three meta-systems differ in how they resolve disagreements between the top two systems; there is a consistent trade-off between more true positives and fewer false positives and all three have comparable F-measures.",

        "First, there is a significant difference between genres.",
        "The linguistic properties which can distinguish metaphors in one genre may not apply to other genres.",
        "Or, looked at another way, different genres are more likely to contain different types of metaphors (the types of metaphor referred to here involve different sources of metaphoric meaning and are not comparable to the corpus's sub-classes).",
        "Second, the predictions of the four systems, regardless of their accuracy, have a relatively low level of agreement.",
        "This low level of agreement is consistent across genres and sub-classes.",
        "This means that the systems are succeeding and failing on different metaphors.",
        "Each of the systems is based on a different theory of metaphor-in-language.",
        "The combination of these two facts suggests that different types of metaphor have different linguistic properties.",
        "Most theories of metaphor conceive of it as a single and coherent phenomenon, so that the predictions of competing theories are mutually exclusive.",
        "The lack of agreement coupled with similar success rates, however, suggests that these theories of metaphor-in-language are not mutually exclusive but rather apply to different types of metaphor-in-language.",
        "If this is the case, then a more accurate model of metaphor-in-language will start by positing a number of different types of metaphor-in-language, which differ in the source of their metaphoric meaning, and then predicting what linguistic properties can be used to distinguish among these types and between them and non-metaphors.",
        "Metaphor identification systems can be improved by focusing on two important properties of metaphor-in-language: First, metaphors are gradient, with some being much more metaphoric than others (Dunn, 2011).",
        "One problem with the systems described in this paper is that they are forced to draw an arbitrary line between two classes to represent a gradient phenomenon.",
        "Second, metaphoric expressions receive their metaphoric meaning from different sources (Dunn, 2013a).",
        "These different types of metaphor-in-language have different properties and should be modeled individually."
