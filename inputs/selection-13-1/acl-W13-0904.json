        "For example, the conceptual metaphor ?Life is a Journey?",
        "indicates a medium within which the target concept ?life?",
        "may be more easily discussed and understood.",

        "By allowing us to discuss an abstract target concept using the vocabulary and world knowledge associated with a more familiar source concept, metaphor serves as a vehicle for human communication and understanding, and as such, has been found to be extremely prevalent in natural language, occurring as often as every third sentence (Shutova et al., 2010).",
        "As a consequence of this ubiquity, it is crucial that any system tasked with the understanding of natural language be capable of detecting the presence of metaphor in text and of modeling the intended semantic content of the metaphoric expression.",

        "The phenomenon of metaphor has been studied by researchers across multiple disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, and computational linguistics.",
        "A number of theories of metaphor have been proposed, including the Contemporary Theory of Metaphor (Lakoff, 1993), the Conceptual Mapping Model (Ahrens et al., 2003), the Structure Mapping Model (Wolff and Gentner, 2000), and the Attribute Categorization Hypothesis (McGlone, 1996).",
        "Based on these theories, large collections of metaphors have been assembled and published for use by researchers.",
        "The Master Metaphor List (MML) (Lakoff, 1994) groups linguistic metaphors together according to their conceptual mapping, and the Hamburg Metaphor Database (HMD) (Eilts and Lo?nneker, 2002) for French and German fuses EuroWordNet synsets with the MML source and target domains for a robust source of metaphoric semantics in those languages.",
        "In recent years, the computational linguistics community has seen substantial activity in the detection of figurative language (Bogdanova, 2010; Li and Sporleder, 2010; Peters and Wilks, 2003; Shutova, 2011) one aspect of which is the identification of metaphoric expressions in text (Fass, 1991; Shutova et al., 2010; Mason, 2004).",
        "Much of the early work on the identification of metaphor relied upon hand-crafted world knowledge.",
        "The met* (Fass, 1991) system sought to determine whether an expression was literal or figurative by detecting the violation of selectional preferences.",
        "Figurative expressions were then classified as either metonymic, using hand-crafted patterns, or metaphoric, using a manually constructed database of analogies.",
        "The CorMet (Mason, 2004) system determined the",
        "source and target concepts of a metaphoric expression using domain-specific selectional preferences mined from Internet resources.",
        "More recent work has examined noun-verb clustering (Shutova et al., 2010) which starts from a small seed set of one-word metaphors and results in clusters that represent source and target concepts connected via a metaphoric relation.",
        "These clusters are then used to annotate the metaphoricity of text.",
        "Similar to our work, the Metaphor Interpretation, Denotation, and Acquisition System (MIDAS) (Martin, 1990) employed a database of conventional metaphors that could be searched to find a match for a metaphor discovered in text.",
        "If no match was found, the metaphoric text was replaced with a more abstract equivalent (e.g. a hypernym) and the database was searched again.",
        "If a match was found, an interpretation mapping was activated, and the novel metaphor would be added to the database for use in future encounters.",
        "Unfortunately, this technique was limited to interpreting known metaphors (and descendants of known metaphors) and was unable to detect truly novel usages.",
        "By expanding the metaphors using a more robust semantic signature, we attempt to transcend this limitation thereby producing a more durable system for metaphoric example linking.",
        "An additional vein of metaphor research has sought to model the human processing of metaphor as a semantic space within which source and target concepts can be placed such that the similarity between their representations within this space (i.e. semantic vectors) can be sensibly quantified (Katz, 1992; Utsumi, 2011).",
        "One computational example of this approach (Kintsch, 2000) has employed latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) to represent the semantic space of the metaphors in a reduced dimensionality (i.e. using singular value decomposition).",
        "In their approach, metaphors were represented as a set of terms found using a spreading activation algorithm informed by the terms?",
        "independent vector relatedness to the source and target concepts within some LSA space.",
        "By contrast, we have chosen to represent the metaphoric space using WordNet senses which have been shown in previous work(Lo?nneker, 2003) to represent a viable representation language for metaphor.",
        "We believe that the ontological knowledge encoded in the semantic relationships of WordNet represents an improvement over the distributional relatedness encoded within an LSA vector.",
        "Also of relevance to the construction and use of semantic signatures is current research on the induction of topic signatures.",
        "A topic signature is a set of related words with associated weights which define and indicate the distinct topics within a text.",
        "In their work on automated summarization, Lin and Hovy (2000) developed a method for the construction of topic signatures which were mined from a large corpus.",
        "Similarly, Harabagiu and Lacatusu (2005) explored the use of topic signatures and enhanced topic signatures for their work on multi-document summarization.",
