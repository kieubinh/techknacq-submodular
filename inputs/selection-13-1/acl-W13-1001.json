        "Bol-drini et al. (2009) carried out a preliminary study in which they used machine learning techniques to mine opinions in blogs.",
        "They created a corpus for Spanish using their Emotiblog system, and discussed the difficulties they encountered while annotating it.",
        "Balahur et al. (2009) also presented a method of emotion classification for Spanish, this time using a database of culturally dependent emotion triggers.",
        "Finally, Brooke et al. (2009) adapted a lexicon-based sentiment analysis system for English (Taboada et al., 2011) to Spanish by automatically translating the core lexicons and adapting other resources in various ways.",
        "They also provide an interesting evaluation that compares the performance of both the original (English) and translated (Spanish) systems using both machine learning methods (specifically, SVM) and their own lexi-con-based semantic orientation calculation algo-rithm, SO-CAL, mentioned above.",
        "They found that their own weighting algorithm, which is based on the same premises as our system, achieved better accuracy for both languages, but the accuracy for Spanish was well below that for English.",
        "Our system, Sentitext (Moreno-Ortiz et al., 2010; 2011), is very similar to Brooke et al's (2009) in design: it is also lexicon-based and it makes use of a similar calculation method for semantic orientation.",
        "It differs in that the lexical knowledge has been acquired semi-automatically and then manually revised from the ground up over a long period of time, with a strong commitment to both coverage and quality.",
        "It makes no use of user-provided, explicit ratings that supervised systems typically rely on for the training process, and it produces an index of semantic orientation based on weighing positive against negative text segments, which is then transformed into a ten-point scale and a five-star rating system.",
        "Yet another way in which our system differs from most other systems, including Taboada et al's (2011), is in the relevance given to multiword expressions vis-?-vis individual words.",
        "3 Sentitext: a SA system for Spanish Sentitext is a web-based, client-server application written in C++ (main code) and Python (server).",
        "The only third-party component in the system is Freeling (Atserias et al., 2006; Padr?, 2011), a powerful, multi-language NLP suite of tools, which we use for basic morphosyntactic analysis.",
        "Currently, only one client application is available, developed in Adobe Flex,2 which takes an input text and returns the results of the analysis in several numerical and graphical ways, including visual representations of the text segments that were identified as sentiment-laden.",
        "For storage, we rely on a relational database (MySQL), where lexical information is stored.",
        "Given that it is a linguistically-motivated sentiment analysis system, special attention is paid to the representation and management of the lexical resources that Sentitext uses for its analysis.",
        "The underlying design principle is to isolate lexical knowledge from processing as much as possible, so that the processors can use the data directly from the database.",
        "The idea behind this design is that all lexical sources can be edited at any time by any member of the team, which is facilitated by a PHP interface specifically developed to this end.",
        "We believe this approach is optimal for lexicon-based systems, since it allows improvements to be easily incorporated simply by updating the database by means of a user-friendly interface.",
        "3.1 Data sources Sentitext relies on three major sources: the individual word dictionary (words), the multiword expressions dictionary (mwords), and the context rules set (crules), which is our implementation of Contextual Valence Shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "The individual word dictionary currently contains over 9,400 items, all of which are labeled for valence.",
        "The acquisition process for this dictionary was inspired by the bootstrapping method recurrently found in the literature (e.g., Riloff and Wiebe, 2003, Aue and Gamon, 2005).",
        "We adapted this methodology in the following way: first, we established a set of 22 antonymic pairs of words to be used as seed words, which we fed to the Spanish version of the OpenOffice thesaurus in order to track its contents for sentiment-carrying words.",
        "However, rather than doing this automatically, we built an interactive tool that presented a user with consecutive rounds of candidate words to be added to the dictionary, thus providing the means to 2 This application can be accessed and tested online at http://tecnolengua.uma.es/sentitext",
        "block wrong polarity assignments, caused mainly by polysemy, that would propagate to subsequent sets of synonymous words.",
        "The resulting dictionary was thoroughly revised manually and actual valences were added by lexicographers using the GDB tool.",
        "In Section 4, we elaborate on this process of manual valence assignment in relation to the MWEs dictionary, which does not differ from the one used in the word dictionary.",
        "Lexical items in both dictionaries in our database were assigned one of the following valences: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.",
        "How-ever, since the word dictionary contains only sen-timent-carrying items, no 0-valence word is present.",
        "The SA system most similar to ours (Taboada et al., 2011) uses a scale from 5 to +5, which makes sense for a number of graded sets of near synonyms such as those given as examples by the authors (p. 273).",
        "In our opinion, however, as more values are allowed, it becomes increasingly difficult to decide on a specific one while maintaining a reasonable degree of objectivity and agreement among different (human) acquirers, especially when there is no obvious graded set of related words, which is very often the case.",
        "In fact, our initial intention was to use a 5 to 5 scale, but this idea was abandoned, as the difficulty for assigning such fine-grained valences became apparent in actual practice on a large scale dictionary.",
        "This does not imply that valence values for actual words and MWEs in context are limited to these.",
        "In a lexicon-based SA system that computes a sentiment rating based on weighing positive against negative text segments there should be a way to distinguish not only between, for example, the adjectives ?good?",
        "and ?bad?, but also deal with the semantics of qualifiers, as in ?very good?, and ?extremely good?.",
        "This is where context rules come into play.",
        "3.2 Context rules It is important to understand the way our context rules work in order to appreciate how closely they interact with the other lexical data sources, especially the multiword dictionary.",
        "Simply accounting for negative and positive words and phrases found in a text would not be enough.",
        "There are two ways in which their valence can be modified by the immediately surrounding context: the valence can change in degree (intensification or downtoning), or it may be inverted altogether.",
        "Negation is the simplest case of valence inversion.",
        "The idea of Contextual Valence Shifters (CVS) was first introduced by Polanyi and Zaenen (2006), and implemented for English by Andreevskaia and Bergler (2007) in their CLaC System, and by Taboada et al. (2011) in their Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL).",
        "To our knowledge, apart from Brooke et al's (2009) adaptation of the SO-CAL system, Sentitext is the only sentiment analysis system to implement CVS for Spanish natively.",
        "Our CVS system is implemented in what we call Context Rules, which are expressed as the following data structure: 1.",
        "Unit Form: Freeling-compliant morpho-syntactic definition of the item being modified (e.g.: \"AQ\" for qualifying adjectives).",
        "2.",
        "Unit Sign: polarity of the item being modified (e.g. \"+\").",
        "3.",
        "CVS Definition: modifier definition (e.g.: very,?very?).",
        "4.",
        "CVS Position: position of the modifier (e.g. \"L\" for left).",
        "5.",
        "CVS Span: maximum number of words where the modifier can be found in the modified item.",
        "6.",
        "Result: valence result of the modification.",
        "This result can be expressed as either an operator or a set valence.",
        "An operators is one of the following ?",
        "INV (valence/polarity INVersion) ?",
        "INTn (valence INTensification of n) ?",
        "DOWn (valence DOWntoning of n).",
        "The n argument in the last two operators is the degree by which the operator is to be applied.",
        "The result can also be a set valence, in which case it looks like any valence expressed in the dictionar-ies.",
        "This system allows us to describe fairly elaborate context rules; for instance, having multiword modifiers such as those in (1) and (2) below.",
        "A context rule for type (1) constructions would cause the polarity of the negative adjective to be invert-ed, whereas a rule for type (2) constructions would intensify the valence of the negative adjective.",
        "(1) no tener nada de (be not at all) + negative adjective: ?Ese no tiene nada de tonto/est?pido/...?",
        "(?He's not at all dumb/stupid/??)",
        "(2) (ser) un completo (be a complete) + negative adjective: ?Es un completo idiota?",
        "(?He's a complete idiot?)",
        "The implementation of this kind of context rules gives us greater flexibility than simply having a repository of MWEs.",
        "Without context rules, it would be very difficult to represent (and successfully process for SA) these types of MWEs, where part of them is defined by the existence of a given semantic prosody that triggers a certain polarity (e.g., adjectives denoting a negative quality).",
        "3.3 Computing Sentiment Sentitext returns a number of metrics in the form of an XML file which is then used to generate the reports and graphical representations of the data.",
        "The crucial information is a Global Sentiment Value (GSV), which is a numerical score (on a 0-10 scale) for the sentiment of the input text.",
        "Other data include the total number of words, total number of lexical words (i.e., content, non-grammatical words), number of neutral words, etc.",
        "To arrive at the global value, a number of scores are computed.",
        "The most important is what we call Affect Intensity, which modulates the GSV to reflect the percentage of sentiment-conveying words that the text contains.",
        "Before we explain how this score is obtained, it is worth stressing the fact that we do not count words (whether positive, negative, or neutral): we count identified text segments that correspond to lexical units (i.e., meaning units from a lexical perspective).",
        "A segment is one of the following: 1.",
        "A single word or MWE as found in the text (or rather, its lemmatized form), either neutral or otherwise.",
        "MWEs are not marked in any special way in Sentitext's output, except for the fact that the individual words it is composed of appear in the lemmatized form in which they are stored in the database.",
        "2.",
        "A single word or MWE identified as a sen-timent-conveying lexical item, whose valence has been modified by a context rule, either by inversion or by intensification.",
        "As we mentioned before, items in our dictionaries are marked for valence with values in the range 2 to 2.",
        "Intensification context rules can add up to three marks, for maximum score of 5 (negative or positive) for any given segment.",
        "The simplest way of computing a global value for sentiment would be to add negative values on the one hand and positive values on the other, and then establish it by simple subtraction.",
        "However, as others have noted (e.g., Taboada et al., 2011), things are rather more complicated than that.",
        "Our Affect Intensity measure is an attempt to capture the effect that different proportions of sentiment-carrying segments have in a text.",
        "We define the Affect Intensity simply as the percentage of senti-ment-carrying segments.",
        "Affect Intensity is not used directly in computing the global value for the text, however: we first adjust the upper and lower limits (initially 5 and 5).",
        "The adjusted limit or Upper Bound equals the initial limit unless the Affect Intensity is greater than 25 (i.e., over 25% of the text's lexical items are sentiment-carrying).",
        "Obviously, this figure is arbitrary, and has been arrived at simply by trial and error.",
        "The Upper Bound is obtained by dividing the Affect Intensity by 5 (since there are 5 possible negative and positive valence values).",
        "A further variable needs some explaining.",
        "Our approach to computing the GSV is similar to Po-lanyi and Zaenen's (2006) original method, in which equal weight is given to positive and negative segments, but it differs in that we place more weight on extreme values.",
        "This is motivated by the fact that it is relatively uncommon to come across such values (e.g. ?extremely wonderful?",
        "), so when they do appear, it is a clear marker of positive sen-timent.",
        "Other implementations of Contextual Valence Shifters (Taboada et al., 2011) have put more weight only on negative segments when modified by valence shifters (up to 50% more weight), operating under the so-called ?positive bias?",
        "assumption (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006), i.e., negative words and expressions appear more rarely than positive ones, and therefore have a stronger cognitive impact, which should be reflected in the final sentiment score.",
        "In our implementation, equal weight is placed on positive and negative values.",
        "However, we do not simply assign more weight to both extremes of the scale (-5 and 5), we place more weight increasingly to each value by multiplying them by different factors, from -12.5 to 12.5 in 2.5 increments3.",
        "3 Our rating scale is based on a 0-10 scale, i.e., a 11-point scale, which is the most familiar for Spanish users, commonly used for grading.",
        "Sentitext outputs its rating using such a scale, and then this is converted to 5-star rating system.",
        "What we aim to achieve with these increments is to give more weight to extreme values.",
        "For ex-ample, a text segment that has been assigned a valence of +4, which warrants a 10 factor, would end up having twice as much weight as two +2 segments (5 factor): 10x4x1=40; 5x2x2=20.",
        "The reason for this is that such extreme values are rarely found and, when they are, they invariably signal strong opinion.",
        "The resulting method for obtaining the Global Sentiment Value for a text is expressed by Equation 1 below,",
        "performance on a domain-specific corpus implied even better performance on general language texts.",
        "Table 1 below shows a tendency toward low recall of negative segments, which we think may be caused by the ?positive bias?",
        "effect mentioned in the previous section.",
        "In any event, these figures are more than reasonable for a sentiment analysis sys-tem.",
        "Dataset Precision Recall Global segments 0,848 0,616 Positive segments 0,838 0,669 Negative segments 0,864 0,525 Table 1: Precision and recall results in global, positive and negative segment valences.",
        "A second evaluation (Moreno-Ortiz et al., 2011) was carried out using a greater variety of types of user reviews: movies, books and music, consumer goods, and electronics.",
        "We also introduced new features, such as a slightly modified system for calculating the GSV (modified Affect Intensity threshold) and conversion of the 0-10 score to a 5-point star-rating system.",
        "Introducing the star-rating system posed interesting questions, such as defining what is a miss and what is a hit, when comparing Sentitext's results to human rat-ings.",
        "Performance results were consistent with the previous evaluation, and confirmed a tendency to obtain better results for reviews of non-content objects (i.e. not books and movies), such as elec-tronics.",
        "A recent evaluation (Moreno-Ortiz and P?rez-Hern?ndez, 2013) has been carried out using a large set of Twitter messages.",
        "This work was developed for the TASS workshop (Villena-Roman et al., 2013), where a double challenge was proposed by the organizers that consisted of classifying over 60,000 tweets according to their polarity in 3 levels + none and 5 levels + none, respective-ly.",
        "This time performance was significantly poorer, which we attribute to both the nature of the texts, and the imposed distinction between neutral and no polarity, which we find irrelevant4.",
        "It has served, 4 In this scheme, no polarity means that no lexical segments carrying polarity were found, whereas neutral means that positive and negative text segments cancel each other out.",
        "Our Affect Intensity measure could easily be used for this, but such a distinction is not really useful for most applications, and usually not taken into account in the literature.",
        "however, as proof that our GSV calculation needs to be modified in order to account for extremely short texts.",
        "4 MWEs in Sentitext Our criteria for the lexical representation of MWEs were largely determined by our choice of tools for basic morphosyntactic analysis, i.e., tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization.",
        "Freeling has the advantage of offering a very flexible MWE recognition engine.",
        "An important advantage of using Freeling is that, being open source, the lexical resources it uses for its analysis are installed in the system in the form of text files, which allows for relatively easy edit-ing.",
        "This is particularly useful for the acquisition of MWEs, since, although Freeling includes only a reduced set of common phrases, it is fairly straightforward to update the text file that contains them.",
        "As for the criteria we have employed for the inclusion of an item in our database, we follow Baldwin and Kim's (2010) loose definition of MWEhood and typology of idiomaticity.",
        "They distinguish between lexical, semantic, pragmatic, and statistic idiomaticity, where MWEs may display one or more of those types.",
        "Some of them are idiomatic at more than one level, whereas others at one (statistical idiomaticity, in the case of colloca-tions, for example).",
        "4.1 Annotation schema As of February 2013, the Sentitext MWE lexicon contains over 19,000 entries, most of which are, as expected, noun phrases.",
        "The full distribution according to syntactic category is shown in Table 2 below.",
        "MWE Category Number Proportion Noun Phrases 10,421 55% Verb Phrases 4,768 25% Adverbial Phrases 2,255 12% Interjections5 781 4% Adjectival Phrases 436 2% Prepositional phrases 237 1% Conjunctions 122 1% Table 2: Distribution of MWE categories in the Sentitext lexicon.",
        "5 Interjections include idioms and other set phrases that have the form of a full sentence.",
        "Freeling uses the EAGLES tagset recommendations for morphosyntactic annotation of corpora (EAGLES, 1996), which have consistently proved their viability in the past.",
        "The EAGLES recommendations do not impose a particular representation scheme for MWEs, and Freeling takes a simple compositional approach in which MWEs are sequences of categorized individual words.",
        "Each morphological tag is composed of different data fields, depending on which morphosyntac-tic category it belongs to; some categories, like interjections, have just one field, while others have up to seven fields (e.g., verb phrases), some of which may be instantiated at runtime.",
        "For example, the morphologically invariable MWE gafas de sol (?sunglasses?)",
        "is represented as (3) gafas_de_sol,gafas_de_sol,NCMS000 where the tag ?NCMS000?",
        "specifies that it is: N = noun, C = common, M = masculine, S = singular.",
        "Whereas in (4) below (oso polar, ?polar bear?",
        "), the MWE is defined as a noun phrase composed of two lemmas that can be instantiated to any valid words form at runtime.",
        "(4) <oso>_<polar>,oso_polar,$1:NC 4.2 Acquisition and valence assignment Our mwords dictionary was obtained mainly from dictionaries and corpora, and the initial collection was subsequently enhanced during the extensive application testing process.",
        "We regard our acquisition of lexical items as an ongoing effort.",
        "Prior to tagging our initial set of MWEs for Freeling, a review process was carried out to ensure that they adhered to certain varietal and statistical criteria.",
        "Castilian Spanish was taken as the standard, and very rarely are other varieties accounted for.",
        "The most time-consuming task was obviously identifying and marking up the components of the MWEs that can be inflected.",
        "This was a lengthy process, and the results had to be checked exhaust-ively, since a mistake could result in an MWE not being identified in any of its forms.",
        "This was performed manually, but aided by an interface that provided a set of templates with the most commonly used morphological structures, also reducing the possibility of typing mistakes.",
        "Next we added the morphological tags, a semiautomatic process that employed RE pattern matching and then a manual check."
