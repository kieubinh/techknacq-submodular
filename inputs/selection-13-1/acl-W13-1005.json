        "Compounds have long been a reoccurring focus of attention within theoretical, cognitive, and computational linguistics.",
        "Recent manifestations of interest in compounds include the Handbook of Compounding (Lieber and Stekauer, 2009) on theoretical perspectives, and a series of workshops1 and special journal issues with respect to the computational perspective (Journal of Computer Speech and Language, 2005; Language Resources and Evaluation, 2010; ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing, to appear).",
        "Some work has focused",
        "2003; Bannard, 2005; Cook and Stevenson, 2006); adjective-noun combinations (Baroni and Zampar-elli, 2010; Boleda et al., 2013); and noun-noun compounds (Reddy et al., 2011b; Reddy et al., 2011a).",
        "Others have aimed at predicting the compositionality of phrases and sentences of arbitrary type and length, either by focusing on the learning approach (Socher et al., 2011); by integrating symbolic models into distributional models (Coecke et al., 2011; Grefenstette et al., 2013); or by exploring the arithmetic operations to predict compositionality by the meaning of the parts (Widdows, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "An important resource in evaluating compositionality has been human compositionality ratings, in which human subjects are asked to rate the degree to which a compound is transparent or opaque.",
        "Transparent compounds, such as raincoat, have a meaning which is an obvious combination of its constituents, e.g., a raincoat is a coat against the rain.",
        "Opaque compounds, such as hot dog, have little or no relation to one or more of their constituents: a hot dog need not be hot, nor is it (hopefully) made of dog.",
        "Other words, such as ladybug, are transparent with respect to just one constituent.",
        "As many words do not fall clearly into one category or the other, subjects are typically asked to rate the compositionality of words or phrases on a scale, and the mean of several judgements is taken as the gold standard.",
        "Like many data sets of human judgements, compositionality ratings can be fraught with large quantities of uncertainty and noise.",
        "For example, participants typically agree on items that are clearly transparent or opaque, but will often disagree about the",
        "gray areas in between.",
        "Such uncertainty represents an inherent part of the semantic task and is the major reason for using the mean ratings of many subjects.",
        "Other types of noise, however, are undesirable, and should be eliminated.",
        "In particular, we wish to examine two types of potential noise in our data.",
        "The first type of noise (Type I noise: uncertainty), comes from when a subject is unfamiliar or uncertain about particular words, resulting in sporadically poor judgements.",
        "The second type of noise (Type II noise: unreliability), occurs when a subject is consistently unreliable or uncooperative.",
        "This may happen if the subject misunderstands the task, or if a subject simply wishes to complete the task as quickly as possible.",
        "Judgements collected via crowdsourcing are especially prone to this second kind of noise, when compared to traditional pen-and-paper experiments, since participants aim to maximize their hourly wage.2 In this paper, we apply two standard cleansing methods (Ben-Gal, 2005; Maletic and Marcus, 2010), that have been used on similar rating data before (Reddy et al., 2011b), on two data sets of compositionality ratings of German noun-noun compounds.",
        "We aim to address two main points.",
        "The first is to assess the cleansing approaches in their ability to produce compositionality ratings of higher quality and consistency, while facing a reduction of data mass in the cleansing process.",
        "In particular, we look at the effects of removing outlier judgements resulting from uncertainty (Type I noise) and dropping unreliable subjects (Type II noise).",
        "The second issue is to assess the overall reliability of our two rating data sets: Are they clean enough to be used as gold standard models in computational linguistics approaches?"

        "After constructing the modified data set, we sorted the subjects by their agreement.",
        "Of the 92 subjects with the lowest agreement, 75 of them were rejected in the original data set (81.5%).",
        "Of the 150 subjects with the highest agreement, only 17 of them were rejected from the original data set (11.3%).",
        "The typical precision-recall tradeoff obviously applies.",
        "Curiously, we note that the minimum subject agreement at this 92nd subject was 0.457.",
        "Comparing with the curves for the individual ratings in Figures 4a and 6, we see this is the point where intrinsic consistency and data retention both begin dropping rapidly.",
        "While this may be a happy coincidence, it does seem to suggest that the ideal minimum subject agreement is roughly where the data retention rate starts rapidly turning.",

        "In this paper, we have performed a thorough analysis of two sets of compositionality ratings to German noun-noun compounds, and assessed their reliability from several perspectives.",
        "We conclude that asking for ratings of compositionality of compound words is reasonable and that such judgements are notably reliable and robust.",
        "Even when compositionality ratings are collected in two very different settings (laboratory vs. AMT) and with different dynamics, the produced ratings are highly consistent.",
        "This is shown by the high initial correlation of the two sets of compositionality ratings.",
        "We believe this",
        "provides strong evidence that human judgements of compositionality, or at least these particular data sets, are reasonable as gold standards for other computational linguistic tasks.",
        "We also find that such ratings can be highly robust against large amounts of data loss, as in the case of aggressive Z-score and minimum subject agreement filtering: despite data retention rates of 10-70%, consistency between our data sets never dropped more than 6 points.",
        "In addition, we find that the correlation between compositionality ratings and association norms is substantial, but generally much lower and less sensitive than internal consistency.",
        "We generally find Type I noise to be very difficult to detect, and Z-score filtering is mostly ineffective at eliminating unreliable item ratings.",
        "This is confirmed by both our natural and artificial experiments.",
        "At the same time, Z-score filtering seems fairly harmless at conservative levels, and probably can be safely applied in moderation with discretion.",
        "On the other hand, we have confirmed that minimum subject agreement is highly effective at filtering out incompetent and unreliable subjects, as evidenced by both our artificial and spammer detection experiments.",
        "We conclude that, as we have defined it, Type II noise is easily detected, and removing this noise produces much higher quality data.",
        "We recommend using subject agreement as a first-pass identifier of likely unreliable subjects in need of manual review.",
        "We would also like to explore other types of compounds, such as adjective-noun compounds (e.g. Gro?eltern ?grandparents?",
        "), and compounds with more than two constituents (e.g. Bleistiftspitzma-chine ?automatic pencil sharpener?",
