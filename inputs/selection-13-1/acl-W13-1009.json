        "While working on valency lexicons for Czech and English, it was necessary to define treatment of multiword entities (MWEs) with the verb as the central lexical unit.",
        "Morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of such MWEs had to be formally specified in order to create lexicon entries and use them in treebank annotation.",
        "Such a formal specification has also been used for automated quality control of the annotation vs. the lexicon entries.",
        "We present a corpus-based study, concentrating on multilayer specification of verbal MWEs, their properties in Czech and English, and a comparison between the two languages using the parallel Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT).",
        "This comparison revealed interesting differences in the use of verbal MWEs in translation (discovering that such MWEs are actually rarely translated as MWEs, at least between Czech and English) as well as some inconsistencies in their annotation.",
        "Adding MWE-based checks should thus result in better quality control of future treebank/lexicon annotation.",
        "Since Czech and English are typologically different languages, we believe that our findings will also contribute to a better understanding of verbal MWEs and possibly their more unified treatment across languages.",

        "Valency is a linguistic phenomenon which plays a crucial role in the majority of today's linguistic theories and may be considered a base for both lexicographical and grammatical work.",
        "After valency was first introduced into linguistics by L. Tesni?re (1959), the study of valency was taken up by many scholars, with a wealth of material now available; cf. (?gel et al., 2006).",
        "In the theoretical framework of Functional Generative Description (Sgall et al., 1986), the following researchers have substantially contributed to valency research: J. Panevov?",
        "(1977; 1998); P. Sgall (1998), M. Lopatkov?",

        "(2012), Z. Ure?ov?",
        "(2011a; 2011b).",
        "In general, valency is understood as a specific ability of certain lexical units - primarily of verbs - to open ?slots?",
        "to be filled in by other lexical units.",
        "By filling up these slots the core of the sentence structure is built.",
        "Valency is mostly approached syntactically, semantically or by combining these two perspectives.",
        "Valency terminology is not consistent (cf. valency, subcategorization, argument structure, etc.",
        "), however, valency as a verbal feature seems to be language universal (Goldberg, 1995).",
        "MWEs are expressions which consist of more than a single word while having non-compositional meaning.",
        "They can be defined (Sag et al., 2002) as ?idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries.?",
        "As the MWE Workshop itself attests, MWEs form a complex issue, both theoretically and practically in various NLP tasks.",
        "Here, we will concentrate on certain types of verbal MWEs only.",
        "Verbal MWEs can be divided into several groups",
        "(cf. Sect.",
        "1.3.2 in (Baldwin and Kim, 2010)): ?",
        "verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as take off, play around, or cut short, ?",
        "prepositional verbs (PVs), such as refer to, look for, or come across, ?",
        "light-verb constructions (LVCs or verb-complement pairs or support verb constructions, see e.g. (Calzolari et al., 2002)), such as give a kiss, have a drink, or make an offer, ?",
        "verb-noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs or VP idioms), such as the (in)famous kick the bucket, spill the beans, or make a face.",
        "While (Baldwin and Kim, 2010) define VNICs as being ?composed of a verb and noun in direct object position,?1 we found that their syntax can be more diverse and thus we will include also constructions like be at odds or make a mountain out of a molehill into this class.",
        "Our goal is to look mainly at the surface syntactic representation of MWEs, therefore, we will follow the above described typology even though the exact classification might be more complex."

        "http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/lindat/EngVallex; since it was created for the WSJ/PTB annotation, the starting point was Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005) to which it is also linked.",

        "Here is an example of a valency lexicon entry (for the base sense of to give, simplified): give ACT(sb) PAT(dobj) ADDR(dobj2) The verb lemma (give) is associated with its arguments, labeled by functors: ACT for actor (deep subject), PAT for Patient (deep object), and ADDR for addressee.5 In the valency lexicon entries, two more argument labels can be used: effect (EFF) and origin (ORIG).",
        "In addition, if a free modifier (e.g. adverbial, prepositional phrase, etc.)",
        "is so tightly associated to be deemed obligatory for the given verb sense, it is also explicitly put into the list of arguments.",
        "The P(CE)DT use about 35 free modifications (such as LOC, DIR1, TWHEN, TTILL, CAUS, AIM, ...), most of which can be marked as obligatory with certain verbs (verb senses).",
        "At each valency slot, requirements on surface syntactic structure and inflectional properties of the arguments may be given.",

        "For details of surface-syntactic structural and morphological requirements related to Czech valency and subcategorization in Czech, see e.g. Ure?ov?",
        "(2011a; 2011b).",
        "For the annotation of (general) MWEs (Bejc?ek and Stran?",
        "?k, 2010) in the P(CE)DT, the following principle have been chosen: each MWE is represented by a single node in the deep dependency tree.",
        "This accords with our principles that ?deep?",
        "representation should abstract from (the peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of) surface syntax and represent ?meaning.",
        "?6 The syntactic (and related morphological) representation of MWEs is annotated at a ?lower?, purely syntactic dependency layer (here, each word token is represented by its own node).",
        "tree should ideally represent a single unit of meaning, and the ?meaning?",
        "of the tree - typically representing a sentence - should be derived compositionally from the meanings of the individual nodes and their (labeled, dependency) relations (i.e. functors, as they are called in the PDT-style treebanks).",
        "Subsequently, the two representations are linked.",
        "However, here arises a problem with modifiable MWEs (such as lose his/my/their/... head): if the whole MWE is represented as a single node, the modifier relation to the MWE would be ambiguous if put simply as the dependent of the MWE (i.e., which part of the MWE does it modify?).",
        "Therefore, a rather technical, but unambiguous solution was adopted: the verb as the head of the verbal MWE is represented by a node, and the ?rest?",
        "of the MWE gets its own appropriately marked node (technically dependent on the verb node).",
        "Such a relation is labeled with the DPHR functor (?Dependent part of a PHRase?).",
        "The modifier of the MWE can thus be unambiguously attached as either the dependent node of the verb (if it modifies the whole MWE, such as a temporal adverbial in hit the books on Sunday), or to the DPHR node (if it modifies only that part of the MWE, such as in hit the history books).7 We believe that this solution which allows the flexibility of considering also modifiable verbal VNICs to be annotated formally in the same way as fully fixed VNICs is original in the PDT family of treebanks, since we have not seen it neither in the Penn Treebank nor in other treebanks, including dependency ones.",
        "Since DPHR is technically a dependent node, it can then be formally included as a slot in the valency dictionary, adding the surface syntactic and/or morphological representation in the form of an encoded surface dependency representation, such as in the following example of an English VNIC: make DPHR(mountain.Obj.sg[a], out[of,molehill.Adv.sg[a]) In Czech, the formal means are extended, e.g. for the required case (1 - nominative, 6 locative):8 be?hat DPHR(mr?z.S1,po[z?da.P6]) 7One can argue that in very complex MWEs, this simple split into two nodes might not be enough; in the treebanks we have explored no such multiple dependent modifiers exist.",
        "8The repertoire of possible syntactic and morphological constraints, which can be used for the description of possible forms of the fixed part of the idiomatic expression, covers all aspects of Czech word formation: case, number, grammatical gender, possessive gender and number, degree of comparison, negation, short/long form of certain adjectives, analytical dependency function etc.",
        "In Fig. 1, the phrase making a mountain out of a mole is syntactically annotated in the following way: ?",
        "mountain is annotated as the syntactic direct object of making, ?",
        "out of a molehill is annotated as a prepositional phrase (with the preposition as the head) On the tectogrammatical layer of annotation, the verb is the head and the defining part of the MWE gets a separate node (marked by DPHR).",
        "In the corpus-based analysis of verbal MWEs in the valency lexicons and the treebanks presented here, we concentrate mainly on VNICs (see Sect.",
        "1) and briefly mention LVCs, since the boundary between them is often a bit grayish.",
        "In the P(CE)DT treebanks, LVCs are always represented as two nodes: the (light) verb node and the noun complement node.",
        "Formally, the representing structure is the same for both mentioned groups of MWEs, but it differs in the labels of the verb arguments: CPHR (Compound PHRase) for LVCs vs. DPHR for VNICs.",
        "Whereas lexical units marked as DPHRs are mostly limited to a fixed number of words and therefore are listed in the lexicon, lexical units marked as CPHRs are often not limited in their number and therefore it does not make sense to list them all in the lexicon.",
        "A possible solution to the problem of automatic identification of (general) MWEs in texts using the annotation found in the PDT, which is related to the topic described in this paper but goes beyond its scope, can be found in (Bejcek et al., 2013)."

        "We have found that VNICs, as one of the types of MWEs, are translated in different ways.",
        "A translation of a VNIC as a VNIC is rare, even if we take into account the annotation errors (88+7+17+28+52=192 cases of the 936 extracted).",
        "By far the most common case of translating a VNIC in both directions is the usage of a completely non-MWE phrase.",
        "There is also a substantial amount of errors in each direction, higher in cases where the Czech translation was annotated as a VNIC and the English original was not.",
        "While the low overall number of VNICs found in the parallel corpus can be explained by not considering standard phrasal verbs for this study and by the required conservatism in marking a phrase as a true VNIC, we can only speculate why only a small proportion of VNICs are translated as VNICs in(to) the other language: manual 12None of the annotators of the English side of the parallel treebank was a fully native English speaker, which might also explain this ?conservatism.?",
        "inspection of several cases suggested (but without a statistically significant conclusions) that this does not seem to be caused by the specific nature or genre of the Wall Street Journal texts, but rather by the fact that the two languages explored, Czech and English, went generally through different developments under different circumstances and contexts throughout the years they evolved separately.",
        "While this paper describes only an initial analysis of multiword expressions (of the verb-noun idiomatic combination type) in parallel treebanks, we plan to apply the same classification and checks as described here to the whole corpus (perhaps automatically to a certain extent), to discover (presumably) even more discrepancies and also more correspondence types.",
        "These will again be classified and corrections in the data will be made.",
        "Eventually, we will be able to get a more reliable material for a thorough study of the use of MWEs in translation, with the aim of improving identification and analysis of MWEs (e.g., by enriching the approach taken by and described in (Bejcek et al., 2013)).",
        "We would also like to improve machine translation results by identifying relevant features of MWEs (including but not limited to VNICs) and using the associated information stored in the valency lexicons in order to learn translation correspondences involving MWEs."
