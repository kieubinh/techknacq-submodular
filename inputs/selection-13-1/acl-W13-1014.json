        "To give a step forward to solve this problem, we decided to survey the verbs undergoing seas an integral part of their lexical form (item 6), called herein pronominal verbs, but also known as inherent reflexive verbs (Rosa?rio Ribeiro, 2011).",

        "An example of the relevance of pronominal verbs is that, in spite of not being argumental, that is, not being eligible for a semantic role label, the use of seas a CONSTITUTIVE PARTICLE should integrate the verb that evokes the argumental structure, as may be seen in Figure 1.",
        "The identification of pronominal verbs is not a trivial task because a pronominal verb has a nega",

        "For the automatic identification of multiword verb+se occurrences, we performed corpus searches on the PLN-BR-FULL corpus (Muniz et al., 2007), which consists of news texts extracted from a major Brazilian newspaper, Folha de Sa?o Paulo, from 1994 to 2005, with 29,014,089 tokens.",
        "The corpus was first preprocessed for sentence splitting, case homogenization, lemmatization, morphological analysis and POS tagging using the PALAVRAS parser (Bick, 2000).",
        "Then, we executed the corpus searches using the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010).",
        "The tool allowed us to define two multilevel word patterns, for proclitic and enclitic cases, based on surface forms, morphology and POS.",
        "The patterns covered all the verbs in third person singular (POS=V*, morphology=3S) followed/preceded by the clitic pronoun se (surface form=se, POS=PERS).",
        "The patterns returned a set of se occurrences, that is, for each verb, a set of sentences in the corpus in which this verb is followed/preceded by the clitic se.",
        "In our analysis, we looked at all the verbs taking an enclitic se, that is, where the clitic se is attached after the verb.",
        "We could as well have included the occurrences of verbs with a proclitic se (clitic attached before the verb).",
        "However, we suspected that this would increase the number of occurrences (sentences) to analyze without a proportional increase in verb lemmas.",
        "Indeed, our search for proclitic se occurrences returned 40% more verb lemmas and 264% more sentences than for the enclitic se (59,874 sentences), thus confirming our hypothesis.",
        "Moreover, as we could see at a first glance, proclitic se results included se conjunctions erroneously tagged as pronouns (when the parser fails the cate-gorial disambiguation).",
        "This error does not occur when the pronoun is enclitic because Portuguese orthographic rules require a hyphen between the verb and the clitic when se is enclitic, but never when it is proclitic.",
        "We decided to look at sentences as opposed to looking only at candidate verb lemmas, because we did not trust that our intuition as native speakers would be sufficient to identify all the uses of the clitic se for a given verb, specially as some verbs allow more than one of the six uses we listed herein.",
        "For performing the annotation, we used a table with the verb lemmas in the lines and a column for each one of the six uses of seas a clitic pronoun.",
        "Working with two screens (one for the table and the other for the sentences), we read the sentences and, once a new use was verified, we ticked the appropriate column.",
        "This annotation setup accelerated the analyses, as we only stopped the reading when we identified a new use.",
        "The annotation was performed manually by a linguist, expert in semantics of Portuguese verbs, and also an author of this paper.",
        "After having summarized the results obtained from corpus analysis, we realized that some cliti-cized verb uses that we know as native speakers did not appear in the corpus (mainly reflexive and reciprocal uses).",
        "In these cases, we added a comment on our table which indicates the need to look for the use",
        "in another corpus aiming to confirm it.",

        "A comparative multi-corpus extension of the present study is planned as future work.",
        "The strategy we adopted to analyze the sentences in order to identify pronominal verbs was to make a series of questions to rule out the other possible se uses.",
        "Question 1 Does these particle function as a marker of PASSIVE voice or SUBJECT INDETERMINATION?",
        "In order to answer this question, it is important to know that both uses involve the suppression of the external argument of the verb.",
        "The difference is that, in the pronominal PASSIVE voice, the remaining NP (noun phrase) is shifted to the subject position (and the verb must then be inflected according to such subject), whereas in SUBJECT INDETERMINATION, the remaining argument, always a PP (prepositional phrase), remains as an indirect object.",
        "For example:",
        "If so, it is a case of REFLEXIVE use.",

        "Ele perguntou-se se aquilo era certo.",
        "He asked himself whether that was correct.",
        "?",

        "Question 3 Is it possible to substitute se for um ao outro (each other)?",
        "If so, it is a case of RECIPROCAL use.",

        "The data generated by this study can also be used to automatically learn classifiers for ambiguous uses of the clitic se.",
        "On the one hand, the annotation of uses can be semi-automatically projected on the sentences extracted from the corpus.",
        "On the other hand, the findings of this work in terms of syntactic and semantic characteristics can be used to propose features for the classifier, trying to reproduce those that can be automatically obtained (e.g., sub-categorization frame) and to simulate those that cannot be easily automated (e.g., whether the subject is animate).",
        "For these future experiments, we intend to compare different learning models, based on SVM and on sequence models like conditional random fields (Vincze, 2012).",
        "As languages are different in what concerns allowed alternations, the use of clitic se in Portuguese becomes even more complex when approached from a bilingual point of view.",
        "Depending on how different the languages compared are, the classification of se adopted here may be of little use.",
        "For example, several verbs classified as reflexive in Portuguese, like vestir-se (to dress), barbear-se (to shave) and demitir-se (to resign) are not translated into a reflexive form in English (*to dress oneself, *to shave oneself and *to dismiss oneself ).",
        "Similarly, typical inchoative verb uses in Portuguese need to be translated into a periphrasis in English, like surpreenderse (to be surprised at), orgulhar-se (to be proud of ) and irritar-se (to get angry).",
        "Such evidences lead",
        "us to conclude that it would be useful to count on a bilingual description not only of pronominal, but also of the other se uses.",
