        "The best-performing methods are usually based on lexical association measures that exploit statistical evidence of word occurrences and co-occurrences acquired from a corpus to determine degree of lexical association between words (Pecina, 2005).",

        "Most of the current approaches are limited to bigrams despite the fact that higher-order MWEs are quite common.",

        "This may seem to be a trivial problem.",
        "However, the complex nature of this phenomenon gives rise to problems on all linguistic levels of analysis: morphology, syntax, and semantics.",
        "In morphologically complex languages, a single MWE can appear in a number of morphological variants, which differ in forms of their individual components; and at the same time, a sequence of words whose base forms match with base forms of components of a given MWE do not necessarily represent an instance of this MWE (Pracoval dnem i noc??",

        "budou padat jedna za druhou / One head of a corrupt deputy will be rolling after the other).",
        "On the other hand, some MWEs can appear only as fixed expressions with no modifications allowed.",
        "In that case, the syntactic matching approach can miss-indicate their instances because of an inserted word or altered word order (Vys?s???",
        "spolec?nost / High society vs.",
        "*Vys?s???",
        "bo-hats???",
        "spolec?nost / High rich society).",
        "From the semantic point of view, MWEs are often characterized by more or less non-compositional (figurative) meaning.",
        "Their components, however, can also occur with the same syntax but compositional (literal) semantics, and therefore not acting as MWEs (Jedinou branku dal az?",
