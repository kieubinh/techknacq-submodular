        "Ahmed et al. (2012) describe several types of complex predicates that are found in Hindi e.g. morphological causatives, verb-verb complex predicates and noun-verb complex predicates.",
        "Of the three types, we will focus on the noun-verb complex predicates in this paper.",
        "Typically, a noun-verb complex predicate chorii ?theft?",
        "karnaa ?to do?",
        "has two components: a noun chorii and a light verb karnaa giving us the meaning ?steal?.",
        "Complex predicates 1 may be found in English e.g. take a walk and many other languages such as Japanese, Persian, Arabic and Chinese (Butt, 1993; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007).",
        "1They are also otherwise known as light verb, support verb or conjunct verb constructions.",
        "The verbal component in noun-verb complex predicates (NVC) has reduced predicating power (although it is inflected for person, number, and gender agreement as well as tense-aspect and mood) and its nominal complement is considered the true predicate, hence the term ?light verb?.",
        "The creation of a lexical resource for the set of true predicates that occur in an NVC is important from the point of view of linguistic annotation.",
        "For semantic role labelling in particular, similar lexical resources have been created for complex predicates in English, Arabic and Chinese (Hwang et al., 2010)."

      "heading": "1.1 Background",
      "text": [
        "The goal of this paper is to produce a lexical resource for Hindi NVCs.",
        "This resource is in the form of ?frame files?, which are directly utilized for PropBank annotation.",
        "PropBank is an annotated corpus of semantic roles that has been developed for English, Arabic and Chinese (Palmer et al., 2005; Palmer et al., 2008; Xue and Palmer, 2003).",
        "In Hindi, the task of PropBank annotation is part of a larger effort to create a multi-layered treebank for Hindi as well as Urdu (Palmer et al., 2009).",
        "PropBank annotation assumes that syntactic parses are already available for a given corpus.",
        "Therefore, Hindi PropBanking is carried out on top of the syntactically annotated Hindi Dependency Treebank.",
        "As the name suggests, the syntactic representation is dependency based, which has several advantages for the PropBank annotation process (see Section 3).",
        "The PropBank annotation process for Hindi follows the same two-step process used for other Prop-Banks.",
        "First, the semantic roles that will occur with each predicate are defined by a human expert.",
        "Then,",
        "these definitions or ?frame files?",
        "are used to guide the annotation of predicate-argument structure in a given corpus.",
        "Semantic roles are annotated in the form of numbered arguments.",
        "In Table 1 PropBank-style semantic roles are listed for the simple verb de;?to give?",
        ":",
        "The labels ARG0, ARG1 and ARG2 are always defined on a verb-by-verb basis.",
        "The description at the verb-specific level gives details about each numbered argument.",
        "In the example above, the numbered arguments correspond to the giver, thing given and recipient.",
        "In the Hindi treebank, which consists of 400,000 words, there are nearly 37,576 predicates, of which 37% have been identified as complex predicates at the dependency level.",
        "This implies that a sizeable portion of the predicates are NVCs, which makes the task of manual frame file creation time consuming.",
        "In order to reduce the effort required for manual creation of NVC frame files, we propose a novel automatic method for generating PropBank semantic roles.",
        "The automatically generated semantic roles will be used to create frame files for each complex predicate in the corpus.",
        "Our method accurately predicts semantic roles for almost two thirds of the unique nominal-verb combinations, with around 20% partial predictions, giving us a total of 87% useful predictions.",
        "For our implementation, we use linguistic resources in the form of syntactic dependency labels from the treebank.",
        "In addition we also have manually created, gold standard frame files for Hindi simple verbs2.",
        "In the following sections we provide linguistic background, followed by a detailed description of our method.",
        "We conclude with an error analysis and evaluation section.",
        "Semantic roles for the arguments of the light verb are determined jointly by the noun as well as the light verb.",
        "Megerdoomian (2001) showed that the light verb places some restrictions on the semantic role of its subject in Persian.",
        "A similar phenomenon may be observed for Hindi.",
        "Compare example 1 with ex",
        "?Today a bicycle was stolen?",
        "PropBank annotation assumes that sentences in the corpus have already been parsed.",
        "The annotation task involves identification of arguments for a given NVC and the labelling of these arguments with semantic roles.",
        "In example 1 we get an agentive subject with the light verb kar ?do?.",
        "However, when it is replaced by the unaccusative ho ?become?",
        "in Example 2, then the resulting clause has a theme argument as its subject.",
        "Note that the nominal chorii in both examples remains the same.",
        "From the point of view of PropBank annotation, the NVC chorii kii will have both ARG0 and ARG1, but chorii huii will only have ARG1 for its single argument cycle.",
        "Hence, the frame file for a given nominal must make reference to the type of light verb that occurs with it.",
        "The nominal as the true predicate also contributes its own arguments.",
        "In example 3, which shows a full (non-light) use of the verb de ?give?, there are three arguments: giver(agent), thing given(theme) and recipient.",
        "In contrast the light verb usage zor de ?emphasis give; emphasize?, seen in example 4, has a locative marked argument baat par ?matter on?",
        "contributed by the nominal zor ?emphasis?.",
        "As both noun and light verb contribute to the semantic roles of their arguments, we require linguistic knowledge about both parts of the NVC.",
        "The semantic roles for the nominal need to specify the co-occurring light verb and the nominal's argument roles must also be captured.",
        "Table 2 describes the desired representation for a nominal frame file.",
        "two frequently occurring light verbs ho and kar.",
        "If other light verbs are found to occur, they are added as additional rolesets as chorii.03, chorii.04 and so on.",
        "This frame file shows the representation of a nominal chorii ?theft?",
        "that can occur in combination with a light verb kar ?do?",
        "or ho ?happen?.",
        "For each combination, we derive a different set of PropBank roles: agent and patient for chorii.01 and theme for chorii.02.",
        "Note that the nominal's frame actually contains the roles for the combination of nominal and light verb, and not the nominal alone.",
        "Nominal frame files such as these have already been defined for English PropBank.3 However, for English, many nominals in NVCs are in fact nom-inalizations of full verbs, which makes it far easier to derive their frame files (e.g. walk in take a walk is a full verb).",
        "For Hindi, this is not the case, and a different strategy needs to be employed to derive these frames automatically."
