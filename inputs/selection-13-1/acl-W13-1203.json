        "In a project to build corpora containing corefer-ence links between events, we have identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none).",
        "Event coreference annotation on two corpora was performed to validate the findings.",
        "1 The Problem of Identity Last year we had HLT in Montreal, and this year we did it in Atlanta.",
        "Does the ?did it?",
        "refer to the same conference or a different one?",
        "The two conferences are not iden-tical, of course, but they are also not totally unre-lated?else the ?did it?",
        "would not be interpretable.",
        "When creating text, we treat instances of entities and events as if they are fixed, well-described, and well-understood.",
        "When we say ?that boat over there?",
        "or ?Mary's wedding next month?, we assume the reader creates a mental representation of the referent, and we proceed to refer to it without further thought.",
        "However, as has been often noted in theoretical studies of semantics, this assumption is very problematic (Mill, 1872; Frege 1892; Guarino, 1999).",
        "Entities and (even more so) events are complex composite phenomena in the world, and they undergo change.",
        "1 This work was supported by grants from DARPA and NSF, as well as by funding that supported Prof. M. Felisa Vedejo from UNED Madrid.",
        "Since nobody has complete knowledge, the author's mental image of the entity or event in question might differ from the reader?s, and from the truth.",
        "Specifically, the properties the author assumes for the event or entity might not be the ones the reader assumes.",
        "This difference has deep consequences for the treatment of the semantic meaning of a text.",
        "In particular, it fundamentally affects how one must perform coreference among entities or events.",
        "As discussed in Section 6, events have been the focus of study in both Linguistics and NLP (Chen and Ji, 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu, 2008, 2010; Humphreys et al., 1997).",
        "Determining when two event mentions in text corefer is, however, an unsolved problem2.",
        "Past work in NLP has avoided some of the more complex problems by considering only certain types of coreference, or by simply ignoring the major problems.",
        "The results have been partial, or inconsistent, annotations.",
        "In this paper we describe our approach to the problem of coreference among events.",
        "In order to build a corpus containing event coreference links that is annotated with high enough inter-annotator agreement to be useful for machine learning, it has proven necessary to create a model of event identity that is more elaborate than is usually assumed in the NLP literature, and to formulate quite specific definitions for its central concepts.",
        "2 In this work, we mean both events and states when we say ?event?.",
        "A state refers to a fixed, or regularly changing, configuration of entities in the world, such as ?it is hot?",
        "or ?he is running?.",
        "An event occurs when there is a change of state in the world, such as ?he stops running?",
        "or ?the plane took off?.",
        "Event coreference is the problem of determining when two mentions in a text refer to the ?same?",
        "event.",
        "Whether or not the event actually occurred in reality is a separate issue; a text can describe people flying around on dragons or broomsticks.",
        "While the events might be actual occurrences, hypothesized or desired ones, etc., they exist in the text as Discourse Elements (DEs), and this is what we consider in this work.",
        "Each DE is referred to (explicitly or implicitly) in the text by a mention, for example ?destroy?, ?the attack?, ?that event?, or ?it?.",
        "But it is often unclear whether two mentions refer to the same DE or to closely related ones, or to something altogether different.",
        "The following example illustrates two principal problems of event coreference: While Turkish troops have been fighting_E.1 a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq, two other Kurdish groups have been battling_E.2 each other.",
        "A radio station operated_E.3 by the Kurdistan Democratic Party said_E.4 the party's forces attacked_E.5 positions of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan on Monday in the Kurdish region's capital Irbil.",
        "The Voice of Iraqi Kurdistan radio, moni-tored_E.6 by the British Broadcasting Corp., said_E.7 more than 80 Patriotic Union fighters were killed_E.8 and at least 150 wound-ed_E.9.",
        "The fighting_E.10 was also reported_E.11 by a senior Patriotic Union official, Kusret Rasul Ali, who said_E.12 PUK forces re-pelled_E.13 a large KDP attack_E.14.",
        "?",
        "Ali claimed_E.16 that 300 KDP fighters were killed_E.17 or wounded_E.18 and only 11 Patriotic Union members died_E.19.",
        "Problem 1: Partial event overlap.",
        "Event E.2, ?battling each other?, refers to an ongoing series of skirmishes between two Kurdish groups, the KDP and the PUK.",
        "Since one of these battles, where the KDP attacked positions of the PUK, is E.5, it is natural to say that E.2 and E.5 corefer.",
        "However, E.2 clearly denotes other battles as well, and therefore E.5 and E.2 cannot fully corefer.",
        "In another example, event E.8 refers to the killing of a number of soldiers as part of this fight E.5, and event E.9 to the wounding of others.",
        "Both events E.8 and E.9 constitute an intrinsic part of the attack E.5, and hence corefer to it, but are each only part of E.5, and hence neither can fully corefer to it.",
        "Problem 2: Inconsistent reporting.",
        "This news fragment contains two reports of the fight: E.5 and E.10.",
        "Since E.10 describes E.5 from the perspective of a senior PUK official, it should corefer to E.5.",
        "But where the KDP's report claims more than 80 PUK fighters killed (event E.8, part of E.5), the PUK official said that only 11 PUK members died (event E.19, part of E.10).",
        "Without taking into account the fact that the two killing events are reports made by different speakers, it would not be possible to recognize them as coreferent.",
        "Examples of partial event overlap and inconsistent reporting are common in text, and occur as various types.",
        "In our work, we formally recognize partial event overlap, calling it partial event identi-ty, which permits different degrees and types of event coreference.",
        "This approach simplifies the coreference problem and highlights various inter-event relationships that facilitates grouping events into ?families?",
        "that support further analysis and combination with other NLP system components.",
        "In this paper, we introduce the idea that there are three degrees of event identity: fully identical, qua-si-identical, and fully independent (not identical).",
        "Full identity reflects in full coreference and quasi-identity in partial coreference.",
        "Fully independent events are singletons.",
        "Our claims in this paper are: ?",
        "Events, being complex phenomena, can corefer fully (identity) or partially (quasi-identity).",
        "?",
        "Event coreference annotation is considerably clarified when partial coreference is allowed.",
        "?",
        "A relatively small fixed set of types of quasi-identity suffices to describe most of them.",
        "?",
        "Different domains and genres highlight different subsets of these quasi-identity types.",
        "?",
        "Different auxiliary knowledge sources and texts are relevant for different types.",
        "2 Types of Full and Partial Identity Def: Two mentions fully corefer if their activi-ty/event/state DE is identical in all respects, as far as one can tell from their occurrence in the text.",
        "(In particular, their agents, location, and time are identical or compatible.)",
        "One can distinguish several types of identity, as spelled out below.",
        "Quasi-identity has been considered in corefer-ence before in (Hasler et al., 2006) but not as ex-tensively, and in (Recasens and Hovy, 2010a; 2011) but applied only to entities.",
        "When applied to events, the issue becomes more complex.",
        "3 Two Problems 3.1 Domain and Reporting Events As described above, inconsistent reporting occurs when a DE stated in reported text contains significant differences from the author's description of the same DE.",
        "To handle such cases we have found it necessary to additionally identify communication events, which we call Reportings, during annotation because they provide a context in which a DE is stat-ed.",
        "We identify two principal types of Reporting verbs: locutionary verbs ?say?, ?report?, ?an-nounce?, etc.)",
        "and Speech Acts (?condemn?, ?promise?, ?support?, ?blame?, etc.).",
        "Where the former verbs signal merely a telling, the latter verbs both say and thereby do something.",
        "For example in the following paragraph, ?admitted?",
        "and ?say?",
        "are communication events: Memon admitted_R.7,in-sayR.3 his involvement in activities_E.8,in-sayR.3 involving an explosives-laden van near the president's motorcade, police said_R.3?.",
        "Sometimes the same event can participate inside two reporting events, as in ?The LA Times lauded_R.1 the decision_E.2,in-sayR.1,in-sayR.3, which the NY Times lampooned_R.3.",
        "Though an added annotation burden, the link from a DE to a reporting event allows the analyst or learning system to discount apparent contradictory aspects of the DE and make more accurate identity decisions.",
        "3.2 Unclear Semantics of Events Sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact relationships between events since their semantics is unclear.",
        "In the following, is E.45 coreferent to E.44, or only partially?",
        "If so, how?",
        "Amnesty International has accused both sides of violating_E.44 international humanitarian law by targeting_E.45 civilian areas, and ... We decided that E.44 is not fully coreferent with E.45, since violating is not the same as targeting.",
        "Also, E.45 is not a subevent of E.44 since ?violat-ing?",
        "is not a script with a well-defined series of steps, does not trigger ?targeting?, and does not occur before ?targeting?.",
        "Rather, targeting is a certain form or example of violation/violating.",
        "(It might be easier if the sentence were: ?...",
        "of violating international humanitarian law by targeting civilian areas and the human rights group, by killing civilians, and by....?.",
        "As such E.45 could be interpreted as a member of E.44, interpreting the latter as a series of violations.)",
        "4 Annotation To validate these ideas we have been annotating newspaper texts within the context of a large project on automated deep reading of text.",
        "This project combines Information Extraction, parsing, and various forms of inference to analyze a small number of texts and to then answer questions about them.",
        "The inability of current text analysis engines to handle event coreference has been a stumbling block in the project.",
        "By creating a corpus of texts annotated for coreference we are working to enable machine learning systems to learn which features are relevant for coreference and then ultimately to perform such coreference as well.",
        "We are annotating two corpora: 1.",
        "The Intelligence Community (IC) Corpus contains texts in the Violent Events domain (bombings, killings, wars, etc.).",
        "Given the relative scarcity of the partial coreference subtypes, we annotated only instances of full coreference, Subevent, and Member relations.",
        "To handle Subevents one needs an unambiguous definition of the scripts in the domain.",
        "Fortunately this domain offers a manageable set of events (our event ontology comprises approximately 50 terms) with a subevent structure that is not overly complex but still realistic.",
        "We did not find the need to exceed three layers of scriptal granularity, as in campaign > {bombing, attack} > {blast, kill, wound}.",
        "2.",
        "The Biography (Bio) Corpus contains texts describing the lives of famous people.",
        "Typically, these texts are written when the person dies or has some notable achievement.",
        "Given the complexities of description of artistic and other creative achievements, we restrict our corpus to achieve",
        "ments in politics, science, sports, and other more factual endeavors.",
        "More important than scriptal granularity in this domain is temporal sequencing.",
        "We obtained and modified a version of the An-CoraPipe entity coreference annotation interface (Bertran et al., 2010) that was kindly given us by the AnCora team at the University of Barcelona.",
        "We implemented criteria and an automated method for automatically identifying domain and reporting events.",
        "We also created a tool to check and display the results of annotation, and technology to deliver various agreement scores.",
        "Using different sets of annotators (from 3 to 6 people per text), we have completed a corpus of 100 texts in the IC domain and are in process of annotating the Bio corpus.",
        "Our various types of full and partial coreference and the associated annotation guidelines were developed and refined over the first third of these documents.",
        "Table 1 shows statistics and inter-annotator agreement for the remaining 65 articles.",
        "The average number of domain and reporting events per article is 41.2.",
        "We use Fleiss's kappa since we have more than two annotators per article.",
        "The (rather low) score for member coreference is not really reliable given the small number of instances.",
        "Avg no per article Agreement (Fleiss's kappa) Full coreference relations Member coreference relations Subevent coreference relations 19.5 0.620 2.7 0.213 7.2 0.467 Table 1: Annotation statistics and agreement.",
        "5 Validation and Use To validate the conceptualization and definitions of full and partial identity relations, we report in (Araki et al., 2013) a study that determines correlations between the Member and Subevent relation instances and a variety of syntactic and lexico-semantic features.",
        "The utility of these features to support automated event coreference is reported in the same paper.",
        "We are now developing a flexible recursive procedure that integrates coreference of events and of their pertinent participants (including locations and times).",
        "This procedure employs inference in addition to feature-based classification to compensate for the shortcomings of each method alone."

      "heading": "6 Relevant Past Work The problem of identity has been addressed by scholars since antiquity. In the intensional approach (for example, De Saussure, 1896) a concept is defined as a set of attributes (differentiae), that serve to distinguish it from other concepts; two concepts are identical iff all their attributes and values are. In the extensional approach (Frege, 1982) a concept can be defined as the set of all instances of that concept; two concepts are identical when their two extensional sets are. Given the impossibility of either approach to support practical work, AI scholars have devoted some attention to so-called Identity Criteria. Gua-rino (1999) outlines several ?dimensions? along which entities can remain identical or change under transformations; for example, a glass before and after it is crushed is identical with respect to its matter but not its shape; the ACL now and one hundred years hence is (probably) identical as an organization but not in its membership. There has not been much theoretical work on semantic identity in the NLP community. But there has been a considerable amount of work on the problem of coreference. Focusing on entity coreference are (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Cu-lotta et al., 2007; Ng, 2007; Ng, 2009; Finkel and Manning, 2008; Ng, 2009). Focusing on event coreference are (Humphries et al., 1997; Chen and Zi, 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu, 2008; 2010). Anaphora and bridging reference are discussed in (Poesio and Artstein, 2005; 2007). Relevant to events is the TIME-ML corpus (Mani and Pustejovsky, 2004; Pustejovsky et al., 2003), which provides a specification notation for events and temporal expressions. Several corpora contain annotations for entity coreference, including the Prague Dependency Treebank (Ku?ov? and Haji?ov?. 2004), the ACE corpus (Walker et al., 2006), and OntoNotes (Pra-dhan et al., 2007). Most similar to our work is that of (Hasler et al., 2006). In that study, coreferential events and their arguments (also coreference between the argu-ments) were annotated for the terrorism/security domain, considering five event categories (attack, defend, injure, die, contact), and five event clusters (Bukavu bombing, Peru hostages, Tajikistan hos-tages, Israel suicide bombing and China-Taiwan",
      "text": [
        "hijacking).",
        "They also annotated information about the kind of coreferential link, such as identity / synonymy / generalization / specialization / other.",
        "Our work takes further the ideas of (Hasler et al., 2006) and (Recasens et al., 2011) in elaborating the types of full and partial identity, as they are manifest in event coreference.",
        "7 Conclusion The problem of entity and event identity, and hence coreference, is challenging.",
        "We provide a definition of identity and two principal types of quasi-identity, with differentiation based on differences in location, time, and participants.",
        "We hope that these ideas help to clarify the problem and improve inter-annotator agreement.",
