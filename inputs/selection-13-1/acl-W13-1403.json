        "For virtually all of Chinese history through the fall of the Qing Dynasty, poetry was largely written in Classical Chinese and accessible to a small, educated fraction of the population.",
        "With the rise of the May Fourth Movement in 1919, prominent intellectuals such as Hu Shi and Lu Xun began to advocate for and produce a fresh vernacular literature.",
        "This upheaval of tradition has been much discussed in literary studies; Michelle Yeh calls vernacular poetry ?a self-proclaimed iconoclast struggling against a formidable predecessor: the heritage of three millennia of classical poetry?",
        "(Yeh, 1991).",
        "While some propose that the May Fourth intellectuals ?abolished the classical language and all of its literary genres?",
        "(Hockx and Smits, 2003), others make more measured claims: Mao Chen, for example, maintains that ?a special relationship to tradition informs all phases of cultural activity during the May Fourth period?",
        "(Chen, 1997).",
        "Julia Lin notes that the period following the May Fourth Movement through 1937 saw ?the most exciting and diverse experimentation in the history of modern Chinese poetry?",
        "(Lin, 1973).",
        "Much of this experimentation was concerned with the question of modernity versus tradition, wherein some poets ?adapt[ed] the reality of the modern spoken language to what they felt was the essence of the old classical Chinese forms?",
        "(Haft, 1989).",
        "The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was a second major turning point in the century, when ?the Communists in one cataclysmic sweep [...] ruthlessly altered the course of the arts?",
        "and poetry ?became totally subservient to the dictates of the party?",
        "(Lin, 1973).",
        "With the ?physical removal of the old cultural leadership,?",
        "many of whom fled to Taiwan, this period saw a substantial ?vacuum in literature and the arts?",
        "(McDougall and Louie, 1997).",
        "Post-Mao, publication restrictions gradually loosened and earlier cultural journals re-entered circulation.",
        "Poetry began to reclaim its audience, and a Chinese avant-garde associated with the ?Misty Poets?",
        "developed (McDougall and Louie, 1997).",
        "However, we lack broad-scale empirical evidence of the linguistic features that constituted the shift from tradition to modernity.",
        "Therefore, we propose a study that asks: To what extent were classical poetic forms and classical language immediately discarded with the advent of vernacular poetry?",
        "What is the status of classical language after 1949 and amidst the Maoist era, when we might expect its total absence?",
        "Does more contemporary poetry still draw connections to classical language?"
