        "Shared attention to stories may have evolved as way of learning to understand others and to increase bonding (Boyd, 2009).",
        "Discussing literature may thus be something that we are wired to do, and that we do indeed wherever possible: today on Amazon, on weblogs, and on Twitter, and in earlier days in newspapers and letters.",
        "These responses to books are important both as documentation of the ways literary works are read and understood, and because they help determine works?",
        "short- and long-term success.",
        "This position paper argues that what we need, therefore, is a large and representative corpus of book responses.",
        "?Book response?",
        "in this paper includes any opinion that responds to a book, i.e. traditional book reviews, book-based discussion, opinions given on booksellers?",
        "sites, on Twitter, thoughtful blog posts, and the like.",
        "The word ?books?",
        "here is meant to refer to all genres, including literature as well as more popular genres such as fantasy, thrillers, comics, etc.",
        "Section 2 of the paper discusses the importance and research potential of book responses.",
        "Section 3 reviews related research.",
        "In section 4, I outline the properties that this corpus should have.",
        "Section 5 describes a Dutch pilot corpus and shows some aspects of this corpus that lend themselves to analysis with linguistic and stylometric tools.",
        "Section 6 presents conclusions and directions for future work.",
        "The author of this paper is not a computational linguist, but has a background in literary studies and digital humanities.",
        "The intention is to create a dialogue between literary studies and computational linguistics about fruitful ways to investigate book responses, their relations to the books they",
        "respond to and their effects on short-term or long-term appreciation.",
        "2 Book responses and their importance Evaluating books and talking about our response is a very natural thing to do (Van Peer, 2008).",
        "In a professionalized form, the discipline of literary criticism has a long and distinguished tradition (Habib, 2005).",
        "But ?ordinary?",
        "readers too have always talked about their reading experiences (Long, 2003; Rehberg Sedo, 2003).",
        "The written output of these reflections and discussions has been an important source for reading and reception studies.",
        "Proof of this importance is e.g. the existence of the Reading Experience Database (RED) that collects experiences of reading as documented in letters, memoirs and other historic material (Crone et al., 2011).",
        "Halsey (2009) e.g. shows how this database can help study changes in stylistic preferences over time.",
        "One reason for the importance of written book responses is that they provide documentation of how works affect their readers: they show what elements of the reading experience readers consider important enough to write down and share with friends and fellow-readers.",
        "To some extent at least this will be determined by the elements of the book that were most significant to the reader and that he or she is most likely to remember.",
        "Unlike in earlier historic periods, this sort of evidence today is plentiful and researchers should take advantage of this.",
        "Spontaneous written responses to reading are not the only way of assessing the effects of (literary) reading.",
        "Experimental research (Miall, 2006) and other approaches have an important place.",
        "Today's online book responses, however, are unique in that they are produced spontaneously by ordinary readers and have an ecological validity that other research data lack.",
        "(Which does, of course, not imply we should take everything that people write online at face value).",
        "A second reason for the importance of written book responses is that their role as (co-)determiners, or at least predictors, of literary success is well-documented.",
        "In the wake of a large body of research on movie reviews (e.g. Liu, 2006), this was established for reviews on booksellers?",
        "sites by (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006).",
        "For traditional (newspaper) reviews, their effects on long-term success (canonization) have been shown in e.g. (Ekelund and B?rjesson, 2002; Rosengren, 1987).",
        "If reading responses are that important for the study of literature and its effects, it follows we need to understand them better.",
        "We need tools that can analyze their style, rhetorical structure, topics, and sentiment, and these tools should be sensitive to the many different sorts of readers, responses and response sites that form part of the landscape of online book discussion.",
        "We also need tools that can help us see relationships between the responses and the works that they respond to, in terms of topics and narrative (what characters and plot developments do reviewers respond to), as well as at higher (cognitive, emotional and moral) levels.",
        "An important step towards such tools is the creation of a representative corpus that can provide a test bed for tool development."
