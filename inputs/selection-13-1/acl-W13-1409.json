        "Recent years have seen a surge in Digital Humanities research.",
        "This area, touching on both the fields of computer science and the humanities, is concerned with making data from the humanities analysable by digitalisation.",
        "For this, computational tools such as search, visual analytics, text mining, statistics and natural language processing aid the humanities researcher.",
        "On the one hand, software permits processing a larger set of data in order to assess traditional research questions.",
        "On the other hand, this gives rise to a transformation of the way research is conducted in the humanities: the possibility of analyzing a much larger amount of data ?",
        "yet in a quantitative fashion with all its necessary aggregation ?",
        "opens the path to new research questions, and different methodologies for attaining them.",
        "Although the number of research projects in Digital Humanities is increasing at fast pace, we still observe a gap between the traditional humanities scholars on the one side, and computer scientists on the other.",
        "While computer science excels in crunching numbers and providing automated processing for large amounts of data, it is hard for the computer scientist to imagine what research questions form the discourse in the humanities.",
        "In contrast to this, humanities scholars have a hard time imagining the possibilities and limitations of computer technology, how automatically generated results ought to be interpreted, and how to operationalize automatic processing in a way that its unavoidable imperfections are more than compensated by the sheer size of analysable material.",
        "This paper resulted from a successful cooperation between a natural language processing (NLP) group and a literary researcher in the field of Digital Humanities.",
        "We present the CoocViewer analysis tool for literary and other corpora, which supports new angles in literary research through quantitative analysis.",
        "In the Section 2, we describe the CoocViewer tool and review the landscape of previously available tools for our purpose.",
        "As a unique characteristic, CoocViewer contains a visualisation of significant concordances, which is especially useful for target terms of high frequency.",
        "In Section 3, we map the landscape of previous and current quantitative research in literary analysis, which is still an emerging and somewhat controversial sub-discipline.",
        "A use-case for the tool in the context of a specific project is laid out in Section 4, where a few examples illus",

        "Whereas there exist a number of tools for visualizing co-occurrences, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no tool to visualize positional co-occurrences, or as we also call them, significant concordances.",
        "In (Widdows et al., 2002) tools are presented that visualize meanings of nouns as vector space representation, using LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) and graph models using co-occurrences.",
        "There is also a range of text-based tools, without any quantitative statistics, e.g. Textpresso (Mu?ller et al., 2004), PhraseNet1 and Walden2.",
        "For searching words in context, Luhn (1960) introduced KWIC (Key Word in Context) which allows us to search for concordances and is also used in several corpus linguistic tools e.g. (Culy and Lyding, 2011), BNCWeb3, Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al., 2004), Corpus Workbench4 and MonoConc (Barlow, 1999).",
        "Although several tools for co-occurrences visualization exist (see e.g. co-occurrences for over 200 languages at LCC5), they often have different aims, and e.g. do not deliver the functionality to filter on different part-of-speech tags."

        "After tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging (Schmid, 1994) and indexing the input data by document, sentence and paragraph within the document, we compute signficant sentence-wide and paragraph-wide co-occurrences, using the tinyCC6 tool.",
        "Here, the log-likelihood test (Dunning, 1993) is employed to determine the significance sig(A,B) of the co-occurrence of two tokens A and B.",
        "To support the significant concordance view (described in the next section), we have extended the tool to also produce positional significant co-occurrences, where sig(A,B, offset) is computed by the log-likelihood significance of the co-occurrence of A and B in a token-distance of offset.",
        "Since the significance measure requires the single frequencies of A and B, as well as their joint frequency per positional offset in this setup, this adds considerable overhead during preprocessing.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to extend the notion of positional co-occurrence beyond direct neighbors, cf. (Richter et al., 2006).",
        "We apply a sigificance threshold of 3.847 and a frequency threshold of 2 to only keep ?interesting?",
        "pairs.",
        "The outcome of preprocessing is stored in a MySQL database schema similar to the one used by LCC (Biemann et al., 2007).",
        "We store sentence-and paragraph-wide co-occurrences and positional co-occurrences in separate database tables, and use one database per corpus.",
        "The database tables are indexed accordingly to optimize the queries issued by the CoocViewer tool.",

        "Quantitative research in literary analysis, although being conducted and discussed since at least the 1960s, (Hoover, 2008), is still far from being a clear field of research with a verified and acknowledged methodology.",
        "Studies in this field vary widely with respect to scope, methods applied and theoretical",
        "background.",
        "Until now, only the most basic definition can be given that applies to these approaches: Quantitative research in literary analysis is generally concerned with the application of methods from corpus linguistics (and statistics) to the field of literature to investigate and quantify general grammatical and lexical features of texts.",
        "Most studies applying such methods to literary analysis are carried out in the field of stylistics, building a relatively new research area of corpus stylistics, also called stylometry (Mahlberg, 2007; Hoover, 2008; Biber, 2011).",
        "The quantitative exploration of stylistic features and patterns is used for authorship attribution, e.g. (Burrows, 1992; Burrows, 2007; Craig, 2004; Hoover, 2001; Hoover, 2002), exploring the specificity of one author's style, e.g. (Burrows, 1987; Hori, 2004; Fischer-Starcke, 2010; Mahlberg, 2012) or one certain text, often compared to other texts of the same author or period, e.g. (Craig, 1999; McKenna and Antonia, 2001; Stubbs, 2005; Clement, 2008; Fischer-Starcke, 2009).",
        "Some studies focus on content-related questions such as the analysis of plot or characterization and the exploration of relations between and role of different characters, e.g. (Mahlberg, 2007; Culpeper, 2002; Culpeper, 2009), developing new ways of exploring these literary features, e.g. via the application of social network analysis (Elson et al., 2010; Moretti, 2011; Agarwal et al., 2012).",
        "Besides this area, there are numerous other approaches, like the attempt to investigate the phenomenon of ?literary creativity?",
        "(Hoey, 2007) or ways for automatic recognition of literary genres (Allison et al., 2011).",
        "Major methodological approaches of this field are, according to Biber (2011), Mahlberg (2007) and Hoover (2008), the study of keywords and word-frequencies, co-occurrences, lexical clusters (also called bundles or n-grams) and collocational as well as concordance analysis.",
        "Additionally, the need for cross-investigating and comparing the results with other corpora (be it a general corpus of one language or other small, purpose-built corpora) is emphasized to discuss the uniqueness of the results.",
        "But while especially the studies of Moretti (2000; 2007; 2009), taking a quantitative approach of ?distant reading?",
        "on questions of literary history and the evolution of literary genres, are often received as groundbreaking for the case, and despite the rising interest in this field of research in the last decades, there still is much reluctance towards the implementation of such methods.",
        "The general arguments raised frequently from the point of view of ?classical?",
        "literary analysis against a quantitative or computational approach can be grouped around four central points: The uniqueness of each literary text that quantitative analysis seems to underscore when treating the texts just as examples of style or period, focussing on very general patterns; the emphasize of technology and the relatively high threshold that the application, analysis and interpretation of the generated data contains (Potter, 1988); and the general notion that meaning in literary texts is highly context-related and context-dependent in different ways (Hoover, 2008).",
        "Last but not least there is what can be called the ?so-what-argument?",
        ": Quantitative methods tend to produce sparse significant new information compared with the classical approach of close reading, generating insights and interpretations that could as well be reached by simply reading the book (Mahlberg, 2007; Rommel, 2008).",
        "But the possibilities and advantages of corpus linguistics come to the foreground especially if one is not interested in aspects of uniqueness or particularity but in commonalities and differences between large amounts of literary texts too many to be read and compared in the classical way.",
        "This especially holds when it comes to questions of topics, themes, discourse analysis and the semantisation of certain words."
