        "Traditional readability formulae use a small number of surface features, such as the average sentence length (a proxy for syntactic complexity) and the average word length in syllables or characters (a proxy to vocabulary difficulty).",
        "Such features are considered linguistically shallow, but they are surprisingly effective and are still widely used (DuBay, 2004; ?tajner et al., 2012).",
        "The formulae or their features are incorporated in modern readability classification systems (Vajjala and Meurers, 2012; Sheehan et al., 2010; Petersen and Osten-dorf, 2009).",
        "Developments in computational linguistics enabled inclusion of multiple features for capturing",
        "various manifestations of text-related readability.",
        "Peterson and Ostendorf (2009) compute a variety of features: vocabulary/lexical (including the classic 'syllables per word'), parse features, including average parse-tree height, noun-phrase count, verb-phrase count and average count of subordinated clauses.",
        "They use machine learning to train classifiers for direct prediction of grade level.",
        "Vajjala and Meurers (2012) also use machine learning, with a wide variety of features, including classic features, parse features, and features motivated from studies on second language acquisition, such as Lexical Density and Type-Token Ratio.",
        "Word frequency and its derivations, such as proportion of rare words, are utilized in many models of complexity (Graesser et al., 2011; Sheehan et al. 2010; Stenner et al., 2006; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "Inspired by psycholinguistic research, two systems have explicitly set to measure textual cohesion for estimations of readability and complexity: Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2011) and Sour-ceRater (Sheehan et al., 2010).",
        "One notion of cohesion involved in those two systems is lexical cohesion ?",
        "the amount of lexically/semantically related words in a text.",
        "Some amount of local lexical cohesion can be measured via stem overlap of adjacent sentences, with averaging of such metric per text (McNamara et al., 2010).",
        "However, Sheehan et al. (submitted) demonstrated that such measure is not well correlated with grade levels.",
        "Perhaps closest to our present study is work reported in Foltz et al. (1998) and McNamara et al. (2010).",
        "These studies used Latent Semantic Analysis, which reflects second order co-occurrence associative relations, to characterize levels of lexical similarity for pairs of adjacent sentences within paragraphs, and for all possible pairs of sentences within paragraphs.",
        "McNamara et al.",
        "have shown success in distinguishing lower and higher cohesion versions of the same text, but have not shown whether that approach systematically applies for different texts and across grade levels.",
        "Our study is a first demonstration that a measure of lexical cohesion based on word-associations, and computed globally for the whole text, is an indicative feature that varies systematically across grade levels.",
        "In the theoretical tradition, our work is closest in spirit to Michael Hoey's theory of lexical priming (Hoey, 2005, 1991), positing that users of language internalize patterns of word co-occurrence and use them in reading, as well as when creating their own texts.",
        "We suggest that such patterns become richer with age and education, beginning with the most tight patterns at early age."

        "In this paper we defined a novel computational measure, lexical tightness.",
        "It represents the degree to which a text tends to use words that are highly inter-associated in the language.",
        "We interpret lexical tightness as a measure of intra-text global cohesion.",
        "This study presented the relationship between lexical tightness and text complexity, using two datasets of reading materials (1180 texts in total), with expert-assigned grade levels.",
        "Lexical tightness has a significant correlation with grade levels: about -0.6 overall.",
        "The correlation is negative: texts for lower grades are lexically tight, they use a higher proportion of mildly and strongly inter-associated words; texts for higher grades are less tight, they use a lesser amount of inter-associated words.",
        "The correlation of lexical tightness with grade level is stronger for texts of the literary genre (fiction and stories) than for text belonging to informational genre (expositional).",
        "While lexical tightness is moderately correlated with readability indexes, it also captures some aspects of prose complexity that are not covered by classic readability indexes, especially for literary texts.",
        "Regression analyses on a training set have shown that lexical tightness adds between 6.7% and 8.5% of explained grade level variance on top of the best readability formula.",
        "The utility of lexical tightness was confirmed by testing the regression formula on a held out set of texts.",
        "Lexical tightness is also moderately correlated with grade level (-0.353) in a small set of poems.",
        "In the same set, Flesch Reading Ease readability formula correlates with grade level at -0.335.",
        "A regression model using that formula and lexical tightness achieves correlation of 0.447 with grade level.",
        "Thus we have shown that lexical tightness has good potential for analysis of poetry.",
        "In future work, we intend to a) evaluate on larger datasets, and b) integrate lexical tightness with other features used for estimation of readability.",
        "We also intend to use this or a related measure for evaluation of writing quality."
