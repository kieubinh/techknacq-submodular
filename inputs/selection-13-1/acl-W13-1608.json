        "A significant amount of work has focused on analyzing English text with measurable success on news articles and product reviews.",
        "There has been recent efforts pertaining to expanding SSA to languages other than English and to analyzing social text such as tweets.",
        "To enable effective SSA for new languages and genres, two main requirements are necessary: (a) subjectivity lexicons that broadly cover sentiment carrying words in the genre or language; and (b) tagged corpora to train subjectivity and sentiment classifiers.",
        "These two are often scarce or nonexistent when expanding to new languages or genres.",
        "In this paper we focus on performing SSA on Arabic news articles and microblogs.",
        "There has been some recent work on Arabic SSA.",
        "However, the available resources continue to lag in the following ways: (1) The size of existing subjectivity lexicons is small, with low coverage in practical application.",
        "(2) The available tagged corpora are limited to the news domain, with no publicly available tagged corpora for tweets.",
        "To address the issue of limited lexicons, we applied two methods to build large coverage lexicons.",
        "In the first, we used Machine Translation (MT) to translate an existing English subjectivity lexicon.",
        "In the second, we employed a random graph walk method to automatically expand a manually curated Arabic lexicon.",
        "For the later method, we used Arabic-English MT phrase tables that include both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) as well as dialectal Arabic.",
        "As for tagged corpora, we annotated a new corpus that includes 2,300 Arabic tweets.",
        "We describe in detail the process of collecting tweets and some of the major attributes of tweets.",
        "The contribution of this paper is as follows: - We introduce strong baselines that employ Arabic specific processing including stemming, POS tagging, and tweets normalization.",
        "The baseline outperforms state-of-the-art subjectivity classification for the news domain.",
        "- We provide a new annotated dataset for Arabic tweet SSA.",
        "- We employ a random graph walk algorithm to ex",
        "pand SSA lexicons, leading to improvements for SSA for Arabic tweets.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys related work; section 3 introduces some of the challenges associated with Arabic SSA; section 4 describes the lexicons we used; section 5 presents the experimental setup and results; and section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work."
