        "In recent years, microblogging has been an attractive new target for sentiment analysis.",
        "The question studied in this paper is how the methods used for ?standard?",
        "newspaper text can be transferred to mi-croblogs.",
        "We focused on the Twitter network because of its widespread use, and because Twitter communication, in response to emerging issues, is fast and especially ad hoc, making it an effective platform for the sharing and discussion of crisis-related information (Bruns/Burgess, 2011).",
        "Furthermore, Twitter is characterized by a high topicality of content (Milstein al., 2008).",
        "Specifically, we present experiments involving two sentiment analysis systems that both employ a combination of polarity lexicon and sentiment composition rules: (i) SentiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2012), a system that is geared toward short social-media text, and (ii) SO-CAL (Taboada et al., 2011), ?Semantic Orientation Calculator?, a general-purpose system that was designed primarily to work on the level of complete texts.",
        "While both are lexicon-based approaches, there are certain differences in the roles of the various submodules.",
        "For our purposes here, it is important that SentiStrength was designed to cope specifically with ?user-generated content?.",
        "Among the features of the system, as stated by Thelwall et al., the following four are especially important for tweets: (i) a simple spelling correction algorithm deletes repeated letters when the word is not found in the dictionary; (ii) repeated letters lead to a boost in sentiment value; (iii) an emoticon list supplements the polarity lexicon; (iv) positive sentences ending in an exclamation mark receive an additional boost, and multiple exclamation marks further strengthen the polarity.",
        "SO-CAL, on the other hand, does not include social-media-specific measures.",
        "In contrast, it was designed for determining semantic orientation on the text level; in our experiments here, we are thus using it for the non-intended purpose of sentence-level sentiment, on tweet ?sentences?.",
        "Next, we review related work on twitter sentiment analysis (Section 2), and describe the data sets for our experiments in Section 3.",
        "Then we investigate the relative performance of SentiStrength and SO-CAL on newspaper text and on tweets (Section 4), including experiments with preprocessing steps.",
        "In Section 5, we present observations from a qualitative evaluation, and we interpret the results and conclude in Section 6."

        "Following the work on ?standard?",
        "text, sentiment classification on tweets is often treated as a two-step task, e.g., (Barbosa/Feng, 2010): subjectivity classification followed by polarity classification.",
        "For subjectivity classification, (Pak/Paroubek, 2010) found that the distribution of POS tags is a useful feature, due to, for example, the presence of modal verbs in subjective tweets.",
        "For polarity assignment, one approach is to automatically build large sets of training data and then train classifiers on token n-grams; in this vein, (Pak/Paroubek, 2010) found that in their approach, bigrams outperform unigrams and trigrams, and they report f-measures around 0.6 for the three-way pos/neg/neutral classification.",
        "The other, non-learning, approach is to rely on a polarity wordlist (or a collection of several, as in (Joshi et al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2012)).",
        "Mukherjee et al. report an accuracy of 66.69% for pos/neg, and 56.17% for pos/neg/neut classification.",
        "Typical preprocessing steps employed by the approaches discussed are the correction of misspellings, the replacement of URLs and hashtags, the translation of emoticons and of slang words.",
        "Sometimes, stop word removal and stemming is used; sometimes deliberately not.",
        "Few authors evaluate the influence of the various measures; one exception is (Mukherjee et al., 2012).",
        "A recent branch of research deals with fine-grained target-specific analysis (as proposed recently by (Jiang et al., 2011)).",
        "In our work, however, we tackle the more coarse-grained problem of assigning a single sentiment value to a complete tweet.",
        "However, we will return to the issue of target-specificity in our conclusions.",
        "An interesting result from analysing the state of the art is that apparently no consensus has been reached yet on the question of ?extra difficulty?",
        "of tweet sentiment analysis.",
        "While everybody agrees that tweets are noisy and can pose considerable difficulty to any standard linguistically-inspired analysis tool, it is not clear to what extent this is a problem for sentiment analysis.",
        "Some authors argue that the noise renders the task more difficult than the analysis of longer text, while others maintain that the brevity of tweets is in fact an advantage, because ?",
        "as (Bermingham/Smeaton, 2010) put it, ?the short document length introduces a succinctness to the content?, and thus ?the focused nature of the text and higher density of sentiment-bearing terms may benefit automated sentiment analysis techniques.?",
        "In their evaluation, the classification of microblogs indeed yields better results than that of blogs.",
        "In correspondence with this open question, there are only few investigations so far on the performance differences for existing sentiment tools operating on newspaper versus social media text.",
        "To shed more light on the issue, we chose to run a set of comparative experiments with the two aforementioned lexicon/rule-based systems, on both newspaper and twitter corpora."
