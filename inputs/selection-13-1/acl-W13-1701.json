        "In Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), language impairments are common, but not universal (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).",
        "Whether these language impairments are distinct from those in Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is an unresolved issue (Williams et al., 2008; Kjelgaard and Tager-Flusberg, 2001).",
        "Accurate and detailed characterization of these impairments is important not only for resolving this issue, but also for diagnostic practice and remediation.",
        "Language ability is typically assessed with structured instruments (?tests?)",
        "that elicit brief, easy to ?This research was supported in part by NIH NIDCD award R01DC012033 and NSF award #0826654.",

        "For example, the CELF-4 includes nineteen multi-item sub-tests with tasks such as object naming, word definition, reciting the days of the week, or repeating sentences (Semel et al., 2003).",
        "Researchers are beginning to discuss the limits of structured instruments in terms of which language impairments they tap into and how well they do so, and are advocating the potential benefits of language sample analysis ?",
        "an-alyzing natural language samples ?",
        "to complement structured assessment, specifically for language assessment in ASD where pragmatic and social communication issues are paramount yet are hard to assess in a conventional test format (e.g. Tager-Flusberg et al. 2009).",
        "However, language sample analysis faces two labor-intensive steps: transcription and detailed coding of the transcripts.",
        "To illustrate the latter, consider the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) (Miller and Chapman, 1985; Miller et al., 2011), which is the de-facto standard choice by clinicians looking to code elicited language samples.",
        "SALT comprises a scheme for coding transcripts of recorded speech, together with software that tallies these codes, computes scores describing utterance length and error counts, and compares these scores with normative samples.",
        "SALT codes indicate bound morphemes, edits (which are referred to in the clinical literature as ?mazes?",
        "), and several types of errors in transcripts of natural language, e.g., omitted or inappropriate words.",
        "Although this has not been formally documented, our experience with SALT coding has shown that the codes vary in terms of: 1) difficulty of manual coding ?",
        "e.g., relatively subtle pragmatic errors versus overgeneralization or marking bound morphemes;",
        "2) utility for identifying particular disorders; and 3) difficulty of automating the code.",
        "This raises an important question: Is there a combination of codes that jointly discriminate well between relevant diagnostic groups, and at the same time are either easy to code manually or can in principle be automated?",
        "This paper explores, first, how well the various manual SALT codes classify certain diagnostic groups; and, second, whether we can automate manual codes that are of diagnostic utility.",
        "Our goal is limited: it is not the automation of all SALT codes, but the automation of those that in combination are of high diagnostic utility.",
        "Automating all SALT codes is substantially more challenging; yet, we note that even when some of these codes do not aid in classifying groups, they nevertheless may be of importance for developing remediation strategies for individual children.",
        "We are particularly interested in the impact of Autism in addition to language impairments for the utility of particular SALT codes.",
        "The diagnostic groups are carefully chosen to be pairwise matched either on language abilities or on autism symptomatology, thus enabling a precise, ?surgical?",
        "determination of the degrees to which SALT codes reflect language-specific vs. autism-specific factors.",
        "Specifically, the groups include children with ASD with language impairment (ALI); ASD with no language impairment (ALN); SLI alone; and typically developing (TD), which is strictly defined to exclude any neurodevelopmental disorder.",
        "The TD and ALN groups, as well as the ALI and SLI groups, are matched on language and overall cognitive abilities, while the ALN and ALI groups are matched on autism symptomatology but not on language and overall cognitive abilities; all groups are matched on chronological age.",
        "Regarding our algorithmic approach, we note that automatic detection of relatively subtle errors may be exceedingly difficult, but perhaps such subtle errors are less critical for diagnosis than more obvious ones.",
        "Most prior work in grammaticality detection in spoken language has focused on specialized detectors (e.g., Caines and Buttery 2010; Has-sanali and Liu 2011), such as misuse of particular verb constructions rather than coarser detectors for the presence of diverse classes of errors.",
        "We demonstrate that these specialized error detectors can break down when confronted with real world dialogue, and that in general, the features in these detectors restricts their utility in detecting other sorts of errors.",
        "We implement a detector to automatically extract coarse SALT codes from an uncoded transcript.",
        "This detector only depends upon part of speech tags, as opposed to the parse features that are often used in grammaticality detectors.",
        "In most cases, these automatically extracted codes enable us to distinguish between diagnostic groups more effectively than do features that can be extracted trivially from an uncoded transcript.",
        "As far as we know, researchers have not previously considered the utility of grammatical error codes to identify ASD or SLI.",
        "Prudhommeaux and Rouhizadeh (2012), however, found that automatically extracted pragmatic features are useful for identifying children with ASD, among children both with and without SLI.",
        "Gabani et al. (2009) found that features derived from language models are useful for distinguishing between children with and without a language impairment, both in monolingual English speakers, and in children who are bilingual in English and Spanish.",
        "Improving the characterization of a child's language impairments is a prerequisite to developing a sound plan for language training and education for that child.",

        "We reimplement both the rule based and statistical detectors proposed by Hassanali and Liu, and apply it to our data, with three modifications.",
        "The first two are minor: 1) we substitute the Charniak-Johnson reranking parser (2005) for Charniak's original parser (Charniak, 2000), and 2) we use the scikit multinomial naive bayes classifier (Pedregosa et al., 2011) instead of the one in WEKA (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "The third difference is that we use these detectors to identify SALT error codes rather than the errors these classifiers were originally built to detect.",

        "would be [EW] because of the otiose 3rd per",

        "For example, to detect utterances with either [EW] or [OM] errors, we pool the detectors for the analogous error codes: ?misuse of -ing participle?, ?subject-auxilliary agreement?, and ?subject-verb agreement?.",
        "There are three factors that may explain the poor performance observed with most of Hassanali and Liu's error detectors when used with our data.",
        "The first is that the three SALT codes we try to detect ([EW], [OM], and [OW]) capture a wider variety of errors than the six in Hassanali and Liu's system.",
        "This could account for the low recall.",
        "Second, there are many utterances in our data that Hassanali and Liu's system would label an error, but which are not marked with any SALT error codes.",
        "For example, if the examiner asks the child what she is doing, ?eating spaghetti?",
        "is a faultless response, even though it is missing both the subject and auxiliary verb.",
        "Such utterances may account for the low precision.",
        "Finally, most of Hassanali and Liu's sub-detectors depend upon features describing the presence or absence of specific structures in the parses of the input.",
