        "Grammatical error correction for language learners has recently attracted increasing interest in the natural language processing (NLP) community.",
        "Grammatical error correction has the potential to create commercially viable software tools for the large number of students around the world who are studying a foreign language, in particular the large number of students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL).",
        "The success of statistical methods in NLP over the last two decades can largely be attributed to advances in machine learning and the availability of large, annotated corpora that can be used to train and evaluate statistical models for various NLP tasks.",
        "The biggest obstacle for grammatical error correction has been that until recently, there was no large, annotated corpus of learner text that could have served as a standard resource for empirical approaches to grammatical error correction (Leacock et al., 2010).",
        "The existing annotated learner corpora were all either too small or proprietary and not available to the research community.",
        "That is why we decided to create the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a large, annotated corpus of learner texts that is freely available for research purposes.",
        "The corpus was built in collaboration with the Centre for English Language Communication (CELC) at NUS.",
        "NUCLE consists of about 1,400 student essays from undergraduate university students at NUS with a total of over one million words which are completely annotated with error tags and corrections.",
        "All annotations and corrections have been performed by professional English instructors.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, NUCLE is the first annotated learner corpus of this size that is freely available for research purposes.",
        "However, although the NUCLE corpus has been available for almost two years now, there has been no reference paper that describes the details of the corpus.",
        "That makes it harder for other researchers to start working with the NUCLE corpus.",
        "In this paper, we address this need by giving a detailed description of the NUCLE corpus, including a description of the annotation schema, the data collection and annotation process, and various statistics on the distribution of grammatical errors in the corpus.",
        "Most importantly, we report on an unpublished study of annotator agreement for grammatical error correction that was conducted prior to creating",
        "the NUCLE corpus.",
        "The study gives some insights regarding the difficulty of the annotation task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section explains the annotation schema that was used for labeling grammatical errors.",
        "Section 3 reports the results of the inter-annotator agreement study.",

        "Before starting the corpus creation, we had to develop a set of annotation guidelines.",
        "This was done in a pilot study before the actual corpus was created.",
        "Three instructors from CELC participated in the pilot study.",
        "The instructors annotated a small set of student essays that had been collected by CELC previously.",
        "The annotation was performed using an in-house, online annotation tool, calledWriting, Annotation, and Marking Platform (WAMP), that was developed by the NUS NLP group specially for creating the NUCLE corpus.",
        "The annotation tool allows the annotators to work over the Internet using a web browser.",
        "Figure 1 shows a screen shot of the WAMP interface.",
        "Annotators can browse through a batch of essays that has been assigned to them and perform the following tasks:",

        "Correct errors by typing the correction into a text box.",
        "?",
        "Comment to give additional explanations if",
        "necessary.",
        "We wanted to impose as few constraints as possible on the annotators and to give them an experience that would closely resemble their usual marking using pen and paper.",
        "Therefore, the WAMP annotation tool allows annotators to select arbitrary text spans, including overlapping text spans.",
        "After some annotation trials, we decided to use a tag set which had been developed by CELC in a previous study.",
        "Some minor modifications were made to the original tag set based on the feedback of the annotators.",
        "The result of the pilot study was a tag set of 27 error categories which are grouped into 13 categories.",
        "The tag set is listed in Table 1.",
        "It is important to note that our annotation schema not only labels each grammatical error with an error category, but also requires an annotator to provide a suitable correction for the error as well.",
        "The annotators were asked to provide a correction that would fix the grammatical error if the selected text span containing the grammatical error is replaced with the correction.",
        "If multiple alternative text spans could be selected, the annotators were asked to select the minimal text span so that minimal changes were made to arrive at the corrected text.",
        "We chose to use the tag set in Table 1 since this tag set was developed and used in a previous study at CELC and was found to be a suitable tag set.",
        "Furthermore, the tag set offers a reasonable compromise in terms of its complexity.",
        "With 27 error categories, it is sufficiently fine-grained to enable meaningful statistics for different error categories, yet not as complex as other tag sets that are much larger in size."

        "This left us with 96 essays with double annotation.",
        "Comparing two sets of annotation is complicated by the fact that the set of annotations that corrects an input text to a corrected output text is ambiguous (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012).",
        "In other words, it is possible that two different sets of annotations produce the same correction.",
        "For example, one annotator could choose to select a whole phrase as one error, while the other annotator selects each word individually.",
        "Our annotation guidelines ask annotators to select the minimum span that is necessary to correct the error, but we do not enforce any hard constraints and different annotators can have a different perception of where an error starts or ends.",
        "An especially difficult case is the annotation of omission errors, for example missing articles.",
        "Selecting a range of whitespace characters is difficult for annotators, especially if the annotation tool is web-based (as whitespace is variable in web pages).",
        "We asked annotators to select the previous or next word and include them into the suggested correction.",
        "To change conduct survey to conduct a survey, the annotator could change conduct to conduct a, or change survey to a survey.",
        "If we only compare the exact text spans selected by the annotators when measuring agreement, these different ways to select the context could easily cause us to conclude that the annotators disagree when they in fact agree on the corrected phrase.",
        "This would lead to an underestimation of annotator agreement.",
        "To address this problem, we perform a simple text span normalization.",
        "First, we ?grow?",
        "the selected context to align with whitespace boundaries.",
        "For example, if an annotator just selected the last character e of the word use and provided ed as a correction, we grow this annotation so that the whole word use is selected and used is the correction.",
        "Second, we tokenize the text and ?trim?",
        "the context by removing tokens at the start and end that are identical in the original and the correction.",
        "Finally, the annotations are ?projected?",
        "onto the individual tokens they span, i.e., an annotation that spans a phrase of multiple to",
        "kens is broken up into multiple token-level annotations.",
        "We align the tokens in the original text span and the tokenized correction string using minimum edit distance.",
        "Now, we can compare two annotations in a more meaningful way at the token level.",
        "Table 2 shows a tokenized example sentence from the annotator agreement study with annotations from two different annotators.",
        "Annotator A and B agree that the first three words This, phenomenon, and opposes and the final period are correct and do not need any correction.",
        "The annotators also agree that the word real is part of a word form (Wform) error and should be replaced with reality.",
        "However, they disagree with respect to the article the: annotator A believes there is an article error (ArtOrDet) and that the article has to be deleted while annotator B believes that the article is acceptable in this position.",
        "The example shows that annotator agreement can be measured with respect to three different criteria: whether there is an error, what type of error it is, and how the error should be corrected.",
        "Accordingly, we analyze annotator agreement under three different conditions: ?",
        "Identification Agreement of tagged tokens regardless of error category or correction.",
        "?",
        "Classification Agreement of error category, given identification.",
        "?",
        "Exact Agreement of error category and correction, given identification.",
        "In the identification task, we are interested to see how well annotators agree on whether something is a grammatical error or not.",
        "In the example above, annotators A and B agree on 5 out of 6 tokens and disagree on one token (the).",
        "That results in an identification agreement of 5/6 = 83%.",
        "In the classification task, we investigate how well annotators agree on the type of error, given that both have tagged the token as an error.",
        "In the example, the classification agreement is 100% as both annotator A and B tagged the word real as a word form (Wform) error.",
        "Finally, for the exact task, annotators are considered to agree if they agree on the error category and the correction given that they both have tagged the token as an error.",
        "In the example, the exact agreement is 100% as both annotators give the same error category Wform and the same correction reality for the word real.",
        "We use the popular Cohen's Kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) to measure annotator agreement between annotators.",
        "Cohen's Kappa is defined as",
        "where Pr(a) is the probability of agreement and Pr(e) is the probability of chance agreement.",
        "We can estimate Pr(a) and Pr(e) from the double annotated essays through maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "For two annotators A and B, the probability of",
        "where the number of agreed tokens is counted as described above, and the total number of tokens is the total token count of the subset of jointly annotated documents.",
        "The probability of chance agreement is computed as",
        "events of annotator A tagging a token as ?error?",
        "or ?no error?",
        "respectively.",
        "We make use of the fact that both annotators perform the task independently.",
        "The probabilities Pr(B = 1) and Pr(B = 0) are computed analogously.",
        "The chance agreement for this task is quite high, as the number of un-annotated tokens is much higher than the number of annotated tokens.",
        "Cohen's Kappa coefficients for the three annotators and the average Kappa coefficient are listed in Table 3.",
        "We observe that the Kappa scores are relatively low and that there is a substantial amount of variability in the Kappa coefficients; annotator A and B show a higher agreement with each other than they do with annotator C. According to Landis and Koch (1977), Kappa scores between 0.21 and 0.40 are considered fair, and scores between 0.41 and 0.60 are considered moderate.",
        "The average Kappa score for identification can therefore only be considered fair and the Kappa scores for classification and exact agreement are moderate.",
        "Thus, an interesting result of the pilot study was that annotators find it harder to agree on whether a word is grammatically correct than agreeing on the type of error or how it should be corrected.",
        "The annotator agreement study shows that grammatical error correction, especially grammatical error identification, is a difficult problem.",
        "Our findings support previous research on annotator agreement that has shown that grammatical error correction is a challenging task (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Lee et al., 2009).",
        "Tetreault and Chodorow (2008) report a Kappa score of 0.63 which in their words ?shows the difficulty of this task and also show how two highly trained raters can produce very different judgments.?",
        "An interesting related work is (Lee et al., 2009) which investigates the annotation of article and noun number errors.",
        "The annotation is performed with either a single sentence context only or the five preceding sentences.",
        "The agreement between annotators increases when more context is given, from a Kappa score of 0.55 to a Kappa score of 0.60.",

        "Finally, the HOO 2011 shared task (Dale and Kil-garriff, 2011) released an annotated corpus of fragments from academic papers written by non-native speakers and published in a conference or workshop of the Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "The corpus uses the annotation schema from the CLC.",
        "Comparing the data set with NUCLE, the HOO 2011 data set is much smaller (about 20,000 words for training and testing, respectively) and represents a specific writing genre (NLP papers).",
        "The NUCLE corpus is much larger and covers a broader range of topics."

        "We have presented the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a large, annotated corpus of learner English.",
        "The corpus contains over one million words which are completely annotated with grammatical errors and corrections.",
        "The NUCLE corpus is freely available for research purposes.",
        "We have also reported an inter-annotator agreement study for grammatical error correction.",
        "The study shows that grammatical error correction is a difficult task, even for humans.",
        "The error statistics from the NUCLE corpus show that learner errors are generally sparse and have a long-tail distribution."
