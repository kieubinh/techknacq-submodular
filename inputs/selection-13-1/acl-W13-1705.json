        "We present the first system developed for automated grading of high school essays written in Swedish.",
        "The system uses standard text quality indicators and is able to compare vocabulary and grammar to large reference corpora of blog posts and newspaper articles.",
        "The system is evaluated on a corpus of 1 702 essays, each graded independently by the student's own teacher and also in a blind regrading process by another teacher.",
        "We show that our system's performance is fair, given the low agreement between the two human graders, and furthermore show how it could improve efficiency in a practical setting where one seeks to identify incorrectly graded essays."

        "Previous work on AES has primarily focused on English texts, and to the best of our knowledge no AES system for Swedish essays has been published.",
        "We exploit some peculiarities of the Swedish language, such as its compounding nature, to design new features for classification.",
        "We also use constructions in the shape of hybrid n-grams (Tsao and Wible, 2009) extracted from large corpora in the classification.",

        "The essays were originally graded by the student's own teacher.",
        "In total, 1 702 essays have all the information we require: digitized text and the two grades.",
        "The size of the corpus is 1 116 819 tokens, or an average of 656 per essay.",
        "The essays have been automatically annotated with lemma and part of speech (PoS) information using Stagger (?stling, 2012).",
        "There are four grades: IG (fail), G (pass), VG (pass with distinction) and MVG (excellent).",
        "Hinnerich et al. (2011) found that the agreement between the two human graders is rather low, and in the set of essays used in this study only 780 (45.8%) of the 1 702 essays received the same grade by both",

        "grades are generally lower.",
        "The disagreement is also more severe for the grades at the extremes of the scale.",
        "It is important to note that the grading guidelines for the national exams do not focus exclusively on the quality of the language used, but rather on the ability of the student to produce a coherent and convincing argument, understanding and relating to other texts, or describing personal experiences.",
        "Some work has been carried out using high-level features in automated essay scoring.",
        "Milt-sakaki and Kukich (2004) use some manual annotation to explore the role of coherence, and Attali and Burstein (2005) automatically analyze the overall structure of essays.",

        "We will, however, focus on form rather than content.",
        "One important reason for this is that our corpus of essays is spread out over 19 different topics (in several cases with as few as 20?30 essays each), where the type of text expected can vary considerably between topics."

        "Some further features that did not contribute much to grading accuracy were tried, but will be omitted from this discussion.",
        "Text length Since the essays are composed in a classroom setting with a fixed amount of time allotted (five hours), a student's fluency in writing is directly mirrored in the length of an essay, which becomes the feature that most strongly correlates with grade.",
        "While one might want to exclude the length from consideration in the grading process, it is important to keep this correlation in mind since other measures may correlate with length, and therefore indirectly correlate with essay grade without contributing any new information.",
        "Average word length The average number of letters per word also correlates with grade but only weakly with the length (in words).",
        "It does however correlate strongly with the distribution of parts of speech, primarily pronouns (which tend to be short) and nouns (which tend to be long, particularly since Swedish is a compounding language).",

        "At the same time, the measure is mostly independent of text length.",
