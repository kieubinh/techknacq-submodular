        "A Vector Space Model (VSM) is a simple, yet effective, method to measure similarities between documents or utterances, which has been utilized in the educational testing field.",
        "For example, VSM has been applied to detect students?",
        "off-topic essays (Higgins et al., 2006) and to automatically score essays (Attali and Burstein, 2004).",
        "The following three steps are required to use VSM for automated assessment: (1) a collection of responses are selected from each score category to construct reference vectors (RV); (2) for an input response under scoring, the same vectorization method used for constructing RVs is applied to compute an input vector (IV); (3) similarities between this IV and the RVs for all score categories are computed as features reflecting vocabulary usage and content relevancy, including a widely used feature, the cosine similarity between the IV and the RV for the highest score category.",
        "Clearly, the quality of VSM-derived features depends on the proper training of RVs.",
        "In language assessment, we tend to use a large number of manually scored responses to build RVs for each testing question (called item in the assessment field).",
        "However, this raises an issue: the requirement of manual scoring of these responses by human raters.",
        "Also, for large-scale assessments administrated globally, a high number of items are typically administered to both ensure the assessment security and support the large volume of test-takers.",
        "To address this challenge of application of VSM, we will describe our solutions based on applying unsupervised learning methods in this paper.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related previous research; Section 3 describes the English assessment, the data used in our experiments, and the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system used; Section 4 reports",
        "the three experiments we conducted; and Section 5 discusses our findings and plans for future research."
