        "Somewhat surprisingly, a classifier relying on purely lexical features performed very well and proved difficult to outperform significantly using various combinations of feature spaces.",

        "We describe the National Research Council Canada's submissions to the Native Language Identification 2013 shared task (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "Our submissions rely on fairly straightforward statistical modelling techniques, applied to various feature spaces representing lexical and syntactic information.",
        "Our most successful submission was actually a combination of models trained on different sets of feature spaces using a simple majority vote.",
        "Much of the work on Natural Language Processing is motivated by the desire to have machines that can help or replace humans on language-related tasks.",
        "Many tasks such as topic or genre classification, entity extraction, disambiguation, are fairly straightforward for humans to complete.",
        "Machines typically trade-off some performance for ease of application and reduced cost.",
        "Equally fascinating are tasks that seem non-trivial to humans, but on which machines, through appropriate statistical analysis, discover regularities and dependencies that are far from obvious to humans.",
        "Examples may include categorizing text by author gender (Koppel et al., 2003) or detecting whether a text is an original or a translation (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006).",
        "This is one motivation for addressing the problem of identifying the native language of an author in this shared task.",

        "We decided to use a straightforward and state-of-the-art statistical classifier, in order to focus our attention on the combination of features and models rather than on the design of the classifier.",
        "We used freely available implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVM) provided in SVM-light (Joachims, 1999) and SVM-perf (Joachims, 2006).",
        "SVM performance may be influenced by at least two important factors: the choice of the kernel and the trade-off parameter ?C?.",
        "In our experiments, we did not observe any gain from using either polynomial or RBF kernels.",
        "All results below are therefore obtained with linear models.",
        "Similarly, we investigated the optimization of parameter ?C?",
        "on a held-out validation set, but found out that the resulting performance was not consistently significantly better than that provided by the default value.",
        "As a consequence our results were obtained using the SVM-light default.",
        "One important issue in this shared task was to handle multiple classes (the 11 languages).",
        "There are essentially two easy approaches to handle single label, multiclass classification with binary SVM: one-versus-all and one-versus-one.",
        "We adopted the one-versus-all setting, combined with a calibration step.",
        "We first trained 11 classifiers using the documents for each language in turn as ?positive?",
        "examples, and the documents for the remaining 10 languages as negative examples.",
        "The output score for each class-specific SVM model was then mapped into a probability using isotonic regression with the pair-adjacent violators (PAV) algorithm (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2002).",
        "A test document is then assigned to the class with the highest probability."

        "Part-of-speech ngrams: The texts were tagged with the Stanford tagger v. 3.02 using the largest and best (bidirectional) model.",
        "Note that the language in a couple of documents was so poor that the tagger was unable to complete, and we reverted to a slightly weaker (left three words) model for those.",

        "Our goal is to capture phenomena such as preposition selection which might be influenced by the native language of the writer.",
        "In order to reduce sparsity, each observed dependency is used to generate three features: one feature for the full lexicalized dependency relation; one feature for the head (which generalizes over all observed modifiers); one feature for the modifier (which generalizes over all possible heads).",
        "For instance, in the sentence ?they participate to one 's appearance?, the parser extracts the following dependency: ?prepto(participate,appearance)?.",
        "It yields three features ?prepto(participate,appearance)?, ?prepto(participate,X)?",
        "and ?prepto(X,appearance)?.",
        "We experimented with all three feature types, but the systems used for the",
        "official evaluation results only used the last two (head and modifier features.)",
        "Note that while these features can capture long distance dependencies in theory, they significantly overlap with word ngram features in practice.",
        "For each feature space, we used a choice of two weighting schemes inspired by SMART (Manning et al., 2008): ltc: log of the feature count, combined with the log inverse document frequency (idf), with a cosine normalization; nnc: straight feature count, no idf, with cosine normalization.",
