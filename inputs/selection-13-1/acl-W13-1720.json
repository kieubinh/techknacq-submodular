        "We demonstrate that even using word level n-grams as features, and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier can yield nearly 80% accuracy.",
        "We observe that the accuracy of a binary-based word level n-gram representation (~80%) is much better than the performance of a frequency-based word level n-gram representation (~20%).",

        "Native language identification (NLI) is an emerging field in the natural language processing community and machine learning community (Koppel et al., 2005; Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "It is a task to identify the native language (L1) of an author based on his/her texts written in a second language.",
        "The application of NLI can bring many benefits, such as providing a learner adaptive feedback of their writing errors based on the native language for educational purposes (Koppel et al., 2005; Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "NLI can be viewed as a classification problem.",
        "In a classification problem, a classifier is first trained using a set of training examples.",
        "Each training example is represented as a set of features, along with a class label.",
        "After a classifier is trained, the classifier is evaluated using a testing set (Murphy, 2012).",
        "Good data representation often yields a better classification performance (Murphy, 2012).",
        "Often time, the simpler representations might produce better performance.",
        "In this work, we demonstrate that a binary-based word level n-gram representation yields much better performance than a frequency-based word level n-gram representation.",
        "In addition, we observed that removing punctuation marks in an essay does not make too much difference in a classification performance.",
        "The contributions of this paper are to demonstrate the usefulness of a binary-based word level n-gram representation, and a very simple baseline system without the need of removing punctuation marks and stop words.",
        "This paper is organized as the following.",
        "In Section 2, we present related literatures.",
        "TOEFL11 data set is introduced in Section 3.",

        "The work by Koppel et al. (2005) is the first study to investigate native language identification.",
        "They use the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE).",
        "They set up this task as a classification problem studied in machine learning community.",
        "They use three types of features: function words, character n-gram, errors and idiosyncrasies, e.g. spelling and grammatical errors.",
        "For errors and idiosyncrasies, they used Microsoft Office Word to detect those errors.",
        "Their features were evaluated on a subset of the ICLE corpus, including essays sampled from five native languages (Russian, Czech, Bulgarian, French and Spanish) with 10- fold cross validation.",
        "They achieve an accuracy of 80.2% by combining all of the features and using a support vector machine as the classification algorithm.",
        "In addition, Tsur and Rappoport (2007) show that using character n-gram only on the ICLE can yield an accuracy of 66%.",
        "The work from Kochmar (2011) identifies an author's native language using error analysis.",
        "She suggests that writers with different native languages generate different grammatical error patterns.",
        "Instead of using ICLE, this work uses a different corpus, English learner essays from the Cambridge Learner Corpus.",
        "She uses SVM on manually annotated spelling and grammatical errors along with lexical features.",
        "Most of the systems described in NLI literature reach good performance in predicting an author's native language, using character n-gram and part of speech n-gram as features (Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "In recent years, various studies have started to look into complex features in order to improve the performance.",
        "Wong and Dras (2009) use contrastive analysis, a systematic analysis of structural similarities and differences in a pair of languages.",
        "A writer's native language influences the target language they aim to learn.",
        "They explore the impact of three English as Second Language (ESL) error types, subject-verb disagreement, noun-number disagreement and determiner errors, and use a subset of ICLE with 7 languages.",
        "However, although the determiner error feature seems useful, when it is combined with a baseline model of lexical features, the classification performance is not significantly improved (Wong and Dras, 2009).",
        "Wong and Dras (2011) use complex features such as production rules from two parsers and reranking features into the classification framework, incorporating lexical features of Koppel et al. (2005).",
        "They achieve a classification performance of 81.71% on the 7-native-languages NLI, slightly better than 80.2% accuracy of the original Koppel et al. (2005).",
        "Note that although the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) is used in most of the NLI studies, ICLE has been known to have fewer essays, and a skewed distribution toward topics of essays (Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "In addition, even though there are 16 native languages in ICLE, as each language has different numbers of essays, most work often uses different subsets of 7 native languages, which makes comparison harder across different studies (Blanchard et al., 2013).",
        "The NLI shared task 2013 provides a new data set, namely the TOEFL11 (Blanchard et al., 2013), which addresses these issues.",
        "As previously discussed, complex features do not necessarily improve classification accuracy.",
        "In this work, we use TOEFL11 to investigate the classification performance using simple word n-gram based features."

        "There could be many ways to represent an essay by word level n-grams.",

        "In this representation, an essay is a vector whose elements are the frequency of different word n-grams in the essay.",
        "Another possible representation is to use binary representation, i.e., 1 indicates this word n-gram is in this essay, 0 indicates this word n-gram is not in this essay.",
