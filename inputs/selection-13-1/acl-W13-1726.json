        "We explored the task of Native Language Identification using a range of different feature types in the context of the NLI Shared Task 2013.",

        "We then explored the contribution and usefulness of some more elaborate, linguistically motivated feature types for the given task.",
        "Using an ensemble model combining features based on POS, dependency, parse trees as well as lemma realization, complexity and suffix information features, we were able to outperform the high accuracy achieved by the surface-based recurring n-grams features alone.",
        "The exploration of linguistically-informed features thus is not just of analytic interest but can also make a quantitative difference for obtaining state-of-the-art performance.",
        "In terms of future work, we have started exploring the various feature types in depth to better understand the causalities and correlations behind the results obtained.",
        "We also intend to explore more complex linguistically motivated features further, such as features based on syntactic alternations as used in Krivanek (2012).",
        "Studying such variation of linguistic properties, instead of recording their presence as we mostly did in this exploration, also stands to provide a more directly interpretable perspective on the feature space identified as effective for NLI."
