        "Recently, a growing number of applications are taking advantage of author profiling to improve their services.",
        "For instance, in security applications (Ab-basi and Chen, 2005; Estival et al., 2007) to help limit the search space of, for example, the author of an email threat, or in marketing where the demography information about customers is important to predict behaviors or to develop new products.",
        "Particularly, author profiling is a task of identifying several demographic characteristics of an author from a written text.",
        "Demographic groups can be identified by age, gender, geographic origin, level of education and native language.",
        "The idea of identifying the native language based on the manner of speaking and writing a second language is borrowed from Second Language Acquisition (SLA), where this is known as language transfer.",
        "The theory of language transfer says that the first language (L1) influences the way that a second language (L2) is learned (Ahn, 2011; Tsur and Rappoport, 2007).",
        "According to this theory, if we learn to identify what is being transfered from one language to another, then it is possible to identify the native language of an author given a text written in L2.",
        "For instance, a Korean native speaker can be identified by the errors in the use of articles a and the in his English writings due to the lack of similar function words in Korean.",
        "As we see, error identification is very common in automatic approaches, however, a previous analysis and understanding of linguistic markers are often required in such approaches.",
        "In this paper we investigate if it is possible to build native language classifiers that are not based on the analysis of common grammatical errors or in deeper semantic analysis.",
        "On the contrary, we want to find a simple set of features related to n-grams of words, characters, and POS tags that can be used in an effective way.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, almost all the works related to L1 identification use fine grained POS tags, but do not look into whether a coarse grained POS tagset could help in their work.",
        "Here, we explore the use of coarse grained Universal POS tags with 12 POS categories in the NLI task and compare the result with the fine grained Penn TreeBank (PTB) POS tags with 36 POS categories.",
        "Moreover, we also investigate how the system works when perplexity values are used as features in identifying native languages.",
        "Using an ensemble based approach that combines four different models built by various combinations of feature sets of n-grams of words, characters, and POS tags, and perplexity values, we identify the native language of the author, over 11 different languages, with an accuracy close to 80% and 75% in development and test dataset respectively."

      "text": [
        "The first known work about native language identification appears in 2005 (Koppel et al., 2005).",
        "In their study, the authors experimented with three types of features, i.e. function words, letter n-grams, errors and idiosyncrasies.",
        "But their analysis was focused on the identification of common errors.",
        "They found that using a combination of all the features in a Support Vector Machine (SVM), they can obtain an accuracy of 80% in the classification of 5 different native languages.",
        "As in this first study, analyzing errors is common in native language identification methods, since it is a straightforward adaptation of how this task is performed in SLA.",
        "For instance, Wong and Dras (2009) investigate the use of error types such as disagreement on subject-verb and noun-number, as well as misuse of determiners to show that error analysis is helpful in this task.",
        "But their results could not outperform the results obtained by Koppel et al. (2005).",
        "They also suggested that analyzing other types of errors might help to improve their approach.",
        "In the same path, Jarvis et al. (2012) investigate a larger variety of errors, for example lexical words and phrase errors, determiner errors, spelling errors, adjective order errors and errors in the use of punctuation marks, among others.",
        "But they also could not achieve results comparable to the previous results in this task.",
        "Since language transfer occurs when grammatical structures from a first language determine the grammatical structures of a second language, the inclusion of function words and dependency parsers as features seem to be helpful to find such transfers as well as error types (Tetreault et al., 2012; Brooke and Hirst, 2011; Wong et al., 2012).",
        "It is common that the analysis of the structure of certain grammatical patterns is also informative to find the use or misuse of well-established grammatical structures (e.g. to distinguish between the use of verb-subject-object, subject-verb-object, and subject-object-verb), in such cases n-grams of POS tags can be used.",
        "Finally, according to Tsur and Rappoport (2007), the transfer of phonemes is useful in identifying the native language.",
        "Even though the phonemes are usually speech features, the authors suggest that this transfer can be captured by the use of character n-grams in the text.",
        "Character n-grams have been proved to be a good feature in author profiling as well since they also capture hints of style, lexical information, use of punctuation and capitalization.",
        "In sum, there are varieties of feature types used in native language identification, most of them combine three to nine types.",
        "Each type aims to capture specific information such as lexical and syntactic information, structural information, idiosyncrasies, or errors."

        "We also compared the accuracy obtained by using the fine grained POS tags and the coarse grained POS tags.",
        "In one of these experiments, we used perplexity values as features to see how effective these features can be in NLI tasks.",
        "Finally, the fifth experiment was an ensemble based approach where we applied a voting scheme to the predictions of the four approaches to get the final result.",

        "In our experiments, we trained the classifier using the training dataset, and using the model we tested the accuracy on the development and test dataset.",
        "We used an SVM multiclass classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2002) with default parameter settings for the machine learning tasks.",
        "We used character n-grams, word n-grams, Parts of Speech (POS) tag n-grams, and perplexity of character trigrams as features.",
        "For all the features except perplexity, we used a TF-IDF weighting scheme.",
        "To reduce the number of features, we selected only the top k features based on the document frequency in the training data.",
        "The provided dataset contained all the sentences in the essays tokenized by using ETS's proprietary tokenizers.",
        "For the POS tags based features, we used two tagsets: Penn TreeBank (PTB) and Universal POS tags.",
        "For PTB POS tags, we tagged the text with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "In order to tag the sentences with Universal POS tags, we mapped the PTB POS tags to universal POS tags using the mapping described by Petrov et al.",
        "(2011).",
        "We also used perplexity values from language models in our experiments.",
        "To generate the language models and compute perplexity, we used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke et al., 2011).",
        "We used training data to generate the language models and train the classifier.",

        "2.",
        "Exp-W2,3Univ3C3: The PTB POS tagset contains 36 fine grained POS categories while the Universal POS tagset contains only 12 coarse POS categories.",
        "In the second experiment, we tried to see how the performance changes when using coarse grained Universal POS categories instead of fine grained PTB POS tags.",
        "Thus, we performed the second experiment with the same settings as the first experiment except we used Universal POS tags instead of PTB POS tags.",
        "Since the total number of Universal POS",
        "trigrams was only 1602, we replaced 6000 PTB POS trigrams with 1602 Universal POS trigrams.",
        "3.",
        "Exp ClassBased: The difference in this experiment from the first one lies in the process of feature selection.",
        "Instead of selecting the top k features from the whole training data, the selection was done considering the top m features for each L1 class present in the training dataset, i.e., we first selected the top m features from each L1 class and combined them for a total of p where p is greater than or equal to m and k. After a number of experiments performed with different combinations of features to train the classifier and testing on the development dataset, we obtained the best result using character trigrams, PTB POS tag bigrams and trigrams, and word bigrams feature sets with 3000, 1000, 1000, and 6000 features from each L1 respectively.",

        "The difference in the approaches used in the first and second experiments was the use of n-grams of different POS tagsets.",
        "The use of coarse grained Universal POS tagset features generalizes the information and loses the discriminating features that the fine grained PTB POS tagset features captures.",
        "For instance, the PTB POS tagset differentiates verbs into six categories while the Universal POS tagset has only one category for that grammatical class.",
        "Because of this, the fine grained POS tagset seems better for identifying the native languages than using a coarse grained POS tagset in most of the cases.",
        "More studies are needed to analyze the cases where Universal POS tagset works better than the fine grained PTB POS tagset.",
        "The difference in accuracies obtained between the first experiment (Exp W2,3PTB3C3) and the third experiment (Exp ClassBased) is more than 6% in the development dataset and more than 3% in the test dataset.",
        "In the test dataset, the third experiment has the highest accuracy for Arabic class and has better accuracy than the first experiment for Telugu class.",
        "The difference between these approaches was the feature selection approach used to create the feature vector.",
        "The results show that in most of the cases selecting the features from the whole dataset achieves better accuracy in identifying native languages compared to using the stratified approach of selecting the features from individual classes.",
        "The main reason behind using the class based feature selection was that we tried to capture some features that are specifically present in one class and not in others.",
        "Since all the texts in our dataset were about one of the eight prompts, and we have a balanced dataset, there was no benefit of doing the class based feature selection approach.",
