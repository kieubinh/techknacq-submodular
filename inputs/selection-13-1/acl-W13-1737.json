        "In automated speech assessment, adaptation of language models (LMs) to test questions is important to achieve high recognition accuracy However, for large-scale language tests, the ordinary supervised training, which uses an expensive and time-consuming manual transcription process, is hard to utilize for LM adaptation.",
        "In this paper, several LM adaptation methods that require either no manual transcription process or just a small amount of transcriptions have been evaluated.",
        "Our experiments suggest that these LM adaptation methods can allow us to obtain considerable recognition accuracy gain with no or low human transcription cost.",

        "Automated speech assessment, a fast-growing area in the speech research field (Eskenazi, 2009), typically uses an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to recognize spontaneous speech responses and use the recognition outputs to generate the features for scoring.",
        "Since the recognition accuracy directly influences the quality of the speech features, especially for the features related to word entities, such as those measuring grammar accuracy and vocabulary richness, it is important to use ASR systems with high recognition accuracy.",
        "Adaptation of language models (LMs) to test responses is an effective method to improve recognition accuracy.",
        "However, it is difficult to only use the ordinary supervised training to adapt LMs to test questions.",
        "First, for high-stake tests administered globally, a very large pool of test questions have to be used to strengthen the tests?",
        "security and validity.",
        "Since a large number of test questions have many possible answers for each question, a large set of audio files needs to be transcribed to cover response content.",
        "Second, due to time and cost constraints, it may not be practical to have a pretest to collect enough speech responses for adaptation purposes.",
        "Therefore, it is important to pursue other methods to obtain LM adaptation data in a faster and lower-cost way than the ordinary supervised training.",
        "As we will review in Section 2, some promising technologies, such as unsupervised training, active learning, and LM adaptation based on Web data, have been utilized in broadcast news recognition, di-alog system, and so on.",
        "In this paper on the LM adaptation task used in automated speech scoring systems, we will report our experiments to obtain LM adaptation data in a faster and more economical way that requires little human involvement.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first such work reported in the automated speech assessment area.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related previous research results; Section 3 describes the English test, the data used in our experiments, and the ASR system used; Section 4 reports the experiments of different methods we tried to obtain LM adaptation data; Section 5 discusses our findings and plans for future research."
