        "Information extracted from these narratives is already being used for clinical research tasks such as automatic phenotype classification for collecting disease cohorts retrospectively (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2013), which can in turn be used for a variety of studies, including pharmacogenomics (Lin et al., 2012; Wilke et al., 2011).",
        "Future applications may use information extracted from the clinical narrative at the point of care to assist physicians in decision-making in a real time fashion.",
        "One of the most interesting and challenging aspects of clinical text is the pervasiveness of temporally grounded information.",
        "This includes a number of clinical concepts which are events with finite time spans (e.g., surgery or x-ray), time expressions (December, postoperatively), and links that relate events to times or other events.",
        "For example, surgery last May relates the time last May with the event surgery via the CONTAINS relation, while Vicodin after surgery relates the medication event Vicodin with the procedure event surgery via the AFTER relation.",
        "There are many potential applications of clinical information extraction that are only possible with an understanding of the ordering and duration of the events in a clinical encounter.",
        "In this work we focus on extracting a particular temporal relation, CONTAINS, that holds between a time expression and an event expression.",
        "This level of representation is based on the computational discourse model of narrative containers (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2011), which are time expressions or events which are central to a section of a text, usually manifested by being relative hubs of temporal relation links.",
        "We argue that containment relations are useful as an intermediate level of granularity between full temporal relation extraction and ?coarse?",
        "temporal bins (Raghavan et al., 2012) like before admission, on admission, and after admission.",
        "Correctly extracting CONTAINS relations will, for example, allow for more accurate placement of events on a timeline, to the resolution possible by the number of time expressions in the document.",
        "We suspect that this finer grained information will also be more useful for downstream applications like coreference, for which coarse information was found to be useful.",

        "Using only the relation to the document creation time would provide too coarse of a timeline resulting in collapsing the three narrative containers (the coarse time bins of Raghavan et al. (2012) would collapse all events into the before admission category).",

        "We performed error analysis on the outputs of the best-performing system (FF+BT+PET+PT in Table 1).",
        "First, we note that the parameter search was optimized for F1.",
        "This resulted in the highest-scoring configuration using a composite kernel with the sum operator, polynomial kernel for the secondary kernel, ?",
        "= 0.5, tree kernel weight (T ) of 0.1, and c = 10.0.",
        "This high value of c and low value of T results in higher precision and lower recall, but there were configurations with lower c and higher T which made the opposite tradeoff, with only marginally worse F1-score.",
        "For the purposes of error analysis, however, this configuration leads to a focus on false negatives.",
        "First, the false positives contained many relations that were legitimately ambiguous or possible annotator errors.",
        "An example ambiguous case is She is currently being treated on the Surgical Service for..., in which the system generates the relation CONTAINS(currently, treated), but the gold standard labels as OVERLAP.",
        "This example is ambiguous because it is not clear from just the linguistic context whether the treatment is wholly contained in the small time window denoted by currently, or whether it started a while ago or will continue into the future.",
        "There are many similar cases where the event is a disease/disorder type, and the specific nature of the disease is important to understanding whether this is a CONTAINS",
        "or OVERLAP relation, specifically understanding whether the disease is chronic or more acute.",
        "Another source of false positives were where the event and time were clearly related, but not with CONTAINS.",
        "In the example reports that she has been having intermittent bleeding since May of 1998, the term since clearly indicates that this is a BEGINS-ON relation between bleeding and May of 1998.",
        "This is a case where having other temporal relation classifiers may be useful, as they can compete and the relation can be assigned to whichever classifier is more confident.",
        "False negatives frequently occurred in contexts where the event and time were far apart.",
        "Syntactic tree kernels were introduced to help improve recall on longer-distance relations, and were successful up to a limit.",
        "However, certain examples are so far apart that the algorithm may have had difficulty sorting noise from important structure.",
        "For example, the system did not find the CONTAINS(October 27, 2010, oophorectomy) relation in the sentence: October 27, 2010, Dr. XXX performed exploratory laparotomy with an transverse colectomy and Dr. YYY performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.",
        "Here, while the date may be part of the same sentence as the event, the syntactic relation between the pair is not what makes the relation; the date is acting as a kind of discourse marker that indicates that the following events are contained.",
        "This suggests that discourse-level features may be useful even for the intra-sentential classification task.",
        "Other false negatives occurred where there was syntactic complexity, even on shorter examples.",
        "The subset tree kernel used here matches complete rule productions, and across complex structure with large productions, the chances of finding similarity decreases substantially.",
        "Thus, events within coordination or separated from the time by clause breaks are more difficult to relate to the time due to the multiple different ways of relating these different syntactic elements.",
        "Finally, there are some examples where the anchor of a narrative container is an event with multiple sub-events.",
        "In these cases, the system performs well at relating a time expression to the anchor event, but may miss the sub-events that are farther away.",
        "This is a case where having an event-event TLINK classifier, then applying deterministic closure rules, would allow a combined system to link the sub-events to the time expression."

        "In this paper we have developed a system for automatically identifying CONTAINS relations in clinical text.",
        "The experiments show first that a machine learning approach that intelligently integrates constituency information can greatly improve performance over rule-based baselines.",
        "We also show that the tree kernel approach, which can model sequence better than a bag of tokens-style approach, is beneficial even when it uses the same features.",
        "Finally, the experiments show that choosing the correct representation is important for tree kernel approaches, and specifically that using a full parse tree may give inferior performance compared to sub-trees focused on the structure of interest.",
        "In general, there is much work to be done in the area of representing temporal information in clinical records.",
        "Many of the inputs to the algorithm described in this paper need to be extracted automatically, including time expressions and events.",
        "Work on relations will focus on adding features to represent discourse information and richer representation of event semantics.",
        "Discourse information may help with the longer-distance errors, where the time expression acts almost as a topic for an extended description of events.",
        "Better understanding of event semantics, such as whether a disease is chronic or acute, or typical duration for a treatment, may help constrain relations.",
        "In addition, we will explore the effectiveness of using dependency tree structure, which has been useful in the domain of extracting relations from the biomedical literature (Tikk et al., 2013)."
