        "Furthermore, we observe that the two scientific corpora behave quite similarly to each other at all three levels.",
        "This second observation is not necessarily a given.",
        "If we can consider for a moment the notion that there might be degrees of fit to the sublanguage model, it is clear that from a content perspective the BNC is unlimited; the CRAFT corpus is limited to mouse genomics, but not to any particular area of mouse genomics (indeed, it contains articles about development, disease, physiology, and other topics); and GENIA is more limited than CRAFT, being restricted to the topic of human blood cell transcription factors.",
        "If a technique for sublanguage detection were sufficiently precise and granular, it might be possible to show a strict ranking from BNC to CRAFT to GENIA in terms of fit to the sublanguage model (i.e., BNC showing no fit, and GENIA showing a greater fit than CRAFT since its subject matter is even more restricted).",
        "However, this does not occur?in our data, CRAFT showed a stronger tendency towards closure at the lexical level, while GENIA shows a stronger tendency towards closure at the morphosyntactic level.",
        "It is possible that the small differences at those levels are not significant, and that the two corpora show the same tendencies towards closure overall.",
        "One reason that the IBM manuals in the (McEnery and Wilson, 2001) experiments showed sentence type closure but the CRAFT and GENIA corpora did not in our experiments is almost certainly related to sentence length.",
        "The average length of a sentence in the IBM manuals is 11 words, versus 24 in the Hansard corpus and 21 in the American Printing House for the Blind corpus.",
        "In this respect, the scientific corpora are much more like the Hansard and American Printing House for the Blind corpora than they are like the IBM manuals?the average length of a sentence in GENIA is 21.47 words, similar to the Hansard and American Printing House for the Blind corpora and about twice the length of sentences in the IBM manuals.",
        "Similarly, the average sentence length of the CRAFT corpus is 22.27 words (twice the average sentence length of the IBM manuals), and the average sentence length in the BNC is 20.43 words.",
        "Longer sentences imply greater chances for different sentence types.",
        "Another reason for the tendency towards sentence type closure in the IBM manuals, which was not observed in CRAFT and GENIA, is the strong possibility that they were written in a controlled language that specifies the types of syntactic constructions that can be used in writing a manual, e.g. limiting the use of passives, etc., as well as lexical choices and limits on other options (Kuhn, under review).",
        "There is no such official controlled language for writing journal articles.",
        "Finally, one reason that the CRAFT and GENIA corpora did not show sentence type closure while the IBM manuals did is that while McEnery and Wilson represented sentence types as parses, we represented them as sequences of part-of-speech tags.",
        "Representing sentence types as parse trees has the effect of smoothing out some variability at the leaf node level.",
        "For this reason, our repre",
        "sentation increases the sensitivity of the method to sentence type differences, providing a stronger test of fit to the sublanguage model.",
        "It has been suggested since Harris's classic work (Harris et al., 1989) that scientific writing forms a sublanguage.",
        "However, it is also clear from the work of (Stetson et al., 2002) and (Mi-haila et al., 2012) that some putative sublanguages are a better fit to the model than others, and to date there has been no publicly available, repeatable method for assessing the fit of a set of documents to the sublanguage model.",
        "This paper presents the first such package of software and uses it to evaluate two corpora of scientific journal articles.",
        "Future work will include evaluating the effects of mapping all numbers to a fixed NUMBER token, which might affect the tendencies towards lexical closure; evaluating the effect of the size of tag sets on type/part-of-speech ratios, which might affect tendencies towards type/part-of-speech closure; and seeking a way to introduce more syntactic structure into the sentence type analysis without losing the generality of the current approach.",
        "We will also apply the technique to other biomedical genres, such as clinical documents.",
        "There is also an important next step to take?this work provides a means for recognizing sublanguages, but does not tackle the problem of determining their characteristics.",
        "However, despite these limitations, this paper presents a large step towards facilitating the study of sublanguages by providing a quantitative means of assessing their presence.",
        "In analyzing the results of the study, some implications for natural language processing are apparent.",
        "Some of these are in accord with the issues for sublanguage natural language processing pointed out in the introduction.",
        "Another is that this work highlights the importance of both classic and more recent work on concept recognition for scientific journal articles (and other classes of sublanguages), such as MetaMap (Aronson, 2001; Aronson and Lang, 2010), ConceptMapper (Tanenblatt et al., 2010), and the many extant gene mention systems."
