        "The analysis of spontaneous language samples is an important task across a variety of fields.",
        "For instance, in language assessment this task can help to extract information regarding language proficiency (e.g. is the child typically developing or language impaired).",
        "In second language acquisition, language samples can help determine if a child's proficiency is similar to that of native speakers.",
        "In recent years, we have started seeing a growing interest in the exploration of NLP techniques for the analysis of language samples in the clinical setting.",
        "For example, Sahakian and Snyder (2012) propose a set of linguistic measures for age prediction in children that combines three traditional measures from language assessment with a set of five data-driven measures from language samples of 7 children.",
        "A common theme in this emerging line of research is the study of the syntax in those language samples.",
        "For instance, to annotate data to be used in the study of language development (Sagae et al., 2005), or to build models to map utterances to their meaning, similar to what children do during the language acquisition stage (Kwiatkowski et al., 2012).",
        "In addition, language samples are also used for neurological assessment, as for example in (Roark et al., 2007; Roark et al., 2011) where they explored features such as Yngve and Frazier scores, together with features derived from automated parse trees to model syntactic complexity and surprisal.",
        "Similar features are used in the classification of language samples to discriminate between children developing typically and children suffering from autism or language impairment (Prud?hommeaux et al., 2011).",
        "In a similar line of research, machine learning and features inspired by NLP have been explored for the prediction of language status in bilingual children (Gabani et al., 2009; Solorio et al., 2011).",
        "More recent work has looked at the feasibility of scoring coherence in story narratives (Hassanali et al., 2012a) and also on the inclusion of coherence",
        "as an additional feature to boost prediction accuracy of language status (Hassanali et al., 2012b).",
        "The contribution of our work consists on new metrics based on n-grams of Part of Speech (POS) tags for assessing language development in children that combine information at the lexical and syntactic levels.",
        "These metrics are designed to capture the lexical variability of specific syntactic constructions and thus could help to describe the level of language maturity in children.",
        "For instance, given two lists of examples of the use of determiner + noun: ?the dog, the frog, the tree?",
        "and ?this dog, a frog, these trees?",
        "we want to be able to say that the second one has more lexical variability than the first one for that grammatical pattern.",
        "Our approach to compute these new metrics does not require any special treatment on the transcripts or special purpose parsers beyond a POS tagger.",
        "On the contrary, we provide a set of measures that in addition to being easy to interpret by practitioners, are also easy to compute."

        "To establish language proficiency, clinical researchers and practitioners rely on a variety of measures, such as number of different words, type-token ratio, distribution of part-of-speech tags, and mean length of sentences and words per minute (Lu, 2012; Yoon and Bhat, 2012; Chen and Zechner, 2011; Yang, 2011; Miller et al., 2006), to name a few.",
        "Most of these metrics can be categorized as low-level metrics since they only consider rates of different characteristics at the lexical level.",
        "These measures are helpful in the solution of several problems, for example, building automatic scoring models to evaluate non-native speech (Chen and Zechner, 2011).",
        "They can also be used as predictors of the rate of growth of English acquisition in specific populations, for instance, in typically developing (TD) and language impaired (LI) bilingual children (Rojas and Iglesias, 2012; Gutie?rrez-Clellen et al., 2012).",
        "Among the most widely used metrics are mean length of utterance (MLU), a measure of syntactic complexity (Bedore et al., 2010), and measures of lexical productivity, such as the number of different words (NDW) and the child's ratio of functional words to content words (F/C) (Sahakian and Snyder, 2012).",
        "MLU, NDW, F/C and some other low-level measures have demonstrated to be valuable in the assessment of language ability considering that practitioners often only need to focus on productivity, diversity of vocabulary, and sentence organization.",
        "Although useful, these metrics only provide superficial measures of the children's language skills that fail to capture detailed lexico-syntactic information.",
        "For example, in addition to knowing that a child is able to use specific verb forms in the right context, such as, third person singular present tense or regular past tense, knowledge about what are the most common patterns used by a child, or how many different lexical forms for noun + verb are present in the child's speech is needed because answering these questions provides more detailed information about the status of grammatical development.",
        "To fill in this need, we propose a set of measures that aim to capture language proficiency as a function of lexical variability in syntactic patterns.",
        "We analyze the information provided by our proposed metrics on a set of spontaneous story retells and evaluate empirically their potential use in language status prediction."

        "We proposed a set of new measures that were developed to characterize the lexico-syntactic variability of child language.",
        "Each measure aims to find information that is not captured by traditional measures used in communication disorders.",
        "Our study is still preliminary in nature and requires an in depth evaluation and analysis with a larger pool of subjects.",
        "However the results presented are encouraging.",
        "The set of experiments we discussed showed that TD and LI children have significant differences in performance according to our metrics and thus these metrics can be used to enrich models of language trajectories in child language acquisition.",
        "Another potential use of metrics similar to those proposed here is the design of targeted intervention practices.",
        "The scripts to compute the metrics as described in this paper are available to the research community by contacting the authors.",
        "However, the simplicity of the metrics makes it easy for anyone to implement, and it certainly makes it easy for clinical researchers to interpret.",
        "Our proposed metrics are a contribution to the set of already known metrics for language assessment.",
        "The goal of these new metrics is not to replace existing ones, but to complement what is already available with concise information about higher-order syntactic constructions in the repertoire of TD children.",
        "We are interested in evaluating the use of our metrics in a longitudinal study.",
        "We believe they are a promising framework to represent language acquisition trajectories."
