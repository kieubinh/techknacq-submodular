        "This might be partly due to the fact that sentence based models seem to be better suited than the paragraph based ones as might have been expected.",
        "The fact that the CRF models performance is below the LR models denotes that the structured abstracts seem to follow a pattern that is different in the case of non-structured abstracts.",

        "We have presented an evaluation of several learning algorithms to label abstract text in MEDLINE/PubMed with argumentative labels, based on MEDLINE/PubMed structured abstracts.",
        "The results show that this task can be achieved with high performance in the case of labeling the paragraphs but this is not the same in the case of sentences.",
        "This intrinsic evaluation was performed on structured abstracts, and in this set the CRF models seem to perform much better compared to the",
        "other models that do not use the labeling sequence.",
        "On the other hand, when applying the trained models to MEDLINE/PubMed non-structured abstracts, we find that the extrinsic evaluation of these labeling on the GeneRIF task shows lower performance for the CRF models.",
        "This indicates that the structured abstracts follow a pattern that non-structured ones do not follow.",
        "The extrinsic evaluation shows that labeling the sentences with argumentative labels improves the indexing of GeneRIF sentences.",
        "The argumentative labels help identifying target sentences for the GeneRIF indexing, but more refined labels learned from non-structured abstracts could provide better performance.",
        "An idea to extend this research would be evaluating the latent discovery of section labels and to apply this labeling to the proposed GeneRIF task and to other tasks, e.g.",
        "MeSH indexing.",
        "Latent labels might accommodate better the argumentative structure of non-structured abstracts.",
        "As shown in this work, the argumentative layout of non-structured abstracts and structured abstracts is not the same.",
        "There is still the open question if there is any layout regularity in the non-structured abstracts that could be exploited to improve information access."
