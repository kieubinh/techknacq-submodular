        "During the past few years, several novel text mining algorithms have been developed in the context of the BioNLP Shared Tasks on Event Extraction.",
        "These algorithms typically aim at extracting biomolecular interactions from text by inspecting only the context of one sentence.",
        "However, when humans interpret biomolecular research articles, they usually build upon extensive background knowledge of their favorite genes and pathways.",
        "To make such world knowledge available to a text mining algorithm, it could first be applied to all available literature to subsequently make a more informed decision on which predictions are consistent with the current known data.",
        "In this paper, we introduce our participation in the latest Shared Task using the large-scale text mining resource EVEX which we previously implemented using state-of-the-art algorithms, and which was applied to the whole of PubMed and PubMed Central.",
        "We participated in the Genia Event Extraction (GE) and Gene Regulation Network (GRN) tasks, ranking first in the former and fifth in the latter."

        "The main objective of our entry was to test the usability of the large-scale text mining resource EVEX to provide supporting information to an existing state-of-the-art event extraction system.",
        "In the GE task, EVEX is used to extract additional features for event extraction, capturing the occurrence of relevant events in other documents across PubMed and PubMed Central.",
        "In the GRN task, EVEX is the sole source of information, i.e. our entry consists of a modified subset of EVEX, rather than a new text mining system specifically trained for the task.",
        "In the 2011 GE task, the majority of participating systems used features solely extracted from the immediate textual context of the event candidate, typically restricted to a single sentence (Kim et al., 2012; McClosky et al., 2012; Bjo?rne et al., 2012b; Vlachos and Craven, 2012).",
        "Several studies have subsequently incorporated coreference relations, capturing information also from surrounding sentences (Yoshikawa et al., 2011; Miwa et al., 2012).",
        "However, no prior work exists on extending the event context to the information extracted from other documents on a large scale.",
        "The motivation for this entry is thus to test whether a gain can be obtained by aggregating information across documents with mutually supporting evidence.",
        "In the following sections, we first introduce EVEX as the underlying text mining resource, and then describe the methods developed specifically for the GRN and GE task entries.",
        "Finally, a detailed error analysis of the results offers insight into the performance of our systems and provides possible directions of future development."

        "EVEX1 is a text mining resource built on top of events extracted from all PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central Open-Access full-text documents (Van Landeghem et al., 2013a).",
        "The extraction was carried out using a combination of the BANNER named entity detector (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) and the TEES event extraction system as made publicly available subsequent to the last Shared Task (ST) of 2011 (Bjo?rne et al., 2012a).",
        "Specifically, this version of TEES was trained on the ST?11 GE data.",
        "On top of the individual event occurrences, EVEX provides event generalizations, allowing the integration and summarization of knowledge across different articles (Van Landeghem et al., 2011).",
        "For instance, the canonicalization algorithm deals with small lexical variations by removing non-alphanumerical characters (e.g. ?Esr1?",
        "to ?esr1?).",
        "The canonical generalization then groups those events together with the same event type and the same canonicalized arguments.",
        "Additionally, gene normalization data has recently been integrated within the EVEX resource, assigning taxonomic classification and database identifiers to gene mentions in text using the GenNorm system (Wei and Kao, 2011).",
        "Finally, the assignment of genes to homologous families allows a more coarse-grained generalization of the textual data.",
        "For each generalized event, a confidence score is automatically calculated based upon the original TEES classification procedure, with higher values representing more confident predictions.",
        "Finally, the EVEX resource provides a network interpretation which transforms events into pairwise gene/protein relations to represent a typed, directed network.",
        "The primary advantage of such a network, as compared to the complex, recursive event structures, is that a network is more easily analysed and integrated with other external resources (Kaewphan et al., 2012; Van Landeghem et al., 2013b)."

        "Further, contradictory types between a specific entity pair (e.g. Inhibition and Activation) may occur simultaneously in the GRN data.",
        "For the EVEX data however, it is more beneficial to try and pick one single correct event type from the set of predictions, effectively reducing the false positive rate.",
        "To this end, the EVEX confidence values are used to determine the single most plausible candidate.",

        "We believe this shift in semantics is caused by the fact that a promoter binding is usually extracted as a binding event by the TEES classifier, while it can semantically be seen as a Transcription event, especially in those cases where the Theme is a protein name, and the Cause a gene symbol (Table 2)."

        "While the difference between TEES output and the random ranking reflects the effect of using an oracle to optimize per-sentence score, the difference between the random ranking and the re-ranker output shows an actual added value of the re-ranker, not attained from the use of oracle thresholds.",
        "Here it is of particular interest to note that this difference is more pronounced for events with multiple arguments (5.95pp of precision) as opposed to single-argument events (3.36pp of precision), possibly due to the fact that such events have a much richer feature representation and also employ the EVEX resource.",
        "To assess the contribution of EVEX data, a re-ranker was trained solely on features derived from EVEX.",
        "This re-ranker achieved an F-score of 1.26pp higher than randomized ranking, thus suggesting that these features have a positive influence on the overall score.",
        "To verify these results and measure their impact on the official evaluation, Table 8 summarizes the performance on the development set using the official evaluation service.",
        "To study the effect on single-argument events (column 1-arg), the re-ranker score for multiple-argument events is artificially increased to always fall above the threshold.",
        "A similar strategy is used to study the effect on multiple-argument events (column N-arg).",
        "These results confirm that the overall performance gain of our system on top of TEES is obtained on single-argument events.",
        "Further, multiple-argument events have only a negligible effect on the overall score, demonstrating that, due to their low frequency, little can be gained or lost purely on multiple-argument events.",
        "To summarize the error analysis, the results in",
        "tive on multiple-argument events where it receives more features including external information from EVEX.",
        "On the other hand, the results in Table 8 clearly demonstrate that the system is overall more effective on single-argument events.",
        "This would suggest a ?mismatch?",
        "between the re-ranker and the threshold regressor, each being more effective on a different class of events.",
        "One possible explanation is the fact that the threshold regressor predicts a single threshold for all events in a sentence, regardless of their type and number of arguments.",
        "If these cannot be distinguished by one threshold, it is clear that the threshold regressor will optimize for the largest event type, i.e. a single-theme regulation.",
        "Studying ways to allow the regressor to act separately on various event types will be important future work."

        "One of the main limitations of our approach is that it can only increase precision, but not recall, since it removes events from the TEES output, but is not able to introduce new events.",
        "As TEES utilizes separate processing stages for predicting event triggers and argument edges, recall can be adjusted by altering either of these steps.",
        "We have briefly experimented with modifying TEES to over-generate events by artificially lowering the prediction threshold for event triggers.",
        "However, this simple strategy of over-generating triggers leads to a number of clearly incorrect events and did not provide any performance gain.",
        "As future work, we thus hope to explore effective ways to over-generate events in a more controlled and effective fashion.",
        "In particular, a more detailed evaluation is needed to assess whether the rate of trigger over-generation should be adjusted separately for each event type.",
        "Another direction to explore is to over-generate argument edges.",
        "This will entail a detailed analysis of partially correct events with a missing argument in TEES output.",
        "As in the case of triggers, it is likely that each event type will need to be optimized separately.",
        "A notable amount of sentences include only false positive predictions, severely complicating the threshold regression.",
        "In an attempt to overcome this issue, we trained a sentence classifier for excluding sentences that should not contain any events.",
        "This classifier partially utilized the same features as the threshold regressor, as well as bag of words and bag of POS tags.",
        "This method showed some promise when used together with trigger over-generation, but the gain was not enough to surpass the lost precision caused by the over-generation.",
        "If the event over-generation can be improved, the feasibility of this method should be re-evaluated."

        "This approach led to a modest increase in the overall F-score of TEES and resulted in the first rank on the GE task.",
