        "In this paper, we describe our submission to the Genia Event (GE) information extraction subtask of the BioNLP Shared Task.",
        "This task requires the development of systems that are capable of identifying bio-molecular events as those events are expressed in full-text publications.",
        "The task represents an important contribution to the broader problem of converting unstructured information captured in the biomedical literature into structured information that can be used to index and analyse bio-molecular relationships.",
        "This year's task builds on previous instantiations of this task (Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012), with only minor changes in the task definition introduced for 2011.",
        "The task organisers provided full text publications annotated with mentions of biological entities including proteins and genes, and asked participants to provide annotations of simple events including gene expression, binding, localization, and protein modification, as well as higher-order regulation events (e.g., positive regulation of gene expression).",
        "In our submission, we built on a system originally developed for the BioNLP-ST 2011 (Liu et al., 2011) and extended in more recent work (Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b).",
        "This system learns to recognise sub-graphs of syntactic dependency parse graphs that express a given bio-molecular event, and matches those subgraphs to new text using an algorithm called Approximate Subgraph Matching.",
        "Due to the method's fundamental dependency on the syntactic dependency parse of the text, in this work we set out to explore the impact of substituting the previously employed dependency parsers with a different parser which has been demonstrated to achieve higher performance than other commonly used parsers for full-text biomedical literature (Verspoor et al., 2012).",
        "In addition, we aimed to address the relatively lower recall of the method through incorporation of large quantities of external training data, acquired through integration of previously automatically extracted bio-molecular events available in a web repository of such extracted events, EVEX (Van Landeghem et al., 2011; Van Landeghem et al., 2012), and additional bio-molecular events generated from a large sample of full text publications using one of the state-of-the-art event extraction systems, TEES (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011).",
        "Since the performance of the subgraph matching method, as an instance-based learning strategy (Alpaydin, 2004), is dependent on having good training examples that express the events in a range of syntactic structures, the motivation underlying this was to increase the amount of training data available to the system, even if that data was derived from a less-than-perfect source.",
        "The augmentation of training corpora with external unlabelled data that is automatically processed to generate additional labels has been explored for retraining the same system, in an approach known as self-training.",
        "This approach has been shown to be",
        "very effective for improving parsing performance (McClosky et al., 2006; McClosky and Charniak, 2008).",
        "Self-training of the TEES system has been previously explored (Bjorne et al., 2012), with somewhat mixed results, but with evidence suggesting it could be useful with an appropriate strategy for selecting training examples.",
        "Here, rather than training our system with its own output over external data, we explore a semi-supervised learning approach in which we train our system with the outputs of a different system (TEES) over external data."

      "text": [
        "The event extraction algorithm is essentially the same as the one used in Liu et al. (2013b).",
        "A fuller description can be found there, but we summarise the most important aspects of it here.",
        "The principal method used in event extraction is Approximate Subgraph Matching, or ASM (Liu et al., 2013a).",
        "Broadly, we learn subgraph patterns from the event structures in the training data, and then apply them by looking for matches with the patterns of the learned rules, using ASM to allow for non-exact matches of the patterns.",
        "The first stage in this is learning the rules which link subgraphs to associated patterns.",
        "The input is a set of dependency-parsed articles (the setup is described in ?2.1.2), and a set of gold-standard annotations of proteins and events in the shared task format.",
        "Using the standoff annotations in the training data, every protein and trigger is mapped to one or more nodes in the corresponding dependency graphs.",
        "In addition, the textual content of every protein is replaced with a generic string enabling abstraction over individual protein names.",
        "Then, for each event annotation in the training data, we retrieve the nodes from the graph corresponding to the associated trigger and protein entities.",
        "We determine the shortest path (or paths, in case of a tie) connecting the graph trigger to each of the event argument nodes.",
        "For arguments which are themselves events (e.g., for regulatory events), the node corresponding to the trigger of the event argument is used instead of a protein node.",
        "Where there are multiple arguments, we take the union of the shortest paths to each individual argument.",
        "This path is then used as the pattern component of an event rule.",
        "The rule also consists of an event type, and a mapping from event arguments to nodes from the pattern graph, or to an event type/node pair for nested event arguments.",
        "After processing all training documents, we get on the order of a few thousand rules; this can be decreased slightly by removing rules with subgraphs that are isomorphic to those of other rules.",
        "In principle, this set of rules could then be directly applied to the test documents, by searching for any matching subgraphs.",
        "However, in practice doing so leads to very low recall, since the patterns are not general enough to get a broad range of matches on new data.",
        "We can alleviate this by relaxing the strictness of the subgraph matching process.",
        "Most basically, we relax node matching.",
        "Instead of requiring an exact match between both the token and the part-of-speech of the nodes of the sentence graph and those from the rule subgraph, we also allow a match on the basis of the lemma (according to BioLemmatizer (Liu et al., 2012)), and a coarse-grained POS-tag (where there is only one POS-tag for nouns, verbs and adjectives).",
        "More importantly, we also relax the requirements on how closely the graphs must match, by using ASM.",
        "ASM defines distances measures between subgraphs, based on structure, edge labels and edge directions, and uses a set of specified weights to combine them into an overall subgraph distance.",
        "We have a preconfigured set of distance thresholds for each event type, and for each sentence/rule pairing, we extract events for any rules with subgraphs under the given threshold.",
        "The problem with this approximate matching is that some rules now match too broadly, and precision is reduced.",
        "This is mitigated by adding an iterative optimisation phase.",
        "In each iteration, we run the event extraction using the current rule set over some dataset ?",
        "usually the training set, or a subset of it.",
        "We check the contribution of each rule in terms of postulated events and actual events which match the gold standard.",
        "If the ratio of matched to postulated events is too low (for the work reported here, the threshold is 0.25), the rule is discarded.",
        "This process is repeated until no more rules are discarded.",
        "This can take multiple iterations since the rules are interdependent due to the presence of nested event arguments.",
        "The optimisation step is by far the most time-consuming step of our process, especially for the large rule sets produced in some configurations.",
        "We were able to improve optimisation times somewhat by parallelising the event extraction, and temporarily removing documents with long extraction times from the optimisation process until as late as possible, but it remained the primary bottleneck in our experimentation.",
        "In our parsing pipeline, we first split sentences using the JULIE Sentence Boundary Detector, or JSBD (Tomanek et al., 2007).",
        "We then parse using a version of clearnlp1 (Choi and McCal-lum, 2013), a successor to ClearParser (Choi and Palmer, 2011), which was shown to have state-of-the-art performance over the CRAFT corpus of full-text biomedical articles (Verspoor et al., 2012).",
        "We use dependency and POS-tagging models trained on the CRAFT corpus (except where noted); these pre-trained models are provided with clearnlp.",
        "Our fork of clearnlp integrates token span marking into the parsing process, so the dependency nodes can easily be matched to the standoff annotations provided with the shared task data.",
        "This pipeline is not dependent on any pre-annotated data, so can thus be trivially applied to extra data not provided as part of the shared task.",
        "In addition the parsing is fast, requiring roughly 46 wall-clock seconds (processing serially) to parse the 5059 sentences from the training and development sets of the 2013 GE task ?",
        "an average of 9 ms per sentence.",
        "The ability to apply the same parsing configuration to new text was useful for adding extra training data, as discussed in ?2.2.",
        "The usage of clearnlp as the parser is the primary point of difference between our system and that of Liu et al. (2013b), who use the Charniak-Johnson parser with the McClosky biomedical model (CJM; McClosky and Charniak (2008)), although there are other minor differences in tokenisation and sentence splitting.",
        "We expected that the higher accuracy of clearnlp over biomedical text would translate into increased accuracy of event detection in the shared task; we consider this question in some detail below."

        "In all cases we used all of the available gold training data from the GE11 and GE13 datasets.",
        "To assess the impact of modification cues, we show results using the basic set as well as with the addition of the data-derived cues.",
        "It has often been noted (MacKinlay et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2011) that modification detection accuracy is strongly dependent on the quality of the upstream event annotation, so we provide an oracle evaluation, using gold-standard event annotations rather than automatic output.",
        "The performance over the automatically-annotated runs is respectable, given that the recall is fundamentally limited by the recall of the input event annotations, which is only around 30% for the configurations shown.",
        "With the oracle event annotations, the results improve substantially, with considerable gains in precision, and recall increasing by a factor of 4?6.",
        "This boost in recall in particular is more than we would naively expect from the roughly threefold increase in recall over the events.",
        "It seems that many of the modification rules we learned were even more effective over events which our pipeline was unable to detect.",
        "The modification rules were learned from oracle event data, but this does not fully explain the discrepancy.",
        "Regardless, our algorithm for modification detection showed excellent performance over the oracle annotations.",
        "Over the 2009 version of the BioNLP shared task data, MacKinlay et al. (2012) report F-scores of 54.6% for NEGATION and 51.7% for SPECULATION.",
        "These are not directly comparable with those in Table 6, but running our newer algorithm over the same 2009 data gives F-scores of 84.2% for NEGATION and 69.1% for SPECULATION.",
        "For the official run, which conflates event extraction and modification detection accuracy, our system was ranked third for NEGATION and SPECULATION out of the three competing teams, although the other teams had event extraction F-scores of roughly 8% higher than our system.",
        "For SPECULATION, our system had the highest precision of 34.15%, while the F-score of 20.22% was close to the best result of 23.92%.",
        "Our NEGATION detection was less competitive, with an F-score of 20.94% ?",
        "roughly 6% lower than the other teams.",
        "We cannot extrapolate directly from the oracle evaluation in Table 6, but it seems to indicate that an increase in event extraction accuracy would have flow-on benefits in modification detection."

        "The biggest surprise here was that clearnlp, a more accurate dependency parser for the biomedical domain, as evaluated on the CRAFT treebank, gave a substantially lower event extraction F-score than the CJM parser.",
        "To determine whether preprocessing caused the differences, we replaced the existing modules (sentence-splitting from JSBD and tokenisation/POS-tagging from clearnlp) with the BioC-derived versions from the CJM pipeline, but this yielded only an insignificant decrease in accuracy.",
        "Over the same training data, the optimised rules from CJM have an average of 2.6 nodes per subgraph path, compared to 3.9 nodes per path using clearnlp.",
        "A longer path is less likely to match than a shorter path, so this may help to explain the lower generalisability of the clearnlp-derived rules.",
        "While it is possible for a longer subgraph to match just as generally, if the test sentences are parsed consistently, in general there are more nodes and edges which can fail to match due to minor surface variations.",
        "One way to mitigate this is to raise the ASM distance thresholds to compensate for this; preliminary experiments suggest it would provide a small (?",
        "1%) boost in F-score but this would not close the gap between the parsers.",
        "Both parsers produce outputs with Stanford Dependency labels (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), so we might naively expect similar graph topology and subgraph pattern lengths.",
        "However, the CJM pipeline produces graphs in the ?CCpro-cessed?",
        "SD format, which are simpler and denser.",
        "If a node N has a link to a node O with a conjunction link to another node P (from e.g. and), an extra link with the same label is added directly from N to P in the CCprocessed format.",

        "there are more direct links in the graph, matching the semantics more closely.",
        "The shortest path fromN to P is now direct, instead of viaO, which could enable the CJM pipeline to produce more general rules.",
        "To evaluate how much this detrimentally affects the clearnlp pipeline, as a post hoc investigation, we implemented a conversion module.",
        "Using Stanford Dependency parser code, we replicated the CCprocessed conversion on the clearnlp graphs, reducing the average subgraph pattern length to 2.8, and slightly improving accuracy.",
        "Over our development set, compared to the results in Table 3 it gave a 0.7% absolute F-score boost over using GE13 training-data only, and 1.1% over using GE11 and GE13 training data (in both cases improving recall).",
        "Over the test set, the improvement was greater, with a P/R/F of 35.66/64.99/46.05, a 2.5% increase in F-score compared to the results in Table 5 and only 2.9% less than the official Liu et al. (2012) submission.",
        "Clearly some of the inter-parser discrepancies are due to surface features and post-processing, and as noted above, we can also achieve small improvements by relaxing ASM thresholds, so some problems may be caused by the default parameters being suboptimal for the parser.",
        "However, the accuracy is still lower where we would expect it to be higher, and this remaining discrepancy is difficult to explain without performing a detailed error analysis, which we leave for future work."

        "However, these tables also indicate that adding manually annotated data produces an increase in performance comparable to adding the noisy data, despite its smaller size, and when using this manually annotated set together with the noisy data, the improvement resulting from the noisy data is smaller (Table 5).",
        "Noisy data was only used during training, which limits its effectiveness?any rule extracted from automatically acquired annotations that are not seen during optimisation of the rule set will have a lower weight.",
        "On the other hand, we found that using noisy data for optimisation seemed to decrease performance.",
