        "Nowadays, these data sources are mostly in the form of unstructured free text, which is complex to incorporate into databases.",
        "Hence, many research events are organized around the issue of automatically extracting information from biomedical text.",
        "Efforts dedicated to biomedical text are necessary because standard Natural Language Processing tools cannot be readily applied to extract biomedical events since they involve highly domain-specific jargon and dependencies (Kim et al., 2011).",
        "This paper describes the HDS4NLP entry to one of these challenges, the Genia task (GE) of the BioNLP 2013 shared task.",
        "The HDS4NLP system is based on a novel model designed to directly extract events having a pairwise structure (trigger,",
        "argument), in contrast to standard pipeline models which first extract the trigger and then search for the argument.",
        "Combining these two steps enables to use more sophisticated event features while largely avoiding error propagation.",
        "The model usage is also simple, in the sense that it does not rely on any complex and costly inference process as required by joint global systems based on Integer Linear Programming.",
        "The official HDS4NLP entry was only ranked 6th on the GE task (with 43.03% f-score).",
        "However, after fixing a bug discovered after the final submission, the HDS4NLP system outperformed the winner of the GE task, with a f-score 51.15% to be compared to the 50.97% of EVEX."

        "A sequence of classifiers are ran on the text to successively (1) detect non-regulation event triggers, (2) assign them arguments, (3) detect regulation event triggers and (4) assign them arguments.",
        "Such systems are relatively easy to set up but suffer from error cascading.",
        "Besides, they detect triggers using classifiers solely taking tokens as input, or involve dependency parse information by tree depth other than a concrete potential argument (Bj?rne et al., 2009).",
        "In the corpuses used in 2009 and 2011 for the GE task, some tokens belong to several events of different types; their classification thus requires to solve a multi-label problem.",
        "We believe that detecting triggers in isolation breaks the structured problem down to excessively fine-grained subtasks, with contextual information loss that leads to ill-posed problems.",
        "Global approaches (Riedel et al., 2009; Mc-Closky et al., 2011) aim at solving the whole task at once, so as to resolve the drawbacks of pipeline models.",
        "In (McClosky et al., 2011), event annotations are converted into pseudo-syntactic representations and the task is solved as a syntactic extraction problem by traditional parsing methods.",
        "(Riedel et al., 2009; Riedel and McCallum, 2011a; Riedel et al., 2011; Riedel and McCallum, 2011b) encode the event annotations as latent binary variables indicating the type of each token and the relation between each pair of them (protein or candidate) in a sentence.",
        "The state of these variables is predicted by maximizing the global likelihood of an Integer Linear Program.This joint model achieves good performance (winner of the 2011 GE task), but might be overly complicated, as it considers all possible combinations of tokens, even unlikely ones, as potential events together."

        "Though being rather minimalist, the pairwise structure captures a great deal of trigger-argument interactions, and the simplicity of the structure leads to a straightforward inference procedure.",
