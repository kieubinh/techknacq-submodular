        "The relaxed POS allows the plural form of nouns to match with the singular form, and the conjugations of verbs to match with each other.",

        "We expect that the incorporation of DSM will enable our system to capture matching tokens in testing sentences that do not appear in the training data while maintaining the extraction precision at a high level.",
        "There have been many approaches to compute the similarity between words based on their distribution in a corpus (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "The output is a ranked list of similar words to each word.",
        "We reimplemented the model proposed by (Pantel and Lin, 2002) in which each word is represented by a feature vector and each feature corresponds to a context where the word appears.",

        "The similarity between two words is then computed using the cosine coefficient (Salton and McGill, 1986) of their mutual information vectors.",

        "First, the model is directly embedded into the node matching scheme.",
        "Once a match cannot be determined by surface tokens, the DSM is invoked to allow a match if the sentence token appears in the list of the top M most similar words to the rule token.",
        "Second, additional event rules are generated by replacing corresponding rule tokens with their top M most similar words, rather than allow DSM to participate in the node matching.",

        "When embedding the distributional similarity model (DSM) directly into the graph node matching",
        "scheme, we performed the DSM on all rule tokens except biological entities, meaning that for each rule token, if a match will be granted if a rule token appears in the top M most similar word list of a sentence token, e.g., ?DSM 3?",
        "denotes the top 3 similar words determined by the DSM.",
        "We further performed DSM only on trigger tokens for comparison, as presented in Table 4.",
        "Even though the DSM helps to substantially increase the recall to 53.43%, we observed a significant precision drop which leads to an inferior F-score to the ensemble baseline in Table 3.",
        "A close evaluation of the generated graph matches reveals that antonyms produced by the DSM contributes to most of the false positive events.",
        "For instance, the most similar words for the verb ?increase?",
        "and the adjective ?high?",
        "returned by the model are ?decrease?",
        "and ?low?",
        "because they tend to occur in the same contexts.",
        "Further investigation is needed to automatically filter out the antonyms.",
        "When generating additional rules using the top M most similar words from the DSM, since all the rules undergo the optimization process, the event extraction precision is ensured.",
        "However, the recall increase from simple events is diluted by the counter effect of the introduced false positives in detecting regulation-related complex events, resulting in a comparable performance to the baseline.",
        "Table 5 gives the performance comparison of using all-paths and the shortest paths in our event extraction system.",
        "Using all-paths does not bring in a significant improvement in F-score but takes 27 iterations to optimize as compared to the 5-iteration optimization on shortest paths.",
        "Most of the rules induced from all-paths are eventually discarded by the optimization process.",
        "The all-paths graph representation was motivated by the observation that shortest paths between candidate entities often exclude relation-signaling words when detecting binary relationships (Airola et al., 2008).",
        "Exploring broader contexts ensures such words to be considered.",
        "In the event extraction task, however, since triggers have been annotated, they are naturally incorporated into the shortest paths connecting trigger to each event argument.",
        "This in part explains why contexts beyond shortest paths did not bring in an appreciable benefit.",
        "Since integrating the DSM and all-paths do not provide significant performance improvements to our system, we decided to retain the original settings in the ASM when extracting events from the testing data.",
        "While most of the 2011 shared task datasets are composed of PubMed abstracts compared to full-text articles in the 2013 GE task, our system focuses on extracting events expressed within the boundaries of a single sentence.",
        "Therefore, in order to take advantage of existing annotated resources, we incorporated the annotated data of 2011 GE task and EPI (Epi-genetics and Post-translational Modifications) task to enrich the training instances of corresponding event types of the 2013 GE task.",
        "Eventually, we obtained a total of 14,448 rules of different event types from our training data.",
        "In practice, it takes the ASM less than a second to match the entire rule set with one document and return results.",
        "Our submitted system achieves a 48.93% F-score on the 305 testing documents of the GE task, ranking 4th among 12 participating teams.",
        "Table 6 presents the performance of the top eight systems.",
        "Our performance is within a reasonable margin from the best-performing system ?EVEX?, and shows an overall superior precision over most participating teams; only two of the top 5 systems obtained",
        "a precision in the 60% range.",
        "Particularly for the regulation-related complex events, we are the only team that achieved a precision over 55% among all 12 participating systems.",
        "This indicates that event rules automatically learned and optimized over training data generalize well to the unseen text, and have the ability to identify precisely corresponding events.",
        "We further evaluated the impact of the additonal training instances from 2011 tasks and the ensemble rule set derived from different parsers as presented in Table 7.",
        "With the help from the 2011 data, our F-score is increased by 3% and we became the only team that detected ?Ubiquitination?",
        "events from testing data.",
        "In addition, rules derived from the Stanford parser do not provide additional benefits on the testing data compared to using the Charniak parser alone."
