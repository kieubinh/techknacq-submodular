        "Thus the CG task is an interesting case-study for text mining from a biological point of view, in that the task spans the literature from molecular events to behaviors linked to phenotypes, and thus considers a broader context than earlier BioNLP shared tasks (Kim et al., 2009, 2011).",

        "It also classifies the verb as finite/nonfinite while marking its presence in a reduced or finite relative clause.",
        "The module determines these various aspects of a verb primarily with the local context, but uses the aspects of a previous verb in cases of coordinated verbs.",
        "Voice detection is facilitated by specific handling of (a) middle verbs, which appear to be in the active voice, but whose theme is the subject ('The protein translocated to the nuc-leus') (b) ergative verbs, which act like middle verbs when they do not have a direct object, but behave regularly when they are used transitively ('Protein levels increased' vs 'Application of the chemical increased protein levels') (c) intransitives, which are verbs that do not take a direct object, but whose subject is the agent ('The patient fell'), (d) verbs in the active voice, but with an object separated from the verb by a preposition ('leads to', 'resulted in', 'binds to').",
        "Voice markup is therefore determined primarily by the roles of the subject/object, and is thus a little different from the voice markings as conventionally defined.",
        "In the sample sentence, there is only one verb, and the output reads: \"[ Concomitantly AV] , [ immunostaining NP] for [ apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) NP] [ showed VP_Af] [ a time dependent translocation NP] from [ the mitochondria NP] to [ the nucleus NP] .\" where the verb phrase 'showed' is in the active voice ('A') and is finite ('f').",

        "Here 'VP_Pfcr' stands for passive voice ('P'), finite ('f'), copula ('c'), and relative clause ('r'), while 'VP_Pnd' stands for Passive ('P'), non-finite ('n') and reduced ('d').",

        "We accommodate 3 additional arguments apart from the agent/theme, such as FromLoc, ToLoc and AtLoc for movement-type trigger words.",

        "An example of an embedding is: 'With major interfering currents inhibited, NaCaEC was measured as the current that is sensitive to the nickel (Ni) during a descending voltage ramp.'.",
        "Here the VP 'was measured' is finite, and this allows its object 'the current' to be identified as the subject of 'is sensitive'.",
        "Other examples of rules for resolving the arguments of relative clauses (RCs) are: (a) Discourse connectives ('whereas, 'whereby, 'because') form clausal boundaries and should not be crossed (b) Certain coordination markers ('besides', 'via') also should not be crossed for RC's (c) If an RC is recognized as coordinated with a prior RC, the arguments are transferred.",
        "A general point in inferring missing arguments is that the nature of the current trigger word can also determine the nature of the induced argument.",
        "Certain trigger words ('induce', 'cause', en-hance', 'prevent') can take an event as an argument , although most trigger words do not (theme argument for 'methylation').",

        "While this makes the process in some sense 'domain-neutral', it may also introduce errors unless the predicate-argument rules are complete and comprehensive for individual triggers.",
        "The parser also locates discourse connectives ('whereas', 'because' , 'via', 'when') and assembles argument frames for these connectives, based on finiteness of verbs when possible.",
        "Connectives ('by') that can take nominals as arguments ('Localization ... by fusing') are also handled by the parser.",
        "Hypernymic and appositional relations are also detected at this stage.",

        "This gave a score (f-measure) of 52.2% with the evaluation options '-s -p' which stand respectively for soft span matching and partial recursive matching.",
        "We then reran the event extraction module after removing all internally generated entity tags for chemicals, proteins and anatomical parts and tagging only such entities as were specified in the gold 'a1' files.",
        "To our surprise, the f-measure was 2% lower on the development set when using the gold entities.",
        "This probably indicates an unwanted dependence of the event extraction module on some peculiarities in the way the internal Cocoa tagger tags entities.",
        "We are currently ana-lyzing the results for such dependencies (see Discussion for some examples).",
        "Nevertheless, the results are encouraging in that the system performance is similar with or without reference entities and thus may be indicative of performance on a new document collection where entities are not specified manually beforehand.",
        "As the task allows only one submission, we submitted the results of the system with entities tagged by the internal tagger and mapped only at the end to the gold tagged entities.",
        "This was based on the better performance of this approach against the development set.",
        "However, the results of the system were considerably lower on the test set (f = 45.3%; best score by TEES 2.1 system = 55.4%; Pyysalo et al., 2013).",
        "Using the evaluation portal for the test dataset, the results with gold-tagged entities improved the performance only by 0.3%, confirming that, at least at the performance levels of this system, the inbuilt Cocoa entity tags can substitute for pre-annotated entities.",
        "The performance on the test set was low primarily against the events in the regulation class (f=35.6%), which form about 40% of the events in both the test and development sets.",
        "This is similar to the result in the development set, where the performance in the regulation class was also quite low at f=37%.",
        "Part of the reason for this is that the system's rules for regulatory triggers generally give preference to other events over entities as causes/agents.",
        "Thus for example in the sentence fragment (PMID:21963494) 'AglRhz induced activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and DNA fragmentation in HT-29 cells, leads to induction of apoptosis as well as suppression of tumorigen-icity of HT-29 cells.",
        "', the gold annotations state that 'AglRhz' is the cause for the trigger word 'leads', while the Peaberry system prefers the trigger word 'induced' for the causative agent.",
        "However, we have not done a detailed study to examine if such differences account for more than a small minority of the errors that contribute to low performance in the regulatory class.",
        "Overall, and surprisingly for a rule-based system, the precision was quite low on both the test set (49%) and the development set (54%).",
        "The low overall precision was dominated by the corresponding number for regulatory events (37% and 44% on test and development sets respectively), but the precision of non-regulatory events was quite dismal as well (please see Discussion section below).",
        "The low recall for regulatory events can be caused by low recall for those primary (i.e. non-regulatory) events that are regulated.",
        "In the development set, the recall for these non-regulatory classes varied between 55% and 75%, but in the test set the recall for some primary event classes (Pathology and General event classes) dropped to ~30-40% (see Table 1 below).",
        "Another reason for low recall is the absence of themes for primary events when these themes are lifted/transferred from mentions of the same trigger word in previous sentences.",

        "problem with our linguistically-based system is the large open-ended number of trigger words that generate events.",
        "This explosive event generation occurs as the system generates predicate argument structures for all verbs in a document as well as for generically defined nominal processes (which are marked as event triggers by morphological considerations, such as words ending in \"ation\").",
        "Moreover, the entity tagger also marks a variety of other words as event triggers when they are known to stand for biological or disease processes, in the Gene Ontology for example.",
        "Projecting the system output into a limited sets of trigger words for a particular task was somewhat problematic for us, although a good training exercise on transferring arguments (e.g. the theme) from 'other' trigger words into the subset of trigger words sufficient for the task.",
        "It is possible that defects in this argument transfer process could account for some of the low performance in the test set.",
        "Developing a rule-based system involves a large amount of manual work in tuning the various aspects of the system to the task at hand.",
        "This is true even if the framework for the system is already in place.",
        "For example, with the CG task, the predicate-argument structures for each individual trigger have to be exhaustively worked out to handle all possible locations of argument structures.",
        "For certain triggers, the theme in the CG task is somewhat indirect, as in the sentence: 'Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils, reduced infections, and improved survival.",
        "', where the theme of 'response' are not the patients but the 'increased neutrophils'.",
        "This is perhaps clearer in the paraphrase: \"Organism responded to Drug with Symptoms\", and cellular symptoms are the appropriate theme for the trigger 'responded' in the CG task.",
        "Distinguishing such a sentence from a syntactically similar but semantically distinct sentence ' Organism responded well to Drug' is a challenging, and perhaps arduous, task for a rule-based linguistically motivated system.",
        "We note that the CG task annotations are quite consistent in this aspect, as the theme is again Symptoms in the paraphrase 'Drug protects Organism from Symptoms'.",
        "Further, in certain sentences, it is somewhat hard to express the meaning in the A2 notation.",
        "This is particularly true for adjectives which refer to the state of an entity rather than an event.",
        "Consider (PMID 17367752): \"These results suggest that SWAP-70 may be required for oncogenic transformation and contributes to cell growth in MEFs transformed by v-Src.\" where one of the gold annotations transcribes functionally as 'contributes ( Agent: SWAP-70, Theme: transformed ( Theme: MEFs ) )' which suggests that SWAP-70 contributes to the transformation of MEF's, whereas 'transformed' is only an attribute of the MEF's for this annotation.",
        "These aspects of the CG task annotations are particularly hard to capture in a rule-based system.",
        "A similar problematic sentence is 'recombinant EBVs that lack the BHRF1 miRNA cluster display a reduced ability to transform B lymphocytes in vitro' where the gold annotations read: reduced (Agent: recombinant_EBVs Theme: transform (B_lymphocytes)) The sentence however suggests that it is the 'lack' of a 'miRNA cluster' in the EBV's that reduces the transformation.",
        "Again, this reading is somewhat hard to express in A2 notation.",
        "As an additional example of the task complexity, we noted that distinguishing between the role of the trigger word 'transform' as 'Cell_transformation' and its role as a 'Planned_process' seems to require some level of discourse analysis at least in the CG training data.",
        "Some defects in the system output arise from differences in interpretation.",
        "In the sentence 'Merlin protein might contribute to the initiation of metastasis of NSCLC.",
        "', (PMID:2174350), the gold annotations read: 'contribute(Agent:Merlin, Theme: initiation (Theme: NSCLC))' 'contribute (Agent: Merlin Theme: metastasis (Theme: NSCLC)) where NSCLC is a cancer.",
        "Peaberry gives instead 'contribute (Agent: Merlin, Theme: initiation(Theme: metastasis(Theme: NSCLC))) As 'initiation' generally requires an event/process/disease as a theme, its theme could be either 'metastasis' or 'NSCLC', and the system makes a greedy choice in this case.",
        "As changes in this logic would have a system-wide impact, this example perhaps shows the inflexibility of the system.",
        "A straightforward example shows the costs of missed anaphora: 'Gene silencing and over-ex",
        "pression techniques were used to modulate RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells.'",
        "The system misses both events 'expression (Theme:RASSF1C)' and 'over-expression (Theme: RASSF1C)', both themes resolving to the anaphoric entity 'Gene', which needs resolution.",
        "Similar considerations apply for the sentence: 'knockdown of HDGF, an up-regulated protein and a target of NF-kappaB, induced cell apoptosis', where 'protein' and not 'HDGF' is seen as the theme of the trigger 'up-regulated'.",

        "A preliminary analysis shows that the reduction in some cases with gold entities was due to peculiarities in the way the system handles acronyms.",
        "The internal tagger lumps together an acronym with its expansion as a single token, while the gold annotations tokenizes the acronym and the definition separately.",

        "Cancer is founded at the molecular/genetic/cellular level and is localized to an individual organ/tissue before metastasis.",
        "It would thus seem that the text processing logic used for the CG task should be generalizable (at least) to diseases of individual organs.",
        "However, cancer is not a true multi-organ systemic problem of the type that characterizes lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are both linked to multiple genomic loci as well as to multiple organs, and it would be interesting to explore coverage of event extraction schemes for these diseases with the text mining techniques developed in the CG task.",
        "In this context, we note that automatic annotation of all events in a document needs to be followed by highlighting of the novel events/properties in the document, which may require some discourse analysis."
