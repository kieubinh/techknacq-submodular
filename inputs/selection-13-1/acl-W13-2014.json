        "A growing amount of biomedical data is continuously being produced, resulting largely from the widespread application of high-throughput techniques, such as gene and protein analysis.",
        "This growth is accompanied by a corresponding increase of textual information, in the form of articles, books and technical reports.",
        "In order to organize and manage these data, several manual curation efforts have been set up to identify entities (e.g., genes and proteins), their interactions (e.g., protein-protein) and events (e.g., transcription and gene regulation).",
        "The extracted information is then stored in structured knowledge resources, such as MEDLINE and Swiss-Prot.",
        "However, manual curation of large quantities of data is a very demanding and expensive task, and it is difficult to keep these databases up-to-date.",
        "These factors have naturally led to an increasing interest in the application of text mining (TM) systems to support those tasks.",
        "Automatic recognition of biomedical events from scientific documents was highly promoted by the BioNLP challenges (Kim et al., 2009; 2011), focusing on events that involve genes and proteins, such as gene expression, binding, and regulation.",
        "Such events are typically represented as the relation between a trigger and one or more arguments, which can be biomedical concepts or other events.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to extract biological events from text (Kim et al., 2009; 2011).",
        "Based on their characteristics and applied natural language processing (NLP) tools, these approaches can be categorized into two main groups, namely rule-and machine learning (ML)-based approaches.",
        "Rule-based approaches consist of a set of rules that are manually defined or automatically learned from training data (Bui & Sloot, 2011; Cohen et al.",
        "2009; Kaljurand et al., 2009; Kilicoglu & Bergler, 2011).",
        "To extract events from text, first event triggers are detected using a dictionary, then the defined rules are applied to the output of the NLP tools e.g., dependency parse trees, to find their arguments.",
        "On the other hand, ML-based approaches exploit various feature sets and learning algorithms to extract events (Bj?rne & Salakoski, 2011; Miwa et al., 2010; 2012; Riedel & McCallum, 2011).",
        "This article presents an enhanced version of our biomedical event extraction system (Bui & Sloot, 2012).",

        "For each event trigger, we count the number of times it appears as an event trigger and the number of times it appears in the training dataset, in order to calculate its confidence score.",
