        "Applications of Natural Language Generation (NLG) in the medical domain have been manifold.",
        "A new area where NLG could contribute to the improvement of services and to patient safety is pre-hospital care: care delivered to a patient before arrival at hospital.",
        "There are many challenges in delivering pre-hospital care, making it different from care taking place in the controlled circumstances of emergency departments or hospital wards.",
        "Some Ambulance Services have developed innovative models to care for patients whilst an ambulance is en-route.",
        "Community First Responder (CFR) schemes recruit volunteers from local communities and give them the necessary training and equipment to deal with a limited range of medical emergencies.",
        "The premise is that even those with basic first-aid skills can save a life.",
        "It is their task to attend the casualty while waiting for the ambulance and to record their observations and actions on a paper patient report form (PRF).",
        "They may also assess the patient's physiological measurements (e.g. heart rate).",
        "In practice, due to time constraints, a verbal handover is performed and the PRF is filled in later.",
        "Physiological measurements may be written in ink on the back of a protective glove, and are rarely passed on in any systematic way.",
        "The MIME (Managing Information in Medical Emergencies)1 project is developing technology to support CFRs in the UK when they respond to patients.",
        "The project aims to enable CFRs to capture a greater volume of physiological patient data, giving them a better awareness of a patient's medical status so they can deliver more effective care.",
        "There are two parts to our work: the use of novel lightweight wireless medical sensors that are simple and quick to apply, and the use of novel software that takes these inherently complex sensor data, along with some other information inputted by the user (e.g. patient demographics or actions performed) on a tablet computer, and present it very simply.",
        "We are working with two sensors that provide measurements of the patient's respiratory rate, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation.",
        "Our software can use NLG to produce a textual handover report at any time.",
        "This can be passed to an arriving paramedic to give a quick summary of the situation and can accompany the patient to inform later stages of care.",
        "We anticipate that our system will also provide some basic decision support based upon the patients clinical condition."

        "Many situations arise in the medical domain where vast amounts of data are produced and their correct interpretation is crucial to the lives of patients.",
        "Interpreting these data is usually a demanding and complex task.",
        "Medical data are therefore often presented graphically or preferably in textual summaries (Law et al., 2005) making NLG important for various applications in the medical domain.",
        "A number of systems address the problem of presenting medical information to patients in a form that they will understand.",
        "Examples are",
        "STOP (Reiter et al., 2003), PILLS (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2002), MIGRANE (Buchanan et al., 1992), and Healthdoc (Hirst et al., 1997).",
        "Other systems, such as TOPAZ (Kahn et al., 1991) and Suregen (Hu?ske-Kraus, 2003), aim to summarise information in order to support medical decision-making.",
        "In the case of MIME, the challenge is to summarise large amounts of sensor data, in the context of carer observations and actions, in a coherent way that supports quick decision making by the reader.",
        "The problem of describing the data relates to previous work on summarising time series data (e.g. (Yu et al., 2007)).",
        "In many ways, though, our problem is most similar to that of Babytalk BT-Nurse system (Hunter et al., 2012), which generates shift handover reports for nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit.",
        "The nature of the recipient is, however, different.",
        "Whereas BabyTalk addresses clinical staff in a controlled environment, MIME is aimed at people with little training who may have to deal with emergency situations very quickly.",
        "Further, while BT-Nurse works with an existing clinical record system, which does not always record all actions and observations which ideally would be included in a report, in MIME users enter exactly the information which MIME needs.",
        "This simplifies the NLG task, at the cost of adding a new task (interface construction)."

        "In the first stage of MIME, we have developed a desktop application to prototype the generation of handover reports.",
        "We used simulated scenarios, where a panel of medical experts determined the sequence of events and predicted the stream of data from the simulated sensors.",
        "The generated reports must provide a quick overview of the situation but at the same time be sufficiently comprehensive, while the format must enhance the readability.",
        "A general structure for the handover reports was determined in a user-centred development process together with ambulance clinicians.",
        "After the demographic description of the casualty and incident details (entered by the responder whenever they have an opportunity), two sections of generated text follow: the initial assessment section and the treatments and findings section.",
        "The initial assessment contains information on the patient gathered by the CFRs just after the sensors are applied and also any observations made during the first minute after the application of the sensors.",
        "The treatment and findings section is a report on the observations and actions of the CFRs while they waited for the ambulance to arrive.",
        "This includes a paragraph that sums up the condition of the patient at the time of handover.",
        "Using sensors to capture physiological data continuously introduces the problem that irrelevant information needs to be suppressed in order not to overload the ambulance clinicians and hinder interpretation.",
        "The NLG algorithm that generates short as well as comprehensive handover reports accomplishes text planning in the two stages of document planning and micro-planning (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Document planning is responsible for the selection of the information that will be mentioned in the generated report.",
        "Events that will be mentioned in the text are selected and structured into a list of trees (similar to trees in Rhetorical Structure Theory (Scott and Siecke-nius de Souza, 1990)).",
        "In the micro-planning step the structure of the document plan is linearised and sentences are compiled using coordination and aggregation.",
        "Whereas some parts of the handover document (e.g. patient demographics) are relatively stylised, the main technically demanding part of the NLG involves the description of the ?treatment and findings?, which describes the events that happen whilst the patient is being cared for and relevant parts of the sensor data (see Figure 1).",
        "For this section of the report, the document planning algorithm is based on that of (Portet et al., 2007), which identifies a number of key events and creates a paragraph for each key event.",
        "Events that are explicitly linked to the key event or events that happen at the same time are added to the relevant paragraph.",
        "This is based on the earlier work of (Hallett et al., 2006)."

        "When the CFR performed readings of the physiological measures they were shown as subtitles.",
        "The videos were presented to two CFRs and a paramedic, who were asked to imagine themselves in the situation of the CFR in the video, and to produce a handover report.",
        "Each video was only played once in order to produce more realistic results.",
        "We asked one CFR to construct a written ?verbal?",

        "The paramedic handover report might be regarded as a gold standard produced by an expert and we were interested in how the generated reports fared in comparison.",
