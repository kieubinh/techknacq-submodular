        "If some tokens are not found in your training data then you cannot translate them and if some translated word do not appear in your language model (LM) corpus, then it becomes harder for the SMT engine to find their correct position in the translation.",
        "Current SMT systems also face problems caused by the proliferation of various parallel corpora available for building SMT systems.",
        "The training data for many of the language pairs in the translation task, part of the Workshop on Machine translation (WMT13) (Callison-Burch et al., 2013), have increased the size of the available parallel corpora for instance by web crawled corpora over the years.",
        "The increased size of the training material creates computational scalability problems when training SMT models and can increase the amount of noisy parallel sentences found.",
        "As the training set sizes increase, proper training set selection becomes more important.",
        "At the same time, when we are going to translate just a couple of thousand sentences, possibly belonging to the same target domain, it does not make sense to invest resources for training SMT models over tens of millions of sentences or even more.",
        "SMT models like Moses already have filtering mechanisms to create smaller parts of the built models that are relevant to the test set.",
        "In this paper, we develop parallel feature decay algorithms (FDA) for solving computational scalability problems caused by the abundance of training data for SMT models and LM models and still achieve SMT performance that is on par with using all of the training data or better.",

        "We perform SMT experiments in all language pairs of the WMT13 (Callison-Burch et al., 2013) and obtain SMT performance close to the baseline Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) system using less resources for training.",
        "With parallel FDA, we can solve not only the instance selection problem for training data but also instance selection for the LM training corpus, which allows us to train higher order n-gram language models and model the dependencies better.",

        "However, although LM corpora resources are more abundant, training on large LM corpora also poses computational scalability problems and until 2012, LM corpora such as LDC Gigaword corpora were not fully utilized due to memory limitations of computers and even with large memory machines, the LM corpora is split into pieces, interpolated, and merged (Koehn and Haddow, 2012) or the LM order is decreased to use up to 4-grams (Markus et al., 2012) or low frequency n-gram counts are omitted and better smoothing techniques are developed (Yuret, 2008).",
        "Using only the given training data for building the LM is another option used for limiting the size of the corpus, which can also obtain the second best performance in Spanish-English translation task and in the top tier for German-English (Guzman et al., 2012; Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "This can also indicate that prior knowledge of the test set domain and its similarity to the available parallel training data may be diminishing the gains in SMT performance through better language modeling or better domain adaptation.",

        "Selecting the LM corpus is harder.",
        "First of all, we know which words should appear in the LM corpus but we do not know which phrases should be there since the translation model may reorder the translated words, find different translations, and generate different phrases.",
        "Thus, we use 1 gram features for LM corpus selection.",
        "At the same time, in contrast with selecting instances for the training set, we are less motivated to increase the diversity since we want predictive power on the most commonly observed patterns.",
        "Thus, we do not initialize feature weights with the idf score and instead, we use the inverse of the idf score for initialization, which is giving more importance to frequently occurring words in the training set.",
        "This way of LM corpus selection also allows us to obtain a more controlled language and helps us create translation outputs within the scope of the training corpus and the closely related LM corpus.",
        "We shuffle the LM corpus available before splitting and select from individual splits, to prevent extreme cases.",
