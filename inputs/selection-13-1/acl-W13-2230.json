        "Due to time constraints we did not deal with inflection for DE-EN and EN-DE.",
        "The morphological simplification process consists in lemmatizing inflected word forms and dealing with word formation (splitting portmanteau prepositions or compounds).",
        "This needs to take into account translation-relevant features (e.g. number) which vary across the different language pairs: while French only has the features number and gender, a wider array of features needs to be considered when modelling Russian (cf. table 6).",

        "This is particularly the case with German compounds, which are very productive and thus often lack coverage in the parallel training data, whereas the individual components can be translated.",
        "Similarly, inflected word forms (e.g. adjectives) benefit from the reduction to lemmas if the full inflection paradigm does not occur in the parallel training data.",
        "For EN-FR, a translation pair with a morphologically complex target language, we describe a two-step translation system built on non-inflected word stems with a post-processing component for predicting morphological features and the generation of inflected forms.",
