        "If coming across a passage that is obviously a mistranslation, any reader would probably start to doubt the reliability of the information in the whole article, even though the rest might be adequately translated.",
        "If the MT system had a QE component to mark translations as reliable or possibly erroneous, the reader would know to use information from passages marked as bad translations with caution, while still being able to trust other passages.",
        "In post editing a human translator could use translation quality annotation as an indication to whether editing the MT output or translating from scratch might be faster.",
        "Or he could use this information to decide where to start in order to improve the worst passages first or skip acceptable passages altogether in order to save time.",
        "Confidence scores can also be useful for applications such as cross lingual information retrieval or question answering.",
        "Translation quality could be a valuable ranking feature there.",
        "Most previous work in the field estimates confidence on the sentence level (e.g. Quirk et al.",
        "(2004)), some operate on the word level (e.g. Ueffing and Ney (2007), Sanchis et al. (2007), and Bach et al. (2011)), whereas Soricut and Echi-habi (2010) use the document level.",
        "Various classifiers and regression models have been used in QE in the past.",
        "Gandrabur and Foster (2003) compare single layer to Multi Layer Per-ceptron (MLP), Quirk et al. (2004) report that Linear Regression (LR) produced the best results in a comparison of LR, MLP and SVM, Gamon et al.",
        "(2005) use SVM, Soricut and Echihabi (2010) find the M5P tree works best among a number of regression models, while Bach et al. (2011) define the problem as a word sequence labeling task and use MIRA.",
        "The QE shared task was added to the WMT evaluation campaign in 2012 (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), providing standard training and test data for system development."
