        "In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework for sentence aligners, which is particularly suitable for noisy-data evaluation.",

        "Virtually all training pipelines of statistical machine translation systems expect training data to be in the form of a sequence of parallel sentence pairs.",
        "This means that a pair of parallel documents must first be segmented into a sequence of aligned sentence pairs, discarding or combining sentences when needed, and aligning sentences as appropriate.",
        "The performance and output of an SMT system is directly dependent on the amount and quality of available training data.",
        "Therefore, it is critical to perform this sentence alignment step properly, ensuring both high recall (to have as much training data as possible) and high precision (to avoid noisy training data).",
        "While sentence aligners achieve excellent performance on highly-parallel, clean data, the task is much more difficult under noisy conditions.",
        "Some prior work has investigated evaluation under noisy conditions (see section 6), but the major focus of prior work has been the clean-data scenario, where accuracy rates exceed 98% (e.g. Simard et al. (1993), Moore (2002)).",
        "For one thing, this meant that the various sentence alignment algorithms differ only slightly in absolute terms.",
        "Similarly, fine-tuning any one of those algorithms might not seem to have an impact on performance.",
        "More importantly, this also meant that we do not have a clear understanding of how well these algorithms would perform under noisy conditions.",
        "Arguably, there was little need to examine sentence alignment of noisy datasets in early MT research, since almost all training data came from high-quality, highly-parallel sources, such as UN documents or parliamentary proceedings.1 However, recent efforts have attempted to utilize web resources and non-perfectly-parallel texts, such as Wikipedia articles and news stories (e.g. Resnik and Smith (2003), Utiyama and Isahara (2003), Munteanu and Marcu (2005), and Smith et al. (2010)).",
        "Such resources naturally contain significantly more noise, at a level that would render sentence alignment a much less straightforward task.",
        "Because sentence alignment algorithms had usually been evaluated under a clean-data scenario, there are fewer empirical results to guide those who wish to extract parallel data from noisy 1Also, parallel datasets created explicitly for MT research (by having a source corpus translated into the target language) would be already sentence-aligned by mere construction if the source side is split into sentences beforehand.",
        "sources.",
        "Furthermore, there is also no easy way to fine-tune an aligner of interest.",
        "For building the Microsoft Translation service, we are continuously mining inherently-noisy web resources, from which we extract MT training data for dozens of the world's languages.",
        "Therefore, having a principled method to evaluate and fine-tune our aligner was critical.",
        "In this paper, we describe our framework for evaluating sentence alignment under noisy conditions.",
        "We use this framework to examine and evaluate the Moore alignment algorithm (Moore, 2002), which was empirically shown to be state-of-the-art under clean conditions, and which we regularly use to extract parallel data from web resources to create training data.",
        "We perform a comprehensive comparison of this aligner against two other algorithms, and furthermore use our framework to fine-tune the algorithm along dimensions of interest (such as the aligner's search parameters) by quantitatively evaluating how the aligner's performance is affected by such changes.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We briefly define sentence alignment and existing approaches in section 2.",
        "We then discuss the evaluation of alignment algorithms in section 3, and present our evaluation framework.",
        "In section 4, we perform a comparative assessment of three alignment algorithms using our framework, illustrating the differences between them under noisy conditions.",
        "In section 5, we present two additional applications of our framework, namely fine-tuning an aligner and performing training data cleanup.",
        "Finally, we give an overview in section 6 of prior work that has tackled the specific issue of evaluating sentence aligners."

        "lexicon that finds corresponding word pairs.",
        "In contrast to length-based algorithms, lexical-based approaches typically require external bilingual resources, and usually perform better.",
        "Previous work on sentence alignment varies across a few other dimensions as well.",
        "Some lexical-based algorithms build the needed bilingual resources from the very dataset that is to be aligned, whereas other approaches assume that such resources are externally provided.",
        "Another dimension is the need to provide anchor points within the text to be aligned, such as in the form of paragraph-level alignment.",
        "Such anchor points are typically needed to restrict the search space to a manageable size.",
        "Another group of aligners take a hybrid approach, relying both on sentence length and lexical similarity (e.g. Zhao and Vogel (2002)).",

        "This is preferable to accepting whatever default parameters are in already place, which are more than likely suitable for a specific domain, dataset, or low-to-nonexistent noise.",
        "We fine-tune the parameters of the MRE+ algorithm by optimizing its performance on a tuning dataset generated using the noisy deletion setup, and then measure its performance on a different evaluation set that was also generated using the noisy deletion setup.",

        "In addition to relying on length similarity and lexical correspondence, the MRE+ aligner also relies on a set of prior probabilities for each insert/delete/align action it could take.",
        "By default, the probability assigned to deletion and insertion was set at 0.02.",

        "For example, when considering a sentence halfway through the source side, only sentences that are close to the halfway point in the target side will be considered.",

        "This alignment threshold is the third dimension we optimize, as it should be lowered or increased to reflect our confidence in the translation model and/or the variability of the length-correspondence model.",
        "The results in Tables 2 and 3 show the benefit of optimizing the aligner's parameters.",
        "It is beneficial to optimize the prior probabilities and the alignment threshold, as indicated by higher recall rates compared to the default values.",
        "On the other hand, the tuning of the search beam size had minimal impact.",
        "This indicates that the mistakes made by the sentence aligner are usually model errors rather than search error.",

        "Contrast this with the low-noise scenario (Table 2), where optimizing the alignment threshold is at least equally important, if not more so.",
        "This is to be expected, since the default prior of 0.02 in the high-noise scenario significantly underestimates the amount of deletion that has actually taken place, making the prior the most important parameter to optimize.",

        "Of course, such tuning would not have been easy to perform, given the lack of a tuning dataset.",
