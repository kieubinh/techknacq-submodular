        "The Discriminative Word Lexicon (DWL) is a maximum-entropy model that predicts the target word probability given the source sentence words.",

        "While DWLs are able to model the global source information, they ignore the structure of the source and target sentence.",
        "We propose to include this structure by modeling the source sentence as a bag-of-n-grams and features depending on the surrounding target words.",
        "Furthermore, as the standard DWL does not get any feedback from the MT system, we change the DWL training process to explicitly focus on addressing MT errors.",
        "By using these methods we are able to improve the translation performance by up to 0.8 BLEU points compared to a system that uses a standard DWL."

        "One problem of this approach is that bilingual context is only modeled within the phrase pairs.",
        "Therefore, different approaches to increase the context available during decoding have been presented (Haque et al., 2011; Niehues et al., 2011; Mauser et al., 2009).",
        "One promising approach is the Discriminative Word Lexicon (DWL).",
        "In this approach, a discriminative model is used to predict the probability of a target word given the words in the source sentence.",
        "In contrast to other models in the phrase-based system, this approach is capable of modeling the translation probability using information from the whole sentence.",
        "Thus it is possible to model long-distance dependencies.",
        "But the model is not able to use the structure of the sentence, since the source sentence is modeled only as a bag-of-words.",
        "Furthermore, the DWL is trained to discriminate between all translation options without knowledge about the other models used in a phrase-based machine translation system such as the translation model, language model etc.",
        "In contrast, we try to feedback information about possible errors of the MT system into the DWL.",
        "Thereby, the DWLs are able to focus on improving the errors of the other models of an MT system.",
        "We will introduce features that encode information about the source sentence structure.",
        "Furthermore, the surrounding target words will also be used in the model to encode information about the target sentence structure.",
