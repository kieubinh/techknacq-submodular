        "Annotated corpora are essential for most research in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "For example, the development of treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank and the Penn Arabic Treebank, has been essential in pushing research on part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing of English and Arabic (Marcus et al., 1993; Maamouri et al., 2004).",
        "The creation of such resources tends to be quite expensive and time consuming: guidelines need to be developed, annotators hired, trained, and regularly evaluated for quality control.",
        "For languages with complex morphologies, limited resources and tools, and/or lack of standard grammars, such as any of the Dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties, developing annotated resources can be a challenging task.",
        "As a result, annotated resources developed under time/money constraints for such languages tend to tradeoff depth of representation with degree of noise.",
        "In the extremes, we find rich morphological representations that may be noisy and inconsistent or simple by highly consistent and reliable annotations that have limited usability.",
        "Furthermore, such resources are often developed by different research groups leading to many inconstancies that make pooling these resources not a very easy task.",
        "In this paper, we describe two general techniques to address the limitations of the two types of annotations: corrections of rich noisy annotations and extensions of clean but shallow ones.",
        "We present our work on Egyptian Arabic, an important Arabic dialect with limited resources, and rich and ambiguous morphology.",
        "Resulting from this effort is the largest Egyptian Arabic corpus annotated in one common representation by pooling resources from three very different sources: a non-final, pre-release version of the ARZ1 corpora from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) (Maamouri et al., 2012g), the LDC's CallHome Egypt transcripts (Gadalla et al., 1997) and CMU's Egyptian Arabic corpus (CMUEAC) (Mohamed et al., 2012).",
        "Although the paper focuses on Arabic, the basic problem is relevant to other languages, especially spontaneously written colloquial language forms such as those used in social media.",
        "The general solutions we propose are language independent given availability of specific language resources.",
        "Next we discuss some related work and relevant linguistic facts (Sections 2 and 3, respectively).",
        "Section 4 presents our annotation correction technique; and Section 5 presents out annotation extension technique.",
        "Finally, Section 6 presents some statistics on the Egyptian Arabic corpus annotated in one unified representation resulting from our correction and extension work."

        "Both supervised and unsupervised approaches have been used employing a variety of",

        "Our morphological extension effort is similar to Alkuhlani et al. (2013)'s work except that they start with tokenizations, reduced POS tags and dependency trees and extend them to full morphological information.",

        "In their work, they simply attempt to ?synchronize?",
        "unknown/malformed annotations with the morphological analyzer they use, thus forcing a reading on the word to make the unknown/malformed annotation usable.",
        "In our work, we address the cleaning issue directly.",
        "We intend to make these automatic corrections and extensions available in the future so that they can be used in future disambiguation tools.",
        "Maamouri et al. (2009) described a set of manual and automatic techniques used to improve on the quality of the Penn Arabic Treebank.",
        "Their work is most similar to ours except in the following aspects: we work only on morphology and for dialectal Arabic, whereas their work is primarily on syntax and standard Arabic.",
        "Furthermore, the challenge of malformed tags is not a major problem for them, while it is a core problem for us.",
        "Furthermore, we work with data that has partial annotations that we extend, while their work was for very rich syntax/morphology annotations."

        "As such, our general solution focuses on correcting closed classes (some stems and all of the affixes) by mapping them to in-vocabulary variants.",
        "We also use a set of language-specific preprocessing corrections for common orthographic variations (for all open and closed classes).",

        "For Arabic words and morphemes, we modify the cost of substitutions involving two phonologically or orthographically similar letters to count as half edits.",
        "We acquire the list of such letter substitutions from Eskander et al. (2013), who report them as the most frequent source of errors in Egyptian Arabic orthography.",

        "For example, the abstract morpheme representation for the correct version of the word in Figure 1 is Ha/FUT_PART+yi/IV3P+IV+uwA/IVSUFF_SUBJ:P. We will refer to this representation as the inflectional morph-tag (IMT).",
        "We build two models for this task.",

        "The output for our example is listed in Figure 3.",
        "We then replace the input POS and MORPH with the top ranked correction: Ha/FUT_PART+yi/IV3MS+IV+uh/IVSUFF_SUBJ:P at a cost of 4.0.",
        "The open class stem is not modified.",
        "Lemma Correction We generate a map that includes all the possible lemmas for every possible stem morpheme in CALIMA+SAMA.",
        "For a given ARZ word analysis, if the stem morpheme is in CALIMA+SAMA, then we pick the lemma from its corresponding lemma set.",
