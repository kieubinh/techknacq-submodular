        "While this is still far from the accuracy scores reported for modern language data, and also quite a bit worse than tagging on the gold-standard normalization (87.07% for this text), it offers a way to facilitate the (semi-automatic) POS annotation of historical texts with relatively minor effort.",
        "Furthermore, as it does not require a sizeable amount of training data, this approach is potentially interesting for less-resourced language varieties in general, assuming some level of graphematic similarity to a well-resourced target language.",
        "Future work should likely consider inclusion of token context for the normalization as proposed by Jurish (2010).",
        "Analysis of the POS tagging errors also highlighted some of the problems that remain.",
        "Domain-specific differences can negatively impact tagging performance even on perfectly normalized data.",
        "Furthermore, spelling normalization cannot account for semantic and syntactic peculiarities of historical language.",
        "For a corpus of Old Spanish, this led Sa?nchez-Marco et al. (2010) to abandon the normalization approach and use a customized POS tagger instead.",
        "On the other hand, a study by Dipper (2010) showed that normalization is still beneficial even when retraining a tagger on a corpus of historical data.",
        "Future research could try to combine a normalization step with a modified POS tagger to improve the results further."
