        "Over the past few years, there has been an increasing sophistication in the types of available natural language processing (NLP) tools, with named entity recognisers being complemented by relation and event extraction systems.",
        "Such relations and events are not intended to be understood in isolation, but rather they are arranged to form a coherent discourse.",
        "In order to carry out complex tasks such as automatic summarisation to a high degree of accuracy, it is important for systems to be able to analyse the discourse structure of texts automatically.",
        "To facilitate the development of such systems, various textual corpora containing discourse annotations have been made available to the NLP community.",
        "However, there is a large amount of variability in the types of annotations contained within these corpora, since different perspectives on discourse have led to the development of a number of different annotation schemes.",
        "Corpora containing discourse-level annotations usually treat the text as a sequence of coherent textual zones (e.g., clauses and sentences).",
        "One line of research has been to identify which zones are logically connected to each other, and to characterise these links through the assignment of discourse relations.",
        "There are variations in the complexity of the schemes used to annotate these discourse relations.",
        "For example, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) defines 23 types of discourse relations that are used to structure the text into complex discourse trees.",
        "Whilst this scheme was used to enrich the Penn TreeBank (Carlson et al., 2001), the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) used another scheme to identify discourse relations that hold between pairs of text spans.",
        "It categorises the relations into types such as ?causal?, ?temporal?",
        "and ?conditional?, which can be either explicit or implicit, depending on whether or",
        "not they are represented in text using overt discourse connectives.",
        "In the biomedical domain, the Biomedical Discourse Relation Bank (BioDRB) (Prasad et al., 2011) annotates a similar set of relation types, whilst BioCause focusses exclusively on causality (Miha?ila?",
        "et al, 2013).",
        "A second line of research does not aim to link textual zones, but rather to classify them according to their specific function in the discourse.",
        "Examples of functional discourse annotations include whether a particular zone asserts new information into the discourse or represents a speculation or hypothesis.",
        "In scientific texts, knowing the type of information that a zone represents (e.g., background knowledge, hypothesis, experimental observation, conclusion, etc.)",
        "allows for automatic isolation of new knowledge claims (Sa?ndor and de Waard, 2012).",
        "Several annotation schemes have been developed to classify textual zones according to their rhetorical status or general information content (Teufel et al., 1999; Mizuta et al., 2006; Wilbur et al., 2006; de Waard and Pander Maat, 2009; Liakata et al., 2012a).",
        "Related to these studies are efforts to capture information relating to discourse function at the level of events, i.e., structured representations of pieces of knowledge which, when identified, facilitate sophisticated semantic searching (Ananiadou et al., 2010).",
        "Since there can be multiple events in a sentence or clause, the identification of discourse information at the event level can allow for a more detailed analysis of discourse elements than is possible when considering larger units of text.",
        "Certain event corpora such as ACE 2005 (Walker, 2006) and GENIA-MK (Thompson et al., 2011) have been annotated with various types of functional discourse information.",
        "It has previously been shown that considering several functional discourse annotation schemes in parallel can be beneficial (Liakata et al., 2012b), since each scheme offers a different perspective.",
        "For a common set of documents, the cited study analysed and compared functional discourse annotations at different levels of textual granularity (i.e., sentences, clauses and events), showing how the different schemes could complement each other in order to lay the foundations for a possible future harmonisation of the schemes.",
        "The results of this analysis provide evidence that it would be useful to carry out further such analyses involving other such schemes, including an investigation of how discourse relations and functional discourse annotations could complement each other, e.g., which types of functional annotations occur within the arguments of discourse relations.",
        "There are, however, certain barriers to carrying out such an analysis.",
        "For example, a comparison of annotation schemes would ideally allow the different types of annotations to be visualised simultaneously or seamlessly merged together.",
        "However, the fact that annotations in different corpora are encoded using different formats (e.g., stand-off or in-line) and different encoding schemes means that this can be problematic.",
        "A solution to the challenges introduced above is offered by the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004), which defines a common workflow meta-data format facilitating the straightforward combination of NLP resources into a workflow.",
        "Based on the interoperability of the UIMA framework, numerous researchers distribute their own tools as UIMA-compliant components (Kano et al., 2011; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Hahn et al., 2008; Savova et al., 2010; Gurevych et al., 2007; Rak et al., 2012b).",
        "However, UIMA is only intended to provide an abstract framework for the interoperability of language resources, leaving the actual implementation to third-party developers.",
        "Hence, UIMA does not explicitly address interoperability issues of tools and corpora.",
        "U-Compare (Kano et al., 2011) is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) via which users can rapidly create NLP pipelines using a drag-and-drop mechanism.",
        "Conforming to UIMA standards, U-Compare components and pipelines are compatible with any UIMA application via a common and sharable type system (i.e., a hierarchy of annotation types).",
        "In defining this type system, U-Compare promotes interoperability of tools and corpora, by exhaustively modelling a wide range of NLP data types (e.g., sentences, tokens, part-of-speech tags, named entities).",
        "This type system was recently extended to include discourse annotations to model three discourse phenomena, namely causality, coreference and meta-knowledge (Batista-Navarro et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper, we describe our extensions to U-Compare, supporting the integration and visualisation of resources annotated according to multiple discourse annotation schemes.",
        "Our method",
        "decomposes pipelines into parallel sub-workflows, each linked to a different annotation scheme.",
        "The resulting annotations produced by each sub-workflow can be either merged within a single document or visualised in parallel views."

        "For this application, we used the ACE 2005 corpus, which consists of 599 documents coming from broadcast conversation, broadcast news, conversational telephone speech, newswire, weblog and usenet newsgroups.",
        "This corpus contains event annotations which have been enriched by attributes such as polarity (positive or negative), modality (asserted or other), generic-ity (generic or specific) and tense (past, present, future or unspecified).",
        "We treat the values of these attributes as functional discourse annotations, since they provide further insight into the interpretation of the events.",
        "We created a component that reads the event annotations in the corpus and maps them to U-Compare's type system.",
        "To obtain discourse relation annotations (which are not available in the ACE corpus) we employed an end-to-end discourse parser trained on the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Lin et al., 2012).",

        "consist of EntRel and NoRel types, in addition to the same first 11 explicit types mentioned above.",
        "We created a workflow consisting of the ACE corpus reader and the discourse parser (available in U-Compare as a UIMA web service).",

        "5 Correlations between discourse relations and functional discourse annotations Based on the merged annotation format described in the previous section, we computed cases in which at least one of the arguments of a discourse relation also contains an event.",
        "Figure 4 is a heatmap depicting the correlations between different types of discourse relations and the attribute values of ACE events that co-occur with these relations.",
        "The darker the colour, the smaller the ratio of the given discourse relation co-occurring with the specified ACE event attribute value.",
        "For instance, the Cause relation co-occurs mostly with positive events (over 95%) and the corresponding cell is a very light shade of green.",
        "These are discussed and exemplified below.",
        "In the examples, the following marking convention is used: discourse connectives are capitalised, whilst arguments are underlined.",
        "Event triggers are shown in bold, and cues relating to functional discourse categories are italicised.",
        "For all discourse relation types, at least 50% of co-occurring events are assigned the specific value of the Genericity attribute.",
        "Specific events are those that describe a specific occurrence or situation, rather than a more generic situation.",
        "In general, this high proportion of specific events is to be expected.",
        "The types of text contained within the corpus, consisting largely of news and transcriptions of conversions, would be expected to introduce a large amount of information about specific events.",
        "For two types of discourse relations, i.e.",
        "Condition and Concession, there are more or less equal numbers of specific and generic events.",
        "The nature of these relation types helps to explain these proportions.",
        "Conditional relations often describe how a particular, i.e., specific, situation will hold if some hypothetical situation is true.",
        "Since hypothetical situations do not denote specific instances, they will usually be labelled as generic.",
        "Concessions, meanwhile, usually describe how a specific situation holds, even though another (more generic) situation would normally hold, that would be inconsistent with this.",
        "For the Instantiation relation category, it may once again be expected that similar proportions of generic and specific events would co-occur within their arguments, since an instantiation describes a specific instance of a more generic situation.",
        "However, contrary to these",
        "functional discourse categories.",
        "A darker shade indicates a smaller percentage of instances of a discourse relation co-occurring with an event attribute.",
        "expectations, the ratio of specific to generic events is 3:1.",
        "A reason for this is that discourse arguments corresponding to the description of a spe",
        "cific instance may contain several different events, as illustrated in Example (1).",

        "In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence",
        "for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg.",
        "In terms of the Modality attribute, most discourse relations correlate with definite, asserted events.",

        "Indeed, for eight relation types, 100% of the corresponding events are positive.",
        "This can partly be explained by the fact that, in texts reporting news,",
        "there is an emphasis on reporting events that have happened, rather than events that did not happen.",
        "It can, however, be noted that events that co-occur with certain discourse relation types have a greater likelihood of having negative polarity.",
        "These relations include Contrast (9% of events having negative polarity) and Cause (5% negative events).",
        "Contrasts can include comparisons of positive and negative situations, as in Example (4), whilst for Causes, it can sometimes be relevant to state that a particular situation caused a specific event not to take place, as shown in Example (5).",

        "(5) His father didn't want to invade Iraq, BECAUSE of all these problems they?re having now.",
        "For most relation types, around 60% of their co-occurring events are annotated as describing past tense situations.",
        "This nature of newswire and conversations mean that this is largely to be expected, since they normally report mainly on events that have already happened.",
        "The proportion of events assigned the future tense value is highest when they co-occur with discourse relations of type Alternative.",
        "In this relation type, it is often the case that one of the arguments describes a possible future alternative to a current situation, as the case in Example (6).",
        "This possible information pattern for Alternative relations, where one of the arguments represents a currently occurring situation, would also help to explain why, even though very few events in general are annotated as present tense, almost 10% of events that co-occur with Alternative relations describe events that are currently ongoing.",
        "As for events whose Tense value is unspecified, two of the most common discourse relation types with which they occur are Condition and Concession.",
        "As exemplified above, Condition relations are often hypothetical in nature, meaning that no specific tense can be assigned.",
        "The generic argument of a Concession relation can also remain unmarked for tense.",
        "As in Example (3), it is not clear whether the effort to minimise civilian casualties has already been initiated, or will be initiated in the future.",

        "Given the level of variability in existing discourse-annotated corpora, it is meaningful for users to identify the relative merits of different schemes.",
        "In this paper, we have presented an extension of the U-Compare infrastructure that facilitates the comparison, integration and visualisation of documents annotated according to different annotation schemes.",
        "U-Compare constructs multiple and parallel annotation sub-workflows nested within a single workflow, with each sub-workflow corresponding to a distinct scheme.",
        "We have applied the implemented method to visualise the similarities and differences of two functional discourse annotation schemes, namely CoreSC and GENIA-MK.",
        "To demonstrate the integration of multiple schemes in U-Compare, we developed a workflow that merged event annotations from the ACE 2005 corpus (which include certain types of functional discourse information) with discourse relations obtained by an end-to-end parser.",
        "Moreover, we have analysed the merged annotations obtained by this workflow and this has allowed us to identify various correlations between the two different types of discourse annotations.",
        "Based on the intuition that there is complementary information across different types of discourse annotations, we intend to examine how the integration of multiple discourse schemes, e.g., features obtained by merging annotations, affects the performance of machine learners for discourse analysis."
