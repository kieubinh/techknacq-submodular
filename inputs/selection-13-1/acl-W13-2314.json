        "Anaphoric shell nouns (ASNs) such as this fact, this possibility, and this issue are common in all kinds of text.",
        "They are called shell nouns because they provide nominal conceptual shells for complex chunks of information representing abstract concepts such as fact, proposition, and event (Schmid, 2000).",
        "An example is shown in (1).",
        "(1) Despite decades of education and widespread course offerings, the survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains a dismal 6 percent or less worldwide.",
        "This fact prompted the American Heart Association last November to simplify the steps of CPR to make it easier for lay people to remember and to encourage even those who have not been formally trained to try it when needed.",
        "Here, the ASN this fact encapsulates the clause marked in bold from the preceding paragraph.",
        "ASNs play an important role in organizing a discourse.",
        "First, they are used metadiscursively to talk about the current discourse.",
        "In (1), the author characterizes the information presented in the context by referring to it as a fact ?",
        "a thing that is indisputably the case.",
        "Second, they are used as cohesive devices in a discourse.",
        "In (1), for example, this fact on the one hand refers to the proposition marked in bold, and on the other, faces forward and serves as the starting point of the following paragraph.",
        "Finally, as Schmid (2000) points out, like conjunctions so and however, ASNs may function as topic boundary markers and topic change markers.",
        "Despite their importance, ASNs have not received much attention in Computational Linguistics.",
        "Although there has been some effort to annotate certain anaphors with similar properties, i.e., demonstratives and the pronoun it (Byron, 2003; Artstein and Poesio, 2006), in contrast to ordinary nominal anaphora, there are not many annotated corpora available that could be used to study ASNs.",
        "Indeed, many questions of annotation of ASNs must still be answered.",
        "For example, the extent to which native speakers themselves agree on the resolution of such anaphors, i.e., on the precise antecedents, remains unclear.",
        "An essential first step in this field of research is therefore to clearly establish the extent of inter-annotator agreement on antecedents of ASNs as a measure of feasibility of the task.",
        "In this paper, we describe our methodology for annotating ASNs using crowdsourcing, a cheap and fast way of obtaining annotation.",
        "We also describe how we evaluated the feasibility of the task and the quality of the annotation, and the challenges we faced in doing so, both with regard to the task itself and the crowdsourcing platform we use.",

        "What to annotate?",
        "The question of ?what to annotate?",
        "as mentioned by Fort et al. (2012) is not straightforward for ASN antecedents, as the notion of markables is complex compared to ordinary nominal anaphora: the units on which the annotation work should focus are heterogeneous.5 Moreover, due to this heterogeneous nature of annotation units, there is a huge number of mark-ables (e.g., all syntactic constituents given by a syntactic parse tree).",
        "So there are many options to choose from, while only a few units are actually to be annotated.",
        "Moreover, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the syntactic type of an antecedent and the semantic type of its referent (Webber, 1991).",
        "For instance, a semantic type such as fact can be expressed with different syntactic shapes such as a clause, a verb phrase, or a complex sentence.",
        "Conversely, a syntactic shape, such as a clause, can function as several semantic types, including fact, proposition, and event.",
        "Lack of the notion of the right answer It is not obvious how to define clear and detailed annotation guidelines to create a gold-standard corpus for ASN antecedent annotation due to our limited understanding of the nature and interpretation of such antecedents.",
        "The notion of the right answer is not well-defined for ASN antecedents.",
        "Indeed most people will be hard-pressed to say whether or not to include the clause Despite decades of education and widespread course offerings in the antecedent of this fact in example (1).",
        "The main challenge is to identify the conditions when two different candidates for annotation should be considered as representing essentially the same concept, which raises deep philosophical issues that we do not propose to solve in this paper.",
        "For our purposes, we believe, this challenge could only be possibly tackled by the requirements of downstream applications of ASN resolution.",
        "5Occasionally, ASN antecedents are non-contiguous spans of text, but in this work, we ignore them for simplicity."

        "Considering the difficulties of ASN annotation discussed above, there were two main challenges involved in the annotation process: first, to find annotators who can annotate data reliably with minimal guidelines, and second, to design simple annotation tasks that will elicit data useful for our purposes.",
        "Now we discuss how we dealt with these challenges.",
        "Crowdsourcing We wanted to examine to what extent non-expert native speakers of English with minimal annotation guidelines would agree on ASN antecedents.",
        "We explored the possibility of using crowdsourcing, which is an effective way to obtain annotations for natural language research (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, we explored the use of CrowdFlower6, a crowdsourcing platform that in turn uses various worker channels such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "CrowdFlower offers a number of features.",
        "First, it offers a number of integrated quality-control mechanisms.",
        "For instance, it throws gold questions randomly at the annotators, and annotators who do not answer them correctly are not allowed to continue.",
        "To further minimize spammers, it also offers a training phase before the actual annotation.",
        "In this phase, every annotator is presented with a few gold questions.",
        "Only those annotators who get the gold questions right get admittance to do the actual annotation.",
        "Second, CrowdFlower chooses a unique answer for each annotation unit based on the majority vote of the trusted annotators.",
        "For each annotator, it assigns a trust level based on how she performs on the gold examples.",
        "The unique answer is computed by adding together the trust scores of annotators, and then picking the answer with the highest sum of trusts (CrowdFlower team, p.c.).",
        "It also assigns a confidence score (denoted as c henceforth) for each answer, which is a normalized score of the summation of the trusts.",
        "For example, suppose annotators A, B, and C with trust levels 0.75, 0.75, and 1.0 give answers no, yes, yes respectively for a particular instance.",
        "Then the answer yes will score 1.75 and answer no will score 0.75 and yes will be chosen as the crowd's answer with c = 0.7 (i.e., 1.75/(1.75 + 0.75)).",
        "We use these confidence scores in our analysis of inter-annotator agreement below.",
        "Finally, CrowdFlower also provides detailed annotation results including demographic information and trustworthiness of each annotator.",
        "Design of the annotation tasks With the help of well-designed gold examples, CrowdFlower can get rid of spammers and ensures that only reliable annotators perform the annotation task.",
        "But the annotation task must be well-designed in the first place to get a good quality annotation.",
        "Following the claim in the literature that with crowdsourcing platforms simple tasks do best (Madnani et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012), we split our annotation task into two relatively simple sequential annotation tasks.",
        "First, identifying the broad region of the antecedent, i.e., not the precise antecedent but the region where the antecedent lies, and second, identifying the precise antecedent, given the broad region of the antecedent.",
        "Now we will discuss each of our annotation tasks in detail.",
        "The first annotation task was about identifying the broad region of ASN antecedents without actually pinpointing the precise antecedents.",
        "We defined the broad region as the sentence containing the ASN antecedent, as the shell nouns we have chosen tend to have antecedents that lie within a single sentence.",
        "We designed a CrowdFlower experiment where we presented to the annotators ASNs from the ASN corpus with three preceding paragraphs as context.",
        "Sentences in the vicinity of ASNs were each labelled: four sentences preceding the anaphor, the sentence containing the anaphor, and two sentences following the anaphor.",
        "This choice was based on our pilot annotation: the antecedents very rarely occur more than four sentences away from the anaphor.",
        "The annotation task was to pinpoint the sentence in the presented text that contained the antecedent for the ASN and selecting the appropriate sentence label as the correct answer.",
        "If no labelled sentence in the presented text contained the antecedent, we suggested to the annotators to select None.",
        "If the antecedent spanned more than one sentence, then we suggested to them to select Combination.",

        "First, we consider 8 diverse annotators who work independently.",
        "Second, we use Crowd-Flower's quality-control mechanisms and hence allow only trustworthy annotators to annotate our texts.",
        "Regarding instructions, we take inter-annotator agreement as a measure for feasibility of the task, and hence we keep the annotation instruction as simple as possible.",
        "This could be a source of low agreement.",
        "The third possibility is hard instances.",
        "Our results show that the mental nouns issue and decision had many low-confidence instances, suggesting the difficulty associated with the interpretation of these nouns (e.g., the very idea of what counts as an issue is fuzzy).",
        "The shell noun decision was harder because most of its instances were court-decision related articles, which were in general hard to understand.",
        "Different strings representing similar concepts As noted in Section 4, the main challenge with the ASN annotation task is that different antecedent candidates might represent the same concept and it is not trivial to incorporate this idea in the annotation process.",
        "When five trusted annotators identify the antecedent as but X and three trusted annotators identify it as merely X, since CrowdFlower will consider these two answers to be two completely different answers, it will give the answer but X a confidence of only about 0.6. u?",
        "or ?",
        "with Jaccard and Dice will not consider this as a complete disagreement; however, the coefficients will register it as a difference.",
        "In other words, the difference functions used with these coefficients do not respond to semantics, paraphrases, and other similarities that humans might judge as inconsequential.",
        "One way to deal with this problem would be clustering the options that reflect essentially the same concepts before measuring the agreement.",
        "Some of these problems could also be avoided by formulating instructions for marking antecedents so that these differences do not occur in the identified antecedents.",
        "However, crowdsourcing platforms require annotation guidelines to be clear and minimal, which makes it difficult to control the annotation variations."
