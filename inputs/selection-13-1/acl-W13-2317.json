        "For historically unwritten languages, few textual resources exist for developing NLP applications such as machine translation engines.",
        "Even when audio resources are available, difficulties arise when converting sound to text (Robinson and Gadelii, 2003).",
        "Increasingly, however, with the widespread use of mobile phones, these languages are being written in social media such as Twitter.",
        "Not only can these languages be written in multiple scripts, but conversations, and even individual messages, often involve multiple languages.",
        "To build useful textual resources for documenting and translating these languages (e.g., bilingual dictionaries), tools are needed to assist in language annotation for this noisy, multiscript, multilingual form of communication.",
        "This paper presents the Dialect Annotation Tool (DATOOL), a graphical tool for annotating conversations consisting of short messages (i.e., tweets), and the results we obtain in using it to annotate tweets for Darija, an historically unwritten North African Arabic dialect spoken by millions but not taught in schools and lacking in standardardization and linguistic resources.",
        "The DATOOL can retrieve the conversation for each tweet on a user's timeline or via Apollo (Le et al., 2011) and display the discourse, enabling annotators to make more informed decisions.",
        "It has integrated classifiers for automatically annotating data so a user can either verify or alter the automatically-generated annotations rather than start from scratch.",
        "The tool can also export annotated data to GEPHI (Bastian et al., 2009), an open source network visualization tool with many layout algorithms, which will facilitate future ?code-switching?",
