        "Human corpus annotation is a difficult, time-consuming, and hence costly process.",
        "This motivates research into methods which reduce this cost (Leech, 1997).",
        "One such method consists of automatically pre-annotating the corpus (Marcus et al., 1993; Dandapat et al., 2009) using an existing system, e.g., a POS tagger, syntactic parser, named entity recognizer, according to the task for which the annotations aim to provide a gold standard.",
        "The pre-annotations are then corrected by the human annotators.",
        "The underlying hypothesis is that this should reduce annotation time while possibly at the same time increasing annotation completeness and consistency.",
        "We study here corpus pre-annotation in a specific setting, out-of-domain named entity annotation, in which we examine specific questions that we present below.",
        "We produced corpora and annotation guidelines for named entities which are both hierarchical and compositional (Grouin et al., 2011),1 and which we used in contrastive studies of news texts in French (Rosset et al., 2012).",
        "We want to rely on the same named entity definitions for studies on two types of data we did not cover: parliament debates (Europarl corpus) and regional, contemporary written news (L?Est Re?publicain), both in French.",
        "To help the annotation process we could reuse our system (Dinarelli and Rosset, 2011), but needed first to examine whether a system trained on one type of text (our first Broadcast News data) could be used to produce a useful pre-annotation for different types of text (our two corpora).",
        "We therefore set up the present study in which we aim to answer the following questions linked to this point and to related annotation issues: ?",
        "can a system trained on data from one specific domain be useful on data from another domain in a pre-annotation task?",
        "?",
        "does this pre-annotation help human annotators or bias them?",
        "?",
        "what importance can we give to the annotators?",
        "subjective assessment of the usefulness of the pre-annotation?",
        "?",
        "can we observe differences in the use of pre-annotation depending on the level of expertise of human annotators?",
        "Moreover, as the aforementioned annotation scheme is based on two annotation levels (entities and components), we want to answer these questions taking into account these two levels.",
        "We first examine related work on pre-annotation (Section 2), then present our corpora and annotation task (Section 3).",
        "We describe and discuss experiments in Section 4, and make subjective and 1Corpora, guidelines and tools are available through ELRA under references ELRA-S0349 and ELRA-W0073.",
        "quantitative observations in Sections 5 and 6.",

        "Facilitating human annotations has been the topic of a large amount of research.",
        "Two different approaches can be distinguished: active learning (Ringger et al., 2007; Settles et al., 2008) and pre-annotation (Marcus et al., 1993; Dandapat et al., 2009).",
        "Our work falls into the latter type.",
        "Pre-annotation can be used in several ways.",
        "The first is to provide annotations to be corrected by human annotators (Fort and Sagot, 2010).",
        "A variant consists of merging multiple automatic annotations before having them corrected by human curators to produce a gold-standard (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2011).",
        "The second type consists of providing clues to help human annotators perform the annotation task (Mihaila et al., 2013).",
        "This work addresses the first type, a single-system pre-annotation with human correction.",
        "An objective is to examine whether a system trained on one type of text can be useful to pre-annotate texts of a different type.",
        "Most previous studies have been performed on well-behaved tasks such as part-of-speech tagging on in-domain data, i.e., the model used for pre-annotating the target data had been trained on similar data.",
        "For instance, Fort and Sagot (2010) provide a precise evaluation of the usefulness of pre-annotation and compare the impact of different quality levels in POS taggers on the Penn TreeBank corpus.",
        "They first trained different models on the training part of the corpus and applied them to the test corpus.",
        "The pre-annotated test corpus was then corrected by humans.",
        "They reported gains in accuracy and inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The study focused on the minimal quality (accuracy threshold) of automatic annotation that would prove useful for human annotation.",
        "They reported a gain for human annotation when accuracy ranged from 66.5% to 81.6%.",
        "On the contrary, for a semantic-frame annotation task, Rehbein et al. (2009) observed no significant gain in quality and speed of annotation even when using a state-of-the-art system.",
        "Generally speaking, annotators find the pre-annotation stage useful (Rehbein et al., 2009; South et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011).",
        "Annotation managers consider that a bias may occur depending on how much human annotators trust the pre-annotation (Rehbein et al., 2009; Fort and Sagot, 2010; South et al., 2011).",
        "In their frame-semantic argument structure annotation, Rehbein et al. (2009) addressed a specific question considering a two-level annotation scheme: is the pre-annotation of frame assignment (low-level annotation) useful for annotating semantic roles (high-level annotation)?",
        "Although for the low-level annotation task they observed a significant difference in quality of final annotation, for the high-level task they found no difference.",
        "Most of these studies used a pre-annotation system trained on the same kind of data as those which were to be annotated manually.",
        "Nevertheless some system-oriented studies have focused on the results obtained by systems trained on one type of corpus and applied to another type of corpus, e.g., for a Latin POS tagger (Poudat and Longre?e, 2009; Skj?rholt, 2011) or for a CoNLL named entity tagger for German (Faruqui and Pado?, 2010) for which the authors noticed noticed a reduction of the F-measure when going from in-domain (newswire data, F=0.782 for their best system) to out-of-domain (Europarl data, F=0.656).",
        "One of our objectives is then to examine whether a system trained on one type of text can be useful to pre-annotate texts of a different type.",
        "We set up experiments to study precisely the possible induced bias and whether the level of experience of the annotators would make a difference in such a context.",
        "In this study, we used two different kinds of corpora, which were both different from the corpus used to train the pre-annotation system."

        "In this paper, we studied the interest of a pre-annotation process for a complex annotation task with only an out-of-domain annotation system available.",
        "We also designed our experiments to check whether the level of experience of the annotators made a difference in such a context.",
        "The experiment produced in the end a high-quality gold standard (8-way merge including 2 versions without pre-annotation) which enabled us to measure quantitatively the performance of every pre-annotation scheme.",
        "We noticed that the pre-annotation system proved relatively precise for such a complex task, with 79% correct pre-annotations, but with a poor recall at 56%.",
        "This may be a good operating point for a pre-annotation system to reduce bias though.",
        "In our quantitative experiments we found that the fullest pre-annotation helped most, both in terms of quality and annotation speed, even though the quality of the pre-annotation system varied depending on the annotation layer.",
        "This contradicted the feelings of the annotators who thought that a type-only pre-annotation was the most efficient.",
        "This shows that in such a setting self-evaluation cannot be trusted.",
        "On the other hand their remarks about the problems in the annotation guide itself seemed rather pertinent.",
        "When it comes to experts vs. novices, we noted that their behaviour and remarks were essentially identical.",
        "Experts were both better and faster at annotating, but had similar reactions to pre-annotation and essentially the same feelings.",
        "In conclusion, even with an out-of-domain system, a pre-annotation step proves extremely useful in both annotation speed and annotation quality, and at least in our setting, with a reasonably precise system (at the expense of recall) no bias was detectable.",
        "In addition, no matter what the annotators feel, as long as precision is good enough, the more pre-annotations the better.",
        "Pre-filtering either of our two levels did not help.",
        "Perspectives.",
        "Based upon this conclusion, we plan to use automatic pre-annotation in further annotation work, beginning with the present corpora.",
        "As a first use, we plan to propose a few changes to the annotation principles in the guidelines we used.",
        "To annotate existing corpora with these changes, automatic pre-annotation will be useful.",
        "As a second piece of future work, we plan to annotate new corpora with the existing annotation framework.",
        "We also plan to add new types of named entities (e.g., events) to extend the annotation of existing annotated corpora, using the pre-annotation process to reduce the overall workload."
