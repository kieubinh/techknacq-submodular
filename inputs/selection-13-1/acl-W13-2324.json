        "For simple tasks, crowd-sourcing involving very many annotators has recently attracted attention.1 For more difficult tasks, the standard setting still is to work with two or a few more annotators, train them well, and compute agreement, usually in terms of the kappa measure.",
        "In this paper, we study a different scenario, which may be called ?classroom annotation?",
        ": The group of annotators is bigger (in our example, 26), and there are no extensive training sessions: Students receive detailed written guidelines, there is a brief QA period, and annotation starts.",
        "In such a setting, one has to expect some agreement problems that are due to different abilities and different motivation of the students.",
        "Our goal is to develop methods for systematically studying the annotation results in such groups, to identify more or less competent subgroups, yet at the same time also learn about the difficulty of various aspects of the underlying annotation task.",
        "To this end, we investigate ways of ranking and clustering annotators.",
        "1See, for instance, Snow et al. (2008) or Bhardwaj et al. (2010) for strategies to analyse and cope with diverging performance of annotators in that scenario.",
        "Our task is the annotation of argumentation in short texts, which is somewhat similar to marking the rhetorical structure, e.g. in terms of RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al., 2003).",
        "Thus we are dealing with a relatively difficult task involving text interpretation.",
        "We devised an annotation scheme (which is more fully described elsewhere), and in order to study the feasibility, first ran experiments with short hand-crafted texts that collectively cover all the relevant phenomena.",
        "This is the setting we report in this paper.",

        "It not only gives an impression of the possible range of agreement, but also allows us to check for ambiguities in the guidelines: If there were stable alternative readings in the guidelines, we would expect multiple larger clusters that can only be merged at a lower level of ?.",
        "As the Figure shows, the clustering grows steadily, maximally incorporating clusters of two annotators, so we do not see the threat of ambiguity in the guidelines.",
        "Furthermore, the clustering conforms with central claim ordering in picking out the same set of six reliable and good annotators (with an average F1 of 0.76 for ?role+type?",
        "and of 0.67 for the full task compared to gold) and it conforms with both orderings in picking out similar sets of worst annotators.",
        "With this clustering we now have the possibility to investigate the agreement for subgroups of annotators.",

        "However, this value not only depends on the amount of confusion but also on the frequency of that categories7, which cannot be assume to be identical for different sets of annotators.",

        "Figure 6 shows the confusion rate for selected category pairs over the path from the best scoring to the maximal cluster.",
        "The confusion between rebutters and undercutters is already at a high level for the best six best annotators, but increases when worse annotators enter the cluster.",

        "Confusing undercutters and support on the opponents side is only a problem of the low-agreeing annotators, the confusion rate is nearly 0 for the first 21 annotators on the cluster path.",
