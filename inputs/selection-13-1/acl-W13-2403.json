        "Sentiment analysis of natural language texts is one of the fast-developing technologies of natural language processing.",
        "Many lexical resources and tools were created for sentiment analysis in English.",
        "But lately a lot of research work was initiated for sentiment analysis in other languages (Mi-halcea et al., 2007; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011; Pe?rez-Rosas et al., 2012).",
        "The development of sentiment analysis in Russian previously did not attract a lot of attention at international conferences.",
        "Besides, until recently, the interest to sentiment analysis within Russia was connected only with election campaigns.",
        "But now there is a considerable interest to sentiment analysis within Russia both from the research community and from the industry.",
        "Therefore during the last years, two workshops on the evaluation of sentiment analysis systems were organized within the framework of Russian Information Retrieval Seminar ROMIP1 .",
        "In many respects ROMIP seminars are similar to other international information retrieval events such as TREC and NTCIR, which have already conducted",
        "different sentiment analysis tracks.",
        "Besides, there are various shared tasks connected to the sentiment analysis like (Morante and Blanco, 2012; Pestian et al., 2012; Wu and Jin, 2010; Amigo?",
        "et al., 2012).",
        "In this paper we partly overview the sentiment analysis tasks proposed at ROMIP-2011 (Chetviorkin et al., 2012) and ROMIP-2012 (Chetviorkin and Loukachevich, 2013), the data prepared for evaluation (and therefore available for other interested researchers), and the results obtained by participants.",
        "In addition we summarize the results of two initiatives, compare them with the state of the art in English and describe some interesting issues connected to news-based sentiment analysis.",
        "We justify all our decisions about the conducted tracks based on the experience of the other researchers, who made the similar initiatives in English.",
        "ROMIP-2011 and ROMIP-2012 are unique events for Slavic languages and other European languages different from English.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we review papers on Russian sentiment analysis, not related to the ROMIP evaluations.",
        "In section 3 we consider sentiment analysis evaluation tasks proposed during ROMIP-2011, 2012 and consider the main results obtained by participants."

        "So in this track we tried to model a real-word task, when a classifier should be trained on available data, which can be quite different from the task data.",
        "The participants stressed that our track is more difficult than training and testing on the similar data, but agreed that this task setting is more realistic.",
        "For each domain a list of search queries was manually compiled and for each query a set of blog posts was extracted.",
        "Finally, results obtained for all queries were merged and sent to the participants.",
        "For the evaluation, annotators selected subjective posts related to three target domains, assessed the polarity of these posts and labeled them with three scores corresponding to different sentiment scales (two-class, three-class and five-class scales).",
        "The participants systems had to classify the reviews to two, three or five classes according to sentiment.",
        "The primary measures for evaluation of two and three class tasks were accuracy and macro-F1 measure.",
        "Macro-measures (Manning et al., 2008) were used because the majority of user reviews in blogs are positive (more than 80%).",
        "Macro-averaging means a simple average over classes.",
        "The five-class task was additionally evaluated with Euclidean distance measure, which is the quadratic mean between the scores of the al",
        "gorithm and the assessor scores.",
        "Practically all the best approaches in the review classification tasks used SVM machine learning method (Kotelnikov and Klekovkina, 2012; Pak and Paroubek, 2012; Polyakov et al., 2012).",
        "Besides, the best methods usually combined SVM with other approaches including manual or automatic dictionaries or rule-based systems.",
        "The best achieved results according to macro-F1 measure and Accuracy within ROMIP 2011 are presented in Table 1 and within ROMIP 2012 in Table 2.",
        "Observing the results of the open evaluation of sentiment analysis systems in Russian during two years we can make some conclusions about the state of the art performance and specific characteristics of the track.",
        "The average level in 2-class classification task according to Accuracy is near 90%, near 75% for 3-class classification task and near 50% for 5-class task.",
        "Such results are consistent with the state of the art performance in English.",
        "However these figures are slightly overestimated due to the skewness of the testing collections.",
        "This fact is the consequence of using blogs as a test set.",

        "Assessors annotated quotations as positive, neutral, negative, or mixed.",
        "After the annotation the quotations with mixed sentiment were removed from the evaluation.",
        "So the participating systems should classify quotations to three classes.",
        "This task is similar to sentiment classification of political quotations (Awadallah et al., 2012; Balasubramanyan et al., 2012) to pro and contra positions.",
        "In (Awadallah et al., 2012) authors state that short quotations are difficult for classification because useful linguistic features tend to be sparse and the same quotation can have different polarities for different topics.",
        "In our case the task was even more difficult because of unlimited topics and three-class classification.",
        "In ROMIP-2012 evaluation 4,260 quotations were prepared for training.",
        "For testing more than 120 thousand quotes were sent to participants, but real evaluation was made on the basis of 5,500 quotations randomly sampled and annotated from the testing set.",
        "An example of the quotation is as follows: Patriarch Kirill, says feminism is a ?very dangerous?",
        "phenomenon offering an illusion of freedom to women, who he says should focus on their families and children.",
        "In this task class distribution was rather balanced in comparison with the review classification task: 41% of quotes were negative, 32% of",
        "quotes were positive and 27% of quotes were neutral.",
        "For evaluation again macro-measures and accuracy were applied.",
        "The results of the participants are presented in",
        "sification of quotations according to the major class.",
        "In opposite to the review classification task, the leaders in the news-based classification were knowledge-based approaches.",
        "It is due to the absence of a large training collection appropriate for this task because of the broad scope of quotation topics.",
        "The authors of the best approach in this task report that their knowledge-based system has a considerable vocabulary including 15 thousand negative expressions, 7 thousand positive expressions, around 120 so-called operators (intensifiers and invertors) and around 200 neutral stop expressions including sentiment words as their components.",
        "The system has a small number of rules for aggregating scores of sentiment word and operator sequences (Kuznetsova et al., 2013).",
        "The second and third results in this task were obtained by a rule-based system with comparably small sentiment dictionaries but a rich rule set based on syntactic analysis (Panicheva, 2013).",
        "An interesting conclusion is that the size of sentiment dictionaries can be compensated with various syntactic rules, which allows handling the variety of situations in expressing sentiment.",
        "The results of this task can be compared with one of the recent studies on lexicon-based methods for sentiment analysis in English (Taboada et al., 2011).",
        "The text fragments in the paper and in ROMIP evaluation are rather equal by style (news quotes versus opinionated news sentences).",
        "We cannot directly compare the results of analogous systems in Russian and English, because we worked with 3 class classification problem (positive, negative, neutral) versus 2 class task in the paper, but available figures are the following: the accuracy of sentiment analysis systems in Russian is near 61.6% in the three-class task versus 71.57% for the two-class task in English."
