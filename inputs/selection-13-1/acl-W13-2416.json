        "Automatic detection and extraction of events from online news provide means for tracking the developments in the World politics, economy and other important areas of life.",
        "Event extraction is a branch of information extraction, whose goal is the automatic retrieval of structured information about events described in natural language texts.",
        "Events include interactions among different entities, to each of which an event-specific semantic role can be assigned.",
        "This role reflects the way in which the entity participates in the event and interacts with the other entities.",
        "For example, in the fragment ?Three people were injured in a building collapse?, the phrase ?three people?",
        "may be assigned a semantic role injured ?",
        "victim.",
        "The list of semantic roles depends on the adopted event model.",
        "The event extraction technology may decrease the information overload, it allows automatic conversion of unstructured text data into structured one, it can be used to pinpoint interesting news articles, also extracted entities and their corresponding semantic roles can provide brief summaries of the articles.",
        "Using lexico-syntactic knowledge is one of the promising directions in modeling the event-specific semantic roles (Hogenboom et al., 2011).",
        "While for English linear patterns seem to work quite well (Tanev et al., 2008), for other lan-guages,where word ordering is more free, cascaded grammars proved to improve the results (Zavarella et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, Slavic languages are more free-order than English; consequently, using cascaded grammars may be considered a relevant approach.",
        "In this paper we present an ongoing effort to build event extraction cascaded grammars for Bulgarian and Czech in the domain of violent news.",
        "To achieve this goal we put forward a semi-automatic approach for building of event extraction grammars, which uses several weakly-supervised algorithms for acquisition of lexical knowledge, based on distributional semantics and clustering.",
        "Moreover, the lexical knowledge is learned in the form of semantic classes, which then can be used as a basis for building of a domain-specific ontology.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous attempts to perform event extraction for Slavic languages, apart from the work presented in (Turchi et al., 2011).",
        "The importance of Czech and Bulgarian languages comes from the geopolitical positions of the countries where they are spoken: Czech Republic is in a central geographical position between Eastern and Western Europe; Bulgaria is on the borders of the European Union, on a crossroad between Europe and Asia, surrounded by different cultures, languages and religions.",
        "These geopolitical factors contribute to the importance of the news from Czech Republic and Bulgaria and consequently make automatic event extraction from these news an useful technology for political analysts.",
        "The paper has the following structure: In section 2 we make a short overview of the related ap",
        "proaches; in section 3 we describe our method for lexical and grammar learning; section 4 presents our experiments and evaluation for Bulgarian and Czech languages and section 5 discusses the outcome of the experiments and some future directions."

        "Our work is based on weakly supervised algorithms for learning of semantic classes and patterns, presented in (Tanev et al., 2009) and (Tanev and Zavarella, 2013); these approaches are based on distributional semantics.",
        "There are different other methods which use this paradigm: A concept and pattern learning Web agent, called NELL (Never Ending Language Learning) is presented in (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "Parallel learning of semantic classes and patterns was presented in (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "However these approaches do not try to derive grammars from the acquired resources, but stop at purely lexical level.",
        "Relevant to our approach are the grammar learning approaches.",
        "A survey of supervised and unsupervised approaches is presented in (D?Ulizia et al., 2011).",
        "The supervised ones require annotation of big amounts of data which makes the development process long and laborious.",
        "On the other hand, unsupervised methods try to generalize all the training data by using different heuristics like the minimal description length.",
        "Since for event extraction only specific parts of the text are ana-lyzed, in order to use unsupervised grammar acquisition methods for learning of event extraction grammars, one should collect the exact phrases which describe the events.",
        "In practice, this would transform the unsupervised methods into supervised ones.",
        "With respect to the state-of-the art grammar inference approaches, our method allows for more interaction between the grammar expert and the learning system.",
        "Moreover, our learning starts from lexical items and not from annotated texts, which decreases the development efforts."

        "The most important of these rules are shown in Table 2.",
        "Part of the event rule learning process is expansion of a seed set of verbs, and other words, referring to the considered event (in this case killing).For this task the semantic class expansion algorithm showed significantly lower accuracy with respect to expanding sets of nouns - only 5%.",
        "Nevertheless, the algorithm learned 54 Czech words, expressing killing and death.",
        "For Bulgarian we learned rules for detection of killing and its victims, but also rules for parsing of wounding events, arrests, targeting of people in violent events, kidnapping, and perpetrators of violent events.",
        "These rules encode 605 event patterns.",
        "Some of the rules are shown in Table 3."

        "In order to evaluate the performance of our grammars, we created two types of corpora: For the precision evaluation we created bigger corpus of randomly picked excerpts of news from Bulgarian and Czech online news sources.",
        "More precisely, we used 7?550 news titles for Czech and 12?850 news titles in Bulgarian.",
        "We also carried out a preliminary recall evaluation on a very small text collection: We manually chose sentences which report about violent events of the types which our grammars are able to capture.",
        "We selected 17 sentences for Czech and 28 for Bulgarian.",
        "We parsed the corpora with our EXPRESS grammars and evaluated the correctness of the extracted events.",
        "Since each event rule has assigned an event type and a semantic role for the participating people reference, we considered a correct match only when both a correct event type and a correct semantic role are assigned to the matched text fragment.",
        "Table 4 shows the results from our evaluation.",
        "The low recall in Czech was mostly due to the insufficient lexicon for people and the too simplistic grammar."

        "In this paper we presented a semi-automatic approach for learning of grammar and lexical knowledge from unannotated text corpora.",
        "The method is multilingual and relies on distributional approaches for semantic clustering and class expansion.",
        "We are currently developing event extraction grammars for Czech and Bulgarian.",
        "Preliminary evaluation shows promising results for the precision, while the recall is still quite low.",
        "One of the factors which influences the law recall was the insufficient number of different morphological word variations in the learned dictionaries.",
        "The morphological richness of Slavic languages can be considered by adding morphological dictionaries to the system or creating an automatic procedure which detects the most common endings of the nouns and other words and expands the dictionaries with morphological forms.",
        "Another problem in the processing of the Slavic languages is their relatively free order.",
        "To cope with that, often the grammar engineer should introduce additional variants of already learned grammar rules.",
        "This can be done semi-automatically, where the system may suggest additional rules to the grammar developer.",
        "This can be done through development of grammar meta-rules.",
        "With respect to other approaches, grammars provide transparent, easy to expand model of the domain.",
        "The automatically learned grammars can be corrected and extended manually with hand-crafted rules and linguistic resources, such as morphological dictionaries.",
        "Moreover, one can try to introduce grammar rules from already existing grammars.",
        "This, of course, is not trivial because of the different formalisms exploited by each grammar.",
        "It is noteworthy that the extracted semantic classes can be used to create an ontology of the domain.",
        "In this clue, parallel learning of a domain-specific grammars and ontologies could be an interesting direction for future research.",
        "The manual efforts in the development of the grammars and the lexical resources were mainly cleaning of already generated lists of words and manual selection and unification of word clusters.",
        "Although we did not evaluate precisely the invested manual efforts, one can estimate them by the size of the automatically acquired word lists and their accuracy, given in section Semi-automatic Learning of Lexica and Grammars.",
        "We plan to expand the Czech grammar with rules for more event types.",
        "Also, we think to extend both the Bulgarian and the Czech event extraction grammars and the lexical resources, so that it will be possible to detect also disasters, humanitarian crises and their consequences.",
        "This will increase the applicability and usefulness of our event extraction grammars."
