        "Bilingual lexicons play a vital role in many Natural Language Processing applications such as Machine Translation (Och and Ney, 2003) or Cross-Language Information Retrieval (Shi, 2009).",
        "Research on lexical extraction from multilingual corpora have largely focused on parallel corpora.",
        "The scarcity of such corpora in particular for specialized domains and for language pairs not involving English pushed researchers to investigate the use of comparable corpora (Fung, 1998; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2003).",
        "These corpora are comprised of texts which are not exact translation of each other but share common features such as domain, genre, sampling period, etc.",
        "The main work in this research area could be seen as an extension of Harris's distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954).",
        "It is based on the simple observation that a word and its translation are likely to appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp, 1995).",
        "Based on this assumption, the alignment method, known as the standard approach builds and compares context vectors for each word of the source and target languages.",
        "A particularity of this approach is that, to enable the comparison of context vectors, it requires the existence of a seed bilingual dictionary to translate source context vectors.",
        "The use of the bilingual dictionary is problematic when a word has several translations, whether they are synonymous or polysemous.",
        "For instance, the French word action can be translated into English as share, stock, lawsuit or deed.",
        "In such cases, it is difficult to identify in flat resources like bilingual dictionaries, wherein entries are usually unweighted and unordered, which translations are most relevant.",
        "The standard approach considers all available translations and gives them the same importance in the resulting translated context vectors independently of the domain of interest and word ambiguity.",
        "Thus, in the financial domain, translating action into deed or lawsuit would probably introduce noise in context vectors.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach which addresses the word ambiguity problem neglected in the standard approach.",
        "We introduce a use of a WordNet-based semantic similarity measure permitting the disambiguation of translated context vectors.",
        "The basic intuition behind this method is that instead of taking all translations of each seed word to translate a context vector, we only use the translations that are more likely to give the best representation of the context vector in the target language.",
        "We test the method on two specialized French-English comparable cor",
        "pora (financial and medical) and report improved results, especially when many of the words in the corpus are ambiguous.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the standard approach and recalls in some details previous work addressing the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "In section 3 we present our context disambiguation process.",
        "Before concluding and presenting directions for future work, we describe in section 4 the experimental protocol we followed and discuss the obtained results."

        "The basic intuition of their work is that a term and its translation share thematic similarities.",
        "Hazem and Morin (2012) recently proposed a method that filters the entries of the bilingual dictionary based upon POS-tagging and domain relevance criteria, but no improvements was demonstrated.",
        "Gaussier et al. (2004) attempted to solve the problem of different word ambiguities in the source and target languages.",
        "They investigated a number of techniques including canonical correlation analysis and multilingual probabilistic latent semantic analysis.",
        "The best results, with a very small improvement were reported for a mixed method.",
        "One important difference with Gaussier et al. (2004) is that they focus on words ambiguities on source and target languages, whereas we consider that it is sufficient to disambiguate only translated source context vectors.",
        "A large number of Word Sense Disambiguation WSD techniques were previously proposed in the literature.",
        "The most popular ones are those that compute semantic similarity with the help of existing thesauri such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",

        "In this work, we use this resource to derive a semantic similarity between lexical units within the same context vector.",

        "The approach we propose includes the three steps of the standard approach.",
        "As it was mentioned in section 1, when lexical extraction applies to a specific domain, not all translations in the bilingual dictionary are relevant for the target context vector representation.",
        "For this reason, we introduce a WordNet-based WSD process that aims at improving the adequacy of context vectors and therefore improve the results of the standard approach.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the lexical extraction process.",
        "Once translated into the target language, the context vectors disambiguation process intervenes.",
        "This process operates locally on each context vector and aims at finding the most prominent translations of polysemous words.",
        "For this purpose, we use monosemic words as a seed set of disambiguated words to infer the polysemous word's translations senses.",
        "We hypothesize that a word is monosemic if it is associated to only one entry in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "We checked this assumption by probing monosemic entries of the bilingual dictionary against WordNet and found that 95% of the entries are monosemic in both resources.",
        "Formally, we derive a semantic similarity value between all the translations provided for each polysemous word by the bilingual dictionary and all monosemic words appearing whithin the same context vector.",
        "There is a relatively large number of word-to-word similarity metrics that were previously proposed in the literature, ranging from path-length measures computed on semantic networks, to metrics based on models of distributional similarity learned from large text collections.",
        "For simplicity, we use in this work, the Wu and Palmer (1994) (WUP) path-length-based semantic similarity measure.",

        "In practice, since a word can belong to more than one synset in WordNet, we determine the semantic similarity between two words w1 and w2 as the maximum WupSim between the synset or the synsets that include the synsets(w1) and synsets(w2) according to the following equation:",

        "to disambiguate the word action.",

        "Our method provides a ranked list of translations for each polysemous word.",
        "A question that arises here is whether we should introduce only the best ranked translation in the context vector or consider a larger number of words, especially when a translations list contain synonyms (share and stock in Table 1).",
        "For this reason, we take into account in our experiments different number of translations, noted WN-Ti, ranging from the pivot translation (i = 1) to the seventh word in the translations list.",
        "This choice is motivated by the fact that words in both corpora have on average 7 translations in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "The baseline (SA) uses all translations associated to each entry in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Table 3a displays the results obtained for the corporate finance corpus.",
