        "A high-quality Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system can only be built with large quantities of parallel texts.",
        "Moreover, systems specialized in specific domains require in-domain training data.",
        "A well-known problem of SMT systems is that existing parallel corpora cover a small percentage of the possible language pairs and very few domains.",
        "We therefore need a language-independent approach for discovering parallel sentences in the available multilingual resources.",
        "This idea was explored intensively in the last decade with different text sources, generically called comparable corpora, such as news feeds, encyclopedias or even the entire Web.",
        "The first approaches focused merely on news corpora and were either based on IBM alignment models (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Fung and Cheung, 2004) or employing machine learning techniques (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul Rauf and Schwenk, 2011).",
        "The multilingual Wikipedia is another source of comparable texts, not yet thoroughly explored.",
        "Adafre and de Rijke (2006) describe two methods for identifying parallel sentences across it based on monolingual sentence similarity (MT and respectively, lexicon based).",
        "Fung et al. (2010) approach the problem by combining recall-and precision-oriented methods for sentence alignment, such as the DK-vec algorithm or algorithms based on cosine similarities.",
        "Both approaches have achieved good results in terms of precision and recall.",
        "However, we are interested in real application scenarios, such as SMT systems.",
        "The following approaches report significant performance improvements when using the extracted data as training material for SMT: Smith et al. (2010) use a maximum entropy-based classifier with various feature functions (e.g. alignment coverage, word fertility, translation probability, distortion).",
        "S?tefa?nescu et al. (2012) propose an algorithm based on cross-lingual information retrieval, which also considers similarity features equivalent to the ones mentioned in the previous paper.",
        "The presented approaches extract general purpose sentences, but we are interested in a specific topical domain.",
        "We have previously tackled the problem (Plamada and Volk, 2012) and encountered two major bottlenecks: the alignment algorithm for matching possible candidates and the similarity metric used to compare them.",
        "To our knowledge, existing sentence alignment algorithms (including the one we have employed in the first place) have a monotonic order constraint, meaning that crossing alignments are not",
        "allowed.",
        "But this phenomenon occurs often in Wikipedia, because its articles in different languages are edited independently, without respecting any guidelines.",
        "Moreover, the string-based comparison metric proved to be unreliable for identifying parallel sentences.",
        "In this paper we propose an improved approach for selecting parallel sentences in Wikipedia articles which considers all possible sentence pairs, regardless of their position in the text.",
        "The selection will be made by means of a more informed similarity metric, which rates different aspects concerning the correspondences between two sentences.",
        "Although the approach is language and domain-independent, the present paper reports results obtained through querying the German and French Wikipedia for Alpine texts (i.e. mountaineering reports, hiking recommendations, articles on the biology and the geology of mountainous regions).",
        "Moreover, we report preliminary results regarding the use of the extracted corpus for SMT training.",
        "2 Finding candidate articles The general architecture of our parallel sentence extraction process is shown in Figure 1.",
        "We applied the approach only to the language pair German-French, as these are the languages we have expertise in.",
        "In the project Domain-specific Statistical Machine Translation1 we have built an SMT system for the Alpine domain and for this language pair.",
        "The training data comes from the Text+Berg corpus2, which contains the digitized publications of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from 1864 until 2011, in German and French.",
        "This SMT system will generate the automatic translations required in the extraction process.",
        "The input consists of German and French Wikipedia dumps3, available in the MediaWiki format 4.",
        "Therefore our workflow requires a preprocessing step, where the MediaWiki contents are transformed to XML and then to raw text.",
        "Preprocessing is based on existing tools, such as WikiPrep5, but further customization is needed in order to correctly convert localized MediaWiki elements (namespaces, templates, date and number formats etc.).",
        "We then identify Wikipedia articles",
        "available in both languages by means of the inter-language links provided by Wikipedia itself.",
        "This reliable information is a good basis for the extraction workflow, since we do not have to worry about the document alignment.",
        "Upon completion of this step, we have extracted a bilingual corpus of approximately 400 000 articles per language.",
        "The corpus is subsequently used for information retrieval (IR) queries aiming to identify the articles belonging to the Alpine domain.",
        "The input queries contain the 100 most frequent mountaineering keywords in the Text+Berg corpus (e.g. Alp, Gipfel, Berg, Route in German and montagne, sommet, voie, cabane in French).",
        "This filter reduces the search space to 40 000 articles.",
        "Although we have refined our search terms by discarding the ones occurring frequently in other text types (e.g. meter, day, year, end), we were not able to avoid a small percentage of false positives.",
        "Once we extract the Alpine comparable corpus, we proceed to the extraction of",
        "parallel sentences, which will be thoroughly discussed in the following section.",
        "See (Plamada and Volk, 2012) for more details about the extraction pipeline.",
        "3 Finding parallel segments in Wikipedia articles The analysis of our previous results brought into attention many ?parallel?",
        "sentence pairs of different lengths, meaning that the shared translated content does not span over the whole sentence.",
        "As an example, consider the following sentences which have been retrieved by the extraction pipeline.",
        "Although they both contain information about the valleys connected by the Turini pass, the German sentence contains a fragment about its position, which has not been translated into French.",
        "DE: Der Pass liegt in der a?usseren, besiedelten Zone des Nationalpark Mercantour und stellt den U?bergang zwischen dem Tal der Be?ve?ra und dem Tal der Ve?subie dar.",
        "FR: Le col de Turini relie la valle?e de la Ve?subie a` la valle?e de la Be?ve?ra.",
        "If this sentence pair would be used for MT training, it would most probably confuse the system, because noisy word alignments are to be expected.",
        "Our solution to this problem is to split the sentences into smaller entities (e.g. clauses) and then to find the alignments on this granularity level.",
        "The clause boundary detection is performed independently for German and French, respectively, following the approach developed by Volk (2001).",
        "The general idea is to split the sentences into clauses containing a single full verb.",
        "Our alignment algorithm, unlike previous approaches, ignores the position of the clauses in the texts.",
        "Although Wikipedia articles are divided into sections, their structure is not synchronized across the language variants, since articles are edited independently.",
        "We have encountered, for example, cases where one section in the French article was included in the general introduction of the German article.",
        "If we would have considered sections boundaries as anchor points, we would have missed useful clause pairs.",
        "We therefore decided to use an exhaustive matching algorithm, in order to cover all possible combinations.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, we reduce the problem to a monolingual alignment task by using an intermediary machine translation of the source article.",
        "We decided that German articles should always be considered the source because we expect a better automatic translation quality from German to French.",
        "The translation is performed by our in-house SMT system trained on Alpine texts.",
        "The algorithm generates all possible clause pairs between the automatic translation and the targeted article and computes for each of them a similarity score.",
        "Subsequently it reduces the search space by keeping only the 3 best-scoring alignment candidates for each clause.",
        "Finally the algorithm returns the alignment pair which maximizes the similarity score and complies with the injectivity constraint.",
        "In the end we filter the results by allowing only clause pairs above the set threshold.",
        "We defined our similarity measure as a weighted sum of feature functions, which returns values in the range [0,1].",
        "The similarity score models two comparison criteria: ?",
        "METEOR score We used the METEOR similarity metric because, unlike other string-based metrics (e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)), it considers not only exact matches, but also word stems, synonyms, and paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011).",
        "Suppose that we compute the similarity between the following sentences in French: j?",
        "aimerais bien vous voir and je voudrais vous voir (both meaning I would like to see you).",
        "BLEU, which is a string-based metric, would assign a similarity score of 52.5.",
        "This value could hardly be considered reliable, given that the sentence ta voiture vous voir (paired with the first sentence) would get the same BLEU score, although the latter sentence (EN: your car see you) is obviously nonsense.",
        "On the other hand, METEOR would return a score of 90.3 for the original sentence pair, since it can appreciate that the two pronouns (je and j?)",
        "are both variations of the first person singular in French and that the predicates convey the same meaning.",
        "?",
        "Number of aligned content words However, METEOR scores can also be misleading, since they rely on automatic word alignments.",
        "Two sentences are likely to receive a high similarity score when they share many aligned words.",
        "However, the alignments are not always reliable.",
        "We often saw",
        "sentence pairs with a decent Meteor score where only some determiners, punctuation signs or simple word collocations (e.g. de la montagne (EN: of the mountain)) were matched.",
        "As an illustration, consider the following sentence pair and its corresponding alignment: Hyp: les armoiries , le de?sir de la ville de breslau par ferdinand i. le 12 mars 1530 a Ref: le 19 juin 1990 , le conseil municipal re?tablit le blason original de la ville 2-4 3-5 5-12 6-13 7-14 13-0 Although the sentences are obviously not semantically equivalent (a fact also suggested by the sparse word alignments), the pair receives a METEOR score of 0.23.",
        "We decided to compensate for this by counting only the aligned pairs which link content words and dividing them by the total number of words in the longest sentence from the considered pair.",
        "In the example above, only one valid alignment (7-14) can be identified, therefore the sentence pair will get a partial score of 1/18.",
        "In this manner we can ensure the decrease of the initial similarity score.",
        "Additionally, we have defined a token ratio feature to penalize the sentence length differences.",
        "Although a length penalty is already included in the METEOR score, we still found false candidate pairs with exceedingly different lengths.",
        "Therefore we decided to use this criterion as a selection filter rather than including it in the similarity function, in order to increase the chances of other candidates with similar length.",
        "Even if no other candidate will pass all the filters, at least we expect the precision to increase, since we will have one false positive less.",
        "The final formula for the similarity score between two clauses src in the source language and, respectively trg in the target language is: score(src, trg) = w1 ?",
        "s1 + (1?",
        "w1) ?",
        "s2 (1) where s1 represents the METEOR score and s2 the alignment score.",
        "The weights, as well as the final threshold are tuned to maximize the correlation with human judgments.",
        "We modeled the task as a minimization problem, where the function value increases by 1 for each correctly selected clause pair and decreases by 1 for each wrong pair.",
        "The solution (consisting of the individual weights and the threshold) is found using a brute force approach, for which we employed the scipy.optimize package from Python.",
        "The training set consists of an article with 1300 clause pairs, 25 of which are parallel and the rest non-parallel.",
        "We chose this distribution of the useful/not useful clauses because this corresponds to the real distribution observed in Wikipedia articles.",
        "In the best configuration, we retrieve 23 good clause pairs and 1 wrong.",
        "This corresponds to a precision of 95% and a recall of 92% on this small test set.",
        "However, we can influence the quantity of extracted parallel clauses by manually adjusting the final filter threshold.",
        "Figure 2 depicts the size variations of the resulting corpus at different thresholds, where the relative frequency is represented on a logarithmic scale.",
        "We notice that the rate of decrease is linear in the log scale of the number of extracted clause pairs.",
        "We start at a similarity score of 0.2 because the pairs below this threshold are too noisy.",
        "The data between 0.2 and 0.3 is already mixed, as it will be shown in the following sections.",
        "However, since this data segment contains approximately twice as much data as the summed superior ones, we decided to include it in",
        "pairs at different thresholds Table 1 presents German-French clause pairs with their corresponding similarity scores.",
        "On the top we can find rather short clauses (up to 10 words) with perfectly aligned words.",
        "One expects that the decrease of the values implies that",

        "Nevertheless, we consider this pair a good candidate for the parallel corpus.",
        "Pair number 8 has the same coordinates (i.e. an extra tail in the German variant), yet it receives a lower score, which might disqualify it for the final list, if we only look at the numbers.",
        "In this case, the low score is caused by the German compounds (Vulkanbauten, Hocheifel), which are unknown to the SMT system, therefore they are left untranslated and cannot be aligned.",

        "This fact is confirmed by the first part of the table.",

        "The accuracy of the extraction procedure can be improved by means of a more informed similarity metric, weighting more feature functions.",
        "Moreover, we can bypass the manual choice of thresholds by employing a classifier (e.g. SVMlight (Joachims, 2002)).",
        "Additionally, we could try to align even shorter sentence fragments (not necessarily linguistically motivated).",
        "We are confident that Wikipedia can be seen as a useful resource for SMT, but further investigation is needed in order to find the best method to exploit the extracted data in a SMT scenario.",
        "For this purpose, quality data should be preferred over sizable data.",
        "We would therefore like to experiment with different ratio combinations of the data sets (Wikipedia extracted and in-domain data) until we find a combination which outperforms our in-domain baseline system."
