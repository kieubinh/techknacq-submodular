        "This paper presents an efficient approach to finding more bilingual webpage pairs with high credibility via link analysis, using little prior knowledge or heuristics.",
        "It extends from a previous algorithm that takes the number of bilingual URL pairs that a key (i.e., a URL pairing pattern) can match as the objective function to search for the best set of keys yielding the greatest number of webpage pairs within targeted bilingual websites.",
        "Enhanced algorithms are proposed to match more bilingual web-pages following the credibility based on statistical analysis of the link relationship of the seed websites available.",
        "With about 12,800 seed websites as test set, the enhanced algorithms improve precision over baseline by more than 5%, from 94.06% to 99.40%, and hence find above 20% more true bilingual URL pairs, illustrating that significantly more bilingual webpages with high credibility can be mined with the help of the link analysis."

        "Parallel corpora of bilingual text (bitext) are indispensable language resources for many data-driven tasks of natural language processing, such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), cross-language information retrieval (Davis and Dunning, 1995; Oard, 1997), and bilingual lexical acquisition (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 1997; Jiang et al., 2009), to name but a few.",
        "A general way to develop such corpora from web texts starts from exploring the structure of known bilingual websites, which are usually organized ?Performed while a research associate at City University of Hong Kong.",
        "?Performed while a visiting student at City University of Hong Kong.",
        "by their web masters in a way to facilitate both navigation and maintenance (Nie, 2010).",
        "The most common strategy is to create a parallel structure in terms of URL hierarchies, exploiting some known naming conventions for webpages of corresponding languages (Huang and Tilley, 2001; Nie, 2010).",
        "Following available structures and naming conventions, researchers have been exploring various means to mine parallel corpora from the web and a good number of such systems have demonstrated the feasibility and practicality in automatic acquisition of parallel corpora from bilingual and/or multilingual web sites, e.g., STRAND (Resnik, 1998; Resnik, 1999; Resnik and Smith, 2003), BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), PTMiner (Chen and Nie, 2000), PTI (Chen et al., 2004), WPDE (Zhang et al., 2006), the DOM tree alignment model (Shi et al., 2006), PagePairGetter (YE et al., 2008) and Bitextor (Espla`-Gomis and For-cada, 2010).",
        "Most of these systems are run in three steps: first, bilingual websites are identified and crawled; second, pairs of parallel webpages are extracted; and finally, the extracted pairs are validated (Kit and Ng, 2007).",
        "Among them, prior knowledge about parallel webpages, mostly in the form of ad hoc heuristics for identifying webpage languages or predefined patterns for matching or computing similarity between webpages, is commonly used for webpage pair extraction (Chen and Nie, 2000; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Yulia and Shuly, 2010; Toma's et al., 2008).",
        "Specifically, these systems exploit search engines and heuristics across webpage anchors to locate candidate bilingual websites and then identify webpage pairs based on predefined URL matching patterns.",
        "However, ad hoc heuristics cannot exhaust all possible patterns.",
        "Many webpages do not even have any language label in their anchors, not to mention many untrustworthy labels.",
        "Also, using a limited set of pre",
        "defined URL patterns inevitably means to give up all reachable bilingual webpages that fall outside their coverage.",
        "Addressing such weaknesses of the previous approaches, we instead present an efficient bilingual web mining system based on analyzing link relationship of websites without resorting to prior ad hoc knowledge.",
        "This approach extends, on top of re-engineering, the previous work of Kit and Ng (2007).",
        "It aims at (1) further advancing the idea of finding bilingual webpages via automatic discovery of non-ad-hoc bilingual URL pairing patterns, (2) applying the found pairing patterns to dig out more bilingual webpage pairs, especially those involving a deep webpage unaccessible by web crawling, (3) discovering more bilingual websites (and then more bilingual webpages) with high credibility via statistical analysis of bilingual URL patterns and link relationship of available seed websites.",
        "The results from our experiments on 12, 800 seed websites show that the proposed algorithms can find considerably more bilingual webpage pairs on top of the baseline, achieving a significant improvement of pairing precision by more than 5%."

        "Our current research is conducted on top of the reimplementation of the intelligent web agent to automatically identify bilingual URL pairing patterns as described in Kit and Ng (2007).",
        "The underlying assumption for this approach is that rather than random matching, parallel webpages have static pairing patterns assigned by web masters for engineering purpose and these patterns are put in use to match as many pairs of URLs as possible within the same domain.",
        "Given a URL u from the set U of URLs of the same domain, the web agent goes through the set U?",
        "{u} of all other URLs and finds among them all those that differ from u by a single token1 ?",

        "a special set of characters including slash /, dot ., hyphen -, and underscore in a URL.",
        "Then, the single-token difference of a candidate URL pairs is taken as a candidate of URL paring pattern, and all candidate patterns are put in competition against each other in a way to allow a stronger one (that matches more candidate URL pairs) to win over a weaker one (that matches fewer).",
        "For instance, the candidate pattern <en,zh> can be detected from the following candidate URL pair:",
        "The reimplementation has achieved a number of improvements on the original algorithm through re-engineering, including the following major ones.",
        "1.",
        "It is enhanced from token-based to character-based URL matching.",
        "Thus, more general patterns, such as <e,c>, can be aggregated from a number of weaker ones like <1e,1c>, <2e,2c>, ..., etc., many of which may otherwise fail to survive the competition.",
        "2.",
        "The original algorithm is speeded up from O(|U |2) to O(|U |) time, by building inverted indices for URLs and establishing constant lookup time for shortest matching URL strings.2 3.",
        "The language detection component has been expanded from bilingual to multilingual and",
        "hence had the capacity to practically handle multilingual websites such as those from EU and UN.",
        "When detected URL patterns are used to match URLs in a web domain for identifying bilingual webpages, noisy patterns (most of which are presumably weak keys) would better be filtered out.",
        "A straightforward strategy to do this is by thresh-olding the credibility of a pattern, which can be defined as",
        "where N(p, w) is the number of webpages matched into pairs by pattern p within website w, and |w |the size ofw in number of webpages.",
        "Note that this is the local credibility of a key with respect to a certain website w. Empirically, Kit and",
        "Ng (2007) set a threshold of 0.1 to rule out weak noisy keys.",
        "Some patterns happen to generalize across domains.",
        "The global credibility of such a pattern p is thus computed by summing over all websites involved, in a way that each webpage matched by p is counted in respect to the local credibility of p in the respective website:",
        "C(p, w)N(p, w).",
        "Interestingly, it is observed that many weak keys ruled out by the threshold 0.1 are in fact good patterns with a nice global credibility value.",
        "In practice, it is important to ?rescue?",
        "a local weak key with strong global credibility.",
        "A common practice is to do it straightforwardly with a global credibility threshold, e.g., C(p)> 500 as for the current work.",
        "Finally, the bilingual credibility of a website is defined as",
        "C(p, w).",
