        "In the last decade, there is a growing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to historical texts due to the increased availability of these texts in digital form (Sporleder, 2010; Sa?nchez-Marco et al., 2011; Piotrowski, 2012).",
        "The specific linguistic properties of historical texts, such as nonstandard orthography, grammar and abbreviations, pose special challenges for NLP.",
        "One of this challenges, which has not been addressed so far, is the problem of bridging the lexical gap between modern and ancient language.",
        "In this paper, we address the interesting task of cross-period thesaurus (a.k.a.",
        "diachronic thesaurus) construction.",
        "A thesaurus usually contains thousands of entries, denoted here as target terms.",
        "Each entry includes a list of related terms, covering various semantic relations.",
        "A cross-period thesaurus aims to enable the potential user to search for a modern term and get related terms from earlier periods.",
        "Thus, in a cross-period thesaurus the target terms are modern while their related terms are ancient.",
        "In many cases, while the actual modern term (or its synynom) does not appear in earlier historical periods, different aspects of that term were mentioned.",
        "For example, in our Jewish historical corpora, the modern term birth control, has no equivalent ancient term, However, different contraceptive methods were described in our historical texts that are semantically similar to birth control.",
        "Thus, a related term is considered similar to the target term when it refers to the same concept.",
        "The goal of our research is to support constructing a high-quality publishable thesaurus, as a cultural resource on its own, alongside being a useful tool for supporting searches in the domain.",
        "Since the precision of fully automatically-constructed thesauri is typically low (e.g. (Mi-halcea et al., 2006)), we present a semi-automatic setting for supporting thesaurus construction by a domain expert lexicographer.",
        "Our recall-oriented setting assumes that manual effort is worthwhile for increasing recall as long as it is being utilized effectively.",
        "Corpus-based thesaurus construction is an active research area (Curran and Moens, 2002; Kilgarriff, 2003; Rychly?",
        "and Kilgarriff, 2007; Liebeskind et al., 2012; Zohar et al., 2013).",
        "Typically, two statistical approaches for identifying semantic relatedness between words were investigated: first-order (co-occurrence-based) similarity and second-order (distributional) similarity (Lin, 1998; Gasperin et al., 2001; Weeds and Weir, 2003; Kotlerman et al., 2010).",
        "In this research, we focus on statistical measures of first-order similarity (see Section 2).",
        "These methods were found to be effective for thesaurus construction as standalone methods and as complementary to second-order methods (Peirsman et al., 2008).",
        "First-order measures assume that words that frequently occur together are topically related (Schu?tze and Peder-sen, 1997).",
        "Thus, co-occurrence provides an appropriate approach to identify highly related terms for the thesaurus entries.",
        "In general, there are two types of historically-relevant corpora: ancient corpora of ancient language, and modern corpora with references and mentions to ancient language (termed here mixed corpora).",
        "Since in our setting the thesaurus?",
        "target terms are modern terms, which do not appear in ancient corpora, co-occurrence methods would be directly applicable only over a mixed corpus.",
        "In a preliminary experiment, we applied the Liebeskind et al. (2012) algorithmic scheme, which applies first-order similarity and morphological aspects of corpus-based thesaurus construction, on a mixed corpus of our historical domain.",
        "We observed that the target terms had low frequency in this corpus.",
        "Since statistical co-occurrence measures have poor performance over low statistics, the experiment's results were not satisfactory.",
        "We therefore looked for ways to increase the number of documents in the statistical extraction process, and decided that applying query expansion (QE) techniques might be a viable solution.",
        "We recognized two potential types of sources of lexical expansions for the target terms.",
        "The first is lexical resources available over the internet for extracting different types of semantic relations (Shnarch et al., 2009; Bollegala et al., 2011; Hashimoto et al., 2011).",
        "The second is lists of related terms extracted from a mixed corpus by a first-order co-occurrence measure.",
        "These lists contain both ancient and modern terms.",
        "Although only ancient terms will be included in the final thesaurus, modern terms can be utilized for QE to increase thesaurus coverage.",
        "Furthermore, expanding the target term with ancient related terms enables the use of ancient-only corpora for co-occurrence extraction.",
        "Following these observations, we present an iterative interactive QE scheme for bootstrapping thesaurus construction.",
        "This approach is used to bridge the lexical gap between modern and ancient terminology by means of statistical co-occurrence approaches.",
        "We demonstrate the empirical advantage of our scheme over a cross-period Jewish domain and evaluate its impact on recall and on the effectiveness of the lexicographer manual effort.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we start with a description of the statistical thesaurus construction method that we utilize in our scheme.",
        "Our main contribution of the iterative scheme is described in Section 3, followed by a case-study in Section 4 and evaluation and summary in Sections 5 and 6."

        "We assume that the top ranked candidates will be further examined (manually) by a lexicographer, who will select the eventual related terms for the thesaurus entry.",
        "Statistical measures of first-order similarity (word co-occurrence), such as Dice coefficient (Smadja et al., 1996) and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), were commonly used to extract ranked lists of candidate related terms.",
        "These measures consider the number of times in which each candidate term co-occurs with the target term, in the same document, relative to their total frequencies in the corpus.",
        "In our setting, we construct a thesaurus for a morphologically rich language (Hebrew).",
        "Therefore, we followed the Liebeskind et al. (2012) algorithmic scheme designed for these cases, summarized below.",
        "First, our target term is represented in its lemma form.",
        "For each target term we retrieve all the corpus documents containing this given target term.",
        "Then, we define a set of candidate terms, which are represented in their surface form, that consists of all the terms in all these documents.",
        "Next, the Dice co-occurrence score between the target term and each of the candidates is calculated, based on their document-level statistics in the corpus.",
        "After sorting the terms based on their scores, the highest rated candidate terms are clustered into lemma-based clusters.",
        "Finally, we rank the clusters by summing the co-occurrence scores of their members and the highest rated clusters constitute the candidate terms for the given target term, to be presented to a domain expert."

        "In this work, we assume that a list of modern target terms is given as input.",
        "Then, we automatically extract a ranked list of candidate related terms for each target term using statistical measures, as detailed in Section 2.",
        "Notice that at this first step related terms can be extracted only from the mixed",
        "corpora, in which the given (modern) target term may occur.",
        "Next, a lexicographer manually selects, from the top ranked candidates, ancient related terms for the thesaurus entry as well as terms for QE.",
        "The QE terms may be either ancient or modern terms from the candidate list, or terms from a lexical resource.",
        "Our iterative QE scheme iterates over the QE terms.",
        "In each iteration, a QE term replaces the target term's role in the statistics extraction process.",

        "Notice that if the QE term is modern, only the mixed corpora can be utilized.",
        "However, if the QE term is ancient, the ancient corpora are also utilized and may contribute additional related terms.",
        "The algorithmic scheme we developed for thesaurus construction is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Our input is a modern target term.",
        "First, we automatically extract candidates by statistical co-occurrence measures, as described in Section 2.",
        "Then, a domain-expert annotates the candidates.",
        "The manual selection process includes two decisions on each candidate (either modern or ancient): (i) whether the candidate is related to the target term and should be included in its thesaurus entry, and (ii) whether this candidate can be used as a QE term for the original target term.",
        "The second decision provides input to the QE process, which triggers the subsequent iterations.",
        "Following the first decision we filter the modern terms and include only ancient ones in the actual thesaurus.",
        "The classification of a candidate term as ancient or modern is done automatically by a simple classification rule: If a term appears in an ancient corpus, then it is necessarily an ancient term; otherwise, it is a modern term (notice that the converse is not true, since an ancient term might appear in modern documents).",
        "In parallel to extracting candidate related terms from the corpus, we extract candidate terms also from our lexical resources, and the domain expert judges their fitness as well.",
        "Our iterative process is applied over the expansions list.",
        "In each iteration, we take out an expansion term and automatically extract related candidates for it.",
        "Then, the annotator selects both ancient related terms for the thesaurus and suitable terms, either modern or ancient, for the expansion list for further iterations.",
        "For efficiency, only new candidates that were not judged in pervious iterations are given for judgement.",
        "The stopping criterion is when there are no additional expansions in the expansions list.",
        "Since the scheme is recall-oriented, the aim of the annotation process is to maximize the thesaurus coverage.",
        "In each iteration, the domain expert annotates the extracted ranked list of candidate terms until k sequential candidates were judged as irrelevant.",
        "This stopping criterion for each iteration controls the efforts to increase recall while maintaining a low, but reasonable precision.",
        "In our setting, we extract ancient related terms for modern terms.",
        "Therefore, in order to utilize co-occurrence statistics extraction, our scheme requires both ancient and mixed corpora, where the first iteration utilizes only the mixed corpora.",
        "Then, our iterative scheme enables subsequent iterations to utilize the ancient corpora as well."
