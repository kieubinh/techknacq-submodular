        "A current increasing trend in machine translation is to combine data-driven and rule-based techniques.",
        "Such combinations typically involve the hybridization of different paradigms such as, for instance, the introduction of linguistic knowledge into statistical paradigms, the incorporation of data-driven components into rule-based paradigms, or the pre-and post-processing of either sort of translation system outputs.",
        "Aiming at bringing together researchers and practitioners from the different multidisciplinary areas working in these directions, as well as at creating a brainstorming and discussion venue for Hybrid Translation approaches, the Hy-Tra initiative was born.",

        "Machine translation (MT) has continuously been evolving from different perspectives.",
        "Early systems were basically dictionary-based.",
        "These approaches were further developed to more complex systems based on analysis, transfer and generation.",
        "The objective was to climb up (and down) in the well-known Vauquois pyramid (see Figure 1) to facilitate the transfer phase or to even minimize the transfer by using an interlingua system.",
        "But then, corpus-based approaches irrupted, generating a turning point in the field by putting aside the analysis, generation and transfer phases.",
        "Although there had been such a tendency right from the beginning (Wilks, 1994), in the last",
        "Wikipedia).",
        "years, the corpus-based approaches have reached a point where many researchers assume that relying exclusively on data might have serious limitations.",
        "Therefore, research has focused either on syntactical/hierarchical-based methods or on trying to augment the popular phrase-based systems by incorporating linguistic knowledge.",
        "In addition, and given the fact that research on rule-based has never stopped, there have been several proposals of hybrid architectures combining both rule-based and data-driven approaches.",
        "In summary, there is currently a clear trend towards hybridization, with researchers adding morphological, syntactic and semantic knowledge to statistical systems, as well as combining data-driven methods with existing rule-based systems.",
        "In this paper we provide a general overview of current approaches to hybrid MT within the context of the Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra 2013).",
        "In our overview, we classify hybrid MT approaches according to the linguistic levels that they address.",
        "We then briefly summarize the contributions presented and collected in this volume.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we motivate and summarize the main aspects of the HyTra initiative.",
        "Then, we present a general overview of the accepted papers and discuss them within the context of other state-of-the-art research in the area.",
        "Finally, we present our conclusions and discuss our proposed view of future directions for Hybrid MT research.",
        "2 Overview of the HyTra Initiative The HyTra initiative started in response to the increasing interest in hybrid approaches to machine translation, which is reflected on the substantial amount of work conducted on this topic.",
        "Another important motivation was the observation that, up to now, no single paradigm has been able to successfully solve to a satisfactory extent all of the many challenges that the problem of machine translation poses.",
        "The first HyTra workshop took part in conjunction with the EACL 2012 conference (Costa-jussa` et al., 2012).",
        "The Second HyTra Workshop, which was co-organized by the authors of this paper, has been co-located with the ACL 2013 conference (Costa-jussa` et al., 2013).",
        "The workshop has been supported by an extensive programme committee comprising members from over 30 organizations and representing more than 20 countries.",
        "As the outcome of a comprehensive peer reviewing process, and based on the recommendations of the programme committee, 15 papers were finally selected for either oral or poster presentation at the workshop.",
        "The workshop also had the privilege to be hon-ored by two exceptional keynote speeches: ?",
        "Controlled Ascent: Imbuing Statistical MT with Linguistic Knowledge by Will Lewis and Chris Quirk (2013), Microsoft research.",
        "The intersection of rule-based and statistical approaches in MT is explored, with a particular focus on past and current work done at Microsoft Research.",
        "One of their motivations for a hybrid approach is the observation that the times are over when huge improvements in translation quality were possible by simply adding more data to statistical systems.",
        "The reason is that most of the readily available parallel data has already been found.",
        "?",
        "How much hybridity do we have?",
        "by Hermann Ney, RWTH Aachen.",
        "It is pointed out that after about 25 years the statistical approach to MT has been widely accepted as an alternative to the classical approach with manually designed rules.",
        "But in practice most statistical MT systems make use of manually designed rules at least for preprocessing in order to improve MT quality.",
        "This is exemplified by looking at the RWTH MT systems."
