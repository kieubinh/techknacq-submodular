        "This paper describes syntactic reordering rules to reorder English sentences as per the Hindi language structure.",
        "Generally in reordering approach, the source sentence is parsed(E) and syntactic reordering rules are applied to form reordered sentence(E`).",
        "The training of SMT system is performed using parallel corpus having source side reordered(E`) and target side.",
        "The decoding is done by supplying reordered source sentences.",
        "The source sentences prior to decoding are reordered using the same syntactic rules as applied for the training data.",
        "So, this process works as a preprocessing stage for the phrase-based SMT system.",
        "It has been observed that reordering as a preprocessing stage is beneficial for developing English-Hindi phrase based SMT system (Rama-nathan et al., 2008; Rama et al., 2008).",
        "This paper describes a rich set of rules for the structural transformation of English sentence to Hindi language structure using Stanford (De et al., 2006) parse tree on source side.",
        "These rules are manually extracted based on analysis of source sentence tree and Hindi translation.",
        "For the evaluation purpose we have trained and evaluated three different phrase based SMT systems using MOSES toolkit (Koehn et al. 2007) and GIZA++(Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The first system was non-reordered baseline (Brown et al., 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003), second using limited reordering described in Ramanathan et al. (2008) and third using improved reordering technique proposed in the paper.",
        "Evaluation has been carried out for end to end English-Hindi translation outputs using BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST score (Doddington, 2002), multi-reference position-independent word error rate (Tillmann et al., 1997), multi-reference word error rate (Nie?en et al., 2000).",
        "We have observed improvement in each of these evaluation metrics used.",

        "Various preprocessing approaches have been proposed for handling syntax within SMT systems.",

        "The BLEU score for the system has increased from 12.10 to 16.90 after reordering.",

        "22.19 compare to +4.8 BLEU point increase in the previous case.",
        "The reason can be, when the system is able to get bigger chunks from the phrase table itself the local reordering (within phrase) is not needed and the long distance reordering employed in the earlier approach will be helpful for overall better translation.",
        "It may not be able to show significant improvements when local reordering is not captured by the translation model.",
        "Other language pairs have also shown significant improvement when reordering is employed.",
