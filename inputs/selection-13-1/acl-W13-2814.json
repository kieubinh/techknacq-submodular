        "Word alignment is the backbone of PB-SMT system or any data driven approaches to Machine Translation (MT) and it has received a lot of attention in the area of statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Word alignment is not an end task in itself and is usually used as an intermediate step in SMT.",
        "Word alignment is defined as the detection of corresponding alignment of words from parallel sentences that are translation of each other.",
        "Statistical machine translation usually suffers from many-to-many word links which existing statistical word alignment algorithms can not handle well.",
        "The unsupervised word alignment models are based on IBM models 1?5 (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM model (Ney and Vogel, 1996; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Models 3, 4 and 5 are based on fertility based models which are asymmetric.",
        "To improve alignment quality, the Berkeley Aligner is based on the symmetric property by intersecting alignments induced in each translation direction.",
        "In the present work, we propose improvement of word alignment quality by combining three word alignment tables (i) GIZA++ alignment (ii) Berkeley Alignment and (iii) rule based alignment.",
        "Our objective is to perceive the effectiveness of the Hybrid model in word alignment by improving the quality of translation in the SMT system.",
        "In the present work, we have implemented a rule based alignment model by considering several types of chunks which are automatically extracted on the source side.",
        "Each individual source chunk is translated using a baseline PB-SMT system and validated with the target chunks on the target side.",
        "The validated source-target chunks are added in the rule based alignment table.",
        "Work has been carried out into three directions: (i) three alignment tables are combined together by taking their union; (ii) extra alignment pairs are added into the alignment table.",
        "This is a well-known practice in domain adaptation in SMT (Eck et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2008); (iii) the alignment table is updated through semi-supervised alignment technique.",
