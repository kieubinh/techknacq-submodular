        "Simple language (or, ?plain language?, ?easy-to-read language?)",
        "is language with low lexical and syntactic complexity.",
        "It provides access to information to people with cognitive disabilities (e.g., aphasia, dyslexia), foreign language learners, Deaf people,1 and children.",
        "Text in simple language is obtained through simplification.",
        "Simplification is a text-to-text generation task involving multiple operations, such as deletion, rephrasing, reordering, sentence splitting, and even insertion (Coster and Kauchak, 2011a).",
        "By contrast, paraphrasing and compression, two other text-to-text generation tasks, involve merely rephrasing and reordering (paraphrasing) and deletion (compression).",
        "Text simplification also shares common ground with grammar and style checking as well as with controlled natural language generation.",
        "Text simplification approaches exist for various languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Swedish.",
        "As Matausch and Nietzio (2012) write, ?plain language is still underrepresented in",
        "the German speaking area and needs further development?.",
        "Our goal is to build a statistical machine translation (SMT) system that translates from German into Simple German.",
        "SMT systems require two corpora aligned at the sentence level as their training, development, and test data.",
        "The two corpora together can form a bilingual or a monolingual corpus.",
        "A bilingual corpus involves two different languages, while a monolingual corpus consists of data in a single language.",
        "Since text simplification is a text-to-text generation task operating within the same language, it produces monolingual corpora.",
        "Monolingual corpora, like bilingual corpora, can be either parallel or comparable.",
        "A parallel corpus is a set of two corpora in which ?a noticeable number of sentences can be recognized as mutual translations?",
        "(Tom's et al., 2008).",
        "Parallel corpora are often compiled from the publications of multinational institutions, such as the UN or the EU, or of governments of multilingual countries, such as Canada (Koehn, 2005).",
        "In contrast, a comparable corpus consists of two corpora created independently of each other from distinct sources.",
        "Examples of comparable documents are news articles written on the same topic by different news agencies.",
        "In this paper we report our experiments in creating a monolingual parallel corpus using German/Simple German documents from the web.",
        "We require parallel data to build an SMT system that translates from German into Simple German.",

        "The task of simplifying text automatically can be performed by means of rule-based, corpus-based, or hybrid approaches.",
        "In a rule-based approach, the operations carried out typically include replacing words by simpler synonyms or rephrasing relative clauses, embedded sentences, passive constructions, etc.",
        "Moreover, definitions of difficult terms or concepts are often added, e.g., the term web crawler is defined as ?a computer program that searches the Web automatically?.",
        "Gasperin et al.",
        "(2010) pursued a rule-based approach to text simplification for Brazilian Portuguese within the PorSimples project,2 as did Brouwers et al. (2012) for French.",
        "As part of the corpus-based approach, machine translation (MT) has been employed.",
        "Yatskar et al. (2010) pointed out that simplification is ?a form of MT in which the two ?languages?",
        "in question are highly related?.",
        "As far as we can see, Zhu et al. (2010) were the first to use English/Simple English Wikipedia data for automatic simplification via machine translation.",
        "They assembled a monolingual comparable corpus4 of 108,016 sentence pairs based on the interlanguage links in Wikipedia and the sentence alignment algorithm of Nelken and Shieber (2006) (cf.",
        "Section 3.2).",
        "Their system applies a ?tree-based simplification model?",
        "including machine translation techniques.",
        "The system learns probabilities for simplification operations (substitution, reordering, splitting, deletion) offline from",
        "parallel because not every Simple English Wikipedia article is necessarily a translation of an English Wikipedia article.",
        "Rather, Simple English articles can be added independently of any English counterpart.",
        "the comparable Wikipedia data.",
        "At runtime, an input sentence is parsed and zero or more simplification operations are carried out based on the model probabilities.",
        "Specia (2010) used the SMT system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to translate from Brazilian Portuguese into a simpler version of this language.",
        "Her work is part of the PorSimples project mentioned above.",
        "As training data she used 4483 sentences extracted from news texts that had been manually translated into Simple Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "The results, evaluated automatically with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) as well as manually, show that the system performed lexical simplification and sentence splitting well, while it exhibited problems in reordering phrases and producing subject?",
        "verb?object (SVO) order.",
        "To further improve her system Specia (2010) suggested including syntactic information through hierarchical SMT (Chiang, 2005) and part-of-speech tags through factored SMT (Hoang, 2007).",
        "Coster and Kauchak (2011a; 2011b) translated from English into Simple English using English/Simple English Wikipedia data.",
        "Like Specia (2010), they applied Moses as their MT system but in addition to the default configuration allowed for phrases to be empty.",
        "This was motivated by their observation that 47% of all Simple English Wikipedia sentences were missing at least one phrase compared to their English Wikipedia counterparts.",
        "Coster and Kauchak (2011a; 2011b) used four baselines to evaluate their system: in-put=output,6 two text compression systems, and vanilla Moses.",
        "Their system, Moses-Del, achieved higher automatic MT evaluation scores (BLEU) than all of the baselines.",
        "In particular, it outperformed vanilla Moses (lacking the phrase deletion option).",
        "Wubben et al. (2012) also worked with English/Simple English Wikipedia data and Moses.",
        "They added a post-hoc reranking step: Following their conviction that the output of a simplification system has to be a modified version of the input,7 they rearranged the 10-best sentences output by Moses such that those differing from the",
        "input sentences were given preference over those that were identical.",
        "Difference was calculated on the basis of the Levenshtein score (edit distance).",
        "Wubben et al. (2012) found their system to work better than that of Zhu et al. (2010) when evaluated with BLEU, but not when evaluated with the Flesch-Kincaid grade level, a common readability metric.",
        "Bott and Saggion (2011) presented a monolingual sentence alignment algorithm, which uses a Hidden Markov Model for alignment.",
        "In contrast to other monolingual alignment algorithms, Bott and Saggion (2011) introduced a monotonicity restriction, i.e., they assumed the order of sentences to be the same for the original and simplified texts.",
        "Apart from purely rule-based and purely corpus-based approaches to text simplification, hybrid approaches exist.",
        "For example, Bott et al. (2012) in their Simplext project for Spanish8 let a statistical classifier decide for each sentence of a text whether it should be simplified (corpus-based approach).",
        "The actual simplification was then performed by means of a rule-based approach.",
        "As has been shown, many MT approaches to text simplification have used English/Simple English Wikipedia as their data.",
        "The only exception we know of is Specia (2010), who together with her colleagues in the PorSimples project built her own parallel corpus.",
        "This is presumably because there exists no Simple Brazilian Portuguese Wikipedia.",
        "The same is true for German: To date, no Simple German Wikipedia has been created.",
        "Therefore, we looked for data available elsewhere for our machine translation system designated to translate from German to Simple German.",
        "We discovered that German/Simple German parallel data is slowly becoming available on the web.",

        "Secondly, some of the LS articles were identical, either because they summarized multiple AS articles or because they were generic placeholders.",
        "Hence, the",

        "While the length of a regular/simple language sentence pair might be different, an overlap in vocabulary can be expected.",
        "Hence, monolingual sentence alignment algorithms typically exploit lexical similarity.",
        "We applied the monolingual sentence alignment algorithm of Barzilay and Elhadad (2003).",
        "The algorithm has two main features: Firstly, it uses a hierarchical approach by assigning paragraphs to clusters and learning mapping rules.",
        "Secondly, it aligns sentences despite low lexical similarity if the context suggests an alignment.",
        "This is achieved through local sequence alignment, a dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "The overall algorithm has two phases, a training and a testing phase.",
        "The training phase in turn consists of two steps: Firstly, all paragraphs of the texts of one side of the parallel corpus (henceforth referred to as ?AS texts?)",
        "are clustered independently of all paragraphs of the texts of the other",
        "side of the parallel corpus (henceforth termed ?LS texts?",
        "), and vice versa.",
        "Secondly, mappings between the two sets of clusters are calculated, given the reference alignments.",
        "As a preprocessing step to the clustering process, we removed stopwords, lowercased all words, and replaced dates, numbers, and names by generic tags.",
        "Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) additionally considered every word starting with a capital letter inside a sentence to be a proper name.",
        "In German, all nouns (i.e., regular nouns as well as proper names) are capitalized; thus, this approach does not work.",
        "We used a list of 61,228 first names to remove at least part of the proper names.",
        "We performed clustering with scipy (Jones et al., 2001).",
        "We adapted the hierarchical complete-link clustering method of Barzilay and Elhadad (2003): While the authors claimed to have set a specific number of clusters, we believe this is not generally possible in hierarchical agglomerative clustering.",
        "Therefore, we used the largest number of clusters in which all paragraph pairs had a cosine similarity strictly greater than zero.",
        "Following the formation of the clusters, lexical similarity between all paragraphs of corresponding AS and LS texts was computed to establish probable mappings between the two sets of clusters.",
        "Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) used the boosting tool Boostexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000).",
        "All possible cross-combinations of paragraphs from the parallel training data served as training instances.",
        "An instance consisted of the cosine similarity of the two paragraphs and a string combining the two cluster IDs.",
        "The classification result was extracted from the manual alignments.",
        "In order for an AS and an LS paragraph to be aligned, at least one sentence from the LS paragraph had to be aligned to one sentence in the AS paragraph.",
        "Like Barzilay and Elhadad (2003), we performed 200 iterations in Boostexter.",
        "After learning the mapping rules, the training phase was complete.",
        "The testing phase consisted of two additional steps.",
        "Firstly, each paragraph of each text in the test set was assigned to the cluster it was closest to.",
        "This was done by calculating the cosine similarity of the word frequencies in the clusters.",
        "Then, every AS paragraph was combined with all LS paragraphs of the parallel text, and Boostexter was used in classification mode to predict whether the two paragraphs were to be mapped.",
        "Secondly, within each pair of paragraphs mapped by Boostexter, sentences with very high lexical similarity were aligned.",
        "In our case, the threshold for an alignment was a similarity of 0.5.",
        "For the remaining sentences, proximity to other aligned or similar sentences was used as an indicator.",
        "This was implemented by local sequence alignment.",
        "We set the mismatch penalty to 0.02, as a higher mismatch penalty would have reduced recall.",

        "We found two reasons for this: language challenges and domain challenges.",
        "In what follows, we discuss each reason in more detail.",
        "While Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) aligned English/Simple English texts, we dealt with German/Simple German data.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3.2, in German nouns (regular nouns as well as proper names) are capitalized.",
        "This makes named entity recognition, a preprocessing step to clustering, more difficult.",
        "Moreover, German is an example of a morphologically rich language: Its noun phrases are marked with case, leading to different inflectional forms for articles, pronouns, adjectives, and nouns.",
        "English morphology is poorer; hence, there is a greater likelihood of lexical overlap.",
        "Similarly, compounds are productive in German; an example from our corpus is Seniorenwohnanlagen (?housing complexes for the elderly?).",
        "In contrast, English compounds are multiword units, where each word can be accessed separately by a clustering algorithm.",
        "Therefore, cosine similarity is more effective for English than it is for German.",
        "One way to alleviate this problem would be to use extensive morphological decomposition and lemmatization.",
        "In terms of domain, Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) used city descriptions from an encyclopedia for their experiments.",
        "For these descriptions clustering worked well because all articles had the same structure (paragraphs about culture, sports, etc.).",
        "The domain of our corpus was broader: It included information about housing, work, and events for people with disabilities as well as information about the organizations behind the respective websites.",

        "The process of creating a parallel corpus for use in machine translation involves sentence alignment.",
        "Sentence alignment algorithms for bilingual corpora differ from those for monolingual corpora.",
        "Since all of our data was from the same language, we applied the monolingual sentence alignment approach of Barzilay and Elhadad (2003).",
        "We have shown the limits of the algorithm with respect to the language and domain of our data.",
        "For example, named entity recognition, a preprocessing step to clustering, is harder for German than for English, the language Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) worked with.",
        "Moreover, German features richer morphology than English, which leads to less lexical overlap when working on the word form level.",
        "The domain of our corpus was also broader than that of Barzilay and Elhadad (2003), who used city descriptions from an encyclopedia for their experiments.",
        "This made it harder to identify common article structures that could be exploited in clustering.",
        "As a next step, we will experiment with other monolingual sentence alignment algorithms.",
        "In addition, we will build a second parallel corpus for German/Simple German: A person familiar with the task of text simplification will produce simple versions of German texts.",
        "We will use the resulting parallel corpus as data for our experiments in automatically translating from German to Simple German.",
        "The parallel corpus we compiled as part of the work described in this paper can be made available to interested parties upon request."
