        "Using textual complexity to rank documents may be adequate for several applications in the fields of information retrieval, machine translation, document simplification, and the assessment of human-written documents.",
        "Approaches based on complexity, however, do not well support document summarization.",
        "In the context of automatic summarization, users want concise summaries to understand the important information present in the documents as rapidly as possible?",
        "to create summaries that can be read as quickly as possible, we need a function that can evaluate the quality of the summary in terms of reading time.",

        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) built a classifier that employs various features extracted from a document and newswire documents annotated with a readability score on a 1 to 5 scale.",
        "They integrated complex features by using SVM and identified the better document correctly with 88.88% accuracy.",
        "They reported that the log likelihood of a document based on its discourse relations, the log likelihood of a document based on n-gram, the average number of verb phrases in sentences, the number of words in the document were good indicators on which to base readability prediction.",
        "Pitler et al., (2010) used the same framework to predict the linguistic quality of a summary.",
        "In the field of automatic summarization, linguistic quality has been assessed manually and hence to automate the assessment is an important research problem (Pitler et al., 2010).",
        "A ranker based on Ranking SVM has been constructed (Joachims, 2002) and identified the better of two summaries correctly with an accuracy of around 90%.",
        "Tanaka-Ishii et al., (2010) also built a ranker to predict the rank of documents according to readability.",
        "While Tanaka-Ishii et al. used word-level features for the prediction, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) and Pitler et al., (2010) also leveraged sentence-level features and document-level features.",
        "In this paper, we extend their findings to predict readability.",
        "We elaborate our feature set in Section 5.",
        "While all of them either classify or rank the documents by assigning a readability score on a 1-5 scale, our research goal is to build a predictor that can also estimate the reading time.",
        "In the context of multi-document summarization, the linguistic quality of a summary is predicted to order the sentences extracted from the original documents (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Lapata, 2006; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).",
        "In multi-document summarization, since sentences are extracted from the original documents without regard for context, they must be ordered in some way to make the summary coherent.",
        "One of the most important features for ordering sentences is the entity grid suggested by Barzilay and Lapata (2005; 2008).",
        "It captures transitions in the semantic roles of the noun phrases in a document, and can predict the quality of an order of the sentences with high accuracy.",
        "It was also used as an important feature in the work by Pitler and Nenkova (2008) and Piter et al., (2010) to predict the readability of a document.",
        "Burstein et al., (2010) used it for an educational purpose, and used it to predict",
        "the readability of essays.",
        "Lapata (Lapata, 2006) suggested the use of Kendall's Tau as an indicator of the quality of a set of sentences in particular order; she also reported that self-paced reading time is a good indicator of quality.",
