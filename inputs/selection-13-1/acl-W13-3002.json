        "Such a model captures only the ordering restrictions on these morphemes; it fails to capture their apparent optionality and transparency to selection.",
        "I propose a model of these ordered yet optional and transparent morphemes that introduces a function Adjoin which operates on pairs of categories: the original category of the modified phrase together with the category of the most recently adjoined modifier.",

        "For example, the adjectives in the MGA lexicon used in the examples in Section 5.1 can be replaced by the adjectives in either grammar from the selectional approaches in Section 4.2, and the same string set can be generated.",
        "Clearly MGs and MGAs are not strongly equivalent: the derivation trees differ in that MGAs have a function that is not present in MGs.",
        "Because the possible configurations of features remains finite, the derivation tree languages of MGAs should prove to be regular, following Kobele et al(2007)'s presentation: transition rules for Adjoin need merely be added.",

        "Although to my knowledge such notions as tierwise strictly local (Heinz et al., 2011) have not yet been formally defined for tree languages, I conjecture that in MGAs, Merge is tierwise strictly k-local, and Adjoin is strictly k-local."
