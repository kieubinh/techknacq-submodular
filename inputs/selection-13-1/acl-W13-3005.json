        "Ordered algebraic structures and sequent calculi have been used extensively in Computer Science and Mathematical Logic.",
        "They have also been used to formalise and reason about natural language.",
        "Lambek (1958) used the ordered algebra of residuated monoids to model grammatical types, their juxtapositions and reductions.",
        "Relational words such as verbs have implicative types and are modelled using the residuals to the monoid multiplication.",
        "Later, Lambek (1999) simplified these algebras in favour of pregroups.",
        "Here, there are no binary residual operations, but each element of the algebra has a left and a right residual.",
        "In terms of semantics, pregroups do not naturally lend themselves to a model-theoretic treatment (Montague, 1974).",
        "However, pregroups are suited to a radically different treatment of semantics, namely distributional semantics (Schu?tze, 1998).",
        "Distributional semantics uses vector spaces based on contextual co-occurrences to model the meanings of words.",
        "Coecke et al. (2010) show how a compositional semantics can be developed within a vector-based framework, by exploiting the fact that vector spaces with linear maps and pregroups both have a compact closed categorical structure (Kelly and Laplaza, 1980; Preller and Lambek, 2007).",
        "Some initial attempts at implementation include Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) and Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011b).",
        "One problem with the distributional approach is that it is difficult to see how the meanings of some words ?",
        "e.g. logical words such as and, or, and relative pronouns such as who, which, that, whose ?",
        "can be modelled contextually.",
        "Our focus in this paper is on relative pronouns in the distributional compositional setting.",
        "The difficulty with pronouns is that the contexts in which they occur do not seem to provide a suitable representation of their meanings: pronouns tend to occur with a great many nouns and verbs.",
        "Hence, if one applies the contextual co-occurrence methods of distributional semantics to them, the result will be a set of dense vectors which do not discriminate between different meanings.",
        "The current state-of-the-art in compositional distributional semantics either adopts a simple method to obtain a vector for a sequence of words, such as adding or mutliplying the contextual vectors of the words (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), or, based on the grammatical structure, builds linear maps for some words and applies these to the vector representations of the other words in the string (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011a).",
        "Neither of these approaches produce vectors which provide a good representation for the meanings of relative clauses.",
        "In the grammar-based approach, one has to assign a linear map to the relative pronoun, for instance a map f as follows: ??????????????",
        "men who like Mary = f(??",
        "?men, ???????",
        "like Mary) However, it is not clear what this map should be.",
        "Ideally, we do not want it to depend on the frequency of the co-occurrence of the relative pronoun with the relevant basis vectors.",
        "But both",
        "of the above mentioned approaches rely heavily on the information provided by a corpus to build their linear maps.",
        "The work of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) uses linear regression and approximates the context vectors of phrases in which the target word has occurred, and the work of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a) uses the sum of Kronecker products of the arguments of the target word across the corpus.",
        "The semantics we develop for relative pronouns and clauses uses the general operations of a Frobenius algebra over vector spaces (Coecke et al., 2008) and the structural categorical morphisms of vector spaces.",
        "We do not rely on the co-occurrence frequencies of the pronouns in a corpus and only take into account the structural roles of the pronouns in the meaning of the clauses.",
        "The computations of the algebra and vector spaces are depicted using string diagrams (Joyal and Street, 1991), which depict the interactions that occur among the words of a sentence.",
        "In the particular case of relative clauses, they visualise the role of the relative pronoun in passing information between the clause and the modified noun phrase, as well as copying, combining, and even discarding parts of the relative clause.",
        "We develop two instantiations of the abstract semantics, one based on a truth-theoretic approach, and one based on corpus statistics, where for the latter the categorical operations are instantiated as matrix multiplication and vector component-wise multiplication.",
        "As a result, we will obtain the following for the meaning of a subject relative clause: ??????????????",
        "men who like Mary = ??",
        "?men (love?",
        "????",
        "Mary) The rest of the paper introduces the categorical framework, including the formal definitions relevant to the use of Frobenius algebras, and then shows how these structures can be used to model relative pronouns within the compositional vector-based setting."

        "In this paper, we have extended the compact categorical semantics of Coecke et al. (2010) to analyse meanings of relative clauses in English from a vector space point of view.",
        "The resulting vector space semantics of the pronouns and clauses is based on the Frobenius algebraic operations on vector spaces: they reveal the internal structure, or what we call anatomy, of the relative clauses.",
        "The methodology pursued in this paper and the Frobenius operations can be used to provide semantics for other relative pronouns and also other closed-class words such as prepositions and determiners.",
        "In each case, the grammatical type of the word and a detailed analysis of the role of these words in the meaning of the phrases in which they occur would be needed.",
        "In some cases, it may be necessary to introduce a linear map to represent the meaning of the word, for instance to distinguish the preposition on from in.",
        "The contribution of this paper is best demonstrated via the string diagrammatic representations of the vector space meanings of these clauses.",
        "A noun phrase modified by a subject relative clause, which before this paper was depicted as follows: N S N NN N NN S Subject Rel-Pronoun Verb Object will now include the internal anatomy of its relative pronoun:",
        "This internal structure shows how the information from the noun flows through the relative pronoun to the rest of the clause and how it interacts with the other words.",
        "We have instantiated this vector space semantics using truth-theoretic and corpus-based examples.",
        "One aspect of our example spaces which means that they work particularly well is that the sentence dimension in the verb is already discarded, which means that the ?",
        "maps are not required (as discussed above).",
        "Another feature is that the simple nature of the models means that the ?map does not lose any information, even though it takes the diagonal of a matrix and hence in general throws information away.",
        "The effect of the ?",
        "and ?",
        "maps in more complex representations of the verb remains to be studied in future work.",
        "On the practical side, what we offer in this paper is a method for building appropriate vector representations for relative clauses.",
        "As a result, when presented with a relative clause, we are able to build a vector for it, only by relying on the vector representations of the words in the clause and the grammatical role of the relative pronoun.",
        "We do not need to retrieve information from a corpus to be able to build a vector or linear map for the relative pronoun, neither will we end up having to discard the pronoun and ignore the role that it plays in the meaning of the clause (which was perhaps the best option available before this paper).",
        "However, the Frobenius approach and our claim that the resulting vectors are ?appropriate?",
        "requires an empirical evaluation.",
        "Tasks such as the term definition task from Kartsaklis et al. (2013) (which also uses Frobenius algebras but for a different purpose) are an obvious place to start.",
        "More generally, the sub-field of compositional distributional semantics is a growing and active one (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011), for which we argue that high-level mathematical investigations such as this paper, and also Clarke (2008), can play a crucial role."
