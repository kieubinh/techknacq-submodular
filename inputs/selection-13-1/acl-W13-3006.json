        "The expressivity of ordered rewrite-rule grammars for phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968, henceforth SPE) and two-level phonology (Koskenniemi, 1983) are exactly the class of regular relations (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Beesley and Kartunnen, 2003).",
        "Since SPE-style grammars can express virtually any phonological generalization, it follows that the generalizations themselves are regular, even if they are represented with other formalisms (such as OT grammars).",
        "This result can be interpreted cognitively as establishing a universal property of phonological patterns: humanly possible phonological patterns are regular.",
        "If correct, this would mean, for example, that humanly possible syntactic patterns which are nonregular are not humanly possible phonological patterns (Heinz and Idsardi, 2011; Lai, 2012; Heinz and Idsardi, 2013).",
        "Recent research suggests that stronger universals than ?being regular?",
        "can be established for phonology.",
        "It has been shown that segmental phonotactic patterns are star-free (Heinz et al., 2011), as are virtually all stress patterns (Rogers et al., to appear), and the semantics of two-level rules appear to ensure that these mappings have star-free-like properties, provided the contexts to the rules are star-free (Yli-Jyra?",

        "This is largely because there are phonological processes such as epenthesis and deletion which are not same-length, and we would like our conclusions to hold for all phonological patterns.",
        "Nonetheless, future work which explores the same-lengthness aspect may lead to some interesting insights.",
        "One reviewer of this paper conjectured, for example, that if the same-length relations were coded as languages that they would then be k-reversible (An-gluin, 1982).",
        "With respect to learnability, total subsequential functions are identifiable in the limit from positive data (Oncina et al., 1993), though this algorithm appears to require data points unavailable in natural language corpora (Gildea and Jurafsky, 1996).",
        "Investigating subclasses of subsequential functions which cover attested phonological patterns may thus not only better characterize possible phonologies, but may also provide insights for learning (Chandlee and Koirala, 2013).",
        "Finally, we believe Elgot and Mezei's theorem can shed new light on the old problem of abstractness in phonology (Hyman, 1970), and suspect a hierarchy of complexity depending on how much markup (either new symbols or with a length-increasing function) needs to be introduced in the intermediate alphabet to order to decompose a regular function into left and right subsequential ones.",
