        "toolbox, including the distinction between accidental and systematic gaps in the data, the detection of ambiguity, the selective discarding of data, and the merging of categories.",
        "Introduction The Minimum Description Length (MDL, see Ris-sanen 1978) framework is primarily about data compression: if we are given some data D, our goal is to find a modelM, and a correction term E , such that the model output and the correction term together describe the data, and transmitting M and E takes fewer bits than transmitting any competingM?",
        "and E ?.",
        "From the very beginning, starting with Pa?n.",
        "ini, linguists have put a premium on brevity.",
        "The hope is that the shortest theory is the best theory (see Vitanyi and Li 2000), at least if we are willing to posit a theory of Universal Grammar (UG) that will let us specifyM briefly, since we can assume UG to be amortized over many languages.",
        "In this paper we study the problem of compressing weighted languages by presenting them via weighted finite state automata (WFSA).",
        "The theoretical approach we discuss here has a long history: the founding paper of Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoff (1964), already studied the problem of inferring a grammar from data, and Gru?nwald (1996) uses MDL to infer CFGs from corpora, there conceived of as long strings over a finite alphabet.",
        "It is fair to say that this theory has not had much impact on computational practice, where grammatical inference is dominated by the standard n-gram based language modeling methods, see Jelinek (1997) for an excellent summary of the basic ideas and techniques, most of which are still in wide use.",
        "While the two approaches may coincide in certain cases (see Gru?nwald 1996), and in theory n-gram models are just a special case of the general WFSA, in practice they are divided by a fundamental difference in modeling unseen data.",
        "From an engineering standpoint, Church et al(2007) are entirely right in saying: No matter how much data we have, we never have enough.",
        "Nothing has zero probability.",
        "Linguists, starting perhaps with Chomsky (1965), draw a bright line between accidentally and systematically missing data, and would prefer to restrict backoff techniques to the accidental gaps.",
        "The distinction is often lost in applied work, because the models need to be built in a noisy environment, where frequent typos like *teh and similar performance errors can easily overwhelm genuine items like boisterous or mopeds by an order of magnitude or even more.",
        "In the eyes of many linguists, this observation alone is sufficient to rob probabilistic models of grammatical content, since this makes it impossible to define a single threshold g such that all and only strings with weight greater than g are grammatical.",
        "Aside from this subtle but important distinction between accidental and systematic gaps, both kinds of language modeling can be cast in the same formal terms: we fit a model M that minimizes some function E (typically, the squared sum) of the error E .",
        "Obviously, the more parameters M has, the better fit we can obtain.",
        "Much of contemporary computational linguistics follows the route of training simple models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) with very many parameters, and stops adding more only when compressing the memory footprint is of paramount importance.",
        "As (Church et al., 2007) notes, applications like the contextual speller of Microsoft Office simply could not ship without keeping the language model within reasonable size limits.",
        "In such cases, we are quite willing to trade in E for gains in the size M ofM, and considerations of optimizing the sum of the two are simply irrelevant.",
        "In contrast, our strategy is to search for model which measures both M and E in bits, and optimizes the sum M + E, not because we put such a premium on data compression, but rather because we follow in Pa?n.",
        "ini's footsteps.",
        "Our goal is finding structural models capable of distinguishing structurally excluded (ungrammatical) strings like furiously sleep ideas green colorless from low probability but grammatical strings like colorless green ideas sleep furiously (Pereira, 2000).",
        "For this more ambitious goal comparing models with different number of parameters is a key issue, and this is precisely where MDL is helpful.",
        "The rest of this Introduction provides the basic definitions, notation, and terminology, all fairly standard except for the use of Moore rather than Mealy machines ?",
        "the significance of this choice will be discussed in Section 2.",
        "In Section 1 we bring a fundamental idea of signal processing, quantization error, to bear on the problem of model selection, illustrating the issue on a real example, the proquant system of Hungarian.",
        "In Section 2 we show how one of the most powerful tools at disposal of the linguist, ambiguity, can be detected by MDL, bringing another standard idea, signal to noise ratio to bear.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss another real example, Hungarian mor-photactics, and show that two methods widely (but shamefacedly) used in practice, discarding data and merging descriptive categories, can be used on a principled basis within MDL.",
        "Our goal is to show that by consistent application of MDL principles we can automatically set up the kind of models that linguists would set up.",
        "Ultimately, both man and machine work toward the same goal, optimization of grammar elegance or, what is the same, brevity.",

        "In a critical sense, LIP is weaker than MDL learn-ability, since the space itself can be very large, and testing all hypothetical transforms X that fit the bill may not be feasible.",
        "The difference between LIP and practical MDL learnability is precisely the difference between existence proofs and constructive proofs.",
        "Our interest here is with the former: our goal is to demonstrate that structurally sound models are LIP.",
        "So far, we have seen that structurally valid segmentations can be effectively obtained by MDL.",
        "Our next task is to show that ambiguity is LIP.",

        "Arranging the pi log(pi/qi) in order of decreasing absolute value we obtain mi 0.0192; minden+ki 0.0175; a+mely 0.0169; mely -0.0147; a+mikor 0.0135; hogy -0.0128; and so forth.",
        "Of all the 121 strings we may consider for direct emission, only hogy is worth adding a separate arc for.",
        "Further, if we repeat the process, adding a second direct arc never results in sufficient entropy gain compared to adding hogy alone.",
        "To summarize, list models can approximate the original data within its inherent noise level, but incur a very significant MDL cost, even if they use an efficient string encoding because they keep many parameters, see the first three lines of Table 3 above.",
        "The hub models, which build structure similar to the one used in the string encoding, recognizing prefixes and suffixes for what they are, are far more compact, at 470-730 bits, even though they have a KL error of about .1-.4 bits.",
        "Finally, the hub+ambiguity model, with 27 parameters, reduces the total MDL cost to 1052 bits, less than half of the best list model.",
        "Currently we lack the kind of detailed understanding of the description length surface over the WFSA?stringencoding space that would let us say with absolute certainty that e.g. the hub model with ambiguous hogy is the global minimum, and we cannot muster the requisite computational power to exhaustively search the space of all WFSA with 27 arcs or less.",
        "Further gains could quite possibly made with even cruder quantization, e.g. to n = 6 levels (powers of 2 are convenient, but not essential for the model), or by bringing in non-uniform quantization.",
        "On the one hand, we are virtually certain that the only encoding of emissions worth studying is the morpheme-based one, since the economy brought by this is tremendous, 3,600 bits over the proquants alone, and no doubt further gains elsewhere, as we extend the scope to other words that contain the same morphemes ?",
        "in this regard, our findings simply confirm what Goldsmith, Creutz, Lagus, and others have already demonstrated.",
        "On the other hand, finding the right segmentation is only the first step, we also need a good model of the tactics.",
        "As we said at the beginning, the encoding of arcs and probabilities can to a significant extent be independent of the encoding of the emissions.",
        "Here the remarkable fact is that a better emission model could to a large extent drive the search for structuring the WFSA itself.",

        "For LIP, the key observation is that models constructed by XY merge-split have a transmission cost composed of two parts, the length of the smaller merged model (given in black in Figure 2), plus transmitting the pairX,Y and the probability of the split, which is exactly the cost of a single arc, even though the actual split model will have many more arcs (given in red in Figure 4).",

        "In this paper we have developed an MDL-based framework for structure detection based on simple notions mostly borrowed from signal processing: quantization noise, inherent noise level, and cut-offs.",
        "Standard n-gram models fare rather poorly compared either in size or in model accuracy to the WFSA results obtained here: for example on the morphotactics data a straight SRILM trigram model has over 200 parameters and has KL divergence 1.09 bits.",
        "Most of the 64 bits per n-gram parameter are wasted (if we assume only 12 bits per parameter, the WFSA we use requires only 49 parameters and gets within 0.03 bits of the observed data) and further, the general-purpose backoff scheme built into SRILM just makes matters worse.",
        "Similarly, on the proquant data an SRILM bigram model has 175 parameters (including the 26 unigram weights but excluding the backoff weights), yet it is farther from the data at 64 bits resolution than our best 27-parameter model at 3 bits.",
        "More important, the bigram structure of the proquant data has to be hand-fed into the standard model, while the MDL approach can discover this, together with other linguistically relevant observations such that hogy was ambiguous.",
        "This is not to say that n-gram models are no longer competitive, for our current MDL methods, based on a simulated annealing learner, use too much CPU and will not scale to the gigaword regime without much further work.",
        "Yet if formal grammar and information theory are to get together again, as (Pereira, 2000) suggests, we must direct effort towards recapitulating linguistic practice, including the ?dirty?",
        "parts such as discarding data strategically.",
        "The main thrust of the work presented here is that the data manipulation methods that are the stock in trade of the descriptive linguist are LIP, and Universal Grammar is simply a short list of the permissible model transformations including path duplication for ambiguity, state merging for position class effects, and merge-split for collapsing categories."
