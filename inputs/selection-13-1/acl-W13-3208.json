        "Our understanding of WSM is in agreement with Sahlgren (2006): ?The word space model is a computational model of word meaning that utilizes the distributional patterns of words collected over large text data to represent semantic similarity between words in terms of spatial proximity?.",
        "There are many types of WSMs built by different algorithms.",
        "WSMs are based on the Harris distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), which assumes that words are similar to the extent to which they share similar linguistic contexts.",
        "WSM can be viewed as a set of words associated with vectors representing contexts in which the words occur.",
        "Then, similar vectors imply (semantic) similarity of the words and vice versa.",
        "Consequently, WSMs provide a means to find words semantically similar to a given word.",
        "This capability of WSMs is exploited by many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications as listed e.g. by Turney and Pantel (2010).",
        "This study follows Biemann and Giesbrecht (2011), who attempted to find a list of non-compositional expressions whose meaning is not fully determined by the meaning of its constituents and their combination.",
        "The task turned out to be frustratingly hard (Johannsen et al., 2011).",
        "Biemann's idea and motivation is that non-compositional expressions could be treated as single units in many NLP applications such as Information Retrieval (Acosta et al., 2011) or Machine Translation (Carpuat and Diab, 2010).",
        "We extend this motivation by stating that WSMs could also benefit from a set of non-compositional expressions.",
        "Specifically, WSMs could treat semantically non-compositional expressions as single units.",
        "As an example, consider ?kick the bucket?, ?hot dog?, or ?zebra crossing?.",
        "Treating such expressions as single units might improve the quality of WSMs since the neighboring words of these expressions should not be related to their constituents (?kick?, ?bucket?, ?dog?",
        "or ?zebra?",
        "), but instead to the whole expressions.",
        "Recent works, including that of Lin (1999), Baldwin et al. (2003), Biemann and Giesbrecht (2011), Johannsen et al. (2011), Reddy et al. (2011a), Krc?ma?r?",
        "et al (2012), and Krc?ma?r?",

        "First, this leads to non-directly comparable results and second, many combinations of",
        "WSMs and measures have never before been applied to the task.",

        "The simplest and oldest types of WSMs1 are the Vector Space Model (VSM) and Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL).",
        "More recent and advanced models include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is based on VSM, and Correlated Occurrence Analogue to Lexical Semantics (COALS), which originates from HAL.",

        "VSM is based on the assumption that similar (related) words tend to occur in the same documents.2 VSM stores occurrence counts of all word types in documents a given corpus in a co-occurrence matrix C. The row vectors of the matrix correspond to the word types and the columns to the documents in the corpus.",
        "The numbers of occurrences cij in C are usually weighted by the product of the local and global weighting functions (Nakov et al., 2001).",

        "Typically: none (denoted as No), Inverse Document Frequency (denoted as Idf ) or a function referred to as Entropy (Ent).",

LSA builds on VSM and was introduced by Landauer and Dumais (1997).",
        "The LSA algorithm works with the same co-occurrence matrix C which can be weighted in the same manner as in VSM.",
        "The matrix is than transformed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Deerwester et al., 1990) into C. The purpose of SVD is to project the row vectors and column vectors of C into a lower-dimensional space and thus bring the vectors of word types and vectors of documents, respectively, with similar meanings near to each other.",
        "The output number of dimensions is a parameter of SVD and typically ranges from 200 to 1000 (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Rohde et al., 2005).",
        "HAL was first explored by Lund and Burgess (1996).",
        "It differs from VSM and LSA in that it only exploits neighboring words as contexts for word types.",
        "HAL processes the corpus by moving a sliding double-sided window with a size ranging from 1 to 5 around the word type in focus and accumulating the weighted co-occurrences of the preceding and following words into a matrix.",
        "Typically, the linear weighting function is used to ensure that the occurrences of words which are closer to the word type in focus are more significant.",
        "The dimensions of the resulting co-occurrence matrix are of size |V |and 2|V |, where V denotes the vocabulary consisting of all the word types occurring in the processed corpora.",

        "The alternatives and their description can be found e.g. in Song et al. (2004).",
        "COALS was introduced by Rohde et al. (2005).",
        "Compared to HAL, COALS also processes a corpus by using a sliding window and linear weighting, but differs in several aspects: the window size of COALS is 4 and this value is fixed; COALS does not distinguish between the preceding and following words and treats them equally; applying COALS supposes that all but the most frequent m columns reflecting the most common open-class words are discarded; COALS transforms weighted counts in the co-occurrence matrix in a special way (all the word pair correlations are calculated, negative values are set to 0, and non-negative ones are square rooted ?",
        "corr); and optionally, Singular Value Decomposition (Deerwester et al., 1990) can be applied to the COALS co-occurrence matrix.",
        "RI is described in Sahlgren (2005) and can be viewed as a mixture of HAL and LSA.",
        "First, RI assigns random vectors to each word type in the corpus.",
        "The random vectors, referred to as index vectors, are very sparse, typically with a length of thousands, and contain only several (e.g. 7) non-zero values from the {-1,1} set.",
        "Second, RI processes the corpus by exploiting a sliding window like HAL and COALS.",
        "However, RI does not accumulate the weighted co-occurrence counts of neighboring words to the vector of the word type in focus.",
        "Instead, RI accumulates the index vectors of the co-occurring words.",
        "For accounting the word order, the permutation variant of RI was also developed (Sahlgren et al., 2008).",
