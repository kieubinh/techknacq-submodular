        "Distributional models of semantics characterize the meanings of words as a function of the words they co-occur with (Firth, 1957).",
        "These models, mathematically instantiated as sets of vectors in high dimensional vector spaces, have been applied to tasks such as thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran, 2004), word-sense discrimination (Schu?tze, 1998), automated essay marking (Lan-dauer and Dumais, 1997), and so on.",
        "During the past few years, research has shifted from using distributional methods for modelling the semantics of words to using them for modelling the semantics of larger linguistic units such as phrases or entire sentences.",
        "This move from word to sentence has yielded models applied to tasks such as paraphrase detection (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Blacoe and Lapata, 2012), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2012; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013), and semantic relation classification (ibid.).",
        "Most efforts approach the problem of modelling phrase meaning through vector composition using linear algebraic vector operations (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010), matrix or tensor-based approaches (Baroni and Zampar-elli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010; Grefenstette et al., 2013; Kartsaklis et al., 2012), or through the use of recursive auto-encoding (Socher et al., 2011; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013) or neural-networks (Socher et al., 2012).",
        "On the non-compositional front, Erk and Pado?",
        "(2008) keep word vectors separate, using syntactic information from sentences to disambiguate words in context; likewise Turney (2012) treats the compositional aspect of phrases and sentences as a matter of similarity measure composition rather than vector composition.",
        "These compositional distributional approaches often portray themselves as attempts to reconcile the empirical aspects of distributional semantics with the structured aspects of formal semantics.",
        "However, they in fact only principally co-opt the syntax-sensitivity of formal semantics, while mostly eschewing the logical aspects.",
        "Expressing the effect of logical operations in high dimensional distributional semantic models is a very different task than in boolean logic.",
        "For example, whereas predicates such as ?red?",
        "are seen in predicate calculi as functions mapping elements of some set Mred to > (and all other domain elements to ?",
        "), in compositional distributional models we give the meaning of ?red?",
        "a vector-like representation, and devise some combination operation with noun representations to obtain the representation for an adjective-noun pair.",
        "Under the logical view, negation of a predicate therefore yields a new truth-function mapping elements of the complement of Mred to > (and all other domain elements to?",
        "), but the effect of negation and other logical operations in distributional models is not so sharp: we expect the representation for ?not red?",
        "to remain close to other objects of the same domain of discourse (i.e. other colours) while being sufficiently different from the representation of ?red?",
        "in some manner.",
        "Exactly how textual logic",
        "would best be represented in a continuous vector space model remains an open problem.",

        "We explain the linguistic and model-related impacts of this mode of representation and discuss how this approach could be generalised to other semantic functions.",
        "In Section 2, we provide an overview of work relating to that presented in this paper, covering the integration of logical elements in distributional models, and the integration of distributional elements in logical models.",

        "We argue for the elimination of non-linearities from such models, and thus show that negation cannot adequately be captured.",

        "The various approaches to combining logic with distributional semantics can broadly be put into three categories: those approaches which use distributional models to enhance existing logical tools; those which seek to replicate logic with the mathematical constructs of distributional models; and those which provide new mathematical definitions of logical operations within distributional semantics.",

        "(2008) to deal with issues polysemy and ambiguity.",
        "As this class of approaches deals with improving logic-based models rather than giving a distributional account of logical function words, we view such models as orthogonal to the effort presented in this paper.",
        "Logic with vectors The second class of approaches seeks to integrate boolean-like logical operations into distributional semantic models using existing mechanisms for representing and composing semantic vectors.",
        "Coecke et al. (2010) postulate a mathematical framework generalising the syntax-semantic passage of Montague Grammar (Montague, 1974) to other forms of syntactic and semantic representation.",
        "They show that the parses yielded by syntactic calculi satisfying certain structural constraints can be canonically mapped to vector combination operations in distributional semantic models.",
        "They illustrate their framework by demonstrating how the truth-value of sentences can be obtained from the combination of vector representations of words and multi-linear maps standing for logical predicates and relations.",
        "They furthermore give a matrix interpretation of negation as a ?swap?",
        "matrix which inverts the truth-value of vectorial sentence representations, and show how it can be embedded in sentence structure.",
        "Recently, Grefenstette (2013) showed that the examples from this framework could be extended to model a full quantifier-free predicate logic using tensors of rank 3 or lower.",
        "In parallel, Socher et al.",
        "(2012) showed that propositional logic can be learned using tensors of rank 2 or lower (i.e. only matrices and vectors) through the use of non-linear",
        "activation functions in recursive neural networks.",
        "The work of Coecke et al. (2010) and Grefenstette (2013) limits itself to defining, rather than learning, distributional representations of logical operators for distributional models that simulate logic, and makes no pretense to the provision of operations which generalise to higher-dimensional distributional semantic representations.",
        "As for the non-linear approach of Socher et al. (2012), we will discuss, in Section 4 below, the limitations with this model with regard to the task of modelling logic for higher dimensional representations.",
        "Logic for vectors The third and final class of approaches is the one the work presented here belongs to.",
        "This class includes attempts to define representations for logical operators in high dimensional semantic vector spaces.",
        "Such approaches do not seek to retrieve boolean logic and truth values, but to define what logical operators mean when applied to distributional representations.",
        "The seminal work in this area is found in the work of Widdows and Peters (2003), who define negation and other logical operators algebraically for high dimensional semantic vectors.",
        "Negation, under this approach, is effectively a binary relation rather than a unary relation: it expresses the semantics of statements such as ?A NOT B?",
        "rather than merely ?NOT B?, and does so by projecting the vector for A into the orthogonal subspace of the vector for B.",

        "In order to model logical operations over semantic vectors, we propose a tripartite meaning representation, which combines the separate and distinct treatment of domain-related and value-related aspects of semantic vectors with a domain-driven syntactic functional representation.",
        "This is a unification of various recent approaches to the problem of semantic representation in continuous distributional semantic modelling (Socher et al., 2012; Turney, 2012; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "We borrow from Socher et al. (2012) and others (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010) the idea that the information words refer to is of two sorts: first the semantic content of the word, which can be seen as the sense or reference to the concept the word stands for, and is typically modelled as a semantic vector; and second, the function the word has, which models the effect the word has on other words it combines with in phrases and sentences, and is typically modelled as a matrix or higher-order tensor.",
        "We borrow from Turney (2012) the idea that the semantic aspect of a word should not be modelled as a single vector where everything is equally important, but ideally as two or more vectors (or, as we do here, two or more regions of a vector) which stand for the aspects of a word relating to its domain, and those relating to its value.",
        "We therefore effectively suggest a tripartite representation of the semantics of words: a word's meaning is modelled by elements representing its value, domain, and function, respectively.",
        "The tripartite representation We argue that the tripartite representation suggested above allows us to explicitly capture several aspects of semantics.",
        "Further, while there may be additional distinct aspects of semantics, we argue that this is a minimal viable representation.",
        "First of all, the differentiation between domain and value is useful for establishing similarity within subspaces of meaning.",
        "For instance, the words blue and red share a common domain (colours) while having very different values.",
        "We hypothesise that making this distinction explicit will allow for the definition of more sophisticated and fine-grained semantics of logical operations, as discussed below.",
        "Although we will represent domain and value as two regions of a vector, there is no reason for these not to be treated as separate vectors at the time of comparison, as done by Turney (2012).",
        "Through the third part, the functional representation, we capture the compositional aspect of semantics: the functional representation governs how a term interacts with its environment.",
        "Inspired by the distributional interpretation (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Coecke et al., 2010) of syntactically-paramatrized semantic composition functions from Montogovian semantics (Montague, 1974), we will also assume the function part of our representation to be parametrized principally by syntax and domain rather than value.",
        "The intuition behind taking domain into account in addition to syntactic class being that all members of a domain largely interact with their environment",
        "in the same fashion.",

        "With the tripartite meaning representation we proposed one possible approach in that direction, which we subsequently expanded by discussing how negation should be captured in this representation.",
        "Having established a suitable and rigorous system for encoding meaning in compositional vectors, we were thus able to investigate the repre",
        "sentative power of the MV-RNN model.",
        "We focused this paper on the case of negation, which has the advantage that it does not require many additional assumptions about the underlying semantics.",
        "Our investigation showed that the basic MV-RNN model is incompatible with our notion of negation and thus with any textual logic building on this proposal.",
        "Subsequently, we analysed the reasons for this failure.",
        "We explained how the issue of negation affects the general class of MV-RNN models.",
        "Through the issue of double-negation we further showed how this issue is largely independent on the particular semantic encoding used.",
        "Based on this analysis we proposed an improved model that is able to capture such textual logic.",
        "In summary, this paper has two key contributions.",
        "First, we developed a tripartite representation for vector space based models of semantics, incorporating multiple previous approaches to this topic.",
        "Based on this representation, the second contribution of this paper was a modified MV-RNN model that can capture effects such as negation in its inherent structure.",
        "In future work, we would like to build on the proposals in this paper, both by extending our work on textual logic to include formulations for e.g. function words, quantifiers, or locative words.",
        "Similarly, we plan to experimentally validate these ideas.",
        "Possible tasks for this include sentiment analysis and relation extraction tasks such as in Socher et al. (2012) but also more specific tasks such as the *SEM shared task on negation scope and reversal (Morante and Blanco, 2012)."
