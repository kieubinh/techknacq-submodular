        "That is, ?translationese?",
        "makes DCs prone to being translated in ways that can differ markedly from their use in the source language.",

        "For cohesive markers and DCs, Koppel and Ordan (2011) and Cartoni et al. (2011) have shown that they may be more explicit (increased use) or less explicit (decreased use) in translationese.",
        "The paper focuses on the latter case, but the same detection method can be applied in reverse, in order to find increased use (explicitation) as well.",
        "In English about 100 types of explicit DCs have been annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank, or PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008) (We say more about this in Section 3.1).",
        "The actual set of markers or connectives is however rather open-ended (Prasad et al., 2010).",
        "DCs signal discourse relations that connect two spans of text and can be ambiguous with respect to the discourse relation they convey.",
        "Moreover, the same DC can simultaneously convey more than one discourse relation.",
        "For example, while can convey contrast or temporality, or both at the same time.",
        "On the other hand, discourse relations can also be conveyed implicitly, without an explicit DC.",
        "Human translators can chose to not translate a SL DC with a TL DC, where the latter would be redundant or where the SL discourse relation would more naturally be conveyed in the TL by other means (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "We will use the term ?zero-translation?",
        "or ?implicitation?",
        "for a valid translation that conveys the same sense as a lexically explicit SL connective, but not with the same form.",
        "As we will show, current SMT models either learn the explicit lexicalization of a SL connective to a TL connective, or treat the former as a random variation, realizing it or not.",
        "Learning other valid ways of conveying the same discourse relation might not only result in more fluent TL text, but also help raise its BLEU score by more closely resembling its more implicit human reference text.",
        "The paper presents work in progress on a corpus study where zero-translations of DCs have been semi-automatically detected in human reference and machine translations from English (EN) to French (FR) and German (DE) (Section 3).",
