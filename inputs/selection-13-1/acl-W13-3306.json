      "text": [
        "Recently, research in statistical machine translation (SMT) has renewed interest in the fact that for a variety of linguistic phenomena one needs information from a longer-range context.",
        "Current statistical translation models and decoding algorithms operate at the sentence and/or phrase level only, not considering already translated context from previous sentences.",
        "This local distance is in many cases too restrictive to correctly model lexical cohesion, referential expressions (noun phrases, pronouns), and discourse markers, all of which relate to the sentence(s) before the one to be translated.",
        "Discourse relations between sentences are often conveyed by explicit discourse connectives (DC), such as although, because, but, since, while.",
        "DCs play a significant role in coherence and readability of a text.",
        "Likewise, if a wrong connective is used in translation, the target text can be fully incomprehensible or not conveying the same meaning as was established by the discourse relations in the source text.",
        "In English, about 100 types of such explicit connectives have been annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB, see Section 4), signaling discourse relations such as temporality or contrast between two spans of text.",
        "Depending on the set of relations used, there can be up to 130 such relations and combinations thereof.",
        "Discourse relations can also be present implicitly (inferred from the context), without any explicit marker being present.",
        "Although annotation for implicit DCs exists as well, we only deal with explicit DCs in this paper.",
        "DCs are difficult to translate mainly because a same English connective can signal different discourse relations in different contexts and when the target language has either different connectives according to the source relations signaled or uses different lexical or syntactical constructs in place of the English connective.",
        "In this paper, we present MT experiments from English (EN) to Czech (CZ) with a large amount of manually annotated DCs.",
        "The corpus, the parallel Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT) (Section 4), is directly usable for MT experiments: the entire discourse annotation in EN is paralleled with a human CZ translation.",
        "This means that we can build and evaluate, against the CZ reference, a translation system, that learns from the EN gold standard discourse relations.",
        "These then have no distortion from wrongly la-beled connectives as it is given in related work (Section 3) where automatic classifiers have been used to label the connectives with a certain error rate.",
        "Furthermore, we can use the sense labels for 100 types of EN connectives, whereas related work only focused on a few highly ambiguous connectives that are especially problematic for translation.",
        "The paper starts by illustrating difficult translations involving connectives (Section 2) and discusses related work in Section 3.",
        "The resources and data used are introduced in Section 4.",
        "The MT experiments are explained in Section 5 and",
        "automatic evaluation is given in Section 6.",
        "We further provide a detailed manual evaluation and error analysis for the CZ translations generated by our SMT systems (Section 7).",

        "The disambiguation of DCs can be seen as a special form of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), that has been applied to SMT for content words with slight improvements to translation quality (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "DCs however form a class of procedural function words that relate text spans from an arbitrarily long context and their disambiguation needs features from that longer-range context.",
        "Only few studies address function word disambiguation for SMT: Chang et al. (2009) disambiguate a multifunctional Chinese particle for Chinese/English translation and Ma et al. (2011) use tagging of English collocational particles for translation into Chinese.",
        "Lexical cohesion at the document level has recently also come into play, with studies on lexical consistency in SMT (Carpuat, 2009; Carpuat and Simard, 2012), topic modeling applied to SMT (Eidelman et al., 2012) or decoding with document-wide features (Hardmeier et al., 2012).",
        "A recently published article summarizes most of the work on SMT with the broader perspective of discourse, lexical cohesion and co-reference (Hardmeier, 2013).",
        "For discourse relations and DCs especially, more and more annotated resources have become available in several languages, such as English (Prasad et al., 2008), French (Pe?ry-Woodley et al., 2009; Danlos et al., 2012), German (Stede, 2004), Arabic (AlSaif, 2012), Chinese (Zhou and Xue, 2012) and Czech (Mladova?",
        "et al, 2009).",
        "These resources however remain mostly monolingual, i.e. translations or parallel texts in other languages do normally not exist.",
        "This makes these resources not directly usable for MT experiments.",
        "Recent work has shown that more adequate and coherent translations can be generated for English/French when ambiguous connectives in the source language are annotated with the discourse relation they signal (Popescu-Belis et al., 2012).",
        "SMT systems for European language pairs are most often trained on Europarl corpus data (Koehn, 2005), where only a small amount of discourse-annotated instances is available (8 connectives with about 300-500 manual annotations each).",
        "Meyer and Popescu-Belis (2012) therefore used these few examples to train automatic classifiers that introduce the sense labels for the connectives in the entire English text of the Europarl corpus.",
        "Although these classifiers are state-of-the-art, they can have an error rate of up to 30% when labeling unseen instances of connectives.",
        "The discourse-aware SMT systems nevertheless improved about 8-10% of the connective translations.",
        "When integrating into SMT directly the small manually-labeled data, without training classifiers, hardly any translation improvement was measurable, cf. (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012)."

        "We presented experiments for EN/CZ SMT with a large amount of hand-labeled discourse connectives that are disambiguated in the source language and training material for MT systems by their sense tags or discourse relations they signal.",
        "This leads to improved translations in cases where the source DC is highly ambiguous or where the target language uses other syntactical constructs than a connective to convey the discourse relation.",
        "Using all 100 types of EN DCs in the corpus and/or all the detailed sense tags from the manual annotation most probably lead to the only very slight improvements for the discourse-aware systems when measured quantitatively over the whole test sets.",
        "In future work we plan to more thoroughly analyze which connectives need to be disambiguated at which sense granularity level before implementing them into an SMT system.",
        "For label implementation there also are other ways worth examining, such as factored translation models that handle the supplementary linguistic information as separate features and alternative decoding paths."
