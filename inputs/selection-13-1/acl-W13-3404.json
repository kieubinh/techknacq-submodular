        "In September 2003 the 1st International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL, n?e International Olympiad in Theoretical, Mathematical and Applied Linguistics), an annual contest for secondary-school students in solving self-sufficient linguistic problems (Derzhanski, Payne 2009), took place in Bulgaria.",
        "Six countries were represented by a total of 33 participants.",
        "At the 10th instalment in 2012 the countries were 26, the contestants 131, and both numbers keep growing.",
        "Since its launching, multilinguality has been a crucial feature of IOL.",
        "A linguistic problem depends more on the language in which it is formulated than a problem in, e.g., mathematics: not every problem can work in all languages, and even when it can, producing versions which give equal chances to all contestants is not always straightforward.",
        "For this reason at IOL, unlike many other international fora, there is no question of limiting the working languages to one or just a few.",
        "Accordingly their number has grown from five at IOL1 to fifteen at IOL10.1 For the 1 In fact at IOL1 and some subsequent early IOLs the versions that were made outnumbered the actual working languages by one, because an English version was made, although not used at the contest, for general reference and for advertising.",
        "At some of the recent IOLs, too, there have same reason the versions of the problem set in all working languages can't be created immediately before the contest, as is done at some of the other international science olympiads; they need to be prepared and verified well in advance.",
        "The production of the multilingual package is a time-consuming and error-prone task, and it calls for the development of tools and methods to increase its efficiency and reliability."

        "A linguistic problem is composed of language material and surrounding text; the language material in turn consists of data in unfamiliar languages and in Solverese2 (usually translations of the unfamiliar language data).",
        "In a multilingual edition of the problem set it is imperative that the Solverese parts be equivalent and everything else be identical.",
        "Figure 1 presents half a page from the Dutch and the English versions of the IOL1 problem set.",
        "It is easy to see that the formatting, the formulae and the Egyptian Arabic expressions had to be exactly the same.",
        "In order to minimise the effort needed to edit the problems in all working languages and the chance that a technical mishap might create a divergence where none should occur, an ad hoc method was invented.",
        "The problem set was written in LATEX, 3 with a master source file for each been more versions than working languages, as the versions in British and American English have been separate, though only differing in the format of the dates and in the spelling",
        "of a few words.",
        "2 On this term see (Bozhanov, Derzhanski 2013, fn.",
        "2).",
        "3 This choice was made because TEX is not a mere typeset",
        "ting system but a full-fledged programming environment, which enables some of the text to be computed rather than typed, greatly reducing the danger of typographic errors.",
        "The most powerful inspiration was (Knuth 1986, p. 218); see also (Derzhanski 2009, Appendix A).",
        "language version and a file of common macro definitions, input by all master files.",
        "Figure 2 shows how this works.",
        "The excerpts from the master files generate the text of the problem seen in Figure 1.",
        "Both master files refer to the shared macro file for the set of equalities in the data (\\fracdata) and the equality in the assignment (\\fractest).",
        "The macro file also takes care of the uniformity of the formatting of problems and assignments, although the words for ?Problem?",
        "and ?Assignment?",
        "in the respective languages are defined in the master files (\\probword and \\asgtword).",
        "The same technique saves repetition within each text, for example, when handling a very common form of assignment: \\def \\fordword #1{Vertaal in het #1} \\assignment \\fordword {Nederlands}: [twice (in Problem 1 and in Problem 4)]",
        "The system made the production of the six parallel problem sets significantly more efficient and reliable than if six separate documents had been written.",
        "Still, much material is shared by the source files, and as can be seen from Figure 1, the texts in Dutch and in English differ more than they need to."

        "The problem sets for IOL2?5 were prepared in Microsoft Word as separate documents, and the identity of the unknown language material as well as the equivalence of the Solverese texts was checked entirely by human eye and hand.",
        "By the time the LATEX-based multilingual system was revived (in 2008), things had changed in several respects.",
        "The number of participants in IOL had grown significantly, as had the quantity and diversity of the working languages; IOL itself had become more mature, and harder problems were being assigned; most importantly, the awareness of IOL's Problem Committee of the need to invest more time and attention into the preparation of the problem set (Derzhanski et al., 2004) had increased.",
        "But with only so many days in the year, this all meant that the multilingual process often had to start before the content of the problems had been finalised, with changes sometimes proving necessary as an effect of this process, as it emerged that some problems (or parts of them), especially problems involving word semantics, would be easier, or certain explanations make more sense, in some languages than in others.4 And having to make the same content change in several parallel texts is undesirable, for obvious reasons.",
        "Therefore when the system came back to life in the weeks before IOL6, it did so as its own antithesis.",
        "In the new version, which has been in use ever since, the main source files for the individual Solverese versions are very brief.",
        "Apart from setting the paper size and the encodings and invoking the Babel package (Braams, 2008) with the appropriate language settings, each inputs two other files.",
        "One is composed entirely of macro definitions; this is effectively a pseu-docode-to-Solverese dictionary.",
        "The other is the text of the problems (statements and solutions), the same for all versions, written entirely in the said pseudocode.",
        "4 Several early versions of Problem IOL10#5 (on Rotuman, by Boris Iomdin and Alexander Piperski) required the solver to make the conjecture that in Rotuman the word for ?grey?",

        "bend, healthy ?",
        "heal) or as periphrastic ones (fat ?",
        "make fat, sleep ?",
        "make fall asleep), but which were which differed from one working language to the other.",

        "versions are translations.",
        "The parallel production of all Solverese versions from the same pseudocode source and with use of dictionaries made from a table where all working languages are uniformly situated creates the effect of (machine) translation from pseudocode to all languages, which in turn makes all languages equal.",
        "At a contest such as IOL, where all contestants are to have the same chances regardless of their working languages, this is of vital importance.",
        "The method has been tested and proven to work with two Cyrillic-written and 12 Roman-written languages, as well as Korean (at IOL7) and Hebrew (at IOL10), with hardly any technical difficulties.",
        "It remains to be seen whether it will meet just as cheerfully the predictable further growth of the number and diversity of IOL's working languages, but it is certain that its potential has not yet been fully explored."
