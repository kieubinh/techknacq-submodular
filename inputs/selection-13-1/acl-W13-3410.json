        "The forum of 2010 started as a new initiative and was the first independent evaluation of morphology parsers for Russian in Russia.",
        "At the same time the forum campaign has been a source of a successful academic course which resulted in a close-knit student team, strong enough to implement the two-year research for the second forum on syntax, held in 2012.",

        "those, inheriting the Soviet tradition, as well as the new commercial industry labs - existed in a disjoined mode.",
        "The absence of the state-of-the-art investigation on the performance of parsers for Russian as well as on the effect of different computational methods for Russian rich morphology impeded the teaching of computational linguistics, making it dilettantish.",
        "It's not surprising that the first initiative of the Evaluation forum emerged in the academy.",
        "The academic status of the initiative also guaranteed its independence.",
        "The complete cycle of the forum in 2010 on morphology, starting with mark-up scheme of the Gold Standard and ending the final paper preparation has served as a basis for a course in computational linguistics with excellent set of tasks for students to carry out.",
        "The problem of the first year experience was insufficient communication with all the participants during the forum preparation.",
        "This is very important for the pioneer status of the forum and also the educational perspective of the initiative.",
        "That's why the two year period of forum preparation has been chosen.",
        "The task of the first year is to prepare and hold a round-table open to all the potential participants where the basic decisions on the test collections, tasks, mark-up and evaluation process are made.",
        "The task of the second year is the evaluation forum itself and the preparation of an overview paper.",
        "Below we will focus on the educational process: we will describe student tasks during the complete cycle of the evaluation forum preparation.",
        "The consistent practical aim of the course distinguishes in from most of the courses in computational linguistics (Hearst, 2005; Liddy and McCracken, 2005; Baldridge and Erk, 2008).",
        "This is a course in NLP evaluation which, as we believe, gives students very useful theoretical and practical skills of making sound and deliberate decisions during linguistic data analyses.",
        "The main idea of the course is to involve students into solving ?real-life?",
        "expert tasks, and to show them multiple approaches to mark-up and data analysis.",
        "We would like to underline that the practical value of the course: students not only do the routine assessment procedure, but analyze the best practices and create the design of the forum.",
        "The course is organized as follows: students complete tasks at home and discuss the results at class with two",
        "or three instructors.",
        "The experienced students may act as instructors also.",
        "The class ends by collective presentation at the conference.",
        "Students work in small teams of 2 or 3 persons, each team doing its piece of work.",
        "All the students have strong background in theoretical linguistics and math, some students have good programming skills.",
        "The main stages of the first year are: 1) getting theoretical background 2) first mark-up experience and proto-gold standard 3) feedback from the participants 4) round-table preparation.",
        "The second year consists of the following stage: 5) preparing Gold Standard 6) results evaluation 7) final paper preparation.",
        "These stages correspond to the four semesters of special courses on NLP, home task activities, hands-on student activities and practice in academic writing.",

        "Primarily students study reports of the main evaluation forums that have been held on the current task.",
        "The topics to be discussed in class are: the types of system running the competitions (statistical, rule-based, hybrid), their theoretical linguistic basis: for example, HPSG parsers or dependency parsers for syntax; the test collections, their sources, size and mark-up scheme; the tasks and their metrics; the performance rate.",
        "The students have to find the answers on all this questions making their way through exhaustive reports, they have to draw out some common grounds to be compared and ana-lyzed.",
        "For example for the syntax forum (Gareyshina et al., 2012) treebanks of different languages and structure types has been analyzed and compared.",
        "The very important point of this stage is that it results in collective determining some ideal scenario of the future forum which is to be inevitably corrected by performing the second investigation ?",
        "examining all the information about the potential participants, such as collecting and reading all the related papers, testing demos or installing the open-source resources.",
        "For example, the main problem for the morphology forum was to determine a mark-up scheme that would be convenient for all the participants (Lyasevskaya et al., 2010).",
        "This problem is crucial because of Russian rich morphology and the variety of theoretical traditions different systems rest upon.",
        "The investigation of syntactic parsing (all the systems that took part in the forum, use dependency parsing) revealed the impossibility to compare the types of syntactic relations specified by different systems.",
        "The fact is not surprising bearing in mind that there is no open treebank such as Penn tree bank to be trained on for Russian.",
        "The workshop devoted to comparing different syntactic parsing outputs has been exhausting but fruitful: we arrived to a decision that the main task of the forum should include only evaluating what syntactic heads were to be marked by the participants.",
        "Correctness of parsing the whole sentence was decided to count as irrelevant.",
        "Only the choice of the head was evaluated.",
        "We would like to underline that the design and the scenario of the forums are always determined as a result of individual work of student groups together with collective analysis and summing-up conclusions.",
        "Finally the last but not the least object of this task is to juxtapose theoretical and computational linguistics: students have to analyze the scope of underlining linguistic phenomena and to compare them with applied realizations in NLP.",
        "The more sophisticated linguistic task is in focus, the more interesting topics are raised in class.",
        "For example, the examination of different principles of anaphoric resolution this year showed the limits of applied tasks and solutions (particularly in discourse anaphora resolution and identifying lexical coherence determined extralinguistically), and revealed the perspectives of future development in NLP and artificial intelligence.",
        "The analysis is then partly fulfilled in Gold Standard mark-up.",
        "The scheme is always broader then it has to be for the evaluation task.",
        "The important additional outcome of such corpus mark-up is to prepare some new open resource that can serve also for corpus linguistic and theoretical linguistic research."
