        "An introductory course to Information Science has been taught at Columbia University for over a decade.",
        "The main goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates at our university to applications of Computer Science.",
        "For most students, this is their first course in the Computer Science department.",
        "The course has no prerequisites such as higher mathematics or programming.",
        "In fact, through a survey we found that about 10% of the class did not know the meaning of a programming language.",
        "Traditionally, the computer science applications that have been taught in this course include HTML (creating a website), Spreadsheets, Database Systems, World Wide Web and the Internet, Algorithms and programming in Python.",
        "Given the importance of understanding how humans are building smart machines and the amount of excitement around Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) applications, we decided to include a social media analysis application ?",
        "sentiment analysis of Twitter ?",
        "in the curriculum last year.",
        "The overall response to this inclusion has been positive.",
        "One outcome of this inclusion is that the students are now able to build basic models for popular NLP applications such as sentiment analysis of Twitter, spam detection of emails, and document classification.",
        "But a more significant outcome of this inclusion is that the students seemed to have gained a general idea of how machine learning works, as a result, they find Watson playing Jeopardy!",
        "against the humans, and Google's self-driving car less ?magical?.",
        "There were two main challenges in incorporating an introduction to NLP and ML to the curriculum: (1) we wanted to include this topic without compromising the traditionally covered material, which put a constraint on the number of lectures we could use for introducing NLP and ML and (2) we were required to abstract away from the inherently mathematical jargon used to explain NLP and ML.",
        "In this paper we present the way we met these challenges.",
        "We present our lecture, homework and examination design that enabled us to get some of the most important ideas of NLP and ML across in one lecture.",
        "The students performed exceptionally well on the NLP/ML section of the examination.",
        "Moreover, some students are pursuing projects related to these topics formulating their own tasks, collecting and annotating data, and building models to answer their hypotheses.",
        "These are signs that undergraduates with a broad spectrum of educational backgrounds and interests are not only capable of tackling the basics of NLP and ML, but that they may even be doing so with relish.",
        "There has been successful and fruitful effort by researchers in the NLP community to share their experiences and course design through this workshop in the past (Lee, 2002; Eisner, 2002; Liddy and McCracken, 2005; Freedman, 2005; Zinsmeis-ter, 2008).",
        "Steven Bird (2008) notes that an introductory course needs to serve some common, basic needs ?",
        "?For some students, it will be the first step in a pathway leading to specialized courses, graduate research, or employment in this field.",
        "For students who do not continue, the introductory course will be their main exposure to the field.",
        "Naturally, this course is also a prime opportunity to promote the field to newcomers and encourage them to pursue advanced studies in this area.?",
        "We share the same motivation (as (Bird, 2008)) ?",
        "our target audience is in fact ?newbies?",
        "in Computer Science, who may or may not continue with more advanced topics in Computer Science, in which case this course will be their main exposure to the field and thus offers a great opportunity for us to promote the field.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we give details of the course and student demographics.",
        "Section 3 presents the NLP/ML lecture organization and content.",
        "In section 4 we present the problems on the mid term examination and performance of the students on the NLP/ML part of the exam.",

        "While these students have an idea of what they would like to major in, they are not required to finalize their majors until the final semester of their sophomore year.",
        "This introductory course is therefore a great opportunity to promote the field by exposing the students to some of the most exciting applications of Computer Science.",
        "In the first class of the course, we showed the students a video of Watson playing the popular gameshow Jeopardy!",
        "against the humans.",
        "It was surprising that only a few students knew of Watson.",
        "But even the ones who knew about it were excited and curious to learn how Watson actually",
        "Figure 2 presents a distribution of students based on the majors they are pursuing or intend to pursue.",

        "We first defined sentiment analysis as the task of building a machine that is able classify the polarity of opinions in text into one of two categories: positive and negative.1 We motivated this application by briefly discussing some of its use cases: predicting the outcome of a presidential election, gauging how a company or a product of a company is performing in the market, finding on average how people are feeling based on gender, location, age and weather.2 After posing the question ?",
        "how would a machine learn to predict if a tweet has a positive or a negative sentiment ?",
        "we first drew an analogy of how humans learn new concepts.",
        "Humans learn through examples and counter-examples.",
        "When we see a new object or learn a new concept, our instinct is to compare the new with the familiar.",
        "Our first attempt is to find similarities and dissimilarities between this new object with the objects we have already seen.",
        "Similarly, to train a machine, we first need to provide it with some labeled examples.",
        "For the task at hand, examples are tweets and their labels are manually annotated sentiment polarity (positive or negative).",
        "Using these training examples, the machine learns patterns of words that signify a particular sentiment.",
        "We started with a small list of words, calling them ?features?.",
        "The training data and features are presented in Table 1.",
        "We asked the students to fill out each cell in Table 1 by putting a 1 if a tweet contains a particular word and 0 if it does not contain that word.",
        "We mentioned that this process is called ?feature extraction?, in which we convert unstructured data into a structured representation.",
        "This representation is structured because each tweet is represented as an ordered and fixed list of features.",
        "We asked the students how they would calculate the similarity between two tweets.",
        "And we got an obvious answer ?",
        "count the number of words they have in common.",

        "The answer to this question was less obvious but once we gave them the formula, 1We defined the italicized words and gave examples to help students understand the definitions.",
        "We intentionally kept the definition of sentiment analysis simple and restricted to classifying polarity of opinions into positive and negative categories.",
        "the students were able to grasp it quickly.",
        "We introduced the formula as a bitwise multiplication of list of features followed by the summation of the resulting bits.",

        "The next question we asked was given a tweet, whose polarity is unknown (an unseen tweet), how might they use the training data to predict its polarity.",
        "This was a harder question, and though we did not expect an answer, we posed this question nonetheless to serve as a pause in the lecture and indicate that a key idea was coming.",
        "Before revealing the secret sauce, we made the analogy of how humans would do a similar task.",
        "Given two kinds of fish, say sea bass and salmon, the way we would classify a new fish into one of these two categories would be by comparing ?features?",
        "of the new fish with the features of sea bass and with the features of salmon followed by observing if the new fish is ?closer?",
        "to sea bass or salmon.",
        "Similarly, the machine will compare the list of features of the unseen tweet with the list of features of the positive and the list of features of the negative tweets and compute a similarity score that will allow the machine to make a prediction about the polarity of this unseen tweet.",
        "We then introduced the following formula:",
        "where N is the total number of training examples, Ti is the ith training example, S is the test tweet and Labeli is the human annotated polarity of Ti.",
        "The machine uses this score to make a final prediction.",
        "If the score is less than or equal to 0, the machine predicts the polarity of the tweet as negative.",
        "If the score is greater than 0, the machine predicts the polarity of the tweet as positive.",
        "We illustrated this by working out a few examples of how the machine will go about predicting the polarity of the following unseen tweets:",

        "common between the two tweets (namely ?good?).",
        "The similarity score between the first training example and the test example",
        "(b) Similarly, comparing the feature lists for T2 and S1, we get a similarity score s2 = ([0, 1, 0, 1, 0]?",
        "[1, 0, 0, 0, 0])?",
        "(?1) = 0 (c) Comparing the feature lists for T3 and S1, we get a similarity score s3 = ([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]?",
        "[1, 0, 0, 0, 0])?",
        "(+1) = 0 (d) Finally, comparing the feature lists for T4 and S1, we get a similarity score s4 = ([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]?",
        "[1, 0, 0, 0, 0])?",
        "(?1) = 0 3.",
        "Next, the machine adds all the similarity scores together to get an aggregated score for the test tweet s = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 = 1.",
        "Since s > 0,",
        "the machine predicts this test tweet T1, ?It is a good day for biking?, has a positive polarity.",
        "Having the students work out the other two examples in class on their own and interacting with their neighbors, they began to see the meaning of pattern recognition.",
        "Bringing their attention to Table 1, we pointed out that the word ?good?",
        "is associated with a positive polarity by virtue of appearing in a positively labeled tweet.",
        "The word ?pretty?",
        "is associated with a neutral polarity because it appears both in a positive and in a negative tweet.",
        "This means that the machine has learned that it cannot make a prediction simply based on the word ?pretty?.",
        "The test tweet ?The situation is not pretty?",
        "makes this point explicit.",
        "This tweet is classified correctly as negative but only because of the presence of the word ?not?, which appears in a negative tweet.",
        "In summary, through these worked out examples, we were able to drive home the following points: 1.",
        "The machine automatically learns the connotation of words by looking at how often certain words appear in positive and negative tweets.",
        "2.",

        "If we have too many negative tweets in our",
        "training data (as compared to the positive tweets), then would the machine not be predisposed to predict the polarity of an unseen tweet as negative?",

        "What appeared to be a promising machine learning technique in class, seemed to fail for this task.",
        "They realized that classifying movie reviews is much harder because of the words used in plot descriptions that mislead the classifier.",
