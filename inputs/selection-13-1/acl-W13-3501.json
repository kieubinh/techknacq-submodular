        "Active learning and domain adaptation are both important tools for reducing labeling cost on learning good supervised prediction models.",
        "Active learning reduces the cost of labeling by selecting the most informative instances to label, whereas domain adaptation obtains auxiliary label information by exploiting labeled data in related domains.",
        "Combining the efforts from both areas to further reduce the labeling cost is an important research direction to explore.",
        "In this paper, we consider online active learning with domain adaptations.",
        "Online learning has been widely studied (Borodin and El-Yaniv, 1998) due to its advantages of low memory requirement and fast computation speed.",
        "Dredze and Crammer (2008) applied online learning on domain adaptation and proposed to combine multiple similar source domains to perform online learning for the target domain, which provides a new opportunity for conducting active learning with domain adaptation.",
        "Online active learning with domain adaptation, to our knowledge, has just gained attention recently and has been addressed in (Rai et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011).",
        "The active online domain adaptation methods developed in (Rai et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011) leverage information from the source domain by domain adaptation to intelligently query labels for instances only in the target domain in an online fashion with a given budget.",
        "They assumed a large amount of labeled data is readily available in the source domain.",
        "In this work, we however tackle online active learning with domain adaptation in a different setting, where source domains with a large amount of free labeled data are not available.",
        "Instead we assume there are very few labeled instances in both the source and target domains and labels in both domains can be acquired with a cost.",
        "Moreover, we assume the annotation cost for acquiring labels in the source domain is much lower than the annotation cost in the target domain.",
        "This is a practical setting in many domain adaptation scenarios.",
        "For example, one aims to learn a good review classification model for high-end computers.",
        "It may be expensive to acquire labels for such product reviews.",
        "However, but it might be relatively much cheaper (but not free) to acquire labels for reviews on movies or restaurants.",
        "In such an active learning scenario, will a source domain with lower annotation cost still be helpful for reducing the labeling cost required to learn a good prediction model in the target domain?",
        "Our research result in this paper will answer this ques",
        "with domain adaptation.",
        "tion.",
        "Specifically, we address this online active domain adaptation problem by extending the online active learning framework in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2006) to consider active label acquirement in both domains.",
        "We first initialize the prediction model based on the initial labeled data in both the source and target domains (LS and LT ).",
        "Then in each round of the online learning, we receive one un-labeled instance from each domain (DS and DT ), on which we need to decide whether to query labels.",
        "Whenever a label is acquired, we update the prediction model using the newly labeled instance if necessary.",
        "The framework of this online active learning setting is demonstrated in Figure 1.",
        "We exploit multi-view learning principles to measure the informativeness of instances and propose two cost-sensitive online active learning methods, a multi-view uncertainty-based method and a multi-view disagreement-based method, to acquire labels for the most informative instances.",
        "Our empirical studies on the tasks of cross-domain sentiment classification of Amazon product reviews show the proposed methods can effectively acquire the most informative labels given a budget, comparing to alternative methods."

        "In this section, we will cover the most related work in the literature.",
        "Online active learning has been widely studied in the literature, including the perceptron-type methods in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2006; Monteleoni and Ka?a?ria?inen, 2007; Dasgupta et al., 2009).",
        "Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2006) proposed a selective sampling perceptron-like method (CBGZ), which serves as a general framework of online active learning.",

        "Dasgupta et al. (2009) analyzed the label complexity of the perceptron algorithm and presented a combination method of a modification of the perceptron update with an adaptive filtering rule.",
        "Our proposed online active learning methods are placed on an extended framework of (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2006), by incorporating domain adaptation and multi-view learning techniques in an effective way.",
        "Active domain adaptation has been studied in (Chan and Ng, 2007; Rai et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012).",
        "Chan and Ng (2007) presented an early study on active domain adaptation and empirically demonstrated that active learning can be successfully applied on out-of-domain word sense disambiguation systems.",
        "Li et al. (2012) proposed to first induce a shared subspace across domains and then actively label instances augmented with the induced latent features.",
        "Online active domain adaptation, however, has only been recently studied in (Rai et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011).",
        "Nevertheless, the active online domain adaptation method (AODA) and its variant method, domain-separator based AODA (DSAODA), proposed in these works assume a large amount of labeled data in the source domain and conduct online active learning only in the target domain, which is different from our problem setting in this paper.",
        "Multi-view learning techniques have recently been employed in domain adaptation (Tur, 2009; Blitzer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011).",
        "In particular, instead of using data with conditional independent views assumed in standard multi-view learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), Blitzer et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2011) randomly split original features into two disjoint subsets to produce two views, and demonstrate the usefulness of multi-view learning with synthetic two views.",
        "On the other hand, multi-view active learning has been studied in (Muslea et al., 2000, 2002; Wang and Zhou, 2008, 2010).",
        "These works all suggest to query labels for contention points (instances on which different views predict different labels).",
        "Our proposed methods will exploit this multi-view",
        "principle and apply it in our multi-view online active domain adaptation setting.",
        "In addition, our proposed work is also related to cost-sensitive active learning.",
        "But different from the traditional cost-sensitive active learning, which assumes multiple oracles with different costs exist for the same set of instances (Donmez and Carbonell, 2008; Arora et al., 2009), we assume two oracles, one for the source domain and one for the target domain.",
        "Overall, the problem we study in this paper is novel, practical and important.",
        "Our research will demonstrate a combination of advances in multiple research areas."

        "As we introduced before, synthetic multi-views produced by splitting the original feature space into disjoint subsets have been demonstrated effective in a few previous work (Blitzer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011).",
        "We adopt this idea to generate two views of the instances in both domains by randomly splitting the common feature space into two disjoint feature subsets, such that xs,r = {x(1)s,r ,x(2)s,r} and xt,r = {x(1)t,r ,x (2) t,r }.",

        "(3) It is reasonable that when ct/cs is very big, the SCS, which simply queries source instances, produces the best performance.",
        "But the proposed two cost-sensitive active learning methods, MUS and MDS, are quite robust to the cost ratios across a reasonable range of ct/cs values, and outperform both source-domain only and target-domain only methods.",
        "When ct = cs, the proposed cost-sensitive methods automatically favor target instances and thus achieve similar performance as TCS.",
