        "Recent years have seen increasing interest in text-to-text generation tasks such as paraphrasing and text simplification, due in large part to their direct utility in high-level natural language tasks such as abstractive summarization.",
        "The task of sentence compression in particular has benefited from the availability of a number of useful resources such as the the Ziff-Davis compression corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2000) and the Edinburgh compression corpus (Clarke and Lapata, 2006b) which make compression problems highly relevant for data-driven approaches involving language generation.",
        "The sentence compression task addresses the problem of minimizing the lexical footprint of a sentence, i.e., the number of words or characters in it, while preserving its most salient information.",
        "This is illustrated in the following example from the compression corpus of Clarke and Lapata (2006b): Original: In 1967 Chapman, who had cultivated a conventional image with his ubiquitous tweed jacket and pipe, by his own later admission stunned a party attended by his friends and future Python colleagues by coming out as a homosexual.",
        "Compressed: In 1967 Chapman, who had cultivated a conventional image, stunned a party by coming out as a homosexual.",
        "Compression can therefore be viewed as analogous to text summarization1 defined at the sentence level.",
        "Unsurprisingly, independent selection of tokens for an output sentence does not lead to fluent or meaningful compressions; thus, compression systems often assemble output text from units that are larger than single tokens such as n-grams (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) or edges in a dependency structure (Filippova and Strube, 2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010).",
        "These systems implicitly rely on a structural representation of text?as a sequence of tokens or as a dependency tree respectively?to to underpin the generation of an output sentence.",
        "In this work, we present structured transduc-tion: a novel supervised framework for sentence compression which employs a joint inference strategy to simultaneously recover sentence compressions under both these structural representations of text?a token sequence as well as a tree of syntactic dependencies.",
        "Sentence generation is treated as a discriminative structured prediction task in which rich linguistically-motivated 1To further the analogy, compression is most often formulated as a word deletion task which parallels the popular view of summarization as a sentence extraction task.",
        "features can be used to predict the informativeness of specific tokens within the input text as well as the fluency of n-grams and dependency relationships in the output text.",
        "We present a novel constrained integer linear program that optimally solves the joint inference problem, using the notion of commodity flow (Magnanti and Wolsey, 1994) to ensure the production of valid acyclic sequences and trees for an output sentence.",
        "The primary contributions of this work are: ?",
        "A supervised sequence-based compression model which outperforms Clarke & Lapata's (2008) state-of-the-art sequence-based compression system without relying on any hard syntactic constraints.",
        "?",
        "A formulation to jointly infer tree structures alongside sequentially-ordered n-grams, thereby permitting features that factor over both phrases and dependency relations.",
        "The structured transduction models offer additional flexibility when compared to existing models that compress via n-gram or dependency factorizations.",
        "For instance, the use of commodity flow constraints to ensure well-formed structure permits arbitrary reorderings of words in the input and is not restricted to producing text in the same order as the input like much previous work (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008) inter alia.2 We ran compression experiments with the proposed approaches on well-studied corpora from the domains of written news (Clarke and Lapata, 2006b) and broadcast news (Clarke and Lapata, 2008).",
        "Our supervised approaches show significant gains over the language model-based compression system of Clarke and Lapata (2008) under a variety of performance measures, yielding 13-15% relative F1 improvements for 4-gram retrieval over Clarke and Lapata (2008) under identical compression rate conditions."

        "This system, which we refer to as Seq ST, is otherwise trained under similar conditions as Joint ST. Table 2 contains an example of incorrect system output for the three systems under study and illustrates some specific quirks of each, such as the tendency of CL08 to preserve deeply nested noun phrases, the limited ability of Seq ST to identify heads of constituents and the potential for plausible but unusual output parses from Joint ST.",

        "We observe that the Joint ST model consistently identifies content words more accurately than the sequence-only models despite sharing all token and trigram features with Seq ST.",
        "Figure 3 studies the variation of RASP grammatical relation F1% with compression rate as an approximate measure of grammatical robustness.",
        "As all three systems track each other fairly closely, the plot conveys the absolute difference of the ST systems from the CL08 baseline, which reveals that Joint ST largely outperforms Seq ST under different compression conditions.",
        "We also note that a high compression rate, i.e., minimal compression, is generally favorable to CL08 under the RASP F1 measure and conjecture that this may be due to the hard syntactic constraints employed by CL08, some of which are defined over RASP relations.",
        "At higher compression rates, these constraints largely serve to prevent the loss of meaningful syntactic relationships, e.g., that between a preposition and its prepositional phrase; however, a restrictive compression rate would likely result in all such mutually-constrained components being dropped rather than simultaneously preserved.",
