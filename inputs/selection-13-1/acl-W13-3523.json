        "A machine-readable bilingual dictionary plays a very important role in many natural language processing tasks.",
        "In machine translation (MT), dictionaries can help in the domain adaptation setting (Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011).",
        "In cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR), dictionaries serve as efficient means for query translation (Resnik et al., 2011).",
        "Many other multilingual applications also rely on bilingual dictionaries as integral components.",
        "One approach for building a bilingual dictionary resource uses parallel sentence-aligned corpora.",
        "This is often done in the context of Statistical MT, using word alignment algorithms such as the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Unfortunately, parallel corpora may be scarce for certain language-pairs or domains of interest (e.g., medical and microblog).",
        "Thus, the use of comparable corpora for bilingual dictionary extraction has become an active research topic (Haghighi et al., 2008; Vulic?",
        "et al., 2011).",
        "Here, a comparable corpus is defined as collections of document pairs written in different languages but talking about the same topic (Koehn, 2010), such as interconnected Wikipedia articles.",
        "The challenge with bilingual dictionary extraction from comparable corpus is that existing word alignment methods developed for parallel corpus cannot be directly applied.",
        "We believe there are several desiderata for bilingual dictionary extraction algorithms:",
        "1.",
        "Low Resource Requirement: The approach should not rely on language-specific knowledge or a large scale seed lexicon.",
        "2.",
        "Polysemy Handling: One should handle the fact that a word form may have multiple meanings, and such meanings may be translated differently.",
        "3.",
        "Scalability: The approach should run effi",
        "ciently an massively large-scale datasets.",
        "Our framework addresses the above desired points by exploiting a novel combination of topic models and word alignment, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Intuitively, our approach works by first converting a comparable document-aligned corpus into a par",
        "allel topic-aligned corpus, then apply word alignment methods to model co-occurence within topics.",
        "By employing topic models, we avoid the need for seed lexicon and operate purely in the realm of unsupervised learning.",
        "By using word alignment on topic model results, we can easily model polysemy and extract topic-dependent lexicons.",
        "Specifically, let we be an English word and wf be a French word.",
        "One can think of traditional bilingual dictionary extraction as obtaining (we, wf ) pairs in which the probability p(we|wf ) or p(wf |we) is high.",
        "Our approach differs by modeling p(we|wf , t) or p(wf |we, t) instead, where t is a topic.",
        "The key intuition is that it is easier to tease out the translation of a polysemous word e given p(wf |we, t) rather than p(wf |we).",
        "A word may be polysemous, but given a topic, there is likely a one-to-one correspondence for the most appropriate translation.",
        "For example, under the simple model p(wf |we), the English word ?free?",
        "may be translated into the Japanese word ??",
        "(as in free speech) or ??",
        "(as in free beer) with equal 0.5 probability; this low probability may cause both translation pairs to be rejected by the dictionary extraction algorithm.",
        "On the other hand, given p(wf |we, t), where t is ?politics?",
        "or ?shopping?, we can allow high probabilities for both words depending on context.",

        "There is a plethora of research on bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora, starting with seminal works of (Rapp, 1995; Fung and Lo, 1998).",
        "The main idea is to assume that translation pairs have similar contexts, i.e. the distributional hypothesis, so extraction consists of 3 steps: (1) identify context windows around words, (2) translate context words using a seed bilingual dictionary, and (3) extract pairs that have high resulting similarity.",
        "Methods differ in how the seed dictionary is acquired (Koehn and Knight, 2002; De?jean et al., 2002) and how similarity is defined (Fung and Cheung, 2004; Tamura et al., 2012).",
        "Projection-based approaches have also been proposed, though they can be shown to be related to the aforementioned distributional approaches (Gaussier et al., 2004); for example, Haghighi (2008) uses CCA to map vectors in different languages into the same latent space.",

        "They do not use word alignments like we do and thus cannot model polysemy.",
        "Further, their approach requires training topic models with a large number of topics, which may limit the scalability of the approach.",
        "Recently, there has been much interest in multilingual topic models (MLTM) (Jagarlamudi and Daume, 2010; Mimno et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2009; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009).",
        "Many of these models give p(t|e) and p(t|f), but stop short of extracting a bilingual lexicon.",
        "Although topic models can group related e and f in the same topic cluster, the extraction of a high-precision dictionary requires additional effort.",

        "For each part of the topic-aligned corpora, we compute the ratio of distinct English word types vs. distinct Japanese word types.",
        "If the ratio is close to one, that means the partition into topic-aligned corpora effectively separates the skewed word-topic distribution of Fig 5.",

        "When we attempted to do this, using top-2 words per p(wf |tk) and p(we|tk), we could only obtain precision of 0.37 for 1600 extractions.",

        "Third, even if (we, wf ) intuitively belong to the same topic, they may not be direct translations; an extraction in this case would be a Correct Topic, Incorrect Alignment error (e.g.",

        "Table 3 shows the distribution of error types by a manual classification.",

        "We proposed an effective way to extract bilingual dictionaries by a novel combination of topic modeling and word alignment techniques.",
        "The key innovation is the conversion of a comparable document-aligned corpus into a parallel topic-aligned corpus, which allows word alignment techniques to learn topic-dependent translation models of the form p(we|wf , tk).",
        "While this kind of topic-dependent translation has been proposed for the parallel corpus (Zhao and Xing, 2007), we are the first to enable it for comparable corpora.",
        "Our large-scale experiments demonstrated that the proposed framework outperforms existing baselines under both automatic metrics and manual evaluation.",
        "We further show that our topic-dependent translation models can capture some of the polysemy phenomenon important in dictionary construction.",
        "Future work includes: 1.",
        "Exploring other topic models (Haffari and Teh, 2009) and word alignment techniques (DeNero and Macherey, 2011; Mermer and Saraclar, 2011; Moore, 2004) in our framework.",
