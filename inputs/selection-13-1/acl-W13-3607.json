      "text": [
        "Most approaches to error correction for non-native text are based on machine learning classifiers for specific error types (Leacock et al., 2010; Dale et al., 2012).",
        "Thus, for correcting determiner or preposition errors, for example, a multiclass model is built that uses a set of features from the local context around the target and predicts the expected article or preposition.",
        "If the output of the classifier is the same as the original sentence, the sentence is not corrected.",
        "Otherwise, a correction is made based on the predicted class.",
        "This is the de facto approach to error correction and is widely adopted in previous work.",
        "Building effective classifiers requires identification of features types from the text that discriminate well correcting each specific error type, such as part-of-speech tags of neighbouring words, n-gram statistics, etc., which in turn require additional linguistic resources.",
        "Classifiers designed to correct only one type of error do not perform well on nested or sequential errors.",
        "Correcting more than one type of error requires building and combining multiple classifiers.",
        "These factors make the solution highly dependent on engineering decisions (e.g. as regards features and algorithms) as well as complex and laborious to extend to new types.",
        "An attractive and simpler alternative is to think of error correction as a translation task.",
        "The underlying idea is that a statistical machine translation (SMT) system should be able to translate text written in ?bad?",
        "(incorrect) English into ?good?",
        "(correct) English.",
        "An advantage of using this approach is that there is no need for an explicit encoding of the contexts that surround each error (i.e. features) since SMT systems learn contextually-appropriate source-target mappings from the training data.",
        "Likewise, they do not require any special modification for correcting multiple error types sequentially, since they generate an overall corrected version of the sentence fixing as much as possible from what they have learnt.",
        "Provided the system is trained using a sufficiently large parallel corpus of incorrect-to-correct sentences, the model should handle all the observed errors without any further explicit information like previously detected error types, context or error boundaries, and so forth.",
        "The increasing performance of state-of-the-art SMT systems also suggests they could prove successful for other applications, such as error correction.",
        "In fact, SMT systems have been successfully used in a few such experiments, as we report below.",
        "The work presented here builds upon these initial experiments and explores the factors that may affect the performance of such systems.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a summary of previous research using SMT for error correction, Section 3 describes our approach and resources, and Section 4 reports our experiments and results.",
        "Section 5 discusses a number of issues related to the performance of our system and reports some at",
        "tempts at improving it while Section 6 includes our official performance in the shared task.",
        "Finally, Section 7 provides conclusions and ideas for future work."

        "Artificial errors are introduced in a deterministic manner using hand-coded rules including operations such as changing quantifiers (much?",
        "many), generating plurals (advice?",
        "advices) or inserting unnecessary determiners.",
        "Experiments show their SMT system was generally able to beat the standard Microsoft Word 2003 grammar checker, although it produced a relatively higher rate of erroneous corrections.",
        "Similar experiments were carried out by Mizu-moto et al. (2011) for correcting Japanese as a second language.",
        "However, their training corpus comprised authentic learner sentences together with corrections made by native speakers on a social learning network website.",
        "Because the original data has no explicit annotation of error types, the resulting SMT system is not type-constrained.",
        "Their results show that the approach is a viable way of obtaining very high performance at a relatively low cost provided a large amount of training data is available.",
        "These claims were later supported by similar experiments using English texts written by Japanese students (Mizumoto et al., 2012) Ehsan and Faili (2013) trained SMT systems for correcting grammatical errors and context-sensitive spelling mistakes in English and Farsi.",
        "Datasets are obtained by injecting artificial errors into well-formed treebank sentences using predefined error templates.",
        "Whenever an original sentence from the corpus matches one of these templates, a pair of correct and incorrect sentences is generated.",
        "This process is repeated multiple times if a single sentence matches more than one error template, thereby generating many pairs for the same original sentence.",
        "A comparison between the proposed systems and rule-based grammar checkers show they are complementary, with a hybrid system achieving the best performance.",
        "Other approaches using machine translation for error correction are not aimed at training SMT systems but rather at using them as auxiliary tools for producing round-trip translations (i.e. translations into a pivot foreign language and back into English) which are used for subsequent post-editing of the original sentence (Hermet and De?silets, 2009; Madnani et al., 2012).",
        "This differs from our work in that we focus on training and adapting SMT systems to make all the targeted corrections sequentially rather than using them as ?black boxes?",

        "In both evaluation rounds, our system scores third in terms of precision, which is particularly encouraging for error correction environments where precision is preferred over recall.",
        "However, these values should be considerably higher in order to prove useful in applications like self-assessment and tutoring systems (Andersen et al., 2013).",
        "Results also reveal precision on the test set is considerably higher than in our cross-validation experiments.",
        "This may be partly a result of the larger amount of training data in our final system and/or greater grammatical or thematic similarity between the test and training sets.",
        "Table 7 shows the distribution of system edits by error type.",
        "The results suggest that lexical heterogeneity in the contexts surrounding errors is a factor in performance, which might be improved through larger training sets."

        "In this paper we have described the use of SMT techniques for building an error correction system.",
        "We trained lexical and factored phrase-based systems using incremental combinations of training data and observed that, in general, recall increases at the expense of precision.",
        "However, this might be due to structural and thematic differences in the corpora we used.",

        "?Corr.?",
        "stands for correct edits, ?Missed?",
        "for missed edits and ?Unnec.?",
        "for unnecessary edits.",
        "The category ?Other?",
        "includes changes made by our system which do not belong to any of the other categories.",
        "new data, which caused a drop in precision but increased recall and F1.",
        "Cross-validation experiments show that our systems were unable to achieve particularly high performance (with precision, recall and F1 consistently below 0.20).",
        "A careful analysis revealed many factors that affect system performance, such as annotation criteria, training parameters and corpus size and heterogeneity.",
        "Our final system submitted to the CoNLL 2013 shared task was designed to circumvent some of these problems and maximise precision.",
        "Plans for future work include more detailed error analysis and the implementation of new solutions to avoid drops in performance.",
        "We would also like to test our approach in an unrestricted scenario (i.e. using corpora which are not limited to a fixed number of error types) and use more flexible evaluation schemes.",
        "We believe further study of the methods used for generating artificial errors is also vital to help SMT systems become a useful approach to error correction."
