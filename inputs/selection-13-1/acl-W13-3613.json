        "It uses very few additional resources: a morphological analyzer and a list of 250 common uncountable nouns, along with the training data provided by the organizers.",
        "The system uses the syntactic information available in the training data: this information is represented as syntactic n-grams, i.e. n-grams extracted by following the paths in dependency trees.",
        "The system is simple and was developed in a short period of time (1 month).",
        "Since it does not employ any additional resources or any sophisticated machine learning methods, it does not achieve high scores (specifically, it has low recall) but could be considered as a baseline system for the task.",
        "On the other hand, it shows what can be obtained using a simple rule-based approach and presents a few situations where the rule-based approach can perform better than ML approach."

        "There are two main approaches in the design of the modern linguistic experiments and the development of the natural language processing applications: rule-based and machine learning-based.",
        "In practical applications of machine learning (ML), the best results are achieved by the methods that use supervised learning, i.e., that are based on manually prepared training data for learning.",
        "It is also worth mentioning what can be considered a general rule for the combination of these two approaches: a system based on the mixed approach should obtain better results if each part of the system is applied according to its ?competence?.",
        "Specifically, some problems are better solved by the application of the rules?like the rules for choosing the correct allomorph of the article ?a?",
        "vs.",
        "?an?, while other problems are better solved by the usage of ML methods?such as deciding the presence or absence of a definite or an indefinite determiner.",
        "This paper describes the system developed for the CoNLL-2013 shared task.",
        "The task consists of grammar correction in texts written by people learning English as a second language (L2).",
        "There are five types of errors considered in the task: noun number, subject-verb agreement, verb form, article/determiner and choice of preposition.",
        "The training data processed by the Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) is provided.",
        "This data is part of the NUCLE corpus (Dahlmeier et al., 2013).",
        "The data also contains the error types and the corrected version.",
        "Development of the systemwas started only two months before the deadline, so it is also an interesting example of what can be done in a rather short period of time and with relatively little effort: only one person-month joint effort in total.",
        "In our system, we considered mainly the rule-based approach.",
        "Note that we used the ConLL data to extract preposition patterns, which can be considered as a very reduced form of machine learning with yes/no classifier, as well as to construct rules directly from the data.",
        "Another feature of our system is the widespread use of the syntactic information present in the provided data.",
        "In our previous works, we generalized the use of syntactic information in NLP by introducing the concept of syntactic n-grams, i.e. n-grams constructed by following the dependency paths in a syntactic tree (Sidorov et al., 2012; Sidorov et al., 2013).",
        "Note that they are not n-grams of POS tags, as could be assumed from the name; the name refers to the manner in which they",
        "of syntactic n-grams).",
        "are constructed.",
        "That is to say, in a dependency relation, there is always a head word and a dependent word.",
        "In the syntactic tree, this relation is graphically represented by an arrow: head?",
        "dependent.",
        "As it can be observed in Fig. 1, we can also use the tree hierarchy?the head word is always ?higher?",
        "in the syntactic tree.",
        "The algorithm for the construction of syntactic n-grams is as follows: we start from the root word and move to each dependent word following the dependency relations.",
        "At each step, the sequence of previous elements in the route taken are taken into account.",
        "The last n words in the sequence correspond to the syntactic n-gram.",
        "This could be reformulated as: we should take the last n words of the (unique) path from the root to the current word.",
        "In other words, we start from the root and reach one of the dependent words.",
        "If we want to construct bigrams, then we have a bigram already.",
        "If we need other elements of the n-gram, then we move to the word that is dependent and continue to the words that are dependent on it.",
        "If a word has several dependent words, we consider them one after another and thus, obtain several syntactic n-grams.",
        "Note that the head word always appears before the dependent word in the syntactic n-gram during the construction process.",
        "For example, from the tree presented in Fig. 1, the following syntactic bigrams can be extracted: likes-also, likes-dog, dog-my, likes-eating, eating-sausage.",
        "Note that only two syntactic 3-grams can be constructed: likes-dog-my, likes-eating-sausage.",
        "The construction process is the following: we start with the root word like.",
        "It has several dependent words: dog, also, eating.",
        "Considering them one after another, we obtain three syntactic bigrams.",
        "Then we move on to the word dog.",
        "It has only one dependent word: my.",
        "This is another bigram dog-my.",
        "However, the path from like also goes through it, so this is also the 3-gram like-dog-my, etc.",
        "The reader can compare these syntactic n-grams with traditional n-grams and consider their advantages: there are a lot less syntactic n-grams, they are less arbitrary, they have linguistic interpretation, etc.",
        "Note that syntactic n-grams can be formed by words (lemmas, stems), POS tags, names of dependency relations, or they can be mixed, i.e., a combination of the mentioned types.",
        "Being n-grams, they can be applied in any machine learning task where traditional n-grams are applied.",
        "However, unlike traditional n-grams, they have a clear linguistic interpretation and can be considered as an introduction of linguistic (syntactic) information into machine learning methods.",
        "Previously, we obtained better results by applying the syntactic n-grams to opinion mining and authorship attribution tasks compared to the traditional n-grams.",
        "Further in this paper, it is described how we use syntactic n-grams for the formulation of rules in our system and for the extraction of patterns.",
        "The system described in this paper does not obtain high scores.",
        "In our opinion, it could be considered a baseline system for the grammar correction task due to its simplicity, its use of very few additional resources and the speed of its development.",
        "Concretely, if a more sophisticated system outperforms ours, it reflects well upon that system.",
        "If it performs more poorly, its design should be revised.",
        "On the other hand, this paper also discusses the few situations where the rule-based system can outperform an ML approach.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, the ideal system would combine both these approaches.",
        "To quote Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994), ?don't guess if you know?.",
