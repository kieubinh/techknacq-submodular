        "For the last decades, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have become powerful tools in various domains such as mathematics (Koedinger et al., 1997), physics (Vanlehn et al., 2005; Litman and Silliman, 2004; Graesser et al., 2005), computer sciences (Corbett et al., 1995), reading (Mostow and Aist, 2001), or foreign languages (Heift and Schulze, 2007; Amaral and Meurers, 2011).",
        "Their appeal relies on the fact that each student does not have to follow an average teaching strategy, especially as the one-to-one tutoring has been proven the most efficent (Bloom, 1968).",
        "The expertise of a teacher relies on his capacity to advice at the right time the student to acquire new skills.",
        "To do so, the teacher is able to choose iteratively pedagogical activities.",
        "From this perspective, teaching is a sequential decision-making problem.",
        "To solve it, the reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) approach and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) paradigm have been successfully used (Iglesias et al., 2009).",
        "Given a situation, each teacher's decision is locally quantified by a reward.",
        "However, the consequences of the teacher's actions on the student's cognition cannot be exactly determined, which introduce uncertainty.",
        "To find a solution, one can notice that spoken dialogue management and tutoring are closely related.",
        "Both are humain-computer interactions in which the human user's intentions are not perfectly known.",
        "In the spoken dialogue case, the partial observability is due to the recognition errors introduced by the speech understanding module.",
        "They are taken into account by using some hypotheses about how the language is constructed.",
        "Thus, accurate models to link observations from the user's recognised utterances to the underlying intentions can be set up.",
        "For example, the Hidden Information State paradigm (Young et al., 2006; Young et al., 2010) builds a state which is a summary of the dialogue history (Gas?ic?",
        "et al, 2010; Daubigney et al., 2011; Daubigney et al., 2012).",
        "However, in the ITS case, such a state is harder to develop since the cognition cannot be determined by analysing a physical signal.",
        "Thus, a model-free approach is preferred here.",
        "To do so, a memory of the past observations and actions is built by means of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and more precisely an Echo State Network (ESN) (Jaeger, 2001).",
        "The internal state of the network can be shown (under some resonable conditions) to meet the Markov property (Szita et al., 2006).",
        "This internal state is then used with a standard RL algorithm to estimate the optimal solution.",
        "It has already been applied to RL in (Szita et al., 2006) in limited toy applications and it is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to use it in an interaction framework.",
        "The proof of concept presented in Szita's article uses the common SARSA algorithm which is an on-line and on-policy algorithm.",
        "Each improvement of the strat",
        "egy is directly tested.",
        "In the case of teaching, testing poor decisions can be problematic.",
        "Here, we thus propose the combination of an ESN with an off-line and off-policy algorithm, namely the Least Square Policy Algorithm (LSPI) (Lagoudakis and Parr, 2003), which is another original contribution of this paper.",
        "Indeed, learning the solution with Partially Observable MDPs in a batch and off-policy manner is not common in the literature."
