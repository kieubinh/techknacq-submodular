        "Evaluating the quality of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) has long since been a challenging task.",
        "While objective metrics like task completion and dialogue duration are not human-centered, subjective measures compensate for this by mod-eling the user's subjective experience.",
        "This information may be used to increase the dialogue system's performance (cf. (Ultes et al., 2012b)).",
        "In human-machine dialogues, however, there is no easy way of deriving the user's satisfaction level.",
        "Moreover, asking real users for answering questions about the system performance requires them to spend more time talking to the machine than necessary.",
        "It can be assumed that a regular user does not want to do this as human-machine dialogues usually have no conversational character but are task oriented.",
        "Hence, automatic approaches are the preferred choice.",
        "Famous work on determining the satisfaction level automatically is the PARADISE framework by Walker et al. (1997).",
        "Assuming a linear dependency between objective measures and User Satisfaction (US), a linear regression model is applied to determine US on the dialogue level.",
        "This is not only very costly, as dialogues must be performed with real users, but also inadequate if quality on a finer level is of interest, e.g., on the exchange level.",
        "To overcome this issue, work by Schmitt et al.",
        "(2011) introduced a new metric for measuring the performance of an SDS on the exchange level called Interaction Quality (IQ).",
        "They used statistical classification methods to automatically derive the quality based on interaction parameters.",
        "Quality labels were applied by expert raters after the dialogue on the exchange level, i.e., for each system-user-exchange.",
        "Automatically derived parameters were then used as features for creating a statistical classification model using static feature vectors.",
        "Based on the same data, Ultes et al. (2012a) put an emphasis on the sequential character of the IQ measure by applying temporal statistical classification using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Continuous Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs).",
        "However, statistical classifiers usually do not achieve perfect performance, i.e., there will always be misclassification.",
        "While most work focuses on applying different statistical models and improving them (Section 2), learning the error to correct the result afterwards represents a different approach.",
        "Therefore, we present our approach on estimating the error of IQ recognition models to correct their hypothesis in order to eventually yield better recognition rates (Section 4).",
        "The definition of IQ and data used for the evaluation of our approach (Section 5) is presented in Section 3.",
        "Our approach is also compared to a simple hierarchical approach also discussed in Section 5."

        "Based on this, counts, sums, means, and frequencies of exchange level parameters from multiple exchanges are computed to constitute the dialogue level (all exchanges up to the current one) and the window level (the three previous exchanges).",
