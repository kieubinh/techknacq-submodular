        "This demo paper describes our Artificial Intelligent Dialogue Agent (AIDA), a dialogue management and orchestration platform under development at the Institute for Infocomm Research.",
        "Among other features, it integrates different human-computer interaction engines across multiple domains and communication styles such as command, question answering, task-oriented dialogue and chat-oriented dialogue.",
        "The platform accepts both speech and text as input modalities by either direct microphone/keyboard connections or by means of mobile device wireless connection.",
        "The output interface, which is supported by a talking avatar, integrates speech and text along with other visual aids."

        "Some recent efforts towards the development of a more comprehensive framework for dialogue supported applications include research on multi-domain or multi-task dialogue agents (Komatani et.",

        "al 2009, Nakano et.",
        "al 2011, Lee et.",
        "al 2012).",
        "With this direction in mind, our Artificial Intelligent Dialogue Agent (AIDA) has been created aiming the following two objectives: (1) serving as a demonstrator platform for showcasing different dialogue systems and related technologies, and (2) providing an experimental framework for conducting research in the area of dialogue management and orchestration.",
        "The main objective of this paper is to present and describe the main characteristics of AIDA.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, in section 2, a description of APOLLO, the software integration platform supporting AIDA is presented.",
        "Then, in section 3, the main features of AIDA as a dialogue management and orchestration platform are described, and a real example of human interaction with AIDA is reported.",
        "Finally, in section 4, our conclusions and future work plans are presented."

        "APOLLO (Jiang et al. 2012) is a component pluggable dialogue framework, which allows for the interconnection and control of the different components required for the implementation of dialogue systems.",
        "This framework allows for the interoperability of four different classes of components: dialogue (ASR, NLU, NLG, TTS, etc.",
        "), managers (vertical domain-dependent task managers), input/output (speech, text, image and video devices), and backend (databases, web crawlers and indexes, rules and inference engines).",
        "The different components can be connected to APOLLO either by means of specifically created plug-ins or by using TCP-IP based socket communications.",
        "All component interactions are controlled by using XML scripts.",
        "Figure 1 presents a general overview of the APOLLO framework."

        "dialogue management and orchestration platform, which is implemented over the APOLLO framework.",
        "In AIDA, different communication task styles (command, question answering, task-oriented dialogue and chatting) are hierarchically organized according to their atomicity; i.e. more atomic (less interruptible) tasks are given preference over less atomic (more interruptible) tasks.",
        "In the case of the chatting engine, as it is the least atomic task of all, it is located in the bottom of the hierarchy.",
        "This engine also behaves as a back-off system, which is responsible for taking care of all the user interactions that other engines fail to resolve properly.",
        "In AIDA, a dialogue orchestration mechanism is used to simultaneously address the problems of domain switching and task selection.",
        "One of the main components of this mechanism is the user intention inference module, which makes informed decisions for selecting and assigning turns across the different individual engines in the platform.",
        "Domain and task selection decisions are made based on three different sources of information: the current user utterance, which includes standard semantic and pragmatic features extracted from the user utterance; engine information states, which takes into account individual information states from all active engines in the platform; and system expectations, which is constructed based on the most recent history of user-system interactions, the task hierarchy previously described and the archived profile of the current user interacting with the system.",
        "Our current implementation of AIDA integrates six different dialogue engines: (BC) a basic command application, which is responsible for serving basic requests such as accessing calendar and clock applications, interfacing with search engines, displaying maps, etc.",
        "; (RA) a receptionist application, which consists of a question answering system for providing information about the Fusionopolis Complex; (IR) I2R information system, which implements as question answering system about our institute; (FR) a flight reservation system, which consists of a frame-based dialogue engine that uses statistical natural language understanding; (RR) a restaurant recommendation system, which implements a three-stage frame-based dialogue system that uses rule-base natural language understanding, and (CH) our IRIS chatting agent (Banchs and Li, 2012).",
        "Regarding input/output modalities, speech and text can be used as input channels for user utterances.",
        "Direct connections via microphone and keyboard are supported, as well as remote connections via mobile devices.",
        "Additionally, audio and video inputs are used to provide AIDA with user identification and tracking capabilities.",
        "In the first case, speaker identification techniques are used to compare the voice profile of the current speaker with a set of users already known by the system.",
        "In the second case, face detection and tracking are used in combination with sound localization to determine what the current speaker's location is when dealing with multi-party dialogue scenarios.",
        "The main output of AIDA is composed of a browser interface in which several frames, including different visual elements, are presented along with a talking avatar.",
        "The different visual elements include a banner, a text display and a general purpose frame for displaying different html files, images or URL's as required.",
        "For avatar and text-to-speech, AIDA relies on the SitePal API (SitePal 2013).",
        "This API allows for controlling both the avatar speech and gaze.",
        "Speech functionalities are used for generating a spoken form of the system's output (which is also displayed as text in one of the frames of the interface) and gaze functionalities are used in combination with face tracking to direct the avatar attention to the user who is speaking.",
        "Finally, an actual example of a user interaction with the AIDA platform is presented in Table 1.",
        "In the table, the following information is provided for each of the turns composing the dialogue: the user utterance, the corresponding system response, the engine that was responsible for generating the response, and the action taken by the system (if any action was taken)."

        "It also combines speech recognition and synthesis, image processing and avatar technologies to improve the user-system interaction experience.",
        "Our future plans include the incorporation of more vertical applications into the platform, as well as the integration of machine translation engines to develop multilingual capabilities.",
