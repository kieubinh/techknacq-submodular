      "text": [
        "When people collaborate on physical or virtual tasks that involve manipulation of objects, dialogues become rich in gestures of different kinds; the actions themselves that collaborators engage in also perform a communicative function.",
        "Collaborators gesture while speaking, e.g. saying ?Try there??",
        "while pointing to a faraway location; they perform actions to reply to their partner's utterances, e.g. opening a cabinet to comply with ?please check cabinet number two?.",
        "Conversely, they use utterances to reply to their partner's gestures and actions, e.g. saying ?not there, try the other one?",
        "after their partner opens a cabinet.",
        "Gestures and actions are an important part of such dialogues; while the role of pointing gestures has been explored, the role that haptic actions (force exchanges) play in an interaction has not.",
        "In this paper, we present our corpus of multimodal dialogues in a home care setting: a helper is helping an elderly person perform activities of daily living (ADLs) such as preparing dinner.",
        "We investigate how to apply Dialogue Act (DA) classification to these multimodal dialogues.",
        "Many challenges arise.",
        "First, an utterance may not directly follow a spoken utterance, but a gesture or a haptic action.",
        "Likewise, the next move is not necessarily an utterance, it can be a gesture (pointing or haptics) only, or a multimodal utterance.",
        "Third, when people use gestures and actions together with utterances, the utterances become shorter, hence the textual context that has been used to advantage in many previous models is impoverished.",
        "Our contributions concern: exploring the dialogue functions of what we call Haptic-Ostensive (H-O) actions (Foster et al., 2008), namely haptics actions that often perform a referential function; experimenting with both offline and online DA classification, whereas most previous work only focuses on offline classification (Stolcke et al., 2000; Hastie et al., 2002; Di Eugenio et al., 2010a); highlighting the role played by multimodal features and dialogue structure (in the form of dialogue games) as concerns DA classification.",
        "Our work is part of the RoboHelper project (Di Eugenio et al., 2010b) whose ultimate goal is to deploy robotic assistants for the elderly so that they can safely remain living in their home.",
        "The models we derive from our experiments are the building blocks of a multimodal information-state based dialogue manager, whose architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The dialogue manager performs reference resolution, specifically resolving third person pronouns and deictics in utterances; classifies utterances to DAs; infers the dialogue games for utterances; updates the dialogue state, and finally decides what the next step is in the interaction.",
        "We have discussed our approach to multimodal reference resolution in (Chen et al., 2011; Chen and Di Eugenio, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the Dialogue Act classification component.",
        "We will also touch on Dialogue Game inference.",
        "Our collaborators are developing the speech processing, vision and haptic recognition components (Franzini and Ben-Arie, 2012; Ma and Ben-Arie, 2012; Javaid and Z?efran, 2012), that, when integrated with the dialogue manager we are building,",
        "will make the interface situated in and able to deal with a real environment.",
        "After discussing related work in Section 2, we present our multimodal corpus and the multidimensional annotation scheme we devised in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss all the features we used to build machine learning models to classify DAs.",
        "Sections 5 is devoted to our experiments and the results we obtained.",
        "We conclude and discuss future work in Section 6."

        "Due to its importance in dialogue research, DA classification has been the focus of a large body of research (Stolcke et al., 2000; Sridhar et al., 2009; Di Eugenio et al., 2010a; Boyer et al., 2011).",
        "Some of this work has been made possible by several available corpora tagged with DAs, including HCRC Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991), CallHome (Levin et al., 1998), Switchboard (Graff et al., 1998), ICSI Meeting Recorder (MRDA) (Shriberg et al., 2004), and the AMI multimodal corpus (Carletta, 2007).",
        "Researchers have applied various approaches to this task.",
        "Initially only simple textual features were used, e.g. n-grams were used to model the constraints for DA sequences in an HMM model (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Zimmermann et al. (2006) investigated the joint segmentation and classification of DAs using prosodic features.",
        "Sridhar et al. (2009) showed that prosodic cues can improve DA classification for a Maximum Entropy based model.",
        "Di Eugenio et al. (2010a) extended Latent Semantic Analysis with linguistic features, including dialogue game information.",
        "Boyer et al. (2011) integrates facial expressions to significantly improve the recognition of several DAs, whereas Ha et al. (2012) shows that automatically recognized postural features may help to disambiguate DAs.",
        "It should be pointed out that most of this work focuses on offline DA classification ?",
        "namely, DA classification is performed on the corpus using the gold-standard classification for the previous DA(s).",
        "Since some sort of history of previous DAs is used by all systems, using online classification for the previous DAs will unavoidably impact performance (Sridhar et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012).",
        "Additionally, for models such as HMMs and CRF that approach the problem as sequence labeling, online processing means that only a partial sequence is available."

        "We devised a multidimensional annotation scheme since we are interested in investigating the role played in the interaction by modalities different from speech.",
        "Our annotation scheme comprises three main components: the multimodal event annotation, which includes annotating for pointing gestures, haptic-ostensive actions, their features, and their relationships to utterances; the dialogue act annotation; and the referential expression annotations already described in (Chen et al., 2011; Chen and Di Eugenio, 2012).",
        "To study the roles played by different sorts of multimodal actions, and how they contribute to the flow of the dialogue, pointing gestures, Haptic-Ostensive (H-O) actions, and the relations among them have been annotated on the Find subcorpus.",

        "The first is, pointing gestures with an identifiable target, which is usually indicated by a short time stable hand pointing.",
        "The other type is without a fixed target.",
        "It usually happens when the subject points to several targets in a short time, or the subject just points to a large space area.",
        "For a pointing gesture, we mark two attributes: the time span and the target.",
        "The time span of a pointing gesture starts when the subject initiates the hand movement, ends when the subject starts to draw the hand back.",
        "We have devised a Referring Index System (Chen and Di Eugenio, 2012) to mark the different types of targets: single identifiable target, multiple identifiable targets and unidentifiable target.",
        "During Find tasks, subjects need to physically interact with the objects, e.g. they need to open cabinets to get plates, to put a pot on the stove etc.",
        "Those physical contact actions often perform a referring function as well, either adding new entities to the discourse model, or referring to an already established referent.",
        "For example, in Figure 3, the action [Touch(Hel,Drawer1)] that accompanies Utt4 disambiguates This by referring to Drawer1, tantamount to a pointing gesture; conversely, the action [Takeout(HEL,spoon1)] associated with Utt8 establishes a referent for spoon1.",

        "First, when we generate the dialogue history and dialogue game features, we use the previously classified DA tag results for online mode, while we use the gold-standard DA tags for offline mode.",
        "Second, MaxEnt (using beam search) and CRF evaluate and classify all the utterances in a dialogue at the same time in offline mode; however in online mode, MaxEnt and CRF can only work on the partial sequence up to the utterance to classify.",
        "Whereas this may sound obvious, it explains why the performance of these classifiers may be even more negatively affected in online mode with respect to their offline performance, as compared to other classifiers.",
        "We will see that indeed this will happen for CRF, but not for MaxEnt.",
        "To evaluate feature effectiveness, we group the features into seven groups: textual features (TX), utterance features (UT), pointing gesture feature (PT), HO action features (H-O), location features (LO), dialogue game feature (DG), dialogue history features (DH).",
        "Then we generate all the combinations of feature groups to run experiments.",
        "For each classification algorithm, we ran 10-fold cross-validation experiments, for each feature group combination, in both online and offline mode.",
        "It would be impossible to report all our results.",
        "Similarly to (Ha et al., 2012), we report our results with single feature groups and incremental feature group combinations, as shown in Table 5.",
        "Whereas all combinations were tried, the omitted results do not shed any additional light on the problem.",
        "The majority baseline, which always assigns the most frequent tag to every utterance, has an accuracy of 20.3%.",
        "The CRF offline model performs best, which confirms the results of (Kim et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012).",
        "This is due to the strong correlation between dialogue history features (DH) and the states of the CRF.",
        "In online mode, when there is noise in the previous DA tags, the CRF's performance drops significantly (p?.005, using ?2).",
        "A significant drop in performance from offline to online mode also happens to NB (p?.005) and DT (p<.025).",
        "MaxEnt performs very stably, the best online model performs only .015 worse than the best offline model.",
        "The best MaxEnt offline model beats the other algorithms?",
        "best models except CRF, while the MaxEnt online model outperforms all the other algorithms?",
        "online models.",
        "Our results thus demonstrate that MaxEnt works best for online DA classification on our data.",
        "As concerns features, for online models, textual features (TX) are the most predictive as a feature type used by itself.",
        "When we add pointing gesture (PT), HO features (H-O) and location features (LO) together to textual features, we notice a significant performance improvement for most models (except CRF models).",
        "For MaxEnt, which gives the best results for online models, none of the gesture, HO action and location features alone significantly improve the results, but all three to",
        "O+LO to TX (cf. lines 1 and 10); ** indicates significant improvement after adding DG to TX+PT+HO+LO+UT (cf. lines 11 and 12); ?indicates significant improvement after adding DH to TX+PT+HO+LO+UT+DG (cf. lines 12 and 13); bold font indicates the feature group set giving best performance for each column.",
        "gether do.",
        "This confirms the finding of (Ha et al., 2012) that non-verbal features help DA classification.",
        "To assess which feature is the most important among those three non-verbal features, we examined the experiment results with a leave-one-out strategy, that is for each classifier in offline and online modes, we leave one of the gesture, HO and location features out from the full experiment feature set (TX+PT+H-O+LO+UT+DG+DH).",
        "No significant difference was discovered.",
        "When the dialogue game features (DG) are added to the models, performance increases significantly for CRF offline model (p<.005), MaxEnt offline (p<.005) and online (p<.05) models, NB online model (p<.05) and DT online model (p<.005).",
        "It confirms previous findings, including by our group (Di Eugenio et al., 2010a), that dialogue game features (DG) play a very important role in DA classification, even via the simple approximation we used.",
        "When the dialogue history features (DH) are added to the models, performance increased significantly for all the offline models and the MaxEnt online model, with p<.005.",
        "This confirms previous findings that dialogue history helps with DA classification."
