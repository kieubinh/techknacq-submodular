        "Existing spoken dialogue systems are typically designed to operate in a static and well-defined domain, and are not well suited to tasks in which the concepts and values change dynamically.",
        "For example, consider a spoken dialogue system installed in a car, which is designed to provide information about nearby hotels and restaurants.",
        "In this case, not only will the data change as the car moves around, but the concepts (or slots) that a user might wish to use to frame a query will also change.",
        "For example, a restaurant system designed to be used within cities might not have the concept of ?al fresco?",
        "dining and could not therefore handle a query such as ?Find me a French restaurant where I can eat outside?.",
        "In order to make this possible, techniques will be needed to extend and adapt existing dialogue policies.",
        "Adaptation can be viewed as a process of improving action selection in a different condition to the one in which the policy was originally trained.",
        "While adaptation has been extensively studied in speech recognition (see an overview in (Gales and Young, 2007)), in spoken dialogue systems it is still relatively novel and covers a wide range of possible research topics (Litman and Pan, 1999; Litman and Pan, 2002; Georgila and Lemon, 2004; Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010).",
        "A recent trend in statistical dialogue modelling has been to model dialogue as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).",
        "This provides increased robustness to errors in speech understanding and automatic dialogue policy optimisation via reinforcement learning (Roy et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Williams and Young, 2007; Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010).",
        "A POMDP-based dialogue manager maintains a distribution over every possible dialogue state at every dialogue turn.",
        "This is called the belief state.",
        "Based on that distribution the system chooses the action that gives the highest expected reward, measured by the Q-function.",
        "The Q-function for a belief state and an action is the expected cumulative reward that can be obtained if that action is taken in that belief state.",
        "The optimisation typically requires O(105) to O(106) dialogues, so is normally done in interaction with a simulated user (Jurc??",
        "?c?ek et al., 2011b).",
        "In reinforcement learning, policy adaptation has been addressed in the context of transfer learning (Taylor and Stone, 2009).",
        "The core idea is to exploit expertise gained in one domain (source domain) to improve learning in another domain (target domain).",
        "A number of techniques have been developed but they have not been previously applied to dialogue management.",
        "Gaussian process (GP) based reinforcement learning (Engel, 2005) has been recently applied to POMDP dialogue policy optimisation in order to exploit the correlations between different belief states and thus reduce the number of dialogues needed for the learning process (Gas?ic?",
        "et al., 2010).",
        "An important feature of a Gaussian process is that it can incorporate a prior mean and variance for the function it estimates, in this case the Q-function.",
        "Setting these appropriately can significantly speed up the process of learning.",
        "If the mean or the variance are estimated in one environment, for example a particular user type or a particular domain, they can be used as a prior for adaptation in a different environment, i.e. another user type or another domain.",
        "A Gaussian process does not depend on the belief state but on the correlation between two belief states encoded by the kernel function.",
        "Therefore, if one defines a kernel function for two belief states in one domain, the policy can be used in a different domain, provided that the correlations between belief states follow a similar pattern.",
        "This paper explores the problem of extending an existing domain by introducing a previously unseen slot.",
        "Specifically, a simple restaurant system is considered which allows a user to search for restaurants based on food-type and area.",
        "This domain is then extended by introducing an additional price-range slot.",
        "The policy is trained for the basic two-slot domain and then reused in the extended domain by defining a modified kernel function and using adaptation.",
        "This strategy not only allows for the knowledge of a previously trained policy to be reused but it also guards against poor performance in the early stages of learning.",
        "This is particularly useful in a real-world situation where the adaptation is performed in direct interaction with users.",
        "In addition, a potential application of this technique to reduce the number of training dialogues is examined.",
        "The domain is decomposed into a series of simple domains and the policy is gradually adapted to the final domain with a smaller number of dialogues than are normally needed for training.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 the background on Gaussian processes in POMDP optimisation is given.",
        "Then Section 3 gives a description of the Bayesian Update of Dialogue State dialogue manager, which is used as a test-bed for the experiments.",
        "In Section 4, a simple method of kernel modification is described which allows a policy trained in the basic domain to be used in an extended domain.",
        "Methods of fast adaptation are investigated in Section 5 and this adaptation strategy is then tested via interaction with humans using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service in Section 6.",

        "The second important feature is that both adaptation strategies guarantee a minimum level of performance during training, which is better than the performance of the basic policy tested on the extended domain.",

        "to train a system in stages iteratively adapting to successively more complex domains (Taylor and Stone, 2009).",
        "We explored this idea by training the extended system in three stages.",

        "The second has an additional area slot (intermediate in Fig. 3) and the final domain has a the price-range slot added (final on the graph).",

        "It has been shown previously that Gaussian process reinforcement learning for this task normally takes 104 dialogues (Gas?ic?",
        "et al, 2012) so this schedule halves the number of dialogues needed for training.",
        "Also it is important to note that when training from scratch the average reward is less than 5 for 300 dialogues (see TRAIN in Fig. 2), in this case that only happens for about 100 dialogues (see initial-train in Fig. 3)."

        "This paper has investigated the problem of extending a dialogue system to handle new previously unseen concepts (i.e. slots) using adaptation based transfer learning.",
        "It has been shown that a GP kernel can be mapped to establish a relationship between a basic and an extended domain and that GP-based adaptation can restore a system to optimal performance within 200 to 300 adaptation dialogues.",
        "A major advantage of this technique is that it allows a minimum level of performance to be guaranteed and hence guards against subject",
        "training.",
        "The target is to achieve the performance of the fully trained 3 slot system as shown by the lower horizontal line final.",
        "This is achieved in three stages, with the target being achieved part way through the 3rd stage using just 3500 dialogues in total.",
        "ing the user to poor performance during the early stages of adaptation.",
        "Two methods of adaptation have been studied ?",
        "one based on augmenting the training points from the source domain with new points from the target domain, and a second which treats the source policy as a prior for the target policy.",
        "Results using the prior method were consistently better.",
        "In a further experiment, it was also shown that starting with a simple system and successively extending and adapting it slot by slot, can achieve optimal performance faster than one trained directly from scratch.",
        "These results suggest that it should be feasible to construct dialogue systems which can dynamically update and extend their domains of discourse automatically during direct conversations with users.",
        "However, further investigation of methods for learning the relationship between the new and the old domains is needed.",
        "Also, the scalability of these results to large-scale domain expansion remains a topic for future work."
