        "Using a 3D projection in a CAVE (Cruz-Neira et al., 1992), the raters were enabled to move freely around and through the recorded mocap data, including a 3D reconstruction of the experimental setting.",
        "This interactive 3D visualisation supported an advanced annotation process and improved the quality of the annotations but at high costs.",
        "Since then, we only know of Kipp (2010) who makes mocap data visible for annotators by presenting feature graphs in his annotation tool Anvil in a desktop-based setting.",
        "In later work, Nguyen and Kipp (2010) also support a 3D model of the speaker, but this needed to be hand-crafted by human annotators.",
        "A more holistic approach for gesture visualizations are the Gesture Space Volumes Pfeiffer (2011), which summarize gesture trajectories over longer timespans or multiple speakers.",
        "The IADE system also allowed us to add visual augmentations during the playback of the recorded data.",
        "These augmentations were based on the events from the mocap data, but aggregated several events to higher-level representations.",

      "text": [
        "During our work on the interface between speech and gesture meaning our previous annotations turned out to be insufficient to support the semantics of concepts such as CIRCULAR TRAJECTORY.",
        "This concept is a representative of many others that for human annotators are difficult to rate with the rigidity required for the symbolic level of semantics.",
        "Scientific visualisations, such as depicted in Figure 6, can be created to support the human raters.",
        "However, there is still the problem of perspective distortions three dimensional gestures are subject to when viewed from different angles and in particular when viewed on a 2D screen.",
        "It is also difficult to follow the complete trajectory of such gestures over time.",
        "Thus, one and the same gesture can be rated differently depending on the rater, while an algorithm with a defined threshold is not subject to these problems.",
        "The presented hybrid approach based on qualitative human annotations, mocap and our FA3ME framework is able to classify the particular 2D trajectories we are interested in following a three-step process: After the human annotator identified the phase and selected relevant trackers, the dimensions are reduced to two and a rigid model-based sketch-recognition algorithm is used to classify the trajectories.",
        "This classification is repeatable, consistent and independent of perspective.",
        "A first comparison of the manually annotated data and the automatic annotations revealed a high match.",
        "All differences between the annotations can be explained by restrictions of the video data which yielded a lower precision in the human annotations specifying the slant of the hand.",
        "Thus, the main issues we had with the results of human raters have been addressed, however a more formal evaluation on a large corpus remains to be done.",
        "What also remains is a specification of membership functions for each kind of gesture trajectories of interest (e.g., circular, rectangular, etc.).",
        "For this, a formal specification of what we commonly mean by, for instance, CIRCULAR, RECTANGULAR etc.",
        "is required.",
        "The automated annotation via mocap improves our original gesture datum to capture the circularity-information conveyed in the gesture.",
        "We have a better understanding of the gesture meaning adopted vis-a`-vis the datum considered.",
        "As it turns out, resorting to pragmatic inference cannot be avoided entirely, but we will exclude a lot of unwarranted readings which the manual-based logical formulae would still allow by using the approximation provided by body tracking methods.",
        "Not presented here is the way third-level multi-modal events are generated by re-simulating the data in a 3D world model to generate context events, e.g., to support pragmatics."
