        "We present a framework for conversational robots that facilitates four-participant groups with proper procedures for obtaining initiatives.",
        "Figure 1 (a) depicts a two-participant conversation.",
        "In such situations, conversational contexts including floor exchanges are commonly grounded between two interlocutors.",
        "Many dialogue systems have dealt with such two-participant situations (Raux and Eskenazi, 2009) (Chao and Thomaz, 2012).",
        "However, in three-participant conversations, as is shown in Figure 1(b), which is the minimum unit for multiparty conversation, floor exchanges cannot always be identified among the participants.",
        "Clark presented the participation structure model (Clark, 1996), drawing on Goffman's work (Goffman, 1981).",
        "In such three-participant situations, interactions between two dominant participants out of the three primarily occur (between participant A and B) and the other participant, who cannot properly get the floor to speak for a long while (cannot be promoted to be either a speaker or an addressee) tends to get left behind, even though all of them are 'ratified participants' considered by the current speaker.",
        "In terms of engagement among conversational participants, Martin et al., (Martin and White, 2005) proposed the appraisal theory that encompasses three subcategories, namely Attitude, Engagement, and Graduation.",
        "Attitude deals with expressions of affect, judgement, and appreciation.",
        "Engagement focuses on language use by which speakers negotiate an interpersonal space for their positions and the strategies which they uses to either acknowledge, ignore, or curtail other voices or points of view.",
        "Graduation focuses on the resources by which sparkers regulate the impact of these resources.",
        "Sidner et al., defined engagement as ?the process by which two (or more) participants establish, maintain and end their perceived connection during interactions they jointly undertake?",
        "(Sidner et al., 2004).",
        "Based on these previous studies, we define engagement as the process establishing connections among participants using dialogue actions so that they can represent their own positions properly.",
        "So, the three-participant model dictates the need for one more participant who helps the participant who is left behind to engage him/her in the conversation.",
        "Conversational robots have the potential to participate in such conversations as the fourth participant, as illustrated in Figure 1 (c-1).",
        "Figure 1 (c-2) gives an example of the participants' speech activities in a certain duration.",
        "In this example, participant C's activity is relatively smaller than that of the others, and so he/she is likely to get left behind in the current conversational situation for a number of reasons.",
        "When a robot steps into the situation to coordinate, there should be proper procedures in place to obtain initiatives to control conversational contexts and to give it back to the others.",
        "If a robot naively starts to approach a participant who is left behind just after a left-behind situation is detected, it could break the current conversation.",
        "In order to coordinate situations, a facilitator (robot) must take the following procedural steps: (1) Be aware of both the presence of dominant participants leading the current conversation and the status of a participant who is left behind, (2) Obtain the initiative to control the situation and wait for approval from the others, either explicitly or implicitly, and (3) Give the floor to a suitable participant.",
        "Research on specially situated facilitation agents in multiparty conversations has been conducted by various researchers.",
        "Two-participant conversation model, which conventional dialogue systems have focused on.",
        "(b) Three-participant conversation model, the minimum unit for a multiparty conversation.",
        "In such multiparty conversations, social imbalance occasionally occurs.",
        "(c-1) Four-participant conversation, with a robot that regulates the imbalance situation, and (c-2) chart showing the unequal speech activities of the participants.",
        "In this case, participant C appears to have less opportunity to take the floor to speak, hence, the robot is expected to help him.",
        "Matsusaka et al. pioneered the act of a physical robot participating in multiparty conversations (Matsusaka et al., 2003).",
        "We previously developed a multiparty quiz-game type facilitation system for elderly care (Matsuyama et al., 2008) and reported on the effectiveness of the existence of a robot (Matsuyama et al., 2010).",
        "Dosaka et al. developed a thought-evoking dialogue system for multiparty conversations with a quiz game task (Dohsaka et al., 2009).",
        "They reported that the existence of agents and empathic expressions are effective for user satisfaction and increase the number of user utterances.",
        "Bohus modeled engagement in multiparty conversations along Sinder's definition, namely open world dialogue (Bohus and Horvitz, 2009).",
        "In terms of facilitation, Benne et al. (Benne and Sheats, 1948) and Bales (Bales, 1950) pioneered investigations into small group dynamics, including functional facilitation roles.",
        "Kumar et al. designed a dialogue action selection model based on Bales's Socio-Emotional Interaction Categories for text-based character agents (Kumar et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper, we propose a framework of procedural facilitation process to increase the total engagement of a group, with caring about side-effects of be-haviors at the same time.",
        "The situations and procedures are modeled and optimized as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is suitable for real-world sequential decision processes, including dialogue systems (Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "We begin by reviewing facilitation of small groups, and summarize requirement specifications for facilitation robots in the next section.",
        "In Section 3, we first describe representations of small group situations and procedures for maintaining small groups, then we discuss how to model them as POMDP.",
        "In Section 4, we give an overview of the architecture of our proposed system.",
        "We then discuss two experiments conducted to verify the efficacy of the small group maintenance procedures.",
