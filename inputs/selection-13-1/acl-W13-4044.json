        "and ?Can you take me there??",
        "should not be understood separately as a statement and a question but together as a command to move towards the door for enabling the user to open it?",
        "Each utterance is an action that affects the interactive situation.",
        "Not only does it construe events, but it also constitutes exchanges between interac-tants such as stating the speaker's need of performing an action and asking about the listener's capability of providing a service.",

        "An alternative approach is Plan Recognition, which consists of using a planner having linguistic meaning and a domain model as inputs.",
        "We depart from this tradition by proposing a contractual approach in which semantic and pragmatic aspects of understanding are symbolically explored in separate steps of inference.",
        "The main rationale for not pursuing the detection of dialogue acts as patterns in the uttered text is that the intended effect of an utterance is not to be found in the wording (Marcu, 1997); and the rationale for not taking construed events directly as plan steps is that the functional roles of inter-actants in cooperative work are decisive for interpreting attitudes.",
        "In this paper, we present an automatic semantic analysis of the interpersonal features of linguistic units and propose a compatible three-step procedure consisting of transformation, contextualization and inference to enable an intelligent wheelchair to understand implied dialogue acts.",
        "In the following two sections, we describe prior approaches to understanding interpersonal meaning and discuss their relevance for our approach.",
        "Then we introduce a classification of interpersonal linguistic features and explain how we re-express these implicit features of language explicitly in a standardised format.",
        "Finally, we describe the procedure used by the pragmatic module of our wheelchair in order to contextualise utterance meaning and infer implied dialogue acts."

        "and ?will you...?",

        "In addition, our approach enables adjustment for new wheelchair functionality without rewriting the whole text analysis component and allows for an easy addition of new tacit contracts with corresponding scripts.",
        "The approach presented in this paper provides a principled way for inferring dialogue acts that uses the structural information present in the clause and therefore enables high accuracy and reusability both on the semantic and on the pragmatic level.",
