        "Allowing input during system speech, known as barge-in, is one approach that designers use to improve system performance.",
        "In the ideal use case, the system detects user speech, switches off the prompt, and then responds to the user's utterance.",
        "Dialogue efficiency improves, as the system receives information prior to completing its prompt, and the interaction becomes more natural, as the system demonstrates more human-like turn-taking behavior.",
        "However, barge-in poses a number of new challenges; the system must now recognize and process input during its prompt that may not be well-formed system directed speech.",
        "This is a difficult task and standard barge-in approaches often stop the prompt for input that will not be understood, subsequently initiating a clarification sub-dialogue (?I'm sorry, I didn't get that.",
        "You can say...etc.?).",
        "This non-understood barge-in (NUBI) could be from environmental noise, non-system directed speech, poorly-formed system directed speech, legitimate speech recognition difficulties (such as acoustic model mismatch), or any combination thereof.",
        "This paper proposes and evaluates a barge-in processing method that focuses on handling NU-BIs.",
        "Our Prediction-based Barge-in Response (PBR) model continuously predicts interpretation success by applying adaptive thresholds to incremental recognition results.",
        "In our view, predicting whether the recognition will be understood has far more utility than detecting whether the barge-in is truly system directed speech as, for many domains, we feel only understandable input has more discourse importance than system speech.",
        "If the input is predicted to be understood, the prompt is paused.",
        "If it is predicted or found to be NUBI, the prompt is resumed.",
        "Using this method, the system may resume speaking before recognition is complete and will never initiate a clarifying sub-dialogue in response to a NUBI.",

        "Both approaches can lead to detection errors: background speech will trigger the VAD, and partial hypotheses are unreliable (Baumann et al., 2009).",

        "The cumulative percentages of the time from speech detection to final recognition are shown in Figure 5.",
        "We find that the State 2?State 3 recognitions are far faster Figure 6: UBI % by minimum recognition time than the Baseline recognitions, which in turn are far faster than the State 2?State 1 recognitions.",
        "The difference between PBR and Baseline recognitions implies that T2 has greater activation during longer recognitions.",
        "Given this, the overall barge-in response time for PBR should be faster than the Baseline (as the PBR system is resuming where the Baseline is silent).",
        "Indeed this is the case: the PBR system's overall mean/median response time is 1.58/1.53 seconds whereas Baseline has a mean/median response time of 2.61/1.8 seconds.",
        "The goal of T2 is for the system to resume when recognition is proceeding poorly, and we have shown that it is primarily being activated during longer recognitions.",
        "If T2 is functioning properly, recognition length should be inversely related to recognition performance, and longer recognitions should be less likely to be understood.",
        "Furthermore, if T2 resumption improves the user's experience then longer PBR recognitions should perform better than Baseline recognitions of comparable length.",
        "Figure 6 presents the UBI percentage by the minimum time for recognitions that reach State 2.",
        "We find that, when all recognitions are accounted for (0 second minimum), the Baseline has a higher rate of UBI.",
        "However, as recognition time increases the Baseline UBI percentage decreases (suggesting successful T2 functioning) whereas the PBR UBI percentage actually increases.",
        "Since longer PBR recognitions are dominated by T2 resumptions, we speculate this improvement is driven by users repeating or initiating new speech that leads to understanding success, as the PBR system is responding where the Baseline system is silent."

        "The above results offer strong evidence that the PBR model increases task success and efficiency, and we found that all three states contribute to the improved performance by creating a more robust, responsive, and natural interaction.",
        "T1 prediction in State 1 reduced the number of spurious prompt suspensions, T2 prediction in State 2 led to improved understanding performance, and prompt resumption (States 2 and 3) reduced the number of abandoned calls.",
        "An important feature of the Prediction-based Barge-in Response model is that, while it lever-ages incremental speech processing for barge-in processing, it does not require an incremental dialogue manager to drive its behavior.",
        "Since the model is also domain independent and does not require access to internal dialogue manager components, it can easily be incorporated into any existing dialogue system.",
        "However, one limitation of the current model is that the prediction thresholds are hand-crafted.",
        "We also believe that substantial improvements can be made by explicitly attempting to predict eventual understanding instead of using the stability score and partial production rate as a proxy.",
        "Furthermore, the PBR model does not distinguish between the causes of the non-understanding, specifically whether the input contained in-domain user speech, out-of-domain user speech, or background noise.",
        "This case is specifically applicable in domains where system and user speech are in the same channel, such as interacting via speaker phone.",
        "In this context, the system should be able to initiate a clarifying sub-dialogue and release the turn, as the system must be more sensitive to the shared acoustic environment and so its current prompt may be less important than the user's non-understood utterance.",
        "The results challenge a potential assumption regarding barge-in: that barge-in indicates greater user pro-activity and engagement with the task.",
        "One of the striking findings was that dialogues with barge-in are slower and less successful than dialogues without barge-in.",
        "This suggests that, for current systems, dialogues with barge-in are more indicative of environmental difficulty than user pro-activity.",
        "The superior performance of the PBR model, which is explicitly resistant to non-system directed speech, implies that dominant barge-in models will have increasingly limited utility as spoken dialogue systems become more prevalent and are used in increasingly difficult environments.",
        "Furthermore, within the context of overall dialogue systems, the PBR model's performance emphasizes the importance of continuous processing for future systems.",
        "This paper has proposed and evaluated the Prediction-based Barge-in Response model.",
        "This model's behavior is driven by continuously predicting whether a barge-in recognition will be understood successfully, and combines incremental speech processing techniques with a prompt resumption procedure.",
        "Using a live dialogue task with real users, we evaluated this model against the standard barge-in model and found that it led to improved performance in both task success and efficiency."
