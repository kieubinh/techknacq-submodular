        "Developing a data-driven statistical parser relies on the availability of a parsed corpus for the language in question.",
        "In the case of Irish, the only parsed corpus available to date is a dependency treebank, which is currently under development and still relatively small, with only 803 gold-annotated trees (Lynn et al., 2012a).",
        "As treebank development is a labour-and time-intensive process, in this study we evaluate various approaches to bootstrapping a statistical parser with a set of unlabelled sentences to ascertain how accurate parsing output can be at this time.",
        "We carry out a number of different semi-supervised bootstrapping experiments using self-training, co-training and sample-selection-based co-training.",
        "Our studies differ from previous similar experiments as our data is taken from a work-in-progress treebank.",
        "Thus, aside from the current small treebank which is used for training the initial seed model and for testing, there is no additional gold-labelled data available to us to directly compare supervised and semi-supervised approaches using training sets of comparable sizes.",
        "In the last decade, data-driven dependency parsing has come to fore, with two main approaches dominating ?",
        "transition-based and graph-based.",
        "In classic transition-based dependency parsing, the training phase consists of learning the correct parser action to take given the input string and the parse history, and the parsing phase consists of the greedy application of parser actions as dictated by the learned model.",
        "In contrast, graph-based dependency parsing involves the non-deterministic construction of a parse tree by predicting the maximum-spanning-tree in the digraph for the input sentence.",
        "In our study, we employ Malt (Nivre et al., 2006), a transition-based dependency parsing system, and Mate (Bohnet, 2010), a graph-based parser.",
        "In line with similar experiments carried out on English (Steedman et al., 2003), we find that co-training is more effective than self-training.",
        "Co-training Malt on the output of Mate proves to be the most effective method for improving Malt's performance on the limited data available for Irish.",
        "Yet, the improvement is relatively small (0.6% over the baseline for LAS, 0.3% for UAS) for the best co-trained model.",
        "The best Mate results are achieved through a non-iterative agreement-based co-training approach, in which Mate is trained on trees produced by Malt which exhibit a minimum agreement of 85% with Mate (LAS increase of 1.2% and UAS of 1.4%).",
        "The semi-supervised parsing experiments do not explicitly take into account the morphosyntactic properties of the Irish language.",
        "In order to examine the effect of this type of information during parsing, we carry out some orthogonal experiments where we",
        "reduce word forms to lemmas and introduce morphological features in certain cases.",
        "These changes do not bring about an increase in parsing accuracy.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 is an overview of Irish morphology.",
        "In Section 3 our previous work carried out on the development of an Irish dependency treebank is discussed followed in Section 4 by a description of some of our prior parsing results.",
        "Section 5 describes the self-training, co-training and sample-selection-based co-training experiments, Section 6 presents the preliminary parsing experiments involving morphological features, and, finally, Section 7 discusses our future work.",
        "2 Irish as a morphologically rich language Irish is a Celtic language of the Indo-European language family.",
        "It has a VSO word order and is rich in morphology.",
        "The following provides an overview of the type of morphology present in the Irish language.",
        "It is not a comprehensive summary as the rules governing morphological changes are too extensive and at times too complex to document here.",
        "Inflection in Irish mainly occurs through suffixation, but initial mutation through lenition and eclipsis is also common (Christian-Brothers, 1988).",
        "A prominent feature of Irish (also of Scottish and Manx), which influences inflection, is the existence of two sets of consonants, referred to as ?broad?",
        "and ?slender?",
        "consonants (O?",
        "Siadhail, 1989).",
        "Consonants can be slenderised by accompanying the consonant with a slender vowel, either e or i.",
        "Broadening occurs through the use of broad vowels; a, o or u.",
        "For example, buail ?to hit?",
        "becomes ag bualadh ?hitting?",
        "in the verbal noun form.",
        "In general, there needs to be vowel harmony (slender or broad) between stem endings and the initial vowel in a suffix.",
        "A process known as syncopation also occurs when words with more than one syllable have a vowel-initial suffix added.",
        "For example imir ?to play?",
        "inflects as imr?",
        "?m ?I play?.",
        "Nouns While Old Irish employed several grammatical cases, Modern Irish uses only three: Nominative, Genitive and Vocative.",
        "The nominative form is sometimes regarded as the ?common form?",
        "as it is now also used to account for accusative and dative forms.",
        "Nouns in Irish are divided into five classes, or declensions, depending on the manner in which the genitive case is formed.",
        "In addition, there are two grammatical genders in Irish - masculine and feminine.",
        "Case, declension and gender are expressed through noun inflection.",
        "For example, pa?ipe?ar ?paper?",
        "is a masculine noun in the first declension.",
        "Both lenition and slenderisation are used to form the genitive singular form: pha?ipe?ir.",
        "In addition, possessive adjectives cause noun inflection through lenition, eclipsis and prefixation.",
        "For example, teach ?house?, mo theach ?my house?, a?r dteach ?our house?",
        "; ainm ?name?, a hainm ?her name?.",
        "Verbs Verbs can incorporate their subject, inflecting for person and number through suffixation.",
        "Such forms are referred to as synthetic verb forms.",
        "In addition, verb tense is often indicated through various combinations of initial mutation, syncopation and suffixation.",
        "For example, scr?",
        "?obh ?write?",
        "can inflect as scr?",
        "?obhaim ?I write?.",
        "The past tense of the verb tug ?give?",
        "is thug ?gave?.",
        "Lenition occurs after the negative particle n??.",
        "For example, tugaim ?I give?",
        "; n??",
        "thugaim ?I do not give?",
        "; n?",
        "?or thug me?",
        "?I did not give?.",
        "Eclipsis occurs following clitics such as interrogative particles (an, nach); complementis-ers (go, nach); and relativisers (a, nach) (Stenson, 1981).",
        "For example, an dtugann se??",
        "?does he give??",
        "; nach dtugann se??",
        "?does he not give??.",
        "Adjectives In general, adjectives follow nouns and agree in number, gender and case.",
        "Depending on the noun they modify, adjectives can also inflect.",
        "Christian-Brothers (1988) note eight declensions of adjectives.",
        "They can decline for genitive singular masculine, genitive singular feminine and nominative plural.",
        "For example, bacach ?lame?",
        "inflects as bacaigh (Gen.Sg.Masc), baca??",
        "(Gen.Fem.Sg) and bacacha (Nom.PL).",
        "Comparative adjectives are also formed through inflection.",
        "For example, la?idir ?strong?, n?",
        "?os la?idre ?stronger?",
        "; de?anach ?late?, is de?ana??",
        "?latest?.",
        "Prepositions Irish has simple and compound prepositions.",
        "Most of the simple prepositions can inflect for person and number (known as prepositional pronouns or pronominal prepositions), thus including a nominal element.",
        "For example, compare bh??",
        "se?",
        "ag labhairt le fear ?he was speaking with a man?",
        "with bh??",
        "se?",
        "ag labhairt leis ?he was speaking with him?.",
        "These forms are used quite fre",
        "quently, not only with regular prepositional attachment where pronominal prepositions operate as arguments of verbs or modifiers of nouns and verbs, but also in idiomatic use where they express emotions and states, e.g. ta?",
        "bro?n orm (lit.",
        "?be-worry-on me?)",
        "?I am worried?",
        "or ta?",
        "su?il agam (lit.",
        "?be-expectation-with me?)",
        "?I hope?.",
        "Noted by Greene (1966) as a noun-centered language, nouns are often used to convey the meaning that verbs often would.",
        "Pronominal prepositions are often used in these types of structures.",
        "For example, bhain me?",
        "geit aisti (lit.",
        "extracted-I-shock-from her) ?I frightened her?",
        "; bhain me?",
        "mo cho?ta d?",

        "triail astu (lit.",
        "extracted-I-attempt-from them)?I tried them?.",
        "Derivational morphology There are also some instances of derivational morphology in Irish.",
        "U??",
        "Dhonnchadha (2009) notes that all verb stems and agentive nouns can inflect to become verbal nouns.",
        "Verbal adjectives are also derived from verb stems through suffixation.",
        "For example, the verb du?n ?close?",
        "undergoes suffixation to become du?nadh ?closing?",
        "(verbal noun) and du?nta ?closed?",
        "(verbal adjective).",
        "An emphatic suffix -sa/-se (both broad and slender form) can attach to nouns or pronouns.",
        "It can also be attached to any verb that has been inflected for person and number and also to pronominal prepositions.",
        "For example mo thuairim ?my opinion?",
        "?mo thuairimse ?my opinion; tu?",
