        "In this paper, we present our contribution to the 2013 Shared Task on Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs).",
        "MRLs pose a number of interesting challenges to today's standard parsing algorithms, for example a free word order and, due to their rich morphology, greater lexical variation that aggravates out-of-vocabulary problems considerably (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).",
        "Given the wide range of languages encompassed by the term MRL, there is, as of yet, no clear consensus on what approaches and features are generally important for parsing MRLs.",
        "However, developing tailored solutions for each language is time-consuming and requires a good understanding of the language in question.",
        "In our contribution to the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013), we therefore chose an approach that we could apply to all languages in the Shared Task, but that would also allow us to fine-tune it for individual languages by varying certain components.",
        "?Authors in alphabetical order.",
        "For the dependency track, we combined the n-best output of multiple parsers and subsequently ranked them to obtain the best parse.",
        "While this approach has been studied for constituency parsing (Zhang et al., 2009; Johnson and Ural, 2010; Wang and Zong, 2011), it is, to our knowledge, the first time this has been applied successfully within dependency parsing.",
        "We experimented with different kinds of features in the ranker and developed feature models for each language.",
        "Our system ranked first out of seven systems for all languages except French.",
        "For the constituency track, we experimented with an alternative way of handling unknown words and applied a products of Context Free Grammars with Latent Annotations (PCFG-LA) (Petrov et al., 2006), whose output was reranked to select the best analysis.",
        "The additional reranking step improved results for all languages.",
        "Our system beats various baselines provided by the organizers for all languages.",
        "Unfortunately, no one else participated in this track.",
        "For both settings, we made an effort to automatically annotate our data with the best possible preprocessing (POS, morphological information).",
        "We used a multi-layered CRF (Mu?ller et al., 2013) to annotate each data set, stacking with the information provided by the organizers when this was beneficial.",
        "The high quality of our preprocessing considerably improved the performance of our systems.",
        "The Shared Task involved a variety of settings as to whether gold or predicted part-of-speech tags and morphological information were available, as well as whether the full training set or a smaller (5k sen",
        "tences) training set was used for training.",
        "Throughout this paper we focus on the settings with predicted preprocessing information with gold segmentation and the full1 training sets.",

        "For all other settings, we refer the reader to the Shared Task overview paper (Seddah et al., 2013).",

        "We first spent some time on preparing the data sets, in particular we automatically annotated the data with high-quality POS and morphological information.",
        "We consider this kind of preprocessing to be an essential part of a parsing system, since the quality of the automatic preprocessing strongly affects the performance of the parsers.",
        "Because our tools work on CoNLL09 format, we first converted the training data from the CoNLL06 format to CoNLL09.",
        "We thus had to decide whether to use coarse or fine part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "In a preliminary experiment we found that fine tags are the better option for all languages but Basque and Korean.",
        "For Korean the reason seems to be that the fine tag set is huge (> 900) and that the same information is also provided in the feature column.",
        "We predict POS tags and morphological features jointly using the Conditional Random Field (CRF) tagger MarMoT2 (Mu?ller et al., 2013).",
        "MarMoT incrementally creates forward-backward lattices of increasing order to prune the sizable space of possible morphological analyses.",
        "We use MarMoT with the default parameters.",
        "1Although, for Hebrew and Swedish only 5k sentences were available for training, and the two settings thus coincide.",
        "Since morphological dictionaries can improve automatic POS tagging considerably, we also created such dictionaries for each language.",
        "For this, we an-alyzed the word forms provided in the data sets with language-specific morphological analyzers except for Hebrew and German where we just extracted the morphological information from the lattice files provided by the organizers.",
        "For the other languages we used the following tools: Arabic: AraMorph a reimplementation of Buckwalter (2002), Basque: Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011), French: an IMS internal tool,3 Hungarian: Magyarlanc (Zsibrita et al., 2013), Korean: HanNanum (Park et al., 2010), Polish: Morfeusz (Wolin?ski, 2006), and Swedish: Granska (Domeij et al., 2000).",
        "The created dictionaries were shared with the other Shared Task participants.",
        "We used these dictionaries as additional features for MarMoT.",
        "For some languages we also integrated the predicted tags provided by the organizers into the feature model.",
        "These stacked models gave improvements for Swedish, Polish and Basque (cf. Table 1 for accuracies).",

        "In the 5k setting, we additionally added all sentences not present in the parser training data to the training data sets of the tagger.",

        "We thus replace rare words (frequency < 20) by the predicted morphological tags of Section 2 (or the true morphological tag for the gold setup).",

        "Since many of these labels are extremely rare and thus hard to learn for the parsers, we reduced the set of edge labels during the conversion.",
        "Specifically, we retained the 50 most frequent labels, while reducing the composite labels to their base label.",
        "For producing the initial n-best lists, we use the mate parser6 (Bohnet, 2010) and a variant of the EasyFirst parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010), which we here call best-first parser.",

        "The non-projective approximation algorithm is a greedy hill climbing algorithm that starts from the optimal projective parse and iteratively tries to reattach all tokens, one at a time, everywhere in the sentence as long as the tree property holds.",
        "It halts when the increase in the score of the tree according to the parsing model is below a certain threshold.",
        "n-best lists are obtained by applying the non-projective approximation algorithm in a non-greedy manner, exploring multiple possibilities.",
        "All trees are collected in a list, and when no new trees are found, or newer trees have a significantly lower score than the currently best one, search halts.",
        "The n best trees are then retrieved from the list.",
        "It should be noted that, in the standard case, the non-projective approximation algorithm may find a local optimum, and that there may be other trees that have a higher score which were not explored.",
        "Thus the best parse in the greedy case may not necessarily be the one with the highest score in the n-best list.",
        "Since the parser is trained with the greedy version of the non-projective approximation algorithm, the greedily chosen output parse tree is of special interest.",
        "We thus flag this tree as the baseline mate parse, in order to use that for features in the ranker.",
        "The baseline mate parse is also our overall baseline in the dependency track.",
        "The best-first parser deviates from the EasyFirst parser in several small respects: The EasyFirst decoder creates dependency links between the roots of adjacent substructures, which gives an O(n log n) complexity, but restricts the output to projective trees.",
        "The best-first parser is allowed to choose as head any node of an adjacent substructure instead of only the root, which increases complexity to O(n2), but accounts for a big part of possible non-projective structures.",
        "We additionally implemented a swap-operation (Nivre, 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2011) to account for the more complex structures.",
        "The best-first parser relies on a beam-search strategy7 to pur7Due to the nature of the decoder, the parser can produce sue multiple derivations, which we also use to produce the n-best output.",

        "We have presented our contribution to the 2013 SPMRL Shared Task.",
        "We participated in both the constituency and dependency tracks.",
        "In both tracks we make use of a state-of-the-art tagger for POS and morphological features.",
        "In the constituency track, we use the tagger to handle unknown words and employ a product-of-grammars-based PCFG-LA parser and parse tree reranking.",
        "In the dependency track, we combine multiple parsers output as input for a ranker.",
        "Since there were no other participants in the constituency track, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our results.",
        "We do however show that the application of product grammars, our handling of rare words, and a subsequent reranking step outperforms a baseline PCFG-LA parser.",
        "In the dependency track we obtain the best results for all languages except French among 7 participants.",
        "Our reranking approach clearly outperforms a baseline graph-based parser.",
        "This is the first time multiple parsers have been used in a dependency reranking setup.",
        "Aside from minor decisions made on the basis of each language, our approach is language agnostic and does not target morphology in any particular way as part of the parsing process.",
        "We show that with a strong baseline and with no language specific treatment it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art results across all languages.",
        "Our architecture for the dependency parsing track enables the use of language-specific features in the ranker, although we only had minor success with features that target morphology.",
        "However, it may be the case that approaches from previous work on parsing MRLs, or the approaches taken by other teams in the Shared Task, can be successfully combined with ours and improve parsing accuracy even more."
