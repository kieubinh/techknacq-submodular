        "According to Yang (2006), distance metric learning learns a distance metric from data sets that consists of pairs of points of the same or different classes while at the same time preserving the adjacency relations among the data points.",
        "Usually, it is easier to let the user label whether a set of data is in the same class than directly assign a distance between each pair or classify whether a pair of data points is a match or not.",
        "Learning a good distance metric in the feature space is essential in many real-world NLP and IR applications.",
        "For example, Web news article clustering applying hierarchical clustering or k-means requires that the distance between the two feature vectors extracted from the news articles faithfully reflect the semantic similarity between them for these algorithms to perform well.",
        "Studies on distance metric learning over the past few years show that the learned metric can outperform Euclidean distance metric.",
        "The constraints of training examples in learning usually comes from the global or local adjacency information.",
        "Data points with the same class labels are supposed to be connected while those with different classes labels disconnected.",
        "Supervised algorithms aim to learn the distance metric to make the adjacency relationships in the training examples preserved.",
        "One of the most common approaches to distance metric learning is to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric.",
        "Example algorithms to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric include (Xing et al., 2002; Gold-berger et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2011).",
        "A common limitation shared by these algorithms is that they fail to scale up to high dimensional data sets.",
        "When those algorithms run on high dimensional data sets, they usually run out of memory.",
        "However, many NLP applications depend on tens of thousands of features to perform well.",
        "Dimensionality reduction and approximation have been suggested, but they usually degrade performance.",
        "Other issues occur when the data sets consists of a large number of disjoint classes.",
        "In this case, the learned distance metric must map the data points to a space where the data points cluster unevenly into a large",
        "number of small groups, which makes the learning problem harder and may require special treatments.",
        "In this paper, we present a new scalable approach to distance metric learning that addresses the scalability issues mentioned above.",
        "To deal with high dimensionality, one approach is to factorize the metric matrix in the Mahalanobis distance metric into low-rank matrix.",
        "This reduces the number of parameters that must be learned during the learning phase.",
        "However, the learning problem becomes non-convex.",
        "Different initializations may result in drastically different performance due to local optima.",
        "We solve this problem by introducing random projection, which projects data points to a low dimensional space before learning a low dimensional full-rank metric matrix.",
        "We show that this strategy not only is more robust than the low-rank approximation, but also outperforms the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a common approach to dimensionality reduction.",
        "Another contribution that our approach offers is new regularization terms in the objective function of learning.",
        "The new terms specify that one should learn to minimize the distance for data points in the same classes and maximize those in different ones.",
        "We found that minimization but not maximization would lead to the best performance, so we kept only the minimization term.",
        "We evaluated our new approach with data sets from two problem domains.",
        "One domain is about learning semantic similarity between Web pages.",
        "This domain was studied in (Shaw et al., 2011) and involves moderately high dimensional data sets of bag-of-words.",
        "The other is about matching semantically related phenotype variables across different genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Hsu et al., 2011).",
        "This problem domain requires extremely high dimensional data for a learner to perform well.",
        "Our experimental results show that our new algorithm consistently outperform the previous ones in both the domains."

        "We have proposed a convex, input-size free optimization algorithm for distance metric learning.",
        "This algorithm combines random projection and intraclass regularization that addresses the weaknesses presenting in the previous works.",
        "When the dimension d is in tens of thousands, as in many NLP and IR applications, M will be hundreds of millions in size, too large and intractable to handle for any existing approaches.",
        "Our approach addresses these issues, making the learning not only scalable, but also more accurate.",
        "In the future, we will investigate theoretical properties that explain why the synergy of random projection and intraclass regularization works well and robust.",
        "We would also like to investigate how to use unlabeled data to regulate the learning to accomplish semi-supervised learning."
