        "One difficulty with this approach is that it often results in some skills, which can be identified as hubs of the Wikipedia graph, constantly being retrieved, regardless of what the input is.",
        "In order to avoid this pitfall, we bias the activation to avoid spreading to general, or popular nodes.",
