        "Language model (LM) adaptation attempts to adjust the parameters of a LM so that it performs well on a particular (sub-)domain of data.",
        "Currently, most LMs are based on the Markov assumption that the prediction of a word depends only on the preceding n–1 words, but such n-gram statistics are known to be extremely susceptible to the characteristics of training samples.",
        "This is true even when the data sources are supposedly similar: for example, Rosenfeld (1996) showed that perplexity doubled when a LM trained on the Wall Street Journal (1987-1989) was tested on the AP newswire stories",
        "of the same period.",
        "This observation, coupled with the fact that training data is available in large quantities only in selected domains, facilitates the need for LM adaptation.",
        "There have been two formulations of the LM adaptation problem.",
        "One is the within-domain adaptation, in which adapted LMs are created for different topics in a single domain (e.g., Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1997; Clarkson and Robinson, 1997; Chen et al., 1998).",
        "In these studies, a domain is defined as a body of text originating from a single source, and the main goal of LM adaptation is to fine-tune the model parameters so as to improve the LM performance on a specific sub-domain (or topic) using the training data at hand.",
        "The other formulation, which is the focus of the current study, is to adapt a LM to a novel domain, for which only a very small amount of training data is available.",
        "This is referred to as cross-domain adaptation.",
        "Following Bellegarda (2001), we call the domain used to train the original model the background domain, and the novel domain with a small amount of training data as the adaptation domain.",
        "Two major approaches to cross-domain adaptation have been investigated: maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and discriminative training methods.",
        "In MAP estimation methods, adaptation data is used to adjust the parameters of the background model so as to maximize the likelihood of the adaptation data.",
        "Count merging and linear interpolation of models are the two MAP estimation methods investigated in speech recognition experiments (Iyer et al., 1997; Bacchiani and Roark, 2003), with count merging reported to slightly outperform linear interpolation.",
        "Discriminative approaches to LM adaptation, on the other hand, aim at using the adaptation data to directly minimize the errors on the adaptation data made by the background model.",
        "These techniques have been applied successfully to the task of language modeling in non-adaptation (Roark et al.,",
        "2004) as well as adaptation (Bacchiani et al., 2004) scenarios.",
        "In this paper, we present comparative experimental results on four language model adaptation techniques and evaluate them from various angles, attempting to elucidate the characteristics of these models.",
        "The four models we compare are a maximum a posteriori (MAP) method and three discriminative training methods, namely the boosting algorithm (Collins, 2000), the average perceptron (Collins, 2002) and the minimum sample risk method (Gao et al., 2005).",
        "Our evaluation of these techniques is unique in that we go beyond simply comparing them in terms of character error rate (CER): we use a metric of distributional similarity to measure the distance between background and adaptation domains, and attempt to correlate it with the CER of each adaptation method.",
        "We also propose a novel metric for measuring the side effects of adapted models using the notion of backward compatibility, which is very important from a software deployment perspective.",
        "Our experiments are conducted in the setting of Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion, as we believe this task is excellently suited for evaluating LMs.",

        "In this paper, we call the task IME (Input Method Editor), based on the name of the commonly used Windows-based application.",
        "The performance of IME is typically measured by the character error rate (CER), which is the number of characters wrongly converted from the phonetic string divided by the number of characters in the correct transcript.",
        "Current IME systems exhibit about 5-15% CER on real-world data in a wide variety of domains.",
        "In many ways, IME is a similar task to speech recognition.",
        "The most obvious similarity is that IME can also be viewed as a Bayesian decision problem: let A be the input phonetic string (which corresponds to the acoustic signal in speech); the task of IME is to choose the most likely word string W* among those candidates that could have been converted from A:",
        "where GEN(A) denotes the candidate set given A.",
        "Unlike speech recognition, however, there is no acoustic ambiguity in IME, because the phonetic string is provided directly by users.",
        "Moreover, we can assume a unique mapping from W to A in IME, i.e., P(A|W) = 1.",
        "So the decision of Equation (1) depends solely on P(W), which makes IME ideal for testing language modeling techniques.",
        "Another advantage of using IME for language modeling research is that it is relatively easy to convert W to A, which facilitates the creation of training data for discriminative learning, as described later.",
        "From the perspective of LM adaptation, IME faces the same problem speech recognition faces: the quality of the model depends heavily on the similarity of the training and test data.",
        "This poses a serious challenge to IME, as it is currently the most widely used method of inputting Chinese or Japanese characters, used by millions of users for inputting text of any domain.",
        "LM adaptation in IME is therefore an imminent requirement for improving user experience, not only as we build static domain-specific LMs, but also in making online user adaptation possible in the future."

        "We have presented a comparison of three discriminative learning approaches with a MAP estimation method in the task of LM adaptation for IME.",
        "We have shown that all discriminative models are significantly better than the linear interpolation method, in that they achieve larger CER reduction with fewer side effects across different domains.",
        "One direction of future research is to apply this technique to an incremental learning scenario, i.e., to incrementally build models using incoming data for adaptation, taking all previously available data as background corpus.",
        "The new metric for backward compatibility we proposed in the paper will play a particularly important role in such a scenario."
