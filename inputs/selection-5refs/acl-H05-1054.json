        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the key techniques in the fields of Information Extraction, Question Answering, Parsing, Metadata Tagging in Semantic Web, etc.",
        "In MET-2 held in conjunction with the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7), the task of NER is defined as recognizing seven subcategories entities: person (PN), location (LN), organization (ON), time, date, currency and percentage.",
        "As for Chinese NEs, we further divide PN into five sub-classes, that is, Chinese PN (CPN), Japanese PN (JPN), Russian PN (RPN), Euramerican PN (EPN) and abbreviated PN (APN) like \"吴/Mr.",
        "Wu\".",
        "Similarly, LN is split into common LN (LN) like \" 中 关村 /Zhongguancun\" and abbreviated LN (ALN) such as \"京/Beijing\", \"沪/Shanghai\".",
        "The recognition of time (TM) and numbers (NM) is comparatively simpler and can be implemented via finite state automata.",
        "Therefore, our research focuses on the recognition of CPN, JPN, RPN, EPN, APN, LN, ALN and ON.",
        "Compared to English NER, Chinese NER is more difficult.",
        "We think that the main differences between Chinese NER and English NER lie in: (1) Unlike English, Chinese lacks the capitalization information which can play very important roles in identifying named entities.",
        "(2) There is no space between words in Chinese, so we have to segment the text before NER.",
        "Consequently, the errors in word segmentation will affect the result of NER.",
        "In this paper, we proposes a hybrid Chinese NER model based on multiple features which emphasizes on (1) combining fine particle features (Word Model) with coarse particle features (POS Model); (2) integrating human knowledge into statistical model; (3) and using diverse sub-models for different kinds of entities.",
        "Especially, we divide transliterated person name into three subclasses according to their characters set, that is, JPN, RPN and EPN.",
        "In order to deduce the complexity of the model and the searching space, we divide the rec",
        "ognition process into two steps: (1) word segmentation and POS tagging; (2) named entity recognition based on the first step.",
        "Trained on the NEs labeled corpus of five-month People's Daily corpus and tested on one-month People's Daily corpus, the Hybrid Model achieves the following performance.",
        "The precision and the recall of PN (including CPN, JPN, RPN, EPN, AP N), LN (including ALN) and ON are respectively (94.06%, 95.21%), (93.98%, 93.48%), and (84.69%, 86.86%).",
        "From the experimental results on People's Daily testing data, we can conclude that our Hybrid Model is better than other models which only use one kind of features.",

        "1998] in MUC7 achieved 95% precision and 92% recall.",
        "However, Chinese NER is far from mature.",
        "For example, the performance (precision, recall) of the best Chinese NER system in MET-2 is (66%, 92%), (89%, 91%), (89%, 88%) for PN, LN and ON respectively.",

        "1998][Sun, et al.",
        "1994][Zheng, et al.",

        "Most of these integrated models can be viewed as a HMM model.",
        "The differences among them are the definition of state and the features used in entity model and context model.",
        "In fact, a NER model recognizes named entities through mining the intrinsic features in the entities and the contextual features around the entities.",
        "Most of existing approaches employ either coarse particle features, like POS and ROLE[Zhang, et al.",
        "2003], or fine particle features like word.",
        "The data sparseness problem is serious if only using fine particle features, and coarse particle features will lose much important information though without serious data sparseness problem.",
        "Our idea is that coarse particle features should be integrated into fine particle features to overcome the disadvantages of them.",
        "However, most systems do not combine them and especially ignore the impact of POS.",
        "Inspired by the algorithms of identifying BaseNP and Chunk[Xun, et al.",
        "2000], we propose a hybrid NER model which emphasizes on combining coarse particle features (POS Model) with fine particle features (Word Model).",
        "Though the Hybrid Model can overcome the disadvantages of the Word Model and the POS Model, there are still some problems in such a framework.",
        "Data sparseness still exists and very large searching space in decoding will influence efficiency.",
        "Our idea is that heuristic human knowledge can not only improve the time efficiency, but also solve the data sparseness problem to some extent by restricting the generation of entity candidates.",
        "So we intend to incorporate human knowledge into the statistical model to improve efficiency and effectivity of the Hybrid Model.",
        "Similarly, for capturing intrinsic features in different types of entities, we design several sub-models for each kind of entities.",
