        "The task of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), i.e. the process of detecting basic event structures such as who did what to whom, when and where, has received considerable interest in the past few years (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2005a; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).",
        "It was shown that the identification of such event frames has a significant contribution for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as Information Extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003) and Question Answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004).",
        "Most current SRL approaches can be classified in one of two classes: approaches that take advantage of complete syntactic analysis of text, pioneered by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), and approaches that use partial syntactic analysis, championed by previous evaluations performed within the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004).",
        "The wisdom extracted from this volume of work indicates that full syntactic analysis has a significant contribution to the SRL performance, when using hand-corrected syntactic information.",
        "On the other hand, when only automatically-generated syntax is available, the quality of the information provided through full syntax decreases because the state-of-the-art of full parsing is less robust and performs worse than the tools used for partial syntactic analysis.",
        "Under such real-world conditions, the difference between the two SRL approaches (with full or partial syntax) is not that high.",
        "More interestingly, the two SRL strategies perform better for different semantic roles.",
        "For example, models that use full syntax recognize better agent and theme roles, whereas models based on partial syntax are better at recognizing explicit patient roles, which tend to be farther from the predicate and accumulate more parsing errors (M`arquez et al., 2005).",
        "The above observations motivate the work presented in this paper.",
        "We introduce a novel semantic role labeling approach that combines several individual SRL systems.",
        "Intuitively, our approach can be separated in two stages: a candidate generation phase, where the solutions provided by several individual models are combined into a pool of candidate arguments, and an inference phase, where the candidates are filtered using a binary classifier, and possi",
        "ble conflicts with domain knowledge constraints are resolved to obtain the final solution.",
        "For robustness, the inference model uses only global attributes extracted from the solutions provided by the individual systems, e.g., the sequence of role labels generated by each system for the current predicate.",
        "We do not use any attributes specific to the individual models, not even the confidence assigned by the individual classifiers.",
        "Besides simplicity, the consequence of this decision is that our approach does not impose any restrictions on the individual SRL strategies, as long as one solution is provided for each predicate.",
        "On the other hand, probabilistic inference processes, which have been successfully used for SRL (Koomen et al., 2005), mandate that each individual candidate argument be associated with its raw activation, or confidence, in the given model.",
        "However, this information is not directly available in two out of three of our individual models, which classify argument chunks and not entire arguments.",
        "Despite its simplicity, our approach obtains encouraging results: the combined system outperforms any of the individual systems and, using exactly the same data, it is also competitive with the best SRL systems that participated in the latest CoNLL shared task evaluation (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005)."

        "Interestingly, the generalized inference layer allows to include in the objective function, jointly with the candidate argument scores, a number of linguistically-motivated constraints to obtain a coherent solution.",
        "Differing from the strategy presented in this paper, their inference layer does not include learning.",
        "Also, they require confidence values from individual classifiers.",
        "This is the best performing system at CoNLL-2005.",
        "Haghighi et al.",
        "(2005) implemented a double re-ranking model on top of the base SRL models to select the most probable solution among a set of candidates.",
        "The re-ranking is performed, first, on a set of n-best solutions obtained by the base system run on a single parse tree, and, then, on the set of best-candidates coming from the n-best parse trees.",
        "The",
        "re-ranking approach allows to define global complex features applying to complete candidate solutions to train the rankers.",
        "The main drawback, compared to our approach, is that re-ranking does not permit to combine different solutions since it is forced to select a complete candidate solution.",
        "This fact implies that the performance upper limit strongly depends on the ability of the base model to generate the complete correct solution in the set of n-best candidates.",
        "Finally, Pradhan et al.",
        "(2005b) followed a stacking approach by learning two individual systems based on full syntax, whose outputs are used to generate features to feed the training stage of a final chunk-by-chunk SRL system.",
        "Although the fine granularity of the chunking-based system allows to recover from parsing errors, we find this combination scheme quite ad-hoc because it forces to break argument candidates into chunks in the last stage."

        "This paper introduces a novel, robust combination strategy for semantic role labeling.",
        "Our approach is separated in two stages: a candidate generation phase, which combines the solutions generated by several individual models into a pool of candidate arguments, followed by a simple inference model that filters the candidate arguments using a single binary classifier and then enforces an arbitrary number of domain-specific constraints.",
        "The proposed approach has several advantages.",
        "First, because it combines the solutions provided by the individual models, the inference model can recover from errors produced in the generation phase.",
        "Second, due to the diversity of the individual models employed, the candidate pool contains a high percentage of the correct arguments.",
        "And lastly, our approach is flexible and robust: it can incorporate any SRL model in the candidate generation stage because it does not require that the individual SRL models provide any information, e.g. classification confidence values, other than an argument solution.",
        "Our results are better than the state of the art using automatically-generated syntactic information.",
        "These results are encouraging considering the simplicity of the proposed approach."
