        "Conventional parsers try to identify syntactic information completely.",
        "These parsers encounter difficulties when processing unrestricted texts, because of ungrammatical sentences, the unavoidable incompleteness of lexicon and grammar, and other reasons like long sentences.",
        "Partial parsing is an alternative technique developed in response to these problems.",
        "This technique aims to recover syntactic information efficiently and reliably from unrestricted texts by sacrificing completeness and depth of analysis, and relying on local information to resolve ambiguities [1].",
        "Partial parsing techniques can be roughly classified into two groups.",
        "The first group of techniques involves partial parsing via finite state machines [2,3,9,10].",
        "These approaches apply the sequential regular expression recognizer to an input sentence.",
        "When multiple rules match an input string at a given position,",
        "* This research was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation in Korea.",
        "the longest-matching rule is selected.",
        "Therefore, these parsers always produce a single best analysis and operate very fast.",
        "In general, these approaches use a handwritten regular grammar.",
        "As would be expected, manually writing a grammar is both very time consuming and prone to have inconsistencies.",
        "The other group of partial parsing techniques is text chunking, that is, recognition of non-overlapping and non-recursive cores of major phrases (chunks), by using machine learning techniques [4,7,8,13,15,17].",
        "Since Ramshaw and Marcus [15] first proposed formulating the chunking task as a tagging task, most chunking methods have followed this word-tagging approach.",
        "In base noun phrase chunking, for instance, each word is marked with one of three chunk tags: I (for a word inside an NP), O (for outside of an NP), and B (for between the end of one NP and the start of another) as follows1:",
        "In ( early trading ) in ( Hong Kong ) ( Monday ), ( gold ) was quoted at ( $ 366.50 ) ( an ounce ).",
        "Ino early/ trading/ ino Hong/ Kong/ Monday_b ,o gold/ wasO quotedOatO $/ 366.50/- an_e ounce/ .O",
        "With respect to these approaches, there have been several studies on automatically extracting chunking rules from large-scale corpora using transformation-based learning [15], error-driven pruning [7], the ALLiS top-down inductive system [8].",
        "However, it is not yet clear how these approaches could be extended beyond the chunking task.",
        "In this paper, we present a method of automatically extracting partial parsing rules from a tree-annotated corpus using the decision tree method.",
        "Our goal is to extract rules with higher accuracy and broader coverage.",
        "We define the partial parsing rules as those that can establish the structure of a substring in an input sentence deterministically.",
        "This decision can be considered as a classification; as such, for a substring in an input sentence, a proper structure is chosen among the structures occurred in the corpus, as extended from the word-tagging approach of text chunking.",
        "For the classification, we use decision tree induction with features of contextual and lexical information.",
        "In addition, we use negative evidence, as well as positive evidence, to gain higher accuracy.",
        "For general recursive phrases, all possible substrings in a parse tree are taken into account by extracting evidence recursively from a parse tree in a training corpus.",
        "We induce partial parsing rules from the decision tree, and, to retain only those rules that are accurate, verify each rule through cross-validation.",
        "In many cases, several different structures are assigned to the same substring in a tree-annotated corpus.",
        "Substrings for coordination and compound nouns are typical examples of such ambiguous cases in Korean.",
        "These ambiguities can prevent us from extracting partial parsing rules that cover the substrings with more than one substructure and, consequently, can cause the result of partial parsing to be limited to a relatively shallow depth.",
        "In this work, we address this problem by merging substructures with ambiguity using an underspecified representation.",

        "The acquired grammar is similar to a phrase structure grammar, with contextual and lexical information, but it allows building structures of depth one or more.",
        "It is easy to understand; it can be easily modified; and it can be selectively added to or deleted from the grammar.",

        "We consider partial parsing as a classification; as such, for a substring in an input sentence, a proper structure is chosen among the structures occurred in the corpus.",
        "Highly accurate partial parsing rules can be extracted by (1) allowing rules to construct a subtree of depth one or more; (2) using decision tree induction, with features of contextual and lexical information for the classification; and (3) verifying induced rules through cross-validation.",
        "By merging substructures with ambiguity in non-deterministic rules using an underspecified representation, we can handle syntactic ambiguities that are difficult to resolve with local information, such as coordination and noun phrase bracketing ambiguities.",
        "Using a threshold, 9, we can control the number of the partial parsing rules and the ratio of the precision/recall trade-off of the partial parser.",
        "The value of this threshold should be set according to the requirements of the relevant application.",
        "Our experiments showed that the proposed partial parser using the automatically extracted rules is not only accurate and efficient, but also achieves reasonable coverage for Korean."
