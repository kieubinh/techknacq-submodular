        "Our basic idea is to use a hybrid method which combines the statistical method and linguistic rules.",
        "The extraction system used in our work operated at three steps: (1) Tokenization and POS tagging of the corpus; (2) Extraction of multi-word units using statistical measure; (3) Linguistic filtering to make use of syntactic patterns and stop-word list.",
        "As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, it has considerably improved the precision of the extraction which is much higher than that of purely statistical method.",
        "In our test, hybrid method combining \"Log-likelihood ratio\" and \"linguistic rules\" had the best performance in the extraction.",
        "We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in this way, could be used effectively either to supplement existing terminological collections or to be used in addition to traditional reference works."

        "Communication between different individuals and nations is not always easy, especially when more than one language is involved.",
        "This kind of communication can include translation problems, which can be solved by the translators who bridge the gap between two different languages.",
        "Through the past decade, China and Korea have been undergoing large economic, cultural exchange, which invariably affects all aspects of communication, particularly translation.",
        "New international contacts, foreign investments as well as cross-cultural communication have caused an enormous increase in the volume of translations produced and required.",
        "But by now, most of all this translation work has been conducted by translators alone, which bears the burden of an enormous translation task to them.",
        "In order to accomplish these tasks with maximum efficiency and quality, a new translation method supported by computer technology has been suggested.",

        "Computerassisted translation systems are based on \"translation memory\" and \"terminology databases\".",
        "With translation memory tools, translators have immediate access to previous translations of the text, which they can then accept or modify.",
        "Terminology management systems also can prove very useful in supporting translator's work [2, 11].",
        "Most translators use some sort of glossary or terminology database, especially in the translation of the technical documents or academic monograph.",
        "Many translation bureaux have the collection of the terminology data bases.",
        "But time pressure and costs make it difficult to get glossary building task done fully manually.",
        "Thus there is a pressing need for the tool which is computationally supported.",
        "For Chinese, other than for English, terminology management tools are not so sophisticated that they could provide wide enough coverage to be directly usable for the translators.",
        "We are contemplating, in this article, situations where computational support is sought to extract the term candidate, construct or enhance such terminology databases.",
        "Our work will be more focused on the problem of terminologically relevant collocation extraction.",
        "In order to extract multiword terms from the domain corpus, three main strategies have been proposed in the literature.",
        "First, linguistic rule-based systems propose to extract relevant terms by making use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other linguistic structure [2, 4].",
        "This methodology is language dependent rather than language independent, and the system requires highly specialized linguistic techniques to identify the possible candidate terms.",
        "Second, purely statistical systems extract discriminating multiword terms from the text corpora by means of association measures [5, 6, 7].",
        "As they use plain text corpora and only require the information appearing in texts, such systems are highly flexible and extract relevant units independently from the domain and the language of the input text.",
        "Finally, hybrid methodologies define co-occurrences of interest in terms of syntactical patterns and statistical regularities [1, 3, 9].",
        "There is no question that the term extraction work comes into play when the tools are parameterized in such a way as to provide as much relevant material (maximizing recall and precision), and as little \"noise\" as possible.",
        "As seen in the literature, neither purely rule-based approach nor statistic based approach could bring an encouraging result alone[3, 4].",
        "The main problem is the \"noise\".",
        "So we need to find a combined technique for reducing this \"noise\".",
        "In this paper, we have taken a hybrid approach which combines the linguistic rules and statistical method.",
        "First, we applied a linguistic filter which selects candidates from the corpus.",
        "Second, the statistical method was used to extract the word class combinations.",
        "And then, the results of several experiments were evaluated and compared with each other."

        "Statistical methods in computational linguistics generally share the fundamental approach to language viewed as a string of characters, tokens or other units, where patterns are discovered on the basis of their recurrence and co-occurrence.",
        "Accordingly, when we approach the extraction of multi-word terms from a statistical point of view, we initially retrieve the word sequences which are not only frequent in their occurrence but also collocating each other.",
        "Before a statistical methodology could be developed, some characteristics of terms in Chinese had to be established.",
        "In Chinese, the length of terms can vary from single word to multi-words(n-gram), with the majority of entries being less than 4-word items, usually two word items(bi-gram) (See in 4.3).",
        "The number of n-grams with n>4 is very small, and the occurrence of which is also rare.",
        "Therefore, the problems of bi-grams, tri-grams and 4-grams are primarily taken into considerations in our work.",
        "Now let us consider the correlation between two neighboring words A and B.",
        "Assuming that these two words are terminologically relevant units, we can intuitively expect that they occur more often than random chance.",
        "From a statistical point of view, this probability can be measured by several statistical methods, such as \"cooccurrence frequency\", \"Mutual Information\", \"Dice coefficient\", \"Chi-square test\", \"log-likelihood\", etc[1, 6, 15].",

        "The idea underlying this method is that multi-word terms are constructed according to more or less fixed syntactic patterns, and if such patterns are identified for each language, it is possible to extract them from a POS tagged corpus.",
        "The second was to use a stop-word filter that a term can never begin or end in a stop-word.",

        "According to the analysis of the existing terms, multi-word terms have some kinds of fixed syntactic patterns.",

        "We found that there were about 30 syntactic patterns which covered almost 95% in the two word combinations.",

        "Three different statistical measures were used to enhance the precision of the extraction, such as Log-likelihood ratio, Chi-square test and Mutual information.",
        "Because of the poor performance in our first test, Dice formula was not used in hybrid method any more.",
        "Therefore, we have delivered three different experiments using like \"LogL + Liguistic Filter\", \"Chi + Liguistic Filter\", \"MI + Liguistic Filter\" methods.",
        "In Figure 7, we present the comparative results of precision rate among these different experiments.",
        "In order to measure the precision rate of the result, we used the grammatical criterion: A multi word n-gram could be considered as accurate result if it is grammatically appropriate.",
        "By grammatical appropriation, we refer to compound noun phrase or compound verb phrase, since with majority of multi-word terms have these structures.",
        "As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, and it has considerably improved the precision of the extraction.",
        "The precision was much higher than that of purely statistical method, retrieving appropriate result almost 10%-20% higher than in the first experiment.",
        "In our test, hybrid method combining \"Log-likelihood ratio\" and \"linguistic rules\" had the best performance in the extraction.",
        "The precision was higher than 90%.",
        "According to their performance, the results of different experiments can be arranged like:",

        "Comparison of Extraction Performance between statistical measures and hybrid measure",
        "In the analysis of the extraction data, we examined the precision of every 100 multi-word candidates which sorted in descending order.",
        "Considering the size of corpus, we compared the results within the highly valued 1000 candidates.",
        "A sample of the highly valued output is seen in Table 4.",
        "Table 4.",
        "The sample result sorted by Log-likelihood ratio",
        "As seen in Table 4, although not all these units would be considered terms in the traditional sense of the word, most of them either contain terms or include terminologically relevant collocations.",
        "Besides, our extraction started from these two word items, expanded to extract multi-word units like three word or four word units.",
        "Finally we could extract multi word units such as the following sample:",
        "Table 5.",
        "The sample of multi-word terms",
        "On the whole, as we think that the performance of the extraction was quite good, this method could be applicable in the translation system.",

        "The paper presents a methodology for the extraction of terminological collocations from academic documents for translation purposes.",
        "It shows that statistical methods are useful because they can automatically extract all the possible multi word units according to the correlation coefficient.",
        "But the purely statistical system extracts all multi-word units regardless of their types, so that we also find sequences which are meaningless in terminology.",
        "Clearly the output must be thoroughly filtered before the result can be used in any productive way.",
        "To improve the precision of the extraction system, we decided to use linguistic rules determining whether a sequence was terminologically relevant or not.",
        "The frequent syntactic patterns of terminology and the stop-word list were used to filter out the irrelevant candidates.",
        "As a consequence, hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, and it has considerably improved the precision of the extraction.",
        "The precision was much higher than that of purely statistical method.",
        "We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in this way, could be used effectively either to supplement existing terminological collections or to be used in addition to traditional reference works.",
        "In future we envisage the development of techniques for the alignment of exact translation equivalents of multi-word terms in Chinese and Korean, and one way of doing so is by finding correspondences between syntactic patterns in both languages.",
        "Translation memory systems already store translations in a format similar to a parallel corpus, and terminology tools already involve functions such as \"auto-translate\" that statistically calculate the most probable translation equivalent.",
        "By refining these functions and making them language specific, we could soon be facing a new generation of tools for translators.",
        "It remains to be seen, however, whether they can really be implemented into translation environments on broad scale."
