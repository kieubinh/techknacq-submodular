        "Our assumption was that synonyms and antonyms of an opinion-bearing word could be opinion-bearing as well, as for example “nice, virtuous, pleasing, well-behaved, gracious, honorable, righteous” as synonyms for “good”, or “bad, evil, disreputable, unrighteous” as antonyms.",

        "If we can measure the ‘opinion-based closeness’ of a synonym or antonym to a known opinion bearer, then we can determine whether to include it in the expanded set.",
        "To develop such a scale, we first created a non-opinion-bearing word list manually and produced related words for it using WordNet.",
