        "Semantic verb classes generalize over verbs according to their semantic properties, that is, they capture large amounts of verb meaning without defining the idiosyncratic details for each verb.",
        "The classes refer to a general semantic level, and idiosyncratic lexical semantic properties of the verbs are either added to the class description or left underspecified.",
        "Examples for semantic verb classes are Position verbs such as liegen 'lie', sitzen 'sit', stehen 'stand', and Manner of Motion with a Vehicle verbs such as fahren 'drive', fliegen 'fly', rudern 'row'.",
        "Manual definitions of semantic verb classes exist for several languages, the most dominant examples concerning English (Levin 1993; Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) and Spanish (Vazquez et al.",
        "2000).",
        "On the one hand, verb classes reduce redundancy in verb descriptions since they encode the common properties of verbs.",
        "On the other hand, verb classes can predict and refine properties of a verb that received insufficient empirical evidence, with reference to verbs in the same class: Under this criterion, a verb classification is especially useful for the pervasive problem of data sparseness in NLP, where little or no knowledge is provided for rare events.",
        "For example, the English verb classification by Levin (1993) has been used in NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones 1996), machine translation (Dorr 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan 1998), and subcat-egorization acquisition (Korhonen 2002).",
        "To my knowledge, no comparable German verb classification is available so far; therefore, such a classification would provide a principled basis for filling a gap in available lexical knowledge.",
        "* Department of Computational Linguistics, Saarbrücken, Germany.",
        "E-mail: schulte@coli.uni-sb.de.",
        "Submission received: 1 September 2003; revised submission received: 5 September 2005; accepted for publication: 10 November 2005.",
        "How can we obtain a semantic classification of verbs while avoiding tedious manual definitions of the verbs and the classes?",
        "Few resources are semantically annotated and provide semantic information off-the-shelf such as FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Fontenelle 2003) and PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).",
        "Instead, the automatic construction of semantic classes typically benefits from a longstanding linguistic hypothesis that asserts a tight connection between the lexical meaning of a verb and its behavior: To a certain extent, the lexical meaning of a verb determines its behavior, particularly with respect to the choice of its arguments (Pinker 1989; Levin 1993; Dorr and Jones 1996; Siegel and McKeown 2000; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew 2002; Lapata and Brew 2004).",
        "Even though the meaning-behavior relationship is not perfect, we can make this prediction: If we induce a verb classification on the basis of verb features describing verb behavior, then the resulting behavior classification should agree with a semantic classification to a certain extent (yet to be determined).",
        "The aim of this work is to utilize this prediction for the automatic acquisition of German semantic verb classes.",
        "The verb behavior itself is commonly captured by the diathesis alternation of verbs: alternative constructions at the syntax-semantics interface that express the same or a similar conceptual idea of a verb (Lapata 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000; McCarthy 2001; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Joanis 2002).",
        "Consider example (1), where the most common alternations of the Manner of Motion with a Vehicle verb fahren ' drive' are illustrated.",
        "The conceptual participants are a vehicle, a driver, a passenger, and a direction.",
        "In (a), the vehicle is expressed as the subject in a transitive verb construction, with a prepositional phrase indicating the direction.",
        "In (b), the driver is expressed as the subject in a transitive verb construction, with a prepositional phrase indicating the direction.",
        "In (c), the driver is expressed as the subject in a transitive verb construction, with an accusative noun phrase indicating the vehicle.",
        "In (d), the driver is expressed as the subject in a ditransitive verb construction, with an accusative noun phrase indicating the passenger, and a prepositional phrase indicating the direction.",
        "Even if a certain participant is not realized within an alternation, its contribution might be implicitly defined by the verb.",
        "For example, in the German sentence in (a) the driver is not expressed overtly, but we know that there is a driver, and in (b) and (d) the vehicle is not expressed overtly, but we know that there is a vehicle.",
        "Verbs in the same semantic class are expected to overlap in their alternation behavior to a certain extent.",
        "For example, the Manner ofMotion with a Vehicle verb fliegen fly' alternates between (a) such as in Der Airbus A380 fliegt nach New York 'The Airbus A380 flies to New York', (b) in marked cases as in Der altere Pilot fliegt nach London 'The older pilot flies to London', (c) as in Pilot Schulze fliegt eine Boing 747' Pilot Schulze flies a Boing 747', and (d) as in Der Pilot fliegt seine Passagiere nach Thailand 'The pilot flies his passengers to Thailand'; the Manner of Motion with a Vehicle verb rudern 'row' alternates between (b) such as in Anna rudert über den See ' Anna rows over the lake', (c) such as in Anna rudert das blaue Boot Anna rows the blue boat', and (d) such as in Anna rudert ihren kleinen Bruder über den See' Anna rows her little brother over the lake'.",
        "Example 1",
        "(a) Der Wagen fahrt in die Innenstadt.",
        "The car drives to the city centre.'",
        "(b) Die Frau fahrt nach Hause.",
        "The woman drives home.'",
        "(c) Der Filiusfahrt einen blauen Ferrari.",
        "The son drives a blue Ferrari.'",
        "(d) Der Jungefahrt seinen Vater zum Zug.",
        "'The boy drives his father to the train.'",
        "We decided to use diathesis alternations as an approach to characterizing verb behavior, and to use the following verb features to stepwise describe diathesis alternations: (1) syntactic structures, which are relevant for capturing argument functions; (2) prepositions, which are relevant to distinguish, for example, directions from locations; and (3) selectional preferences, which concern participant roles.",
        "A statistical grammar model serves as the source for an empirical verb description for the three levels at the syntax-semantics interface.",
        "Based on the empirical feature description, we then perform a cluster analysis of the German verbs using k-means, a standard unsupervised hard clustering technique as proposed by Forgy (1965).",
        "The clustering outcome cannot be a perfect semantic verb classification, since the meaning-behavior relationship on which the clustering relies is not perfect, and the clustering method is not perfect for the ambiguous verb data.",
        "However, our primary goal is not necessarily to obtain the optimal clustering result, but rather to assess the linguistic and technical conditions that are crucial for a semantic cluster analysis.",
        "More specifically, (1) we perform an empirical investigation of the relationship between verb meaning and verb behavior (that is, Can we use the meaning-behavior relationship of verbs to induce verb classes, and to what extent does the meaning-behavior relationship hold in the experiments?",
        "), and (2) we investigate which technical parameters are suitable for the natural language task.",
        "The resulting clustering methodology can then be applied to a larger-scale verb set.",
        "The plan of the article is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the experimental setup with respect to (1) gold standard verb classes for 168 German verbs, (2) the statistical grammar model that provides empirical lexical information for German verbs at the syntax-semantics interface, and (3) the clustering algorithm and evaluation methods.",
        "Section 3 performs preliminary clustering experiments on the German gold standard verbs, and Section 4 presents an application of the clustering technique in a large-scale experiment.",

        "A set of 168 German verbs was manually classified into 43 concise semantic verb classes.",
        "The verb class labels refer to the common semantic properties of the verbs in a class at a general conceptual level, and the idiosyncratic lexical semantic properties of the verbs are left underspecified.",
        "The German verbs are provided with a coarse translation into English, given here in brackets; we do not attempt to define subtle differences in meaning or usage.",
        "The translated verb senses only refer to the respective semantic class; if the verb translations in one class are too similar to distinguish among them, a common translation is given.",
        "Even though the classification is primarily based on semantic intuition and not on facts about syntactic behavior, the verbs grouped in one class share certain aspects of their behavior.",
        "(Please note that this overlap does not necessarily transfer to the English translations.)",
        "This agreement corresponds to the",
        "Schulte im",
        "long-standing linguistic hypothesis that asserts a tight connection between the meaning components of a verb and its behavior (Pinker 1989; Levin 1993).",
        "The purpose of the manual classification is to evaluate the reliability and performance of the clustering experiments.",
        "The following facts refer to empirically relevant properties of the classification: The class size is between 2 and 7, with an average of 3.9 verbs per class.",
        "Eight verbs are ambiguous with respect to class membership and marked by subscripts.",
        "The classes include both high-and low-frequency verbs in order to exercise the clustering technology in both data-rich and data-poor situations: The corpus frequencies of the verbs range from 8 to 71,604 (within 35 million words of a German newspaper corpus, cf.",
        "Section 2.2).",
        "The class labels are given on two semantic levels: coarse labels such as Manner of Motion are subdivided into finer labels, such as Locomotion, Rotation, Rush, Vehicle, Flotation.",
        "The fine-grained labels are relevant for the clustering experiments, as the numbering indicates.",
        "As mentioned before, the classification is primarily based on semantic intuition, not on facts about syntactic behavior.",
        "As an extreme example, the Support class (23) contains the verb unterstützen, which syntactically requires a direct object, together with the verbs dienen, folgen, and helfen, which dominantly subcategorize for an indirect object.",
        "The classification was checked to ensure lack of bias, so class membership is not disproportionately made up of high-frequency verbs, low-frequency verbs, strongly ambiguous verbs, verbs from specific semantic areas, and so forth.",
        "The classification deliberately sets high standards for the automatic induction process: It would be easier (1) to define the verb classes on a purely syntactic basis, since syntactic properties are easier to obtain automatically than semantic features, or (2) to define larger classes of verbs, so that the distinction between the classes is not based on fine-grained verb properties, or (3) to disregard clustering complications such as verb ambiguity and low-frequency verbs.",
        "But the overall goal is not to achieve a perfect clustering on the given 168 verbs but to investigate both the potential and the limits of our clustering methodology that combines easily available data with a simple algorithm.",

        "We developed, implemented, and trained a statistical grammar model for German that is based on the framework of head-lexicalized, probabilistic, context-free grammars.",
        "The idea originates from Charniak (1997), with this work using an implementation by Schmid (2000) for a training corpus of 35 million words from a collection of large German newspaper corpora from the 1990s, including Frankfurter Rundschau, Stuttgarter Zeitung, VDi-Nachrichten, die tageszeitung, German Law Corpus, Donaukurier,and Computerzeitung.",
        "The statistical grammar model provides empirical lexical information, specializing in but not restricted to the subcategorization behavior of verbs.",
        "Details of the implementation, training, and exploitation of the grammar model can be found in",
        "Schulte im Walde (2003a, chapter 3).",
        "The German verbs are represented by distributional vectors, with features and feature values in the distribution being acquired from the statistical grammar.",
        "The distributional description is based on the hypothesis that \"each language can be described in terms of a distributional structure, that is, in terms of the occurrence of parts relative to other parts\" (cf. Harris 1968).",
        "The verbs are described distributionally on three levels at the syntax-semantics interface, each level refining the previous level.",
        "The first level D1 encodes a purely syntactic definition of verb subcategorization, the second level D2 encodes a syntactico-semantic definition of subcategorization with prepositional preferences, and the third level D3 encodes a syntactico-semantic definition of subcategorization with prepositional and selectional preferences.",
        "Thus, the refinement of verb features starts with a purely syntactic definition and incrementally adds semantic information.",
        "The most elaborated description comes close to a definition of verb alternation behavior.",
        "We decided on this three-step procedure of verb descriptions because the resulting clusters and particularly the changes in clusters that result from a change of features should provide insight into the meaning-behavior relationship at the syntax-semantics interface.",
        "For D1, the statistical grammar model provides frequency distributions for German verbs over 38 purely syntactic subcategorization frames (cf.",
        "Appendix 6).",
        "Based on these frequencies, we can also calculate the probabilities.",
        "For D2, the grammar provides frequencies for the different kinds of prepositional phrases within a frame type; probabilities are computed by distributing the joint probability of a verb and a PP frame over the prepositional phrases according to their frequencies in the corpus.",
        "Prepositional phrases are referred to by case and preposition, such as mitDat, furAcc.The statistical grammar model does not learn the distinction between PP arguments and PP adjuncts perfectly.",
        "Therefore, we did not restrict the PP features to PP arguments, but to 30 PPs according to 'reasonable' appearance in the corpus, as defined by the 30 most frequent PPs that appear with at least 10 different verbs.",
        "The subcategorization frame information for D1andD2 has been evaluated: Schulte im Walde (2002b) describes the induction of a subcategorization lexicon from the grammar model for a total of 14,229 verbs with a frequency between 1 and 255,676 in the training corpus, and Schulte im Walde (2002a) performs an evaluation of the subcategorization data against manually created dictionary entries and shows that the lexical entries have potential for adding to and improving manual verb definitions.",
        "For the refinement of D3, the grammar provides selectional preference information at a fine-grained level: It specifies the possible argument realizations in the form of lexical heads, with reference to a specific verb-frame-slot combination.",
        "Obviously, we would run into a sparse data problem if we tried to incorporate selectional preferences into the verb descriptions at such a specific level.",
        "We are provided with detailed information at the nominal level, but we need a generalization of the selectional preference definition.",
        "A widely used resource for selectional preference information is the semantic ontology WordNet (Miller et al.",
        "1990; Fellbaum 1998); the University of Tübingen has developed the German version of WordNet, GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997; Kunze 2000).",
        "The hierarchy is realized by means of synsets, sets of synonymous nouns, which are organized by multiple inheritance hyponym/hypernym relationships.",
        "A noun can appear in several synsets, according to its number of senses.",
        "The German noun hierarchy in GermaNet is utilized for the generalization of selectional preferences: For each noun in a verb-frame-slot combination, the joint frequency is divided over the different senses of the noun and propagated up the hierarchy.",
        "In case of multiple hypernym",
        "Schulte im",
        "synsets, the frequency is divided again.",
        "The sum of frequencies over all top synsets equals the total joint frequency.",
        "Repeating the frequency assignment and propagation for all nouns appearing in a verb-frame-slot combination, the result defines a frequency distribution of the verb-frame-slot combination over all GermaNet synsets.",
        "To restrict the variety of noun concepts to a general level, only the frequency distributions over the top GermaNet nodes are considered: Lebewesen creature', Sache thing', Besitz property', Substanz substance', Nahrung food', Mittel means', Situation situation', Zustand state', Struktur structure', Physis body', Zeit time', Ort space', Attribut attribute', Kognitives Objekt 'cognitive object', Kognitiver Prozess 'cognitive process'.",
        "Since the 15 nodes are mutually exclusive and the node frequencies sum to the total joint verb-frame frequency, we can use their frequencies to define a probability distribution.",
        "Are selectional preferences equally necessary and informative for all frame types?",
        "For example, selectional preferences for the direct object are expected to vary strongly with respect to the subcategorizing verb (because the direct object is a highly frequent argument type across all verbs and verb classes), but selectional preferences for a subject in a transitive construction with a nonfinite clause are certainly less interesting for refinement (because this frame type is more restricted with respect to the verbs it is subcategorized for).",
        "We empirically investigated which of the overall frame roles may be realized by different selectional preferences and are therefore relevant and informative for a selectional preference distinction.",
        "As a result, in parts of the clustering experiments we will concentrate on a specific choice of frame-slot combinations to be refined by selectional preferences (with the relevant slots underlined): 'n', 'na', 'nd', 'nad', 'ns-dass.'",
        "Table 1 presents three verbs from different classes and their 10 most frequent frame types at the three levels of verb definition and their probabilities.",
        "D1for beginnen 'begin' defines' np' and 'n' as the most probable frame types.",
        "After splitting the' np' probability over the different PP types in D2, a number of prominent PPs are left, the time indicating umAcc and nachDat, mitDat referring to the begun event, anDat as date, and inDat as place indicator.",
        "It is obvious that not all PPs are argument PPs, but adjunct PPs also represent a part of the verb behavior.",
        "D3 illustrates that typical selectional preferences for beginner roles are Situation situation', Zustand state', Zeit time', Sache thing'.",
        "D3 has the potential to indicate verb alternation behavior, for example, 'na(Situation)' refers to the same role for the direct object in a transitive frame as \"n(Situation)\" in an intransitive frame.",
        "essen eat' as an object-drop verb shows strong preferences for both intransitive and transitive usage.",
        "As desired, the argument roles are dominated by Lebewesen 'creature' for 'n'and 'na' and Nahrung 'food' for 'na'.",
        "fahren 'drive' chooses typical manner of motion frames ('n,' 'np,' 'na') with the refining PPs being directional (inAcc,zuDat, nachDat) or referring to a means of motion (mitDat,inDat, aufDat).",
        "The selectional preferences show correct alternation behavior: Lebewesen creature' in the object drop case for 'n'and 'na,' Sache 'thing' in the inchoative/causative case for 'n'and 'na'.",
        "In addition to the absolute verb descriptions above, a simple smoothing technique is applied to the feature values.",
        "The goal of smoothing is to create more uniform distributions, especially with regard to adjusting zero values, but also for assimilating high and low frequencies and probabilities.",
        "The smoothed distributions are particularly interesting for distributions with a large number of features, since they typically contain",

        "We decided to apply the smoothing algorithm referred to as additive smoothing: The smoothing is performed simply by adding 0.5 to all verb features, that is, the joint frequency of each verb v and feature xi is changed by freq'(v,xi) = freq(v,xi) + 0.5.",
        "The total verb frequency is adapted to the changed feature values, representing the sum of all verb feature values: vfreq/ = i freq'(v,xi).",

        "Clustering is a standard procedure in multivariate data analysis.",

        "Related to this parameter is the level of semantic concept: The more verb clusters are found, the more specific the semantic concept, and vice versa.",
        "(2) fc-means is sensitive to the initial clusters, so the initialization is varied according to how much preprocessing we invest: Both random clusters and hierarchically preprocessed clusters are used as initial clusters for fc-means.",
        "In the case of preprocessed clusters, the hierarchical clustering is performed as bottom-up agglomerative clustering with the following criteria for merging the clusters: single linkage (minimal distance between nearest neighbor verbs), complete linkage (minimal distance between furthest neighbor verbs), average distance between verbs, distance between cluster centroids, and Ward's method (minimizing the sum of squares when merging clusters).",
        "The merging method influences the shape of the clusters; for example, single linkage causes a chaining effect in the shape of the clusters, and complete linkage creates compact clusters.",

Recall and precision numbers are calculated in the standard way, with true positives the number of common pairs in M and C, false positives the number of pairs in C,but not M, and false negatives the number of pairs in M,but not C.Weuse the f-score pairF (as harmonic mean between recall and precision), which provides an easy to understand percentage.",

        "The PP information is essential for distinguishing these verb classes, and the coherence is partly destroyed by D3: Manner ofMotion verbs (from the subclasses Locomotion, Rotation, Rush, Vehicle, Flotation) are captured well by clusters (d) and (e), since they use common alternations, but cluster (c) merges Existence, Position, and Aspect verbs because verb-idiosyncratic demands on selectional roles destroy the D2 class demarcation.",

        "(2) Low-frequency verbs were a problem in the clustering experiments.",
        "Their distributions are noisier than those for more frequent verbs, so they typically constitute noisy clusters.",
        "(3) As known beforehand, verb ambiguity cannot be modeled by the hard clustering algorithm fc-means.",

        "(4) The interpretation of the clusterings unexpectedly points to meaning components of verbs that have not been discovered by the manual classification.",
        "An example verb is laufen, expressing not only a Manner of Motion but also a kind of existence when used in the sense of operation.",
        "The discovery effect should be more impressive with an increasing number of verbs, since manual judgement is more difficult, and also with a soft clustering technique, where multiple cluster assignment is enabled.",
        "(5) In a similar way, the clustering interpretation exhibits semantically related verb classes, that is, verb classes that are separated in the manual classification, but semantically merged in a common cluster.",
        "For example, Perception and Observation verbs are related in that all the verbs express an observation, with the Perception verbs additionally referring to a physical ability, such as hearing.",
        "(6) Related to the preceding issue, the manual verb classes as defined are demonstrated as detailed and subtle.",
        "Compared to a more general classification that would appropriately merge several classes, the clustering confirms that we defined a difficult task with subtle classes.",
        "We were aware of this fact but preferred a fine-grained classification, since it allows insight into verb and class properties.",
        "In this way, verbs that are similar in meaning are often clustered incorrectly with respect to the gold standard.",
        "To come to the main point, what exactly is the nature of the meaning-behavior relationship?",
        "(1) Already a purely syntactic verb description allows a verb clustering clearly above the baseline.",
        "The result is a (semantic) classification of verbs that agree in their syntactic frame definitions, for example, most of the Support verbs.",
        "The clustering fails for semantically similar verbs that differ in their syntactic behavior, for example, unterstützen, which belongs to the Support verbs but demands an accusative rather than a dative object.",
        "In addition, it fails for syntactically similar verbs that are clustered together even though they do not exhibit semantic similarity; for example, many verbs from different semantic classes subcategorize for an accusative object, so they are falsely clustered together.",
        "(2) Refining the syntactic verb information with prepositional phrases is helpful for the semantic clustering, not only in the clustering of verbs where the PPs are obligatory, but also in the clustering of verbs with optional PP arguments.",
        "Schulte im",
        "The improvement underlines the linguistic fact that verbs that are similar in their meaning agree either on a specific prepositional complement (e.g., glauben/denken anAcc) or on a more general kind of modification, for example, directional PPs for Manner of Motion verbs.",
        "(3) Defining selectional preferences for arguments improves the clustering results further, but the improvement is not as persuasive as when refining the purely syntactic verb descriptions with prepositional information.",
        "For example, selectional preferences help demarcate the Quantum Change class because the respective verbs agree in their structural as well as selectional properties.",
        "But in the Consumption class, essen and trinken have strong preferences for a food object, whereas konsumieren allows a wider range of object types.",
        "In contrast, there are verbs that are very similar in their behavior, especially with respect to a coarse definition of selectional roles, but they do not belong to the same fine-grained semantic class, for example, toten and unterrichten.",
        "The effect could be due to (a) noisy or (b) sparse data, but the basic verb descriptions appear reliable with respect to their desired linguistic content, and Table 8 illustrates that even with little added information the effect exists (e.g., refining few arguments by 15 selectional roles results in 253 instead of 178 features, so the magnitude of feature numbers does not change).",
        "Why do we encounter an indeterminism concerning the encoding and effect of verb features, especially with respect to selectional preferences?",
        "The meaning of verbs comprises both properties that are general for the respective verb classes, and idiosyncratic properties that distinguish the verbs from each other.",
        "As long as we define the verbs by those properties that represent the common parts of the verb classes, a clustering can succeed.",
        "But by stepwise refining the verb description and including lexical idiosyncrasy, the emphasis on the common properties vanishes.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, the distinction between common and idiosyncratic features is obvious, but from a practical point of view there is no perfect choice for the encoding of verb features.",
        "The feature choice depends on the specific properties of the desired verb classes, and even if classes are perfectly defined on a common conceptual level, the relevant level of behavioral properties of the verb classes might differ.",
        "Still, for a large-scale classification of verbs, we need to specify a combination of linguistic verb features as a basis for the clustering.",
        "Which combination do we choose?",
        "Both the theoretical assumption of encoding features of verb alternation as verb behavior and the practical realization by encoding syntactic frame types, prepositional phrases, and selectional preferences seem promising.",
        "In addition, we aimed at a (rather linguistically than technically based) choice of selectional preferences that represents a useful compromise for the conceptual needs of the verb classes.",
        "Therefore, this choice of features best utilizes the meaning-behavior relationship and will be applied in a large-scale clustering experiment (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "It is not a goal of this article to optimize the number of clusters in the cluster analysis.",
        "We are not interested in the question of whether, for example, 40, 42, 43, or 45 clusters represent the best semantic classification of 168 verbs.",
        "But there are two reasons why it is interesting and relevant to investigate the properties of clusterings with respect to different numbers of clusters.",
        "(1) The clustering methodology should basically work the way we expect it to work, that is, the evaluation of the results should show deficiencies for extreme numbers of clusters, but (possibly several) optimal values for various numbers of clusters in between.",
        "(2) Even if we do not check for an exact number of clusters, we should check the magnitude of the number of clusters, since the clustering methodology might be successful in capturing a rough verb classification with few verb classes but not a fine-grained classification with many subtle distinctions.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the clustering results for the series of cluster analyses as performed by fc-means with hierarchical clustering initialization (Ward's method) on probability distributions, with skew divergence as the similarity measure.",
        "The feature description refers to D2.",
        "The number of clusters is varied from 1 through the number of verbs (168), and the results are evaluated by Randa^-.",
        "A range of numbers of clusters is determined as optimal (71) or near-optimal (approx.",
        "58-78).",
        "The figure demonstrates that having performed experiments on the parameters for clustering, it is worthwhile exploring additional parameters: The optimal result is 0.188 for 71 clusters as compared to 0.158 for 43 clusters reported previously."

        "The features of the verbs were restricted to those that should capture the basic differences between the verb classes, in line with the idea that the feature choice depends on the specific properties of the desired verb classes.",
        "But using the same classification methodology for a large-scale experiment with an enlarged number of verbs and classes faces more problems.",
        "For example, Joanis (2002) reported an extension of their work that used 802 verbs from 14 classes from Levin (1993).",
        "He defined an extensive feature space with 219 core features (such as part of speech, auxiliary frequency, syntactic categories, and animacy as above) and 1,140 selectional preference features taken from WordNet.",
        "As in Schulte im Walde (2000), the selectional preferences did not improve the clustering.",
        "In recent work, Stevenson and Joanis (2003) compared their supervised method for verb classification with semisupervised and unsupervised techniques.",
        "In these experiments, they enlarged the number of gold standard English verb classes to 14 classes related to Levin classes, with a total of 841 verbs.",
        "Low-frequency and ambiguous verbs were excluded from the classes.",
        "They found that a semisupervised approach where the classifier was trained with five seed verbs from each verb class outperformed both a manual selection of features and the unsupervised approach of Dash, Liu, and Yao (1997), which used an entropy measure to organize data into a multidimensional space.",
        "The classification methodology from Merlo and Stevenson (2001) was applied to multilinguality by Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) and Tsang, Stevenson, and Merlo (2002).",
        "Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) showed that the classification paradigm is applicable in languages other than English by using the same features as defined by Merlo and Stevenson (2001) for the respective classification of 59 Italian verbs empirically based on the Parole corpus.",
        "The resulting accuracy is 86.4%.",
        "In addition, they used the content of Chinese verb features to refine the English verb classification, explained in more detail by Tsang, Stevenson, and Merlo (2002).",
        "The English verbs were manually translated into Chinese and given part-of-speech tag features, passive particles, causative particles, and sublexical morphemic properties.",
        "Verb tags and particles in Chinese are overt expressions of semantic information that is not expressed as clearly in English, and the multilingual set of features outperformed either set of monolingual features, yielding an accuracy of 83.5%.",
        "Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) describe a hierarchical soft clustering method that clusters words according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts.",
        "They used an application of their method to nouns appearing as direct objects of verbs.",
        "The clustering result was a hierarchy of noun clusters, where every noun belongs to every cluster with a membership probability.",
        "The initial data for the clustering process were frequencies of verb-noun pairs in a direct object relationship, as extracted from parsed sentences from the Associated Press news wire corpus.",
        "On the basis of the conditional verb-noun probabilities, the similarity of the distributions was determined by the Kullback-Leibler divergence.",
        "The EM algorithm (Baum 1972) was used to learn the hidden cluster membership probabilities, and deterministic annealing performed the divisive hierarchical clustering.",
        "The resulting class-based model can be utilized for estimating information for unseen events (cf. Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999).",
        "Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) produced soft semantic clusters for English that represent a classification on verbs as well as on nouns.",
        "They gathered distributional data for verb-noun pairs in specific grammatical relations from the British National Corpus.",
        "The extraction was based on a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (Carroll and Rooth 1998) and contained the subject and object nouns for all intransitive and transitive verbs in the parses – a total of 608,850 verb-noun types.",
        "Conditioning of the verbs and the nouns on each other was done through hidden classes, and the joint probabilities of classes, verbs, and nouns were trained by the EM algorithm.",
        "The resulting model defined conditional membership probabilities for each verb and noun in each class; for example, the class of communicative action contains the most probable verbs ask, nod, think, shape, smile and the most probable nouns man, Ruth, Corbett, doctor, woman.",
        "The semantic classes were utilized for the induction of a semantically annotated verb lexicon."

      "text": [
        "This article presented a clustering methodology for German verbs whose results agreed with a manual classification in many respects and should prove useful as automatic basis for a large-scale clustering.",
        "Without a doubt the cluster analysis needs manual correction and completion, but represents a plausible foundation.",
        "Key issues of the clustering methodology concern linguistic criteria on the one hand, and technical criteria on the other hand.",
        "Linguistic Criteria: The strategy of utilizing subcategorization frames, prepositional information, and selectional preferences to define the verb features seems promising,",
        "Schulte im",
        "since the experiments illustrated a relation between the induced verb behavior and the membership of the semantic verb classes.",
        "In addition, each level of representation generated a positive effect on the clustering and improved upon the less informative level.",
        "The experiments presented evidence for a linguistic limit on the usefulness of the verb features: The meaning of verbs comprises both (1) properties that are general for the respective verb classes and (2) idiosyncratic properties that distinguish the verbs from each other.",
        "As long as we define the verbs by those properties that represent the common parts of the verb classes, a clustering can succeed.",
        "But by stepwise refining the verb description and including lexical idiosyncrasy, emphasis on the common properties vanishes.",
        "From the theoretical point of view, the distinction between common and idiosyncratic features is obvious.",
        "But from the practical point of view, feature choice then depends on the definition of the verb classes, and this definition might vary according to the conceptual level and also according to the kind of semantic coherence captured by the class.",
        "So far, we have concentrated on synonymy, but the large-scale experiment, in particular, discovered additional semantic relations within a verb class, such as participation in a process/script.",
        "However, the investigated feature combination within this article seems to be a useful starting point for verb description.",
        "Technical Criteria: We investigated the relationship between clustering idea, clustering parameters, and clustering result in order to develop a clustering methodology that is suitable for the demands of natural language.",
        "The clustering initialization played an important role: k-means needed compact, similarly-sized clusters in order to achieve a linguistically meaningful classification.",
        "The linguistically most successful initial clusters were therefore based on hierarchical clustering with complete linkage or Ward's method, as the resulting clusters are comparable in size and correspond to compact cluster shapes.",
        "The hierarchical clustering achieved more similar clustering outputs than k-means, which is due to the similarity of the clustering methods with respect to the common clustering criterion of optimizing the sum of distances between verbs and cluster centroids.",
        "The similarity measure used in the clustering experiments proved to be of secondary importance, since the differences in clustering due to varying the measure were negligible.",
        "For larger object and feature sets, Kullback-Leibler variants tended to outperform other measures, confirming language-based results on distributional similarity (Lee 2001).",
        "Both frequencies and probabilities represented a useful basis for the verb distributions.",
        "The number of clusters played a role concerning the magnitude of numbers: Inducing fine-grained clusters as given in the manual classification proved to be an ambitious goal because the feature distinction for the classes was also finegrained.",
        "Inducing coarse clusters provided a coarse classification that was subject to less noise and easier to manually correct.",
        "The \"optimal\" number of clusters is always a compromise and depends on the purpose of the classes, for example, as a fine-grained lexical resource, or for an NLP application.",
        "In the latter case, the optimal number should be determined by automatic means, that is, by trying different magnitudes of cluster numbers, because the level of generalization depends on the purpose for the abstraction.",
        "There are various directions for future research.",
        "(1) The manual definition of the German semantic verb classes will be extended in order to include a greater number and a larger variety of verb classes.",
        "An extended classification would be useful as a gold standard for further clustering experiments, and more generally as a resource for NLP applications.",
        "(2) Low-frequency verbs require a specific handling in the clustering procedure: Both the small-scale and the large-scale experiments showed that the low-frequency verbs have a negative impact on the cluster coherence.",
        "An alternative model for the low-frequency verbs might, for example, first take out of the cluster analysis those verbs below a certain frequency cutoff, and then assign the left-out verbs to the nearest clusters.",
        "The cluster assignment should also be special, for example, using verb features restricted to the reliable features, that is, above a certain frequency threshold.",
        "For example, if we consider the D2 features of the low-frequency verb ekeln 'disgust' (frequency: 31) with a minimum feature frequency of 2, we get a strong overlap with the distinguishing features of the verb furchten 'fear'.",
        "Future work will address these issues.",
        "(3) Possible features for describing German verbs will include any kind of information that helps to classify the verbs in a semantically appropriate way.",
        "Within this article, we concentrated on defining the verb features with respect to alternation behavior.",
        "Other features that are relevant for describing the behavior of verbs are their auxiliary selection and adverbial combinations.",
        "In addition, if we try to address additional types of semantic verb relations such as script-based relations, we will need to extend our features.",
        "For example, Schulte im Walde and Melinger (2005) recently showed that nouns in co-occurrence windows of verbs contribute to verb descriptions by encoding scene information, rather than intrasentential functions.",
        "They proposed the integration of window-based approaches into function-based approaches, a combination that has not yet been applied.",
        "(4) Variations in the existing feature description are especially relevant for the choice of selectional preferences.",
        "The experiment results demonstrated that the 15 conceptual GermaNet top levels are not sufficient for all verbs.",
        "For example, the verbs toten and unterrichten require a finer version of selectional preferences in order to be distinguished.",
        "It is worthwhile either to find a more appropriate level of selectional preferences in WordNet or to apply a more sophisticated approach towards selectional preferences such as that of Li and Abe (1998), in order to determine a more flexible choice of selectional preferences.",
        "(5) With respect to a large-scale classification of verbs, it will be interesting to apply classification techniques to the verb data.",
        "This would require more data manually labeled with classes in order to train a classifier.",
        "But the resulting classifier might abstract better than k-means over the different requirements of the verb classes with respect to the feature description.",
        "(6) As an extension of the existing clustering, a soft clustering algorithm will be applied to the German verbs.",
        "Soft clustering enables us to assign verbs to multiple clusters and therefore address the phenomenon of verb ambiguity.",
        "These clustering outcomes should be even more useful for discovering new verb meaning components and semantically related classes, compared with the hard clustering technique.",
        "(7) The verb clusters as resulting from the cluster analysis will be used within an NLP application in order to prove the usefulness of the clusters.",
        "For example, replacing verbs in a language model by the respective verb classes might improve the language model's robustness and accuracy, as the class information provides more stable syntactic and semantic information than the individual verbs.",
        "The syntactic part of the German verb behavior is captured by 38 subcategorization frame types.",
        "The frames comprise maximally three arguments.",
        "Possible arguments are nominative (n), dative (d) and accusative (a) noun phrases, reflexive pronouns (r), prepositional phrases (p), expletive es (x), subordinated non-finite clauses (i), subordinated finite clauses (s-2 for verb second clauses, s-dass for dass-clauses, sob for ob-clauses, s-w for indirect wh-questions), and copula constructions (k).",
        "The resulting frame types are listed in Table A.1, accompanied by annotated verb-second example clauses.",
        "The German examples are provided with English glosses; in cases where the glosses are difficult to understand, an English translation is added.",
