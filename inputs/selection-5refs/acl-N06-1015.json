        "Word alignment is a key component of most end-to-end statistical machine translation systems.",
        "The standard approach to word alignment is to construct directional generative models (Brown et al., 1990; Och and Ney, 2003), which produce a sentence in one language given the sentence in another language.",
        "While these models require sentence-aligned bitexts, they can be trained with no further supervision, using EM.",
        "Generative alignment models do, however, have serious drawbacks.",
        "First, they require extensive tuning and processing of large amounts of data which, for the better-performing models, is a non-trivial resource requirement.",
        "Second, conditioning on arbitrary features of the input is difficult; for example, we would like to condition on the orthographic similarity of a word pair (for detecting cognates), the presence of that pair in various dictionaries, the similarity of the frequency of its two words, choices made by other alignment systems, and so on.",
        "Recently, Moore (2005) proposed a discriminative model in which pairs of sentences (e, f ) and proposed alignments a are scored using a linear combination of arbitrary features computed from the tuples (a, e, f).",
        "While there are no restrictions on the form of the model features, the problem of finding the highest scoring alignment is very difficult and involves heuristic search.",
        "Moreover, the parameters of the model must be estimated using averaged perceptron training (Collins, 2002), which can be unstable.",
        "In contrast, Taskar et al.",
        "(2005) cast word alignment as a maximum weighted matching problem, in which each pair of words (ei, fk) in a sentence pair (e, f) is associated with a score sik (e, f) reflecting the desirability of the alignment of that pair.",
        "Importantly, this problem is computationally tractable.",
        "The alignment for the sentence pair is the highest scoring matching under constraints (such as the constraint that matchings be one-to-one).",
        "The scoring model sik (e, f ) can be based on a rich feature set defined on word pairs (ei, fk) and their context, including measures of association, orthography, relative position, predictions of generative models, etc.",
        "The parameters of the model are estimated within the framework of large-margin estimation; in particular, the problem turns out to reduce to the",
        "solution of a (relatively) small quadratic program (QP).",
        "The authors show that large-margin estimation is both more stable and more accurate than perceptron training.",
        "While the bipartite matching approach is a useful first step in the direction of discriminative word alignment, for discriminative approaches to compete with and eventually surpass the most sophisticated generative models, it is necessary to consider more realistic underlying statistical models.",
        "Note in particular two substantial limitations of the bipartite matching model of Taskar et al.",
        "(2005): words have fertility of at most one, and there is no way to incorporate pairwise interactions among alignment decisions.",
        "Moving beyond these limitations – while retaining computational tractability – is the next major challenge for discriminative word alignment.",
        "In this paper, we show how to overcome both limitations.",
        "First, we introduce a parameterized model that penalizes different levels of fertility.",
        "While this extension adds very useful expressive power to the model, it turns out not to increase the computational complexity of the aligner, for either the prediction or the parameter estimation problem.",
        "Second, we introduce a more thoroughgoing extension which incorporates first-order interactions between alignments of consecutive words into the model.",
        "We do this by formulating the alignment problem as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), where in addition to scoring individual edges, we also define scores of pairs of edges that connect consecutive words in an alignment.",
        "The predicted alignment is the highest scoring quadratic assignment.",
        "QAP is an NP-hard problem, but in the range of problem sizes that we need to tackle the problem can be solved efficiently.",
        "In particular, using standard off-the-shelf integer program solvers, we are able to solve the QAP problems in our experiments in under a second.",
        "Moreover, the parameter estimation problem can also be solved efficiently by making use of a linear relaxation of QAP for the min-max formulation of large-margin estimation (Taskar, 2004).",
        "We show that these two extensions yield significant improvements in error rates when compared to the bipartite matching model.",
        "The addition of a fertility model improves the AER by 0.4.",
        "Modeling first-order interactions improves the AER by 1.8.",
        "Combining the two extensions results in an improvement in AER of 2.3, yielding alignments of better quality than intersected IBM Model 4.",
        "Moreover, including predictions of bidirectional IBM Model 4 and model of Liang et al.",
        "(2006) as features, we achieve an absolute AER of 3.8 on the English-French Hansards alignment task – the best AER result published on this task to date."

        "These extensions significantly enhance the expressive power of the discriminative approach; in particular, they make it possible to capture phenomena of monotonicity, local inversion and contiguous fertility trends – phenomena that are highly informative for alignment.",
        "They do so while remaining computationally efficient in practice both for prediction and for parameter estimation.",
        "Our best model achieves a relative AER reduction of 25% over the basic matching formulation, beating intersected IBM Model 4 without the use of any compute-intensive features.",
        "Including Model 4 predictions as features, we achieve a further relative AER reduction of 32% over intersected Model 4 alignments.",
        "By also including predictions of another model, we drive AER down to 3.8.",
        "We are currently investigating whether the improvement in AER results in better translation BLEU score.",
        "Allowing higher fertility and optimizing a recall biased cost function provide a significant increase in recall relative to the intersected IBM model 4 (from 88.1% to 94.4%), with only a small degradation in precision.",
        "We view this as a particularly promising aspect of our work, given that phrase-based systems such as Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003) perform better with higher recall alignments."
