        "Content coverage is commonly measured in summary comparison to assess how much information from the reference summary is included in a peer summary.",
        "Both manual and automatic methodologies have been used.",
        "Naturally, there is a great amount of confidence in manual evaluation since humans can infer, paraphrase, and use world knowledge to relate text units with similar meanings, but which are worded differently.",
        "Human efforts are preferred if the evaluation task is easily conducted and managed, and does not need to be performed repeatedly.",
        "However, when resources are limited, automated evaluation methods become more desirable.",
        "For years, the summarization community has been actively seeking an automatic evaluation methodology that can be readily applied to various summarization tasks.",
        "ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) has gained popularity due to its simplicity and high correlation with human judgments.",
        "Even though validated by high correlations with human judgments gathered from previous Document Understanding Conference (DUC) experiments, current automatic procedures (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hovy et al., 2005) only employ lexical n-gram matching.",
        "The lack of support for word or phrase matching that stretches beyond strict lexical matches has limited the expressiveness and utility of these methods.",
        "We need a mechanism that supplements literal matching – i.e.",
        "paraphrase and synonym – and approximates semantic closeness.",
        "In this paper we present ParaEval, an automatic summarization evaluation method, which facilitates paraphrase matching in an overall three-level comparison strategy.",
        "At the top level, favoring higher coverage in reference, we perform an optimal search via dynamic programming to find multi-word to multi-word paraphrase matches between phrases in the reference summary (usually human-written) and those in the peer summary (system-generated).",
        "The non-matching fragments from the previous level are then searched by a greedy algorithm to find single-word paraphrase/synonym matches.",
        "At the third and the lowest level, we perform literal lexical unigram matching on the remaining texts.",
        "This tiered design for summary comparison guarantees at least a ROUGE-1 level of summary content matching if no paraphrases are found.",
        "The first two levels employ a paraphrase table.",
        "Since manually created multi-word paraphrases – phrases determined by humans to be paraphrases of one another – are not available in sufficient quantities, we automatically build a paraphrase",
        "table using methods from the Machine Translation (MT) field.",
        "The assumption made in creating this table is that if two English phrases are translated into the same foreign phrase with high probability (shown in the alignment results from a statistically trained alignment algorithm), then the two English phrases are paraphrases of each other.",
        "This paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 introduces previous work in summarization evaluation; Section 3 describes the motivation behind this work; paraphrase acquisition is discussed in Section 4; Section 5 explains in detail our summary comparison mechanism; Section 6 validates ParaEval with human summary judgments; and we conclude and discuss future work in Section 7."

        "SEE provides a user-friendly environment in which human assessors evaluate the quality of system-produced peer summary by comparing it to a reference summary.",
        "Summaries are represented by a list of summary units (sentences, clauses, etc.).",
        "Assessors can assign full or partial content coverage score to peer summary units in comparison to the corresponding reference summary units.",
        "Grammaticality can also be graded unit-wise.",
        "The goal of the Factoid work is to compare the information content of different summaries of the same text and determine the minimum number of summaries, which was shown through experimentation to be 20-30, needed to achieve stable consensus among 50 human-written summaries.",
        "The Pyramid method uses identified consensus – a pyramid of phrases created by annotators – from multiple reference summaries as the gold-standard reference summary.",
        "Summary comparisons are performed on Summarization Content Units (SCUs) that are approximately of clause length.",
        "To facilitate fast summarization system design-evaluation cycles, ROUGE was created (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "It is an automatic evaluation package that measures a number of n-gram co-occurrence SCU1: the crime in question was the Lockerbie {Scotland} bombing",
        "statistics between peer and reference summary pairs.",
        "ROUGE was inspired by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) which was adopted by the machine translation (MT) community for automatic MT evaluation.",
        "A problem with ROUGE is that the summary units used in automatic comparison are of fixed length.",
        "A more desirable design is to have summary units of variable size.",
        "This idea was implemented in the Basic Elements (BE) framework (Hovy et al., 2005) which has not been completed due to its lack of support for paraphrase matching.",
        "Both ROUGE and BE have been shown to correlate well with past DUC human summary judgments, despite incorporating only lexical matching on summary units (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hovy et al., 2005)."

        "From an in-depth analysis on the manually created SCUs of the DUC2003 summary set D30042 (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), we find that 54.48% of 1746 cases where a non-stop word from one SCU did not match with its supposedly human-aligned pairing SCUs are in need of some level of paraphrase matching support.",
        "For example, in the first two extracted SCUs (labeled as 1 and 2) in Figure 1 – “for the Lockerbie bombing” and “for blowing up ... over Lockerbie, Scotland” – no non-stop word other than the word “Lockerbie” occurs in both phrases.",
        "But these two phrases were judged to carry the same semantic meaning because human annotators think the word “bombing” and the phrase “blowing up” refer to the same action, namely the one associated with “explosion.” However, “bombing” and “blowing up” cannot be matched through synonymy relations by using WordNet, since one is a noun and the other is a verb phrase (if tagged within context).",
        "Even when the search is extended to finding synonyms and hypernyms for their categorical variants and/or using other parts of speech (verb for “bombing” and noun phrase for “blowing up”), a match still cannot be found.",

        "We wish to incorporate the probabilistic paraphrase extraction model from (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) to better approximate the relations between paraphrases.",
        "This adaptation will also lead to a stochastic model for the low-level lexical matching and scoring.",
        "We chose English-Chinese MT parallel data because they are news-oriented which coincides with the task genre from DUC.",
        "However, it is unknown how large a parallel corpus is sufficient in providing a paraphrase collection good enough to help the evaluation process.",
        "The quality of the paraphrase table is also affected by changes in the domain and language pair of the MT parallel data.",
        "We plan to use ParaEval to investigate the impact of these changes on paraphrase quality under the assumption that better paraphrase collections lead to better summary evaluation results.",
        "The immediate impact and continuation of the described work would be to incorporate paraphrase matching and extraction into the summary creation process.",
        "And with ParaEval, it is possible for us to evaluate systems that do incorporate some level of abstraction, especially paraphrasing."
