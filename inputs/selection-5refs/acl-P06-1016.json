        "With the dramatic increase in the amount of textual information available in digital archives and the WWW, there has been growing interest in techniques for automatically extracting information from text.",
        "Information Extraction (IE) is such a technology that IE systems are expected to identify relevant information (usually of predefined types) from text documents in a certain domain and put them in a structured format.",
        "According to the scope of the ACE program (ACE 2000-2005), current research in IE has three main objectives: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).",
        "This paper will focus on the ACE RDC task, which detects and classifies various semantic relations between two entities.",
        "For example, we want to determine whether a person is at a location, based on the evidence in the context.",
        "Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who is the president of the United States?”.",
        "One major challenge in relation extraction is due to the data sparseness problem (Zhou et al. 2005).",
        "As the largest annotated corpus in relation extraction, the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that different subtypes/types of relations are much unevenly distributed and a few relation subtypes, such as the subtype “Founder” under the type “ROLE”, suffers from a small amount of annotated data.",
        "Further experimentation in this paper (please see Figure 2) shows that most relation subtypes suffer from the lack of the training data and fail to achieve steady performance given the current corpus size.",
        "Given the relative large size of this corpus, it will be time-consuming and very expensive to further expand the corpus with a reasonable gain in performance.",
        "Even if we can somehow expend the corpus and achieve steady performance on major relation subtypes, it will be still far beyond practice for those minor subtypes given the much unevenly distribution among different relation subtypes.",
        "While various machine learning approaches, such as generative modeling (Miller et al. 2000), maximum entropy (Kambhatla 2004) and support vector machines (Zhao and Grisman 2005; Zhou et al. 2005), have been applied in the relation extraction task, no explicit learning strategy is proposed to deal with the inherent data sparseness problem caused by the much uneven distribution among different relations.",
        "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learning strategy to deal with the data sparseness problem by modeling the commonality among related classes.",
        "Through organizing various classes hierarchically, a linear discriminative function is determined for each class in a top-down way using a perceptron algorithm with the lower-level weight vector derived from the upper-level weight vector.",
        "Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that the hierarchical",
        "strategy achieves much better performance than the flat strategy on least and medium-frequent relations.",

        "The problem is that such integration may impose big challenges, e.g. the need of a large annotated corpus.",
        "To overcome the data sparseness problem, generative models typically applied some smoothing techniques to integrate different scales of contexts in parameter estimation, e.g. the back-off approach in Miller et al. (2000).",
        "Zelenko et al. (2003) proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees.",
        "Culotta and Sorensen (2004) extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees and achieved F-measure of 45.8 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus1.",
        "Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) proposed a shortest path dependency kernel.",
        "They argued that the information to model a relationship between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph.",

        "Although tree kernel-based approaches are able to explore the huge implicit feature space without much feature engineering, further research work is necessary to make them effective and efficient.",
        "Comparably, feature-based approaches achieved much success recently.",
        "Roth and Yih (2002) used the SNoW classifier to incorporate various features such as word, part-of-speech and semantic information from WordNet, and proposed a probabilistic reasoning approach to integrate named entity recognition and relation extraction.",
        "Kambhatla (2004) employed maximum entropy models with features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency tree, parse tree and achieved F-measure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.",
        "Zhao and Grisman (2005)2 combined various kinds of knowledge from tokenization, sentence parsing and deep dependency analysis through support vector machines and achieved F-measure of 70.1 on the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus3.",
        "Zhou et al. (2005) further systematically explored diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features through support vector machines and achieved F-measure of 68.1 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus respectively.",
        "To overcome the data sparseness problem, feature-based approaches normally incorporate various scales of contexts into the feature vector extensively.",
        "These approaches then depend on adopted learning algorithms to weight and combine each feature effectively.",
        "For example, an exponential model and a linear model are applied in the maximum entropy models and support vector machines respectively to combine each feature via the learned weight vector.",
        "In summary, although various approaches have been employed in relation extraction, they implicitly attack the data sparseness problem by using features of different contexts in feature-based approaches or including different sub2 Here, we classify this paper into feature-based approaches since the feature space in the kernels of Zhao and Grisman (2005) can be easily represented by an explicit feature vector.",
        "structures in kernel-based approaches.",
        "Until now, there are no explicit ways to capture the hierarchical topology in relation extraction.",
        "Currently, all the current approaches apply the flat learning strategy which equally treats training examples in different relations independently and ignore the commonality among different relations.",
        "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learning strategy to resolve this problem by considering the relatedness among different relations and capturing the commonality among related relations.",

        "It indicates that, although support vector machines and maximum entropy models always perform better than the simple perceptron algorithm in most (if not all) applications, the hierarchical learning strategy using the perceptron algorithm can easily overcome the difference and outperforms the flat learning strategy using the overwhelming support vector machines and maximum entropy models in relation extraction, at least on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus."

        "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learning strategy to deal with the data sparseness problem in relation extraction by modeling the commonality among related classes.",
        "For each class in a class hierarchy, a linear discriminative function is determined in a top-down way using the perceptron algorithm with the lower-level weight vector derived from the upper-level weight vector.",
        "In this way, the upper-level discriminative function can effectively guide the lower-level discriminative function learning.",
        "Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that the hierarchical strategy performs much better than the flat strategy in resolving the critical data sparseness problem in relation extraction.",
        "In the future work, we will explore the hierarchical learning strategy using other machine learning approaches besides online classifier learning approaches such as the simple perceptron algorithm applied in this paper.",
        "Moreover, just as indicated in Figure 2, most relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus (arguably the largest annotated corpus in relation extraction) suffer from the lack of training examples.",
        "Therefore, a critical research in relation extraction is how to rely on semi-supervised learning approaches (e.g. bootstrap) to alleviate its dependency on a large amount of annotated training examples and achieve better and steadier performance.",
        "Finally, our current work is done when NER has been perfectly done.",
        "Therefore, it would be interesting to see how imperfect NER affects the performance in relation extraction.",
        "This will be done by integrating the relation extraction system with our previously developed NER system as described in Zhou and Su (2002)."
