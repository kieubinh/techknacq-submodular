        "Automatic sentence compression has recently attracted much attention, in part because of its affinity with summarisation.",
        "The task can be viewed as producing a summary of a single sentence that retains the most important information while remaining grammatically correct.",
        "An ideal compression algorithm will involve complex text rewriting operations such as word reordering, paraphrasing, substitution, deletion, and insertion.",
        "In default of a more sophisticated compression algorithm, current approaches have simplified the problem to a single rewriting operation, namely word deletion.",
        "More formally, given an input sentence of words W = w1, w2, ... , wn, a compression is formed by dropping any subset of these words.",
        "Viewing the task as word removal reduces the number of possible compressions to 2n; naturally, many of these compressions will not be reasonable or grammatical (Knight and Marcu 2002).",
        "Sentence compression could be usefully employed in wide range of applications.",
        "For example, to automatically generate subtitles for television programs; the transcripts cannot usually be used verbatim due to the rate of speech being too high (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004).",
        "Other applications include compressing text to be displayed on small screens (Corston-Oliver 2001) such as mobile phones or PDAs, and producing audio scanning devices for the blind (Grefenstette 1998).",
        "Algorithms for sentence compression fall into two broad classes depending on their training requirements.",
        "Many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002; Riezler et al.",
        "2003; Nguyen et al.",
        "2004a; Turner and Char-niak 2005; McDonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees.",
        "The learnt rules effectively describe which constituents should be deleted in a given context.",
        "Approaches that do not employ parallel corpora require minimal or no supervision.",
        "They operationalise compression in terms of word deletion without learning specific rules and can therefore rely on little linguistic knowledge such as part-of-speech tags or merely the lexical items alone (Hori and Furui 2004).",
        "Alternatively, the rules of compression are approximated from a non-parallel corpus (e.g., the Penn Treebank) by considering context-free grammar derivations with matching expansions (Turner and Charniak 2005).",
        "Previous approaches have been developed and tested almost exclusively on written text, a notable exception being Hori and Furui (2004) who focus on spoken language.",
        "While parallel corpora of original-compressed sentences are not naturally available in the way multilingual corpora are, researchers have obtained such corpora automatically by exploiting documents accompanied by abstracts.",
        "Automatic corpus creation affords the opportunity to study compression mechanisms",
        "cheaply, yet these mechanisms may not be representative of human performance.",
        "It is unlikely that authors routinely carry out sentence compression while creating abstracts for their articles.",
        "Collecting human judgements is the method of choice for evaluating sentence compression models.",
        "However, human evaluations tend to be expensive and cannot be repeated frequently; furthermore, comparisons across different studies can be difficult, particularly if subjects employ different scales, or are given different instructions.",
        "In this paper we examine some aspects of the sentence compression task that have received little attention in the literature.",
        "First, we provide a novel comparison of supervised and weakly supervised approaches.",
        "Specifically, we study how constituent-based and word-based methods port to different domains and show that the latter tend to be more robust.",
        "Second, we create a corpus of human-authored compressions, and discuss some potential problems with currently used compression corpora.",
        "Finally, we present automatic evaluation measures for sentence compression and examine whether they correlate reliably with behavioural data."

        "The word-based model is closer to the human compression rate.",
        "According to our automatic evaluation measures, the decision-tree model is significantly worse than the word-based model (using the Student t test, SSA p < 0.05, F-score p < 0.05) on the Broadcast News corpus.",
        "Both models are significantly worse than humans (SSA p < 0.05, F-score p < 0.01).",
        "There is no significant difference between the two systems using the Ziff-Davis corpus on both simple string accuracy and relation F-score, whereas humans significantly outperform the two systems.",
        "We have performed an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to examine whether similar results are obtained when using human judgements.",
        "Statistical tests were done using the mean of the ratings (see Table 5).",
        "The ANOVA revealed a reliable effect of compression type by subjects and by items (p < 0.01).",
        "Post-hoc Tukey tests confirmed that the word-based model outperforms the decision-tree model (α < 0.05) on the Broadcast news corpus; however, the two models are not significantly",

        "Stars indicate level of statistical significance.",
        "different when using the Ziff-Davis corpus.",
        "Both systems perform significantly worse than the gold standard (α < 0.05).",
        "We next examine the degree to which the automatic evaluation measures correlate with human ratings.",
        "Table 6 shows the results of correlating the simple string accuracy (SSA) and relation F-score against compression judgements.",
        "The SSA does not correlate on both corpora with human judgements; it thus seems to be an unreliable measure of compression performance.",
        "However, the F-score correlates significantly with human ratings, yielding a correlation coefficient of r = 0.575 on the Ziff-Davis corpus and r = 0.532 on the Broadcast news.",
        "To get a feeling for the difficulty of the task, we assessed how well our participants agreed in their ratings using leave-one-out resam-pling (Weiss and Kulikowski 1991).",
        "The technique correlates the ratings of each participant with the mean ratings of all the other participants.",
        "The average agreement is r = 0.679 on the Ziff-Davis corpus and r = 0.746 on the Broadcast News corpus.",
        "This result indicates that F-score’s agreement with the human data is not far from the human upper bound."

        "In this paper we have provided a comparison between a supervised (constituent-based) and a minimally supervised (word-based) approach to sentence compression.",
        "Our results demonstrate that the word-based model performs equally well on spoken and written text.",
        "Since it does not rely heavily on training data, it can be easily extended to languages or domains for which parallel compression corpora are scarce.",
        "When no parallel corpora are available the parameters can be manually tuned to produce compressions.",
        "In contrast, the supervised decision-tree model is not particularly robust on spoken text, it is sensitive to the nature of the training data, and did not produce adequate compressions when trained on the human-authored Broadcast News corpus.",
        "A comparison of the automatically gathered Ziff-Davis corpus",
        "with the Broadcast News corpus revealed important differences between the two corpora and thus suggests that automatically created corpora may not reflect human compression performance.",
        "We have also assessed whether automatic evaluation measures can be used for the compression task.",
        "Our results show that grammatical relations-based F-score (Riezler et al.",
        "2003) correlates reliably with human judgements and could thus be used to measure compression performance automatically.",
        "For example, it could be used to assess progress during system development or for comparing across different systems and system configurations with much larger test sets than currently employed.",
        "In its current formulation, the only function driving compression in the word-based model is the language model.",
        "The word significance and SOV scores are designed to single out important words that the model should not drop.",
        "We have not yet considered any functions that encourage compression.",
        "Ideally these functions should be inspired from the underlying compression process.",
        "Finding such a mechanism is an avenue of future work.",
        "We would also like to enhance the word-based model with more linguistic knowledge; we plan to experiment with syntax-based language models and more richly annotated corpora.",
        "Another important future direction lies in applying the unsupervised model presented here to languages with more flexible word order and richer morphology than English (e.g., German, Czech).",
        "We suspect that these languages will prove challenging for creating grammatically acceptable compressions.",
        "Finally, our automatic evaluation experiments motivate the use of relations-based F-score as a means of directly optimising compression quality, much in the same way MT systems optimise model parameters using BLEU as a measure of translation quality."
