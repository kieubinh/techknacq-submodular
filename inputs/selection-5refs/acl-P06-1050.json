        "Consider the sentence from a news article: George W. Bush met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow.",
        "How long was the meeting?",
        "Our first reaction to this question might be that we have no idea.",
        "But in fact we do have an idea.",
        "We know the meeting was longer than 10 seconds and less than a year.",
        "How much tighter can we get the bounds to be?",
        "Most people would say the meeting lasted between an hour and three days.",
        "There is much temporal information in text that has hitherto been largely unexploited, encoded in the descriptions of events and relying on our knowledge of the range of usual durations of types of events.",
        "This paper describes one part of an exploration into how this information can be captured automatically.",
        "Specifically, we have developed annotation guidelines to minimize discrepant judgments and annotated 58 articles, comprising 2288 events; we have developed a method for measuring inter-annotator agreement when the judgments are intervals on a scale; and we have shown that machine learning techniques applied to the annotated data considerably outperform a baseline and approach human performance.",
        "This research is potentially very important in applications in which the time course of events is to be extracted from news.",
        "For example, whether two events overlap or are in sequence often depends very much on their durations.",
        "If a war started yesterday, we can be pretty sure it is still going on today.",
        "If a hurricane started last year, we can be sure it is over by now.",
        "The corpus that we have annotated currently contains all the 48 non-Wall-Street-Journal (non-WSJ) news articles (a total of 2132 event instances), as well as 10 WSJ articles (156 event instances), from the TimeBank corpus annotated in TimeML (Pustejovky et al., 2003).",
        "The non-WSJ articles (mainly political and disaster news) include both print and broadcast news that are from a variety of news sources, such as ABC, AP, and VOA.",
        "In the corpus, every event to be annotated was already identified in TimeBank.",
        "Annotators were instructed to provide lower and upper bounds on the duration of the event, encompassing 80% of the possibilities, excluding anomalous cases, and taking the entire context of the article into account.",
        "For example, here is the graphical output of the annotations (3 annotators) for the “finished” event (underlined) in the sentence After the victim, Linda Sanders, 35, had finished her cleaning and was waiting for her clothes to dry,...",
        "This graph shows that the first annotator believes that the event lasts for minutes whereas the second annotator believes it could only last for several seconds.",
        "The third annotates the event to range from a few seconds to a few minutes.",
        "A logarithmic scale is used for the output because of the intuition that the difference between 1 second and 20 seconds is significant, while the difference between 1 year 1 second and 1 year 20 seconds is negligible.",
        "A preliminary exercise in annotation revealed about a dozen classes of systematic discrepancies among annotators’ judgments.",
        "We thus developed guidelines to make annotators aware of these cases and to guide them in making the judgments.",
        "For example, many occurrences of verbs and other event descriptors refer to multiple events, especially but not exclusively if the subject or object of the verb is plural.",
        "In “Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles”, there is the time it takes to destroy one missile and the duration of the interval in which all the individual events are situated – the time it takes to destroy all its missiles.",
        "Initially, there were wide discrepancies because some annotators would annotate one value, others the other.",
        "Annotators are now instructed to make judgments on both values in this case.",
        "The use of the annotation guidelines resulted in about 10% improvement in inter-annotator agreement (Pan et al., 2006), measured as described in Section 2.",
        "There is a residual of gross discrepancies in annotators’ judgments that result from differences of opinion, for example, about how long a government policy is typically in effect.",
        "But the number of these discrepancies was surprisingly small.",
        "The method and guidelines for annotation are described in much greater detail in (Pan et al., 2006).",
        "In the current paper, we focus on how inter-annotator agreement is measured, in Section 2, and in Sections 3-5 on the machine learning experiments.",
        "Because the annotated corpus is still fairly small, we cannot hope to learn to make fine-grained judgments of event durations that are currently annotated in the corpus, but as we demonstrate, it is possible to learn useful coarse-grained judgments.",
        "Although there has been much work on temporal anchoring and event ordering in text (Hitzeman et al., 1995; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001; Boguraev and Ando, 2005), to our knowledge, there has been no serious published empirical effort to model and learn vague and implicit duration information in natural language, such as the typical durations of events, and to perform reasoning over this information.",
        "(Cyc apparently has some fuzzy duration information, although it is not generally available; Rieger (1974) discusses the issue for less than a page; there has been work in fuzzy logic on representing and reasoning with imprecise durations (Godo and Vila, 1995; Fortemps, 1997), but these make no attempt to collect human judgments on such durations or learn to extract them automatically from texts.)"

        "In the literature on the kappa statistic, most authors address only category data; some can handle more general data, such as data in interval scales or ratio scales.",
        "However, none of the techniques directly apply to our data, which are ranges of durations from a lower bound to an upper bound.",
        "In fact, what coders were instructed to annotate for a given event is not just a range, but a duration distribution for the event, where the area between the lower bound and the upper bound covers about 80% of the entire distribution area.",
        "Since it’s natural to assume the most likely duration for such distribution is its mean (average) duration, and the distribution flattens out toward the upper and lower bounds, we use the normal or Gaussian distribution to model our duration distributions.",

        "Thus, the baseline will be an annotator who knows the global distribution and annotates in accordance with it, but does not read the specific article being annotated.",

        "In the research described in this paper, we have addressed a problem -- extracting information about event durations encoded in event descriptions -- that has heretofore received very little attention in the field.",
        "It is information that can have a substantial impact on applications where the temporal placement of events is important.",
        "Moreover, it is representative of a set of problems – making use of the vague information in text – that has largely eluded empirical approaches in the past.",
        "In (Pan et al., 2006), we explicate the linguistic categories of the phenomena that give rise to grossly discrepant judgments among annotators, and give guidelines on resolving these discrepancies.",
        "In the present paper, we describe a method for measuring inter-annotator agreement when the judgments are intervals on a scale; this should extend from time to other scalar judgments.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement is too low on fine-grained judgments.",
        "However, for the coarse-grained judgments of more than or less than a day, and of approximate agreement on temporal unit, human agreement is acceptably high.",
        "For these cases, we have shown that machine-learning techniques achieve impressive results."
