        "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in such applications that deal with opinions (a.k.a.",
        "sentiment, reputation etc.).",
        "For instance, Mori-naga et al.",
        "developed a system that extracts and analyzes reputations on the Internet (Morinaga et al., 2002).",
        "Pang et al.",
        "proposed a method of classifying movie reviews into positive and negative ones (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "In these applications, one of the most important issue is how to determine the polarity (or semantic orientation) of a given text.",
        "In other words, it is necessary to decide whether a given text conveys positive or negative content.",
        "In order to solve this problem, we intend to take statistical approach.",
        "More specifically, we plan to learn the polarity of texts from a corpus in which phrases, sentences or documents are tagged with labels expressing the polarity (polarity-tagged corpus).",
        "So far, this approach has been taken by a lot of researchers (Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "In these previous works, polarity-tagged corpus was built in either of the following two ways.",
        "It is built manually, or created from review sites such as AMAZON.COM.",
        "In some review sites, the review is associated with meta-data indicating its polarity.",
        "Those reviews can be used as polarity-tagged corpus.",
        "In case of AMA-ZON.COM, the review’s polarity is represented by using 5-star scale.",
        "However, both of the two approaches are not appropriate for building large polarity-tagged corpus.",
        "Since manual construction of tagged corpus is time-consuming and expensive, it is difficult to build large polarity-tagged corpus.",
        "The method that relies on review sites can not be applied to domains in which large amount of reviews are not available.",
        "In addition, the corpus created from reviews is often noisy as we discuss in Section 2.",
        "This paper proposes a novel method of building polarity-tagged corpus from HTML documents.",
        "The idea behind our method is to utilize certain layout structures and linguistic pattern.",
        "By using them, we can automatically extract sentences that express opinion (opinion sentences) from HTML documents.",
        "Because this method is fully automatic and can be applied to arbitrary HTML documents, it does not suffer from the same problems as the previous methods.",
        "In the experiment, we could construct a corpus consisting of 126,610 sentences.",
        "To validate the quality of the corpus, two human judges assessed a part of the corpus and found that 92% opinion sentences are appropriate ones.",
        "Furthermore, we applied our corpus to opinion sentence classification task.",
        "Naive Bayes classifier was trained on our corpus and tested on three data sets.",

        "It is important to discuss the reason that we intend to build a corpus tagged at sentence level rather than document level.",
        "The reason is that one document often includes both positive and negative sentences, and hence it is difficult to learn the polarity from the corpus tagged at document level.",
        "Consider the following example (Pang et al., 2002): This film should be brilliant.",
        "It sounds like a great plot, the actors are first grade, and the supporting cast is good as well, and Stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance.",
        "However, it can’t hold up.",

        "We would like to point out that polarity-tagged corpus created from reviews prone to be tagged at document-level.",
