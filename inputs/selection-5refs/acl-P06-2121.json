        "Such life events play an important role in triggering depressive symptoms, such as depressed mood, suicide attempts, and anxiety.",
        "Therefore, it is desired to develop a system capable of identifying negative life events to provide more effective psychiatric services.",
        "For example, through the negative life events, the health professionals can know the background information about subjects so as to make more correct decisions and suggestions.",
        "Negative life events are often expressed in natural language segments (e.g., sentences).",
        "To identify them, the critical step is to transform the segments into machine-interpretable semantic representation.",
        "This involves the extraction of key semantic patterns from the segments.",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "Two years ago, I lost my parents.",
        "(Event) Since that, I have attempted to kill myself several times.",
        "(Suicide) In this example, the semantic pattern <lost, par-ents> is constituted by two words, which indicates that the subject suffered from a negative life event that triggered the symptom “Suicide”.",
        "A semantic pattern can be considered as a semantically plausible combination of k words, where k is the length of the pattern.",
        "Accordingly, a semantic pattern may have variable length.",
        "In Wu et al.’s study (2005), they have presented a methodology to identify depressive symptoms.",
        "In this work, we go a further step to devise a text mining framework for variable-length semantic pattern induction from psychiatry web resources.",
        "Traditional approaches to semantic pattern induction can be generally divided into two streams: knowledge-based approaches and corpus-based approaches (Lehnert et al., 1992; Muslea, 1999).",
        "Knowledge-based approaches rely on exploiting expert knowledge to design handcrafted semantic patterns.",
        "The major limitations of such approaches include the requirement of significant time and effort on designing the handcrafted patterns.",
        "Besides, when applying to a new domain, these patterns have to be redesigned.",
        "Such limitations form a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "A possible solution to reducing the problem is to use a general-purpose ontology",
        "such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), or a domain-specific ontology constructed using automatic approaches (Yeh et al., 2004).",
        "These ontologies contain rich concepts and inter-concept relations such as hypernymy-hyponymy relations.",
        "However, an ontology is a static knowledge resource, which may not reflect the dynamic characteristics of language.",
        "For this consideration, we instead refer to the web resources, or more restrictedly, the psychiatry web resources as our knowledge resource.",
        "Corpus-based approaches can automatically learn semantic patterns from domain corpora by applying statistical methods.",
        "The corpora have to be annotated with domain-specific knowledge (e.g., events).",
        "Then, various statistical methods can be applied to induce variable-length semantic patterns from all possible combinations of words in the corpora.",
        "However, statistical methods may suffer from data sparseness problem, thus they require large corpora with annotated information to obtain more reliable parameters.",
        "For some application domains, such annotated corpora may be unavailable.",
        "Therefore, we propose the use of web resources as the corpora.",
        "When facing with the web corpora, traditional corpus-based approaches may be infeasible.",
        "For example, it is impractical for health professionals to annotate the whole web corpora.",
        "Besides, it is also impractical to enumerate all possible combinations of words from the web corpora, and then search for the semantic patterns.",
        "To address the problems, we take the notion of weakly supervised (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) or unsupervised learning (Hasegawa, 2004; Grenager et al., 2005) to develop a framework able to bootstrap with a small set of seed patterns, and then induce more relevant patterns form the unannotated psychiatry web corpora.",
        "By this way, the reliance on annotated corpora can be significantly reduced.",
        "The proposed framework is divided into two parts: Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL) model (Burgess et al., 1998; Bai et al., 2005), and a cascaded induction process (CIP).",
        "The HAL model, which is a cognitive motivated model, provides an informative infrastructure to make the CIP capable of learning from unannotated corpora.",
        "The CIP treats the variable-length induction task as a cascaded process.",
        "That is, it first induces the semantic patterns of length two, then length three, and so on.",
        "In each stage, the CIP initializes the set of semantic patterns to be induced based on the better results of the previous stage, rather than enumerating all possible combinations of words.",
        "This would be helpful to avoid noisy patterns propagating to the next stage, and the search space can also be reduced.",
        "A crucial step for semantic pattern induction is the representation of words as well as combinations of words.",
        "The HAL model constructs a high-dimensional context space for the psychiatry web corpora.",
        "Each word in the HAL space is represented as a vector of its context words, which means that the sense of a word can be inferred through its contexts.",
        "Such notion is derived from the observation of human behavior.",
        "That is, when an unknown word occurs, human beings may determine its sense by referring to the words appearing in the contexts.",
        "Based on the cognitive behavior, if two words share more common contexts, they are more semantically similar.",
        "To further represent a semantic pattern, the HAL model provides a mechanism to combine its constituent words over the HAL space.",
        "Once the HAL space is constructed, the CIP takes as input a seed pattern per run, and in turn induces the semantic patterns of different lengths.",
        "For each length, the CIP first creates the initial set based on the results of the previous stage.",
        "Then, the induction process is iteratively performed to induce more patterns relevant to the given seed pattern by comparing their context distributions.",
        "In addition, we also incorporate expert knowledge to guide the induction process by using relevance feedback (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), the most popular query reformulation strategy in the information retrieval (IR) community.",

        "where P(w1,...wk) is the probability of the k words co-occurring in a sentence in the training set, and P(wi) is the probability of a single word occurring in the training set.",
        "Higher mutual information indicates that the k words are more likely to form a semantic pattern of length k. Here the length k also ranges from 2 to 4.",
        "For each k, we compute the mutual information for all possible combinations of words in the training set, and those with their mutual information above a threshold are selected to be the final results of the semantic patterns, denoted as SPM,.",
        "In order to obtain reliable mutual information values, only words with at least the minimum number of occurrences (>5) are considered.",
        "To examine the coverage of SPC,P and SPM, on real data, 15 human subjects are involved in creating a test set.",
        "The subjects provide their experienced negative life events in the form of natural language sentences.",
        "A total of 69 sentences are collected to be the test set, of which 39 sentences contain a semantic pattern of length two, 21 sentences contain a semantic pattern of length three, and 9 sentences contain a semantic pattern of length four.",
        "The evaluation metric used is out-of-pattern (OOP) rate, a ratio of unseen patterns occurring in the test set.",
        "Thus, the OOP can be defined as the number of test sentences containing the semantic patterns not occurring in the training set, divided by the total number of sentences in the test set.",
        "Table 4 presents the results.",
        "The results show that the OOP of SPMI is higher than that of SPCIP .",
        "The main reason is the lack of a large enough domain corpus with annotated life events.",
        "In this circumstance, many semantic patterns, especially for those with a larger length, could not be learned, because the number of their occurrences would be very rare in the training set.",
        "With no doubt, one could collect a large amount of domain corpus to reduce the OOP rate.",
        "However, increasing the amount of domain corpus also increases the amount of annotation and computation complexity.",
        "Our approach, instead, exploits the quality concepts to reduce the search space, also applies the relevance feedback to guide the induction process, thus it can achieve better results with time-limited constraints."
