        "The task of syntactic parsing is valuable to most natural language understanding applications, e.g., anaphora resolution, machine translation, or question answering.",
        "Syntactic parsing in its most general definition may be viewed as discovering the underlying syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "The specificities include the types of elements and relations that are retrieved by the parsing process and the way in which they are represented.",
        "For example, Treebank-style parsers retrieve a bracketed form that encodes a hierarchical organization (tree) of smaller elements (called phrases), while Grammatical-Relations(GR)-style parsers explicitly output relations together with elements involved in the relation (subj(John,walk)).",
        "The present paper presents an evaluation of parsers for the Coh-Metrix project (Graesser et al., 2004) at the Institute for Intelligent Systems of the University of Memphis.",
        "Coh-Metrix is a text-processing tool that provides new methods of automatically assessing text cohesion, readability, and difficulty.",
        "In its present form, v1.1, few cohesion measures are based on syntactic information, but its next incarnation, v2.0, will depend more heavily on hierarchical syntactic information.",
        "We are developing these measures.",
        "Thus, our current goal is to provide the most reliable parser output available for them, while still being able to process larger texts in real time.",
        "The usual trade-off between accuracy and speed has to be taken into account.",
        "In the first part of the evaluation, we adopt a constituent-based approach for evaluation, as the output parses are all derived in one way or another from the same data and generate similar, bracketed output.",
        "The major goal is to consistently evaluate the freely available state-of-the-art parsers on a standard data set and across genre on corpora typical for learning technology environments.",
        "We report parsers’ competitiveness along an array of dimensions including performance, robustness, tagging facility, stability, and length of input they can handle.",
        "Next, we briefly address particular types of misparses and mistags in their relation to measures planned for Coh-Metrix 2.0 and assumed to be typical for learning technology applications.",
        "Coh-Metrix 2.0 measures that centrally rely on good parses include: causal and intentional cohesion, for which the main verb and its subject must be identified;",
        "anaphora resolution, for which the syntactic relations of pronoun and referent must be identified; temporal cohesion, for which the main verb and its tense/aspect must be identified.",
        "These measures require complex algorithms operating on the cleanest possible sentence parse, as a faulty parse will lead to a cascading error effect."

        "While the purpose of this work is not to propose a taxonomy of all available parsers, we consider it necessary to offer a brief overview of the various parser dimensions.",
        "Parsers can be classified according to their general approach (hand-built-grammar-based versus statistical), the way rules in parses are built (selective vs. generative), the parsing algorithm they use (LR, chart parser, etc.",
        "), type of grammar (unification-based grammars, context-free grammars, lexicalized context-free grammars, etc.",
        "), the representation of the output (bracketed, list of relations, etc.",
        "), and the type of output itself (phrases vs grammatical relations).",
        "Of particular interest to our work are Treebank-style parsers, i.e., parsers producing an output conforming to the Penn Treebank (PTB) annotation guidelines.",
        "The PTB project defined a tag set and bracketed form to represent syntactic trees that became a standard for parsers developed/trained on PTB.",
        "It also produced a treebank, a collection of hand-annotated texts with syntactic information.",
        "Given the large number of dimensions along which parsers can be distinguished, an evaluation framework that would provide both parser-specific (to understand the strength of different technologies) and parser-independent (to be able to compare different parsers) performance figures is desirable and commonly used in the literature."

      "heading": "1.2 General Parser Evaluation Methods",
      "text": [
        "Evaluation methods can be broadly divided into non-corpus-and corpus-based methods with the latter subdivided into unannotated and annotated corpus-based methods (Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "The non-corpus method simply lists linguistic constructions covered by the parser/grammar.",
        "It is well-suited for hand-built grammars because during the construction phase the covered cases can be recorded.",
        "However, it has problems with capturing complexities occuring from the interaction of covered cases.",
        "The most widely used corpus-based evaluation methods are: (1) the constituent-based (phrase structure) method, and (2) the dependency/GR-based method.",
        "The former has its roots in the Grammar Evaluation Interest Group (GEIG) scheme (Grishman et al., 1992) developed to compare parsers with different underlying grammatical formalisms.",
        "It promoted the use of phrase-structure bracketed information and defined Precision, Recall, and Crossing Brackets measures.",
        "The GEIG measures were extended later to constituent information (bracketing information plus label) and have since become the standard for reporting automated syntactic parsing performance.",
        "Among the advantages of constituent-based evaluation are generality (less parser specificity) and fine grain size of the measures.",
        "On the other hand, the measures of the method are weaker than exact sentence measures (full identity), and it is not clear if they properly measure how well a parser identifies the true structure of a sentence.",
        "Many phrase boundary mismatches spawn from differences between parsers/grammars and corpus annotation schemes (Lin, 1995).",
        "Usually, treebanks are constructed with respect to informal guidelines.",
        "Annotators often interpret them differently leading to a large number of different structural configurations.",
        "There are two major approaches to evaluate parsers using the constituent-based method.",
        "On the one hand, there is the expert-only approach in which an expert looks at the output of a parser, counts errors, and reports different measures.",
        "We use a variant of this approach for the directed parser evaluation (see next section).",
        "Using a gold standard, on the other hand, is a method that can be automated to a higher degree.",
        "It replaces the counting part of the former method with a software system that compares the output of the parser to the gold standard,",
        "highly accurate data, manually parsed – or automatically parsed and manually corrected – by human experts.",
        "The latter approach is more useful for scaling up evaluations to large collections of data while the expert-only approach is more flexible, allowing for evaluation of parsers from new perspectives and with a view to special applications, e.g., in learning technology environments.",
        "In the first part of this work we use the gold standard approach for parser evaluation.",
        "The evaluation is done from two different points of view.",
        "First, we offer a uniform evaluation for the parsers on section 23 from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of PTB, the community norm for reporting parser performance.",
        "The goal of this first evaluation is to offer a good estimation of the parsers when evaluated in identical environments (same configuration parameters for the evaluator software).",
        "We also observe the following features which are extremely important for using the parsers in large-scale text processing and to embed them as components in larger systems.",
        "Self-tagging: whether or not the parser does tagging itself.",
        "It is advantageous to take in raw text since it eliminates the need for extra modules.",
        "Performance: if the performance is in the mid and upper 80th percentiles.",
        "Long sentences: the ability of the parser to handle sentences longer than 40 words.",
        "Robustness: relates to the property of a parser to handle any type of input sentence and return a reasonable output for it and not an empty line or some other useless output.",
        "Second, we evaluate the parsers on narrative and expository texts to study their performance across the two genres.",
        "This second evaluation step will provide additional important results for learning technology projects.",
        "We use evalb (http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/) to evaluate the bracketing performance of the output of a parser against a gold standard.",

        "One: There was one minor problem, e.g., a mis-labeled terminal or a wrong scope of an adverbial or prepositional phrase (wrong attachment site) that did not affect the overall parse of the sentence, which is therefore still usable for Coh-Metrix 2.0 measures.",
