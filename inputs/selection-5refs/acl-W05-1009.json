        "This paper fits into a broader effort addressing the automatic acquisition of semantic classes for Catalan adjectives.",
        "So far, no established standard of such semantic classes is available in theoretical or empirical linguistic research.",
        "Our aim is to reach a classification that is empirically adequate and theoretically sound, and we use computational techniques as a means to explore large amounts of data which would be impossible to explore by hand to help us define and characterise the classification.",
        "In previous research (Boleda et al., 2004), we developed a three-way classification according to generally accepted adjective properties (see Section 2),",
        "and applied a cluster analysis to further examine the classes.",
        "While the cluster analysis confirmed our classification to a large extent, it was clear that one of the classes needed further exploration.",
        "Also, we used only syntactic features modelled as pairs of POS-bigrams; we explored neither other syntactic features nor the role of morphological evidence for the classification.",
        "In this paper we apply a supervised classification technique, decision trees, for exploratory data analysis.",
        "Our aim is to explore the linguistic features and description levels that are relevant for the semantic classification, focusing on morphology and syntax.",
        "We check how far we get with morphological information, and whether syntax is helpful to overcome the ceiling reached with morphology.",
        "Decision trees are appropriate for our task, to test and compare sets of features, based on our gold standard.",
        "They are also known for their easy interpretation, by reading feature combinations off the tree paths.",
        "This property will help us get insight into relevant characteristics of our adjective classes, and in the error analysis.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the adjective classification and the gold standard used for the experiments.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 explore the morphology-semantics interface and the syntax-semantics interface with respect to the classification proposed, and Section 5 focuses on the differences in the kind of information each level provides for the classification.",
        "Sections 6 and 7 are devoted to discussion of related work and conclusions."

        "To date, no semantic classification of adjectives is generally accepted in theoretical linguistics.",
        "Much research in formal semantics has focused on entailment properties , while other kinds of lexical semantic properties are left uncovered.",
        "Standard descriptive grammars propose broader classifications (see Picallo (2002) for Catalan), but these usually do not follow a single classification parameter: they mix morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria and end up with classifications that are not consistent.",
        "We are interested in properties of the lexical semantics of adjectives that have a bearing on their syntactic behaviour.",
        "This property makes the semantic distinctions traceable at another linguistic level, which is desirable to ensure falsability of the classification criteria.",
        "On more practical terms, it also allows the exploitation of the syntax-semantics interface as is usual in Lexical Acquisition, to automate the acquisition of the relevant classes.",
        "Our proposal is largely inspired by the Ontological Semantics framework (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995).",
        "The assumption of an ontology as a model of the world allows us to distinguish linguistic aspects (e.g. syntactic properties) from the actual content of the lexical entries, formalised as a link to an element the ontology.",
        "We assume an ontology of basic denotations composed of properties (or attributes), objects (or entities), and events.",
        "Adjectives participate in each of these possible denotations, and can be basic, object-related or event-related, depending on their lexical meaning.1 We next characterise each class.",
        "Basic adjectives are the prototypical adjectives, which denote attributes or properties which cannot be decomposed (bonic ‘beautiful’, sòlid ‘solid’).",
        "Event adjectives have an event component in their meaning.",
        "For instance, if something is tangible (‘tangible’), then it can be touched: tangible necessarily evokes a potential event of touching which is embedded in the meaning of the adjective.",
        "Other examples are alterat (‘altered’) and ofensiu (‘offensive’).",
        "Similarly, object adjectives have an embed",
        "ded object component in their meaning: deformació nasal (‘nasal deformity’) can be paraphrased as deformity that affects the nose, so that nasal evokes the object nose.",
        "Other examples are peninsular (‘peninsular’) and sociolingüístic (‘sociolinguistic’).",
        "This proposal shares many aspects with discussions in descriptive grammar (2002) and proposals in other lexical resources, such as WordNet (Miller, 1998).",
        "In particular, the distinction between prototypical, attribute-denoting adjectives and object-related adjectives is found both in descriptive grammar and in WordNet.",
        "As for event-related adjectives, they are not usually found as a class in Romance descriptive grammar, and in WordNet they are distinguished but only if they are participial; other kinds of deverbal adjectives are considered basic (in our terminology).",
        "More on the morphology-semantics relationship in Section 3.",
        "Our classification focuses on the semantic content of adjectives, rather than on formal properties such as entailment patterns (contrary to the tradition in formal semantics).",
        "The semantic distinctions proposed have an effect on the syntactic distribution of adjectives, as will be shown throughout the paper, and can be exploited in low-level NLP tasks (POS-tagging), and also in more demanding tasks, such as paraphrase detection and generation (e.g. exploiting the relationship tangible – * can be touched, or deformació nasal – * deformity affecting the nose)."

        "), not on phrase structure.",

        "One of these cases would be the adjective puntual, a de-nominal adjective (derived from punt, ‘point’).",
        "Its most frequent sense is ‘punctual’ as in ‘I expect Mary to be punctual for this meeting’.",
        "This is a basic meaning, noncompositional in the sense that it cannot be predicted from the meaning of the originating noun in combination with the suffix.",
        "The adjective has a compositional sense, namely, ‘related to a point’ (usually, a point in time), as in això va ser un esdeveniment puntual, ‘this was a once-occuring event’.",
        "This is the meaning we would expect from the derivation punt (‘point’) + al, and is an object meaning.",
        "In this case, the judge should assign the adjective to two classes, primary basic, secondary object.",
        "Compositional meanings are thus those corresponding to active morphological processes, and can be predicted from the meaning of the noun and the derivation with the suffix (be it de-nominal, deverbal or participial).",
        "The judges had an acceptable 0.74 mean K agreement (Carletta, 1996) for the assignment of the primary class, but a meaningless 0.21 for the secondary class (they did not even agree on which lemmata were polysemous).",
        "As a reaction to the low agreement about polysemy, we incorporated polysemy information from a Catalan dictionary (DLC, 1993).",
        "This information was incorporated only in addition to the gathered gold standard: In many cases the dictionary only lists the compositional sense.",

        "This fact is reflected in the low recall score for basic adjectives (0.45), and in precision being much lower than recall for the other two classes (0.64 vs. 1 for event, 0.67 vs. 0.91 for object adjectives).",
        "The mismatches usually correspond to polysemy due to noncompositional senses of the adjectives, such as the denominal adjective puntual discussed above.",
        "Another case is the participial abatut, which compositionally means ‘shot-down’, but is most frequently used as a synonym to ‘depressed, downcast’, and therefore is classified as basic.",

        "Sometimes the compositional meaning is completely lost, as with most deverbal adjectives classified as basic.",
        "In some cases the underlying verb no longer exists in Catalan (horrible-*horrir, compatible-*compatir), and they are not perceived as derived.4 In other cases, although the verb exists, it is a stative predicate (e.g. iestable, ‘unstable’, from estar ‘stand/be’; pudent ‘stinking’, from pudir, ‘stink’), and thus are much more similar to basic adjectives than deverbal adjectives deriving from dynamic predicates, such as ofensiu (‘offensive’).",
        "As-pectuality of the deriving verb is a factor that has to be examined more carefully in the future.",
        "To summarise, the results for the morphology-semantics mapping indicate that there is a clear relationship between these two levels: Morphology does most of the job right, because each morphological rule has an associated semantic operation.",

        "If we compare the mistakes made by each mapping, both morphology and syntax assign the expected class to 103 lemmata (55.4% of the gold standard), and both coincide in assigning a wrong class for 21 (11.3%).",
        "The cases where one mapping achieves the right classification and the other one makes a mistake are reflected in Tables 5 and 6.",
        "Cases where morphology achieves the right class and syntax does not (Table 6) do not present a very clear pattern, although the basic-event confusion in were so due to their bearing complements, a parameter orthogonal to the targeted classification.",
        "syntax is indeed reflected as the most numerous in Table 5 (6+7 cases).",
        "In absence of a syntactic characterisation of the class, applying the default mapping will yield better results.",
        "As for the cases where syntax classifies correctly and morphology does not (Table 6), they do present a clear pattern: They correspond, as expected, to deverbal (8), participial (2) and denominal (17) adjectives with a meaning that does not correspond to the morphological rule.",
        "Among denominals, examples are elemental and horrorós (‘elementary’ and ‘horrifying’); among deverbals, raonable and present (‘reasonable’ and ‘present’); among participials, in-nat and inesperat (‘innate’ and ’unexpected’).",
        "Note that syntax is most helpful in the identification of basic denominal adjectives (17 cases), providing support for the hypothesis that adjectives with a noncompositional meaning behave in the syntax as basic adjectives, which can be exploited in a lexical acquisition setting.",
        "In contrast, event and basic classes not having a clearly distinct syntactic distribution, the syntactic features do not help in telling these two classes apart.",
        "This problem accounts for the little overall accuracy improvement from morphology (70.1%) to syntax (73.8%): It improves the object vs. basic distinction, but it does not consistently improve the event vs. basic distinction."

        "The next logical step in building a better classifier for adjectives is to use both morphological and syntactic function information.",

        "In recent years much research (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003) has aimed at exploiting the syntax-semantics interface for classification tasks, mostly based on verbs.",
        "In particular, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) present a classification experiment which bears similarities to ours.",
        "They use decision trees to classify intransitive English verbs into three semantic classes: unergatives, unaccusatives, and object-drop.",
        "As in our experiments, they define three classes, and use only 60 verbs for the experiments.",
        "Merlo and Stevenson identify linguistic features referring to verb argument structure (crucially involving thematic relations), and classify the verbs into the three classes with an accuracy of 69.8%.",
        "They compare their results with a random baseline of 33%.",
        "There has been much less research in Lexical Acquisition for adjectives.",

        "(2002) used bootstrapping to assign German adjectives to “functional” classes (of a more traditional sort, based on a German descriptive grammar).",
        "They relied on ordering restrictions and coordination data which can be adapted to Catalan.",

        "They manually classified the adjectival uses of the homographs into six syntactic classes with characteristics used in our classification (predicative uses, position with respect to the head noun, etc.).",
        "They used that information to build finite state transducers aimed at determinining the POS of the homographs in each context, with a high accuracy (99.3%) and coverage (94%).",

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have presented and discussed the role of two sources of evidence for the automatic classification of adjectives into ontological semantic classes: morphology and syntax.",
        "Both levels provide relevant information, as indicated by their respective accuracy results (70.1% for morphology, 73.8% for syntax), both well above a majority baseline (46.8%).",
        "Morphology fails in cases of noncompositional meaning, when the relationship to the deriving word has been lost, cases that syntax tends to correctly classify.",
        "In contrast, syntax systematically confuses event and basic adjectives due to the lack of a sufficiently distinct syntactic profile of the event class.",
        "Therefore, the default morphology-semantics mapping handles these cases better.",
        "Not suprisingly, the best classifier is obtained combining both kinds of information (74.7%), although it is not even 1% better than the syntactic classifier.",
        "More research is needed to achieve better ways of combining both levels of description.",
        "We can summarise our results as indicating that morphology can give a reliable initial hypothesis with respect to the semantic class of an adjective, which syntax can refine in cases of noncompositional meaning, particularly for object adjectives.",
        "Therefore, morphology can be used as a baseline in future classification experiments.",
        "The experiments presented in this paper also shed light on the characteristics of each class.",
        "In particular, we have shown that event adjectives do not have a homogeneous and distinct syntactic profile.",
        "One factor to take into account is that the morphological variability within the class (suffixes -ble, iu, nt,",
        "participles) is associated with a high semantic variability.",
        "This semantic variability is not found in the object class, where the several suffixes (al, ic, à, etc.)",
        "all have a similar semantic effect.",
        "Another factor which seems to play a role, and which has been identified in the error analysis, is the aspectuality of the deriving verb, particularly whether it is stative or dynamic.",
        "In the near future, we intend to use the best classifier to automatically classify more adjectives of our database, so as to allow further exploration of the data and a clearer definition of the class.",
        "A major issue we leave for future research is polysemy detection.",
        "Up to now, we have only aimed at single-class classification, and not attempted to capture multiple uses of an adjective.",
        "E.g. the approach in Bohnet et al.",
        "(2002) could be adapted to Catalan: We can use data on coordination and ordering for polysemy detection, once the class of the most frequent sense is established with the methodology explained in this paper.",
        "Finally, the results presented in this paper seem to point in a fruitful direction for the study of adjective semantics: Adjectives that are flexibly used, those that fully exploit the syntactic possibilities of the language (in Catalan, being used predicatively and as epithets), tend to correspond to adjectives with a basic meaning, that is, tend to be viewed as a compact attribute, as a prototypical adjective.",
        "In contrast, derived adjectives which retain much of the semantic link to the noun or verb from which they derive do not behave like prototypical adjectives, are tied to certain positions, and do not exhibit the full range of syntactic possibilities of adjectives as a class.",
        "We intend to explore the consequences of this hypothesis in more detail in the future."
