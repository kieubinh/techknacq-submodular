        "Phrase-based approaches (Och and Ney, 2004) to statistical machine translation (SMT) have recently achieved impressive results, leading to significant improvements in accuracy over the original IBM models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "However, phrase-based models lack a direct representation of syntactic information in the source or target languages; this has prompted several researchers to consider various approaches that make use of syntactic information.",
        "This paper describes a framework for tree-to-tree based statistical translation.",
        "Our goal is to learn a model that maps parse trees in the source language to parse trees in the target language.",
        "The model is learned from a corpus of translation pairs, where each sentence in the source or target language has an associated parse tree.",
        "We see two major benefits of tree-to-tree based translation.",
        "First, it is possible to explicitly model the syntax of the target language, thereby improving grammaticality.",
        "Second, we can build a detailed model of the correspondence between the source and target parse trees, with the aim of constructing translations that preserve the meaning of source language sentences.",
        "Our translation framework involves a process where the target-language parse tree is broken down into a sequence of clauses, and each clause is then translated separately.",
        "A central concept we introduce in the translation of clauses is that of an aligned extended projection (AEP).",
        "AEPs are derived from the concept of an extended projection in lexicalized tree adjoining grammars (LTAG) (Frank, 2002), with the addition of alignment information that is based on work in synchronous LTAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1990).",
        "A key contribution of this paper is a method for learning to map German clauses to AEPs using a feature-based model with a perceptron learning algorithm.",
        "We performed experiments on translation from German to English on the Europarl data set.",
        "Evaluation in terms of both BLEU scores and human judgments shows that our system performs similarly to the phrase-based model of Koehn et al.",

        "For this example we take the desired translation to be we know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers.",
        "Translation of a German sentence proceeds in the following four steps: Step 1: The German sentence is parsed and then broken down into separate parse structures for a sequence of clauses.",
        "For example, the German example above is broken into a parse structure for the clause wir wissen followed by a parse structure for the subordinate clause daß ... war.",
        "Each of these clauses is then translated separately, using steps 2–3 below.",
        "Step 2: An aligned extended projection (AEP) is predicted for each German clause.",
        "To illustrate this step, consider translation of the second German clause, which has the following parse structure:",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Note that we use the symbols 1 and 2 to identify the two modifiers (arguments or adjuncts) in the clause, in this case a subject and an object.",
        "A major part of the AEP is a parse-tree fragment, that is similar to a TAG elementary tree (see also Figure 2): has V NP been Following the work of Frank (2002), we will refer to a structure like this as an extended projection (EP).",
        "The EP encapsulates the core syntactic structure in the English clause.",
        "It contains the main verb been, as well as the function words that and has.",
        "It also contains a parse tree “spine” which has the main verb been as one of its leaves, and has the clause label SBAR as its root.",
        "In addition, it specifies positions for arguments in the clause – in this case NPs corresponding to the subject and object.",
        "An AEP contains an EP, as well as alignment information about where the German modifiers should be placed in the extended projection.",
        "For example, the AEP in this case would contain the tree fragment shown above, together with an alignment specifying that the modifiers 1 and 2 from the German parse will appear in the EP as subject and object, respectively.",
        "Step 3: The German modifiers are translated and placed in the appropriate positions within the AEP.",
        "For example, the modifiers das haupthemmnis and der vorhersehbare widerstand der hersteller would be translated as the main obstacle, and the predictable resistance of manufacturers, respectively, and then placed into the subject and object positions in the AEP.",
        "Step 4: The individual clause translations are combined to give a final translation.",
        "For example, the translations we know and that the main obstacle has been ... would be concatenated to give we know that the main obstacle has been ....",
        "The main focus of this paper will be Step 2: the prediction of AEPs from German clauses.",
        "AEPs are detailed structural objects, and their relationship to the source-language clause can be quite complex.",
        "We use a discriminative feature-based model, trained with the perceptron algorithm, to incrementally predict the AEP in a sequence of steps.",
        "At each step we define features that allow the model to capture a wide variety of dependencies within the AEP itself, or between the AEP and the source-language clause."

      "heading": "1.2 Motivation for the Approach",
      "text": [
        "Our approach to tree-to-tree translation is motivated by several observations.",
        "Breaking the source-language tree into clauses (Step 1) considerably simplifies the difficult problem of defining an alignment between source and target trees.",
        "Our impression is that high-quality translations can be produced in a clause-by-clause fashion.",
        "The use of a feature-based model for AEP prediction (Step 2) allows us to capture complex syntactic correspondences between English and German, as well as grammaticality constraints on the English side.",
        "In this paper, we implement the translation of modifiers (Step 3) with the phrase-based system of Koehn et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The modifiers in our data set are generally small chunks of text such as NPs, PPs, and ADJPs, which by definition do not include clauses or verbs.",
        "In our approach, we use the phrase-based system to generate n-best lists of candidate translations and then rerank the translations based on grammaticality, i.e., using criteria that judge how well they fit the position in the AEP.",
        "In future work, we might use finite state machines in place of a reranking approach, or recursively apply the AEP approach to the modifiers.",
        "Stitching translated clauses back together (Step 4) is a relatively simple task: in a substantial majority of cases, the German clauses are not embedded, but instead form a linear sequence that accounts for the entire sentence.",
        "In these cases we can simply concatenate the English clause translations to form the full translation.",
        "Embedded clauses in German are slightly more complicated, but it is not difficult to form embedded structures in the English translations.",
        "Section 5.2 of this paper describes the features",
        "we use for AEP prediction in translation from German to English.",
        "Many of the features of the AEP prediction model are specifically tuned to the choice of German and English as the source and target languages.",
        "However, it should be easy to develop new feature sets to deal with other languages or treebanking styles.",
        "We see this as one of the strengths of the feature-based approach.",
        "In the work presented in this paper, we focus on the prediction of clausal AEPs, i.e., AEPs associated with main verbs.",
        "One reason for this is that clause structures are particularly rich and complex from a syntactic perspective.",
        "This means that there should be considerable potential in improving translation quality if we can accurately predict these structures.",
        "It also means that clause-level AEPs are a good test-bed for the discriminative approach to AEP prediction; future work may consider applying these methods to other structures such as NPs, PPs, ADJPs, and so on."

        "Selecting modifiers using this representation would correspond to searching the finite-state network for the most likely path.",
        "A finite-state representation has many advantages, including the ability to easily incorporate an n-gram language model.",
        "Future work may also consider expanded definitions of AEPs.",
