        "Our work is concerned with multi-document summarization, namely with the merging of multiple documents about the same topic taken from the web.",
        "We view summarization as extraction of important sentences from the text.",
        "As a consequence of the merging process the layout of the documents is lost.",
        "In order to create the layout of the output, the document structure (Power et al., 2003) has to be regenerated.",
        "One aspect of this structure is of particular importance for our work: the paragraph structure.",
        "In web documents paragraph boundaries are used to anchor figures and illustrations, so that the figures are always aligned with the same paragraph even when the font size or the window size is changed.",
        "Since we want to include figures in the generated summaries, paragraph segmentation is an important subtask in our application.",
        "Besides multi-document summarization of web documents, paragraph boundary identification (PBI) could be useful for a number of different applications, such as producing the layout for transcripts provided by speech recognizers and optical character recognition systems, and determining the layout of documents generated for output devices with different screen size.",
        "Though related to the task of topic segmentation which stimulated a large number of studies (Hearst, 1997; Choi, 2000; Galley et al., 2003, inter alia), paragraph segmentation has not been thoroughly investigated so far.",
        "We explain this by the fact that paragraphs are considered a stylistic phenomenon and that there is no unanimous opinion on what the function of the paragraph is.",
        "Some authors (Irmscher (1972) as cited by Stark (1988)) suggest that paragraph structure is arbitrary and can not be determined based solely on the properties of the text.",
        "Still, psycholinguistic studies report that humans agree, at least to some extent, on placing boundaries between paragraphs.",
        "These studies also note that paragraph boundaries are informative and make the reader perceive paragraph-initial sentences as being important (Stark, 1988).",
        "In contrast to topic segmentation, paragraph segmentation has the advantage that large amounts of annotated data are readily availabe for supervised learning.",
        "In this paper we describe our approach to paragraph segmentation.",
        "Previous work (Sporleder & Lapata, 2004; 2006) mainly focused on superficial and easily obtainable surface features like punctuation, quotes, distance and words in the sentence.",
        "Their approach was claimed to be domain and language-independent.",
        "Our hypothesis, however, is that linguistically motivated features, which we compute automatically, provide a better paragraph segmentation than Sporleder & Lapata’s surface ones, though our approach may loose some of the",
        "domain-independence.",
        "We test our hypothesis on a corpus of biographies downloaded from the German Wikipedia1.",
        "The results we report in this paper indicate that linguistically motivated features outperform surface features significantly.",
        "It turned out that pronominalization and information structure contribute to the determination of paragraph boundaries while discourse cues have a negative effect.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: First, we describe related work in Section 2, then in Section 3 our data is introduced.",
        "The baselines, the machine learners, the features and the experimental setup are given in Section 4.",

        "Compared to other text segmentation tasks, e.g. topic segmentation, PBI has received relatively little attention.",
        "We are aware of three studies which approach the problem from different perspectives.",
        "Bolshakov & Gelbukh (2001) assume that splitting text into paragraphs is determined by text cohesion: The link between a paragraph initial sentence and the preceding context is weaker than the links between sentences within a paragraph.",
        "They evaluate text cohesion using a database of collocations and semantic links and insert paragraph boundaries where the cohesion is low.",
        "The algorithm of Sporleder & Lapata (2004, 2006) uses surface, syntactic and language model features and is applied to three different languages and three domains (fiction, news, parliament).",
        "This study is of particular interest to us since one of the languages the algorithm is tested on is German.",
        "They investigate the impact of different features and data size, and report results significantly better than a simple baseline.",
        "However, their results vary considerably between the languages and the domains.",
        "Also, the features determined important is different for each setting.",
        "So, it may be possible that Sporleder & Lapata do not provide conclusive results.",
        "Genzel (2005) considers lexical and syntactic features and reports accuracy obtained from English fiction data as well as from the WSJ corpus.",
        "He points out that lexical coherence and structural features turn out to be the most useful for his algorithm.",
        "Unfortunately, the only evaluation measure he provides is accuracy which, for the PBI task,",
        "does not describe the performance of a system sufficiently.",
        "In comparison to the mentioned studies, our goal is to examine the influence of cohesive features on the choice of paragraph boundary insertion.",
        "Unlike Bolshakov & Gelbukh (2001), who have similar motivation but measure cohesion by collocations, we explore the role of discourse cues, pronominalization and information structure.",
        "The task of topic segmentation is closely related to the task of paragraph segmentation.",
        "If there is a topic boundary, it is very likely that it coincides with a paragraph boundary.",
        "However, the reverse is not true and one topic can extend over several paragraphs.",
        "So, if determined reliably, topic boundaries could be used as high precision, low recall predictors for paragraph boundaries.",
        "Still, there is an important difference: While work on topic segmentation mainly depends on content words (Hearst, 1997) and relations between them which are computed using lexical chains (Galley et al., 2003), paragraph segmentation as a stylistic phenomenon may depend equally likely on function words.",
        "Hence, paragraph segmentation is a task which encompasses the traditional borders between content and style."

        "Although our corpus is substantially smaller than the German corpora of Sporleder & Lapata (2006), it should be big enough for a fair comparison between their algorithm and the algorithm proposed here.",
        "Having investigated the effect of the training size, Sporleder & Lapata (2006) came to the conclusion that their system performs well being trained on a small data set.",
        "In particular, the learning curve for German shows an improvement of only about 2% when the amount of training data is increased from 20%, which in case of German fiction approximately equals 370,000 tokens, to 100%.",
        "Fully automatic preprocessing in our system comprises the following stages: First, a list ofpeo-ple of a certain Wikipedia category is taken and for every person an article is extracted The text",
        "is purged from Wiki tags and comments, the information on subtitles and paragraph structure is preserved.",
        "Second, sentence boundaries are identified with a Perl CPAN module2 whose performance we improved by extending the list of abbreviations and modifying the output format.",
        "Next, the sentences are split into tokens.",
        "The TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) and the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1997) are used for tagging and lemmatizing.",
        "Finally, the texts are parsed with the CDG dependency parser (Foth & Menzel, 2006).",
        "Thus, the text is split on three levels: paragraphs, sentences and tokens, and morphological and syntactic information is provided.",
        "A publicly available list of about 300 discourse connectives was downloaded from the Internet site of the Institute for the German Language3 (Insti-tut f¨ur Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim) and slightly extended.",
        "These are identified in the text and annotated automatically as well.",
        "Named entities are classified according to their type using information from Wikipedia: person, location, organization or undefined.",
        "Given the peculiarity of our corpus, we are able to identify all mentions of the bi-ographee in the text by simple string matching.",
        "We also annotate different types of referring expressions (first, last, full name) and resolve anaphora by linking personal pronouns to the biographee provided that they match in number and gender.",

        "Distribution of data among the three sets is presented in Table 1.",
