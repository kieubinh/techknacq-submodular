        "The recent rapid expansion of access to information has significantly increased the demands on retrieval or classification of sentiment information from a large amount of textual data.",
        "The field of sentiment classification has recently received considerable attention, where the polarities of sentiment, such as positive or negative, were identified from unstructured text (Shanahan et al., 2005).",
        "A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003), and at sentence level, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy is still less than desirable.",
        "Therefore, ranking according to the likelihood of containing sentiment information is expected to serve a crucial function in helping users.",
        "We believe that our work is the first attempt at sentiment retrieval that aims at finding sentences containing information with a specific sentiment polarity on a certain topic.",
        "Intuitively, the expression of sentiment in text is dependent on the topic.",
        "For example, a negative view for some voting event may be expressed using ‘flaw’, while a negative view for some politician may be expressed using ‘reckless’.",
        "Moreover, sentiment polarities are also dependent on topics or domains.",
        "For example, the adjective ‘unpredictable’ may have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as ‘unpredictable steering’, but it could have a positive orientation in a movie review, in a phrase such as ‘unpredictable plot’, as mentioned in (Turney, 2002) in the context of his sentiment word detection.",
        "We propose sentiment retrieval models in the framework of generative language modeling, not only assuming query terms expressing a certain topic, but also assuming that the polarity of sentiment interest is specified by the user in some manner, where the topic dependence of the sentiment is considered.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no other studies on a retrieval model unifying both topic and sentiment, and further, there have been no other studies on sentiment retrieval.",
        "The sentiment information often appears as local in a document, and therefore focusing on finer levels, i.e., sentence or passage levels rather than document level, is crucial.",
        "We thus experiment on sentiment retrieval at the sentence level in this paper.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the work related to this study.",
        "Section 3 describes a generative model of sentiment, which is proposed here as a theoretical framework for our work.",

        "We propose sentiment retrieval models in the framework of probabilistic generative models, not only assuming that a user inputs query terms expressing a certain topic, but also assuming that the user specifies a sentiment polarity of interest either as a sentiment specification q' E { -1� 11 or as a set of sentiment seed words qs.",
        "For this purpose, we combine sentiment relevance models and topic relevance models, considering the topic dependence of the sentiment.",
        "In our experiments, our model worked significantly better than standard language modeling approaches, both when using q' and qs, and with both manual and automatic annotation of the fragments expressing sentiments in text.",
        "With qs and automatic annotation, our model still worked significantly better than the standard approaches; however, the per",
        "formance did not reach that achieved with other settings.",
        "We believe the performance can be improved with larger-scale data.",
        "We experimented to find sentences that were relevant to a given topic and were appropriate to a given sentiment; however, our models can also be applied to textual chunks of any length, such as at document level or passage level.",
        "Our model can be easily extended to opinion retrieval, if the opinion retrieval is defined as retrieving sentences or documents that contain either positive or negative sentiments.",
        "This issue is worth pursuing in future work.",
        "Approaches considering polarity strength or continuous values for the polarity specification, rather than using { -1�11, can also be considered in future work."
