        "Discriminative models have become the models of choice for NLP tasks, because of their ability to easily incorporate non-independent features and to more directly optimize classification accuracy.",
        "State of the art models for many NLP tasks are either fully discriminative or trained using discriminative reranking (Collins, 2000).",
        "These include models for part-of-speech tagging (Toutanova et al., 2003), semantic-role labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2005; Pradhan et al., 2005b) and Penn Treebank parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "The superiority of discriminative models has been shown on many tasks when the discriminative and generative models use exactly the same model structure (Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "However, the advantage of the discriminative models can be very slight (Johnson, 2001) and for small training set sizes generative models can be better because they need fewer training samples to converge to the optimal parameter setting (Ng and Jordan, 2002).",
        "Additionally, many discriminative models use a generative model as a base model and add discriminative features with reranking (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Roark et al., 2004), or train discriminatively a small set of weights for features which are generatively estimated probabilities (Raina et al., 2004; Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "Therefore it is important to study generative models and to find ways of making them better even when they are used only as components of discriminative models.",
        "Generative models may often perform poorly due to making strong independence assumptions about the joint distribution of features and classes.",
        "To avoid this problem, generative models for NLP tasks have often been manually designed to achieve an appropriate representation of the joint distribution, such as in the parsing models of (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).",
        "This shows that when the generative models have a good model structure, they can perform quite well.",
        "In this paper, we look differently at comparing generative and discriminative models.",
        "We ask the question: given the same set of input features, what is the best a generative model can do if it is allowed to learn an optimal structure for the joint distribution, and what is the best a discriminative model can do if it is also allowed to learn an optimal structure.",
        "That is, we do not impose any independence assumptions on the generative or discriminative models and let them learn the best representation of the data they can.",
        "Structure learning is very efficient for generative models in the form of directed graphical models (Bayesian Networks (Pearl, 1988)), since the optimal parameters for such models can be estimated in closed form.",
        "We compare Bayesian Net",
        "works with structure learning to their closely related discriminative counterpart – conditional log-linear models with structure learning.",
        "Our conditional log-linear models can also be seen as Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), except we do not have a structure on the labels, but want to learn a structure on the features.",
        "We compare the two kinds of models on two NLP classification tasks – prepositional phrase attachment and semantic role labelling.",
        "Our results show that the generative models are competitive with or better than the discriminative models.",
        "When a small set of interpolation parameters for the conditional probability tables are fit discriminatively, the resulting hybrid generative-discriminative models perform better than the generative only models and sometimes better than the discriminative models.",
        "In Section 2, we describe in detail the form of the generative and discriminative models we study and our structure search methodology.",

        "From Table 6 we can see that when we compare general Bayesian Network structures to general log-linear models, the performance gap between the generative and discriminative models is much smaller.",
        "The Bayesian Network with a single interpolation weight d has 93.5% accuracy and the log-linear model has 93.9% accuracy.",
        "The hybrid model with multiple interpolation weights performs at 93.7%.",
        "All models in Table 6 are in a statistical tie according to McNemar’s test, and thus the log-linear model is not significantly better than the Bayes Net models.",
        "We can see that the generative model was able to learn a structure with a set of independence assumptions which are not as strong as the ones the Naive Bayes model makes, thus resulting in a model with performance competitive with the discriminative model.",
        "Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the Bayesian Networks learned for PP Attachment and Semantic Role Labeling.",
        "Table 7 shows the conjunctions",
        "learned by the Log-linear models for PP attachment and SRL.",
        "We should note that it is much faster to do structure search for the generative Bayesian Network model, as compared to structure search for the log-linear model.",
        "In our implementation, we did not do any computation reuse between successive steps of structure search for the Bayesian Network or log-linear models.",
        "Structure search took 2 hours for the Bayesian Network and 24 hours for the log-linear model.",
        "To put our results in the context of previous work, other results on core arguments using the same input features have been reported, the best being 91.4% for an SVM with a degree 2 polynomial kernel (Pradhan et al., 2005a).3 The highest reported result for independent classification of core arguments is 96.0% for a log-linear model using more than 20 additional basic features (Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "Therefore our resulting models with 93.5% and 93.9% accuracy compare favorably to the SVM model with polynomial kernel and show the importance of structure learning."

        "Previous work has compared generative and discriminative models having the same structure, such as the Naive Bayes and Logistic regression models (Ng and Jordan, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2002) and other models (Klein and Manning, 2002; Johnson, 2001).",
        "Bayesian Networks with special structure of the CPTs – e.g. decision trees, have been previously studied in e.g. (Friedman and Goldszmidt, 1996), but not for NLP tasks and not in comparison to discriminative models.",
        "Studies comparing generative and discriminative models with structure learning have been previously performed ((Pernkopf and Bilmes, 2005) and (Grossman and Domingos, 2004)) for other, non-NLP domains.",
        "There are several important algorithmic differences between our work and that of (Pernkopf and Bilmes, 2005; Grossman and Domingos, 2004).",
        "We detail the differences here and perform an empirical evaluation of the impact of some of these differences.",
        "Form of the generative models.",
        "The generative models studied in that previous work do not employ any special form of the conditional probability tables.",
        "Pernkopf and Bilmes (2005) use a simple smoothing method: fixing the probability of every event that has a zero relative frequency estimate to a small fixed c. Thus the model does not take into account information from lower order distributions and has no hyper-parameters that are being fit.",
        "Grossman and Domingos (2004) do not employ a special form of the CPTs either and do not mention any kind of smoothing used in the generative model learning.",
        "Form of the discriminative models.",
        "The works (Pernkopf and Bilmes, 2005; Grossman and Domingos, 2004) study Bayesian Networks whose parameters are trained discriminatively (by maximizing conditional likelihood), as representatives of discriminative models.",
        "We study more general log-linear models, equivalent to Markov Random Fields.",
        "Our models are more general in that their parameters do not need to be interpretable as probabilities (sum to 1 and between 0 and 1), and the structures do not need to correspond to Bayes Net structures.",
        "For discriminative classifiers, it is not important that their component parameters be interpretable as probabilities; thus this restriction is probably unnecessary.",
        "Like for the generative models, another major difference is in the smoothing algorithms.",
        "We smooth the models both by fitting a gaussian prior hyper-parameter and by incorporating features of subsets of cliques.",
        "Smoothing in (Pernkopf and Bilmes, 2005) is done by substituting zero-valued parameters with a small fixed c. Grossman and Domingos (2004) employ early stopping using held-out data which can achieve similar effects to smoothing with a gaussian prior.",
        "To evaluate the importance of the differences between our algorithm and the ones presented in these works, and to evaluate the importance of fitting hyper-parameters for smoothing, we implemented a modified version of our structure search.",
        "The modifications were as follows.",
        "For Bayes Net structure learning: (i) no Witten-Bell smoothing is employed in the CPTs, and (ii) no backoffs to lower-order distributions are considered.",
        "The only smoothing remaining in the CPTs is an interpolation with a uniform distribution with a fixed weight of a = .1.",
        "For discriminative log-linear model structure learning: (i) the gaussian prior was fixed to be very weak, serving only to keep the weights away from infinity (a = 100) and (ii) the conjunction selection was restricted to correspond to a Bayes Net structure with no features for subsets of feature conjunctions.",
        "Thus the only difference between the class of our modified discriminative log-linear models and the class of models considered in (Pernkopf and Bilmes, 2005; Grossman and Domingos, 2004) is that we do not restrict the parameters to be interpretable as probabilities.",
        "The results shown in Table 8 summarize the results obtained by the modified algorithm on the two tasks.",
        "Both the generative and discriminative learners suffered a statistically significant (at level .01) loss in performance.",
        "Notably, the log-linear model for PP attachment performs worse than logistic regression with better smoothing.",
        "ing minimal smoothing and no backoff to lower order distributions.",
        "In summary, our results showed that by learning the structure for generative models, we can obtain models which are competitive with or better than corresponding discriminative models.",
        "We also showed the importance of employing sophisticated smoothing techniques in structure search algorithms for natural language classification tasks."
