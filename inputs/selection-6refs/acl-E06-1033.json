        "For languages with limited electronic resources, i.e. low-density languages, however, we cannot use automated techniques based on parallel corpora (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 2000; Resnik, 1999; Utsuro et al., 2002), comparable corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998), or multilingual thesauri (Vossen, 1998).",
        "Yet for these low-density languages, printed bilingual dictionaries often offer effective mapping from the low-density language to a high-density language, such as English.",
        "Dictionaries can have different formats and can provide a variety of information.",
        "However, they typically have a consistent layout of entries and a",
        "consistent structure within entries.",
        "Publishers of dictionaries often use a combination of features to impose this structure including (1) changes in font style, font-size, etc.",
        "that make implicit the lexicographic information1, such as headwords, pronunciations, parts of speech (POS), and translations, (2) keywords that provide an explicit interpretation of the lexicographic information, and (3) various separators that impose an overall structure on the entry.",
        "For example, a boldface font may indicate a headword, italics may indicate an example of usage, keywords may designate the POS, commas may separate different translations, and a numbering system may identify different senses of a word.",
        "We developed an entry tagging system that recognizes, parses, and tags the entries of a printed dictionary to reproduce the representation electronically (Karagol-Ayan et al., 2003).",
        "The system aims to use features as described above and the consistent layout and structure of the dictio",
        "naries to capture and recover the lexicographic information in the entries.",
        "Each token2 or group of tokens (phrase)3 in an entry associates with a tag indicating its lexicographic information in the entry.",
        "Figure 1 shows sample tagged entries in which eight different types of lexicographic information are identified and marked.",
        "The system gets format and style information from a document image analyzer module (Ma and Doermann, 2003) and is retargeted at many levels with minimal human assistance.",
        "A major requirement for a human aided dictionary tagging application is the need to minimize human generated training data .4 This requirement limits the effectiveness of data driven methods for initial training.",
        "We chose rule-based tagging that uses the structure to analyze and tag tokens as our baseline, because it outperformed the baseline results of an HMM tagger.",
        "The approach has demonstrated promising results, but we will show its shortcomings can be improved by applying a transformation-based learning (TBL) post processing technique.",
        "TBL (Brill, 1995) is a rule-based machine learning method with some attractive qualities that make it suitable for language related tasks.",
        "First, the resulting rules are easily reviewed and understood.",
        "Second, it is error-driven, thus directly minimizes the error rate (Florian and Ngai, 2001).",
        "Furthermore, TBL can be applied to other annotation systems’ output to improve performance.",

        "However if the font is incorrect (font errors are more likely to happen with short tokens), the only way to mark correctly the tag involves checking the neighboring tokens and tags to determine its relative position within the entry.",
        "When the token has an incorrect font or OCR errors exist, and the other clues are ambiguous or inconclusive, the rule-based method may yield incorrect results.",
        "Second, the rule-based method can produce incorrect splitting and/or merging of phrases.",
