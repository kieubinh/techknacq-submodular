      "text": [
        "Over the years, there have been several multimodal systems that allow input and/or output to be conveyed over multiple channels such as speech, graphics, and gesture, for example, put that there (Bolt, 1980), CUBRICON (Neal and Shapiro, 1991), QuickSet (Cohen et al., 1998), SmartKom (Wahlster, 2002), Match (Johnston et al., 2002).",
        "Multimodal integration and interpretation for such interfaces is elegantly expressed using multimodal grammars (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).",
        "These grammars support composite multimodal inputs by aligning speech input (words) and gesture input (represented as sequences of gesture symbols) while expressing the relation between the speech and gesture input and their combined semantic representation.",
        "In (Bangalore and Johnston, 2000; Johnston and Bangalore, 2005), we have shown that such grammars can be compiled into finite-state transducers enabling effective processing of lattice input from speech and gesture recognition and mutual compensation for errors and ambiguities.",
        "However, like other approaches based on handcrafted grammars, multimodal grammars can be brittle with respect to extra-grammatical, erroneous and disfluent input.",
        "For speech recognition, a corpus-driven stochastic language model (SLM) with smoothing or a combination of grammar-based and n-gram model (Bangalore and Johnston, 2004; Wang et al., 2002) can be built in order to overcome the brittleness of a grammar-based language model.",
        "Although the corpus-driven language model might recognize a user’s utterance correctly, the recognized utterance may not be assigned a semantic representation by the multimodal grammar if the utterance is not part of the grammar.",
        "There have been two main approaches to improving robustness of the understanding component in the spoken language understanding literature.",
        "First, a parsing-based approach attempts to recover partial parses from the parse chart when the input cannot be parsed in its entirety due to noise, in order to construct a (partial) semantic representation (Dowding et al., 1993; Allen et al., 2001; Ward, 1991).",
        "Second, a classification-based approach views the problem of understanding as extracting certain bits of information from the input.",
        "It attempts to classify the utterance and identifies substrings of the input as slot-filler values to construct a frame-like semantic representation.",
        "Both approaches have shortcomings.",
        "Although in the first approach, the grammar can encode richer semantic representations, the method for combining the fragmented parses is quite ad hoc.",
        "In the second approach, the robustness is derived from training classifiers on annotated data, this data is very expensive to collect and annotate, and the semantic representation is fairly limited.",
        "Furthermore, it is not clear how to extend this approach to apply on lattice input – an important requirement for multimodal processing.",
        "An alternative to these approaches is to edit the recognized string to match the closest string that can be accepted by the grammar.",
        "Essentially the idea is that, if the recognized string cannot be parsed, then we determine which in-grammar string it is most like.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the recognized string is mapped to the closest string in the grammar by deletion of the words restaurants and in.",
        "In this paper, we develop further this edit-based approach to finite-state multimodal language understanding and show how when appropriately tuned it can provide a substantial improvement in concept accuracy.",
        "We also explore learning edits from data and present an approach of modeling this process as a machine translation problem.",
        "We learn a model to translate from out of grammar or misrecognized language (such as ‘ASR:’ above) to the closest language the system can understand (‘Grammar:’ above).",
        "To this end, we adopt techniques from statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) and use statistical alignment to learn the edit patterns.",
        "Here we evaluate these different techniques on data from the MATCH multimodal conversational system (Johnston et al., 2002) but the same techniques are more broadly applicable to spoken language systems in general whether unimodal or multimodal.",
        "The layout of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Sections 2 and 3, we briefly describe the MATCH application and the finite-state approach to multimodal language understanding.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss the limitations of the methods used for robust understanding in spoken language understanding literature.",
        "In Section 5 we present our approach to building hand-crafted edit machines.",

        "In order to evaluate the understanding performance of the different edit machines, for each partition of the data we first composed the output from speech recognition with the edit machine and the multimodal grammar, flattened the meaning representation (as described in Section 3.1), and computed the exact string match accuracy between the flattened meaning representation and the reference meaning representation.",
        "We then averaged this concept sentence accuracy measure over all six partitions.",
        "The results are tabulated in Figure 10.",
        "The columns show the concept sentence accuracy (ConSentAcc) and the relative improvement over the the baseline of no edits.",
        "Compared to the baseline of 38.9% concept sentence accuracy without edits (No Edits), Basic Edit gave a relative improvement of 32%, yielding 51.5% concept sentence accuracy.",
        "4-edit further improved concept sentence accuracy (53%) compared to Basic Edit.",
        "The heuristics in Smart Edit brought the concept sentence accuracy to 60.2%, a 55% improvement over the baseline.",
        "Applying Smart edit to lattice input improved performance from 60.2% to 63.2%.",
        "The MT-based edit model yielded concept sentence accuracy of 51.3% a 31.8% improvement over the baseline with no edits, but still substantially less than the edit model derived from the application database.",
        "We believe that given the lack of data for multimodal applications that an approach that combines the two methods may be most effective.",
        "The Classification approach yielded only 34.0% concept sentence accuracy.",
        "Unlike MT-based edit this approach does not have the benefit of composition with the grammar to guide the understanding process.",
        "The low performance of the classifier is most likely due to the small size of the corpus.",
        "Also, since the training/test split was by scenario the specifics of the commands differed between training and test.",
        "In future work will explore the use of other classification techniques and try combining the annotated data with the grammar for training the classifier model."

        "Robust understanding is a crucial feature of a practical conversational system whether spoken or multimodal.",
        "There have been two main approaches to addressing this issue for speech-only dialog systems.",
        "In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on edit machines that is more suitable for multimodal systems where generally very little training data is available and data",
        "is costly to collect and annotate.",
        "We have shown how edit machines enable integration of stochastic speech recognition with hand-crafted multimodal understanding grammars.",
        "The resulting multimodal understanding system is significantly more robust 62% relative improvement in performance compared to 38.9% concept accuracy without edits.",
        "We have also presented an approach to learning the edit operations and a classification-based approach.",
        "The Learned edit approach provides a substantial improvement over the baseline, performing similarly to the Basic edit machine, but does not perform as well as the application-tuned Smart edit machine.",
        "Given the small size of the corpus, the classification-based approach performs less well.",
        "This leads us to conclude that given the lack of data for multimodal applications a combined strategy may be most effective.",
        "Multimodal grammars coupled with edit machines derived from the underlying application database can provide sufficiently robust understanding performance to bootstrap a multimodal service and as more data become available data-driven techniques such as Learned edit and the classification-based approach can be brought into play."
