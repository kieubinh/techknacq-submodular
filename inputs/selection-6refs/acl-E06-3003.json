        "In the course of recent years the scientific community working on the problem of automatic text summarization has been experiencing an upsurge.",
        "A multitude of different techniques has been applied to this end, some of the more remarkable of them being (Marcu, 1997; Mani et al.",
        "1998; Teufel and Moens, 2002; Elhadad et al., 2005), to name just a few.",
        "These researchers worked on various text genres: scientific and popular scientific articles (Marcu, 1997; Mani et al., 1998), texts in computational linguistics (Teufel and Moens, 2002), and medical texts (Elhadad et al., 2002).",
        "All these genres are examples of texts characterized by rigid structure, relative abundance of surface markers and straightforwardness.",
        "Relatively few attempts have been made at summarizing less structured genres, some of them being dialogue and speech summarization (Zechner, 2002; Koumpis et al.",
        "2001).",
        "The issue of summarizing fiction remains largely untouched, since a few very thorough earlier works (Charniak, 1972; Lehnert, 1982).",
        "The work presented here seeks to fill in this gap.",
        "The ultimate objective of the project is stated as follows: to produce indicative summaries of short works of fiction such that they be helpful to a potential reader in deciding whether she would be interested in reading a particular story or not.",
        "To this end, revealing the plot was deemed unnecessary and even undesirable.",
        "Instead, the current approach relies on the following assumption: when a reader is presented with an extracted summary outlining the general settings of a story (such as time, place and who it is about), she will have enough information to decide how interested she would be in reading a story.",
        "For example, a fragment of such a summary, produced by an annotator for the story The Cost of Kindness by Jerome K. Jerome is presented in Figure 1.",
        "The plot, which is a tale of how one local family decides to bid a warm farewell to Rev.",
        "Crackle-thorpe and causes the vicar to change his mind and remain in town, is omitted.",
        "The data used in the experiments consisted of 23 short stories, all written in XIX – early XX century by mainstream authors such as Katherine Mansfield, Anton Chekhov, O.Henry, Guy de Maupassant and others (13 authors in total).",
        "The genre can be vaguely termed social fiction with the exception of a few fairy-tales.",
        "Such vagueness as far as genre is concerned was deliberate, as the author wished to avoid producing a system relying on cues specific to a particular genre.",
        "Average length of a story in the corpus is 3,333 tokens (approximately 4.5 letter-sized pages) and the target compression rate is 6%.",
        "In order to separate the background of a story from events, this project relies heavily on the notion of aspect (the term is explained in Section 3.1).",
        "Each clause of every sentence is described in terms of aspect-related features.",
        "This representation is then used to select salient descriptive sentences and to leave out those which describe events."

        "The original version of the Gazetteer recognized only named entities and professions, but the Gazetteer was extended to include common animate nouns such as man, woman, etc.",
        "As the next step, an implementation based on a classical pronoun resolution algorithm (Lappin and Leass, 1994) was applied to the texts.",

        "In the fine-grained dataset the findings were similar: 1) presence of a character mention; 2) position of a sentence in the text; 3) voice; and 4) tense were more important than the other features.",
        "It is not easy to interpret these results in any conclusive way at this stage.",
        "The main weakness, of course, is that the results are based solely on the annotations of one person while it is generally known that human annotators are likely to exhibit some disagreement.",
        "The second issue lies in the fact that given the compression rate of 6%, and the objective that the summary be indicative and not informative, more that one ‘good’ summary is possible.",
        "It would therefore be desirable that the results be evaluated not based on overlap with an annotator (or annotators, for that matter), but on how well they achieve the stated objective."

        "In the immediate future the inconclusiveness of the results will be addressed by means of asking human judges to evaluate the produced summaries.",

        "The judges will also be asked to annotate their own version of a summary to explore what inter-judge agreement means in the context of fiction summarization.",
        "More remote plans include possibly tackling the problem of summarizing the plot and dealing more closely with the problem of evaluation in the context of fiction summarization."
