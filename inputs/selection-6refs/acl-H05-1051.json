        "Lexical ambiguity refers to words that share the same orthography but have different meanings (word senses).",
        "It can be subdivided into two distinct types, homonymy and polysemy.",
        "Homonymy describes when two senses of a given word (or derivation) are distinct.",
        "Typically, they are separated by etymology and are therefore entirely unrelated in meaning.",
        "One classic example (Kilgarriff, 1992) is ‘bat’ as in an airborne mammal (from the Middle English word ‘bakke’ meaning flying rodent) vs. ‘bat’ as in an instrument used in the game of cricket (from the Celtic for stick or cudgel).",
        "There is no underlying relationship between these two meanings which have come about independently from differing root languages.",
        "Alternatively, polysemy describes where two senses of a word are related in that they share membership of a subsuming semantic classification.",
        "Consider the word ‘mouth’ as in a part of the body vs. ‘mouth’ as in the outlet of a river.",
        "Both meanings are subsumed by a higher concept (in this case they both describe an opening).",
        "Homonymy and polysemy are differentiated in most dictionaries by the major (homonyms) and minor (polysemes) entries for a given word.",
        "Where a lexical resource is described in terms of granularity a coarse-grained approach only differentiates between homonymy whereas a fine-grained approach also considers polysemy.",
        "The use of word sense disambiguation in Information Retrieval (IR) has been an active field of study for the past 30 years.",
        "Despite several failures (described in Sanderson, 2000) recent studies have begun to show increased retrieval effectiveness, particularly in Web retrieval.",
        "However, two key questions remain: (1) to what accuracy must disambiguation be performed in order to show increased retrieval effectiveness and (2) to what level of granularity should disambiguation be performed in order to maximize these gains?",
        "This study answers these questions by simulating the impact of ambiguity and its subsequent resolution on retrieval effectiveness."

        "Results showed that retrieval effectiveness increased when documents were indexed by cluster as opposed to raw terms.",
        "Performance further increased when a word in the collection was assigned membership of its three most likely clusters.",

        "The accuracy of their disambiguation was reported at 62% based on its performance over a large subset of SemCor (a collection of manually disambiguated documents).",
        "It remains unclear how accuracy figures produced on different collections can be compared.",

        "WordNet is a fine-grained lexical resource and polysemy can be derived to varying degrees of granularity by traversing the link structure between synsets (figure 1).",
        "An important feature of pseudowords is the number of constituents as this controls the amount of additional ambiguity created.",
        "A feature of all previous studies is that they generate pseudowords with a uniform number of constituents, e.g. size 2, size 5 or size 10, thus introducing uniform levels of additional ambiguity.",

        "The approach taken in this study was to generate pseudowords where the number of constituents was variable.",

        "When producing the traditional pseudoword based collection the only modification to Sander-son’s (1994) approach (described in section 2), other than the variable size, involved formalizing his observation that the constituent words were unlikely to be related.",

        "2) It must not be part of another pseudoword.",

        "hypothesized from previous studies (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Sanderson and Van Rijsbergen, 1999) which highlight the importance of co-occurrence between query words.",
        "Where two (or more) words appear together in a query, statistical retrieval inherently performs some element of disambiguation.",
        "However, in the case of a word with many closely related senses, co-occurrence between query words may not be sufficient for a given sense to become apparent.",
        "This is particularly exasperated in Web retrieval given that the average query length in these experiments was 2.9 words.",
        "Clearly, the inherent disambiguation performed by statistical IR techniques is sensitive to polysemy in the same way as systems which explicitly perform disambiguation.",
        "With regard to disambiguation accuracy and IR (section 5.2) these experiments establish that performance gains begin to occur where disambiguation is between 55% and 76%.",
        "Where within this range the actual breakeven point lies is dependent on the granularity of the disambiguation and the balance between polysemy and homonymy in a given collection.",
        "Consider that coarse-grained disambiguation is frequently advocated on the basis that it can be performed more accurately.",
        "Whilst this is undoubtedly true these results suggest that homonymy has to be resolved to a much higher level of accuracy than polysemy in order to be of benefit in IR.",
        "It would seem prudent to consider the results of this study in relation to the state-of-the-art in disambiguation.",
        "At Senseval-3 (Mihalcea et al., 2004) the top systems were considered to have reached a ceiling, in terms of performance, at 72% for fine-grained disambiguation and 80% for coarse-grained.",
        "When producing the English language test collections the rate of agreement between humans performing manual disambiguation was approximately 74%.",
        "This suggests that machine disambiguation has reached levels comparable to the performance of humans.",
        "In parallel with this the IR community has begun to report increased retrieval effectiveness through explicitly performing disambiguation to varying levels of granularity.",
        "A final point of discussion is the way in which we simulate disambiguation both in this study and those previously (Sanderson, 1994; Gonzalo et al., 1998).",
        "There is growing evidence (Leacock et al., 1998; Agirre and Martinez, 2004) to suggest that simulating uniform rates of accuracy and error across both words and senses may not reflect the performance of modern disambiguation systems.",
        "Supervised approaches are known to exhibit inherent bias that exists in their training data.",
        "Examples include Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949) which denotes that a small number of words make up a large percentage of word use and Krovetz and Croft’s (1992) observation that one sense of a word accounts for the majority of all use.",
        "It would seem logical to presume that supervised systems show their best performance over the most frequent senses of the most frequent words in their training data.",
        "Not enough is known about the potential impact of these biases to allow for them to be incorporated into this simulation.",
        "Still, it should be noted that Stokoe et al.",
        "(2003) utilized frequency statistics in their disambiguator and that a by-product of Schütze and Pederson’s (1992) approach was that they eliminated infrequently observed senses.",
        "There is supporting evidence from Sanderson and Van Rijsbergen (1999) to suggest that accounting for this frequency bias is in some way advantageous.",
        "Therefore, it is worth considering that simulating a uniform accuracy and error rate across all words and senses might actually offer a pessimistic picture of the potential for disambiguation and IR.",

        "It also emphasises that although coarse-grained disambiguation can be performed to a higher degree of accuracy, this might not directly translate to increased IR performance compared to fine-grained approaches.",
        "This is in contrast to current thinking which suggests that coarse-grained approaches are more likely to bring about retrieval performance because of their increased accuracy.",
        "In terms of disambiguation accuracy and increased retrieval effectiveness, results show potential benefits where accuracy is as low as 55% when dealing with just polysemy and rises to 76% when",
        "dealing with just homonymy.",
        "Obviously this study has simulated two extremes (polysemy or homonymy) and the exact point where performance increases will occur is likely to be dependent on the interaction between homonymy and polysemy in a given query.",
        "With regard to simulation a more empirical exploration of the ideas expressed in this work would be desirable.",
        "However, the size of modern IR test collections dictates that future studies will need to rely more heavily on simulation.",
