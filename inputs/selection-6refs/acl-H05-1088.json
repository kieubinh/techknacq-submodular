        "Event recognition is, after entity recognition, one of the major tasks within Information Extraction.",
        "It is currently being succesfully applied in different areas, like bioinformatics and text classification.",
        "Recognizing events in these fields is generally carried out by means of predefined sets of relations, possibly structured into an ontology, which makes such tasks domain dependent, but feasible.",
        "Event recognition is also at the core of Question Answering,",
        "since input questions touch on events and situations in the world (states, actions, properties, etc.",
        "), as they are reported in the text.",
        "In this field as well, the use of predefined sets of relation patterns has proved fairly reliable, particularly in the case of factoid type queries (Brill et al., 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Hovy et al., 2002; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002).",
        "Nonetheless, such an approach is not sensitive to certain contextual elements that may be fundamental for returning the appropriate answer.",
        "This is for instance the case in reporting or attempting contexts.",
        "Given the passage in (1a), a pattern-generated answer to question (1b) would be (1c).",
        "Similarly, disregarding the reporting context in example (2) could erroneously lead to concluding that no one from the White House was involved in the Watergate affair.",
        "(1) a.",
        "Of the 14 known ways to reach the summit, only the East Ridge route has never been successfully climbed since George Mallory and Andrew ”Sandy” Irvine first attempted to climb Everest in 1924. b.",
        "When did George Mallory and Andrew Irvine first climb Everest?",
        "c. #In 1924.",
        "(2) a. Nixon claimed that White House counsel John Dean had conducted an investigation into the Watergate matter and found that no-one from the White House was involved.",
        "b.",
        "What members of the White House were involved in the Watergate matter?",
        "c. #Nobody.",
        "Intensional contexts like those above are generated by predicates referring to events of attempting, intending, commanding, and reporting, among others.",
        "When present in text, they function as modal",
        "qualifiers of the truth of a given proposition, as in example (2), or they indicate the factuality nature of the event expressed by the proposition (whether it happened or not), as in (1) (Saur´ı and Verhagen, 2005).",
        "The need for a more sophisticated approach that sheds some awareness on the specificity of certain linguistic contexts is in line with the results obtained in previous TREC Question Answering competitions (Voorhees, 2002, 2003).",
        "There, a system that attempted a minimal understanding of both the question and the answer candidates, by translating them into their logical forms and using an inference engine, achieved a notably higher score than any surface-based system (Moldavan et al., 2002; Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
        "Non-factoid questions introduce an even higher level of difficulty.",
        "Unlike factoid questions, there is no simple or unique answer, but more or less satisfactory ones instead.",
        "In many cases, they involve dealing with several events, or identifying and reasoning about certain relations among events which are only partially stated in the source documents (such as temporal and causal ones), all of which makes the pattern-based approach less suitable for the task (Small et al., 2003, Soricut and Brill, 2004).",
        "Temporal information in particular plays a significant role in the context of question answering systems (Pustejovsky et al., forthcoming).",
        "The question in (3), for instance, requires identifying a set of events related to the referred killing of peasants in Mexico, and subsequently ordering them along a temporal axis.",
        "(3) What happened in Chiapas, Mexico, after the killing of 45 peasants in Acteal?",
        "Reasoning about events in intensional contexts, or with event-ordering relations such as temporality and causality, is a requisite for any open-domain QA system aiming at both factoid and non-factoid questions.",
        "As a first step, this involves the identification of all relevant events reported in the source documents, so that later processing stages can locate intensional context boundaries and temporal relations among these events.",
        "In this article, we present Evita, a tool for recognizing events in natural language texts.",
        "It has been developed as part of a suite of tools aimed at providing QA systems with information about both temporal and intensional relations between events; we anticipate, however, that it will be useful for other NLP tasks as well, such as narrative understanding, summarization, and the creation of factual databases from textual sources.",
        "In the next section, we provide the linguistic foundations and technical details of our event recognizer tool.",
        "Section 3 gives the results and discusses them in the context of the task.",

        "TARSQI is devoted to two complementary lines of work: (1) establishing a specification language, TimeML, aimed at capturing the richness of temporal and event related information in language (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a, forthcoming), and (2) the construction of a set of tools that perform tasks of identifying, tagging, and reasoning about eventive and temporal information in natural language texts (Pustejovsky and Gaizauskas, forthcoming, Mani, 2005; Mani and Schiffman, forthcoming; Verhagen, 2004; Verhagen et al., 2005; Verhagen and Knippen, forthcoming).",

        "Evita combines linguistic and statistically-based techniques to better address all subtasks of event recognition.",
        "For example, the module devoted to recognizing temporal information that is expressed through the morphology of certain event expressions (such as tense and aspect) uses grammatical information (see section 2.4), whereas disambiguating nouns that can have both eventive and non-eventive interpretations is carried out by a statistical module (section 2.3).",
        "The functionality of Evita breaks down into two parts: event identification and analysis of the event-based grammatical features that are relevant for temporal reasoning purposes.",
        "Both tasks rely on a preprocessing step which performs part-of-speech tag",
        "ging and chunking, and on a module for clustering together chunks that refer to the same event.",

        "As a result, generics and most state-denoting expressions are filtered out (see Saur´ı et al.",
        "(2004) for a more exhaustive definition of the criteria for event candidacy in TimeML).",
        "Event-denoting expressions are found in a wide range of syntactic expressions, such as finite clauses (that no-one from the White House was involved), nonfinite clauses (to climb Everest), noun phrases headed by nominalizations (the young industry’s rapid growth, several antiwar demonstrations) or event-referring nouns (the controversial war), and adjective phrases (fully prepared).",
        "In addition to identifying the textual extent of events, Evita also analyzes certain grammatical features associated with them.",
        "These include:",
        "• The polarity (positive or negative) of the expression tells whether the referred event has happened or not; • Modality (as marked by modal auxiliaries may, can, might, could, should, etc., or adverbials like probably, likely, etc.)",
        "qualifies the denoted event with modal information (irrealis, necessity, possibility), and therefore has implications for the suitability of statements as answers to questions, in a parallel way to other intensional contexts exemplified in (1-2); • Tense and aspect provide crucial information for the temporal ordering of the events; • Similarly, the non-finite morphology of certain verbal expressions (infinitival, present partici",
        "ple, or past participle) has been shown as useful in predicting temporal relations between events (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).",
        "We also consider as possible values here the categories of noun and adjective.",
        "• Event class distinguishes among states (e.g., be the director of), general occurrences (walk), reporting (tell), intensional (attempt), and perception (observe) events.",
        "This classification is relevant for characterizing the nature of the event as irrealis, factual, possible, reported, etc.",
        "(recall examples (1-2) above).",
        "Despite the fact that modality, tense, aspect, and non-finite morphology are typically verbal features, some nouns and adjectives can also have this sort of information associated with them; in particular, when they are part of the predicative complement of a copular verb (e.g., may be ready, had been a collaborator).",
        "A TimeML mark-up of these cases will tag only the complement as an event, disregarding the copular verb.",
        "Therefore, the modality, tense, aspect, and non-finite morphology information associated with the verb is incorporated as part of the event identified as the nominal or adjectival complement.",
        "Except for event class, the characterization of all the features above relies strictly on surface linguistic cues.",
        "Notice that this surface-based approach does not provide for the actual temporal interpretation of the events in the given context.",
        "The tense of a verbal phrase, for example, does not always map in a straightforward way with the time being referred to in the world; e.g., simple present is sometimes used to express future time or habituality.",

        "For example, a noun in a subset subsumed by the phenomenon synset is not an event if it is also subsumed by the synset with the noun cloud (in other words, many phenomena are events but clouds are not).",
        "If the result of lexical lookup is inconclusive (that is, if a nominal occurs in WN as both and event and a non-event), then a disambiguation step is applied.",
        "This process is based on rules learned by a Bayesian classifier trained on SemCor.",
        "Finally, identifying events from adjectives takes a conservative approach of tagging as events only those adjectives that were annotated as such in Time-Bank1.2, whenever they appear as the head of a predicative complement.",

        "In addition, Evita identifies the grammatical information that is associated with the event-referring expression, such as tense, aspect, polarity, and modality.",
        "The characterization of these features is based on explicit linguistic cues.",
        "Unlike other work on event recognition, Evita does not attempt to identify event participants, but relies on the use of entity taggers for the linking of arguments to events.",
        "Evita combines linguistic and statistically-based knowledge to better address each particular subtask of the event recognition problem.",
        "Linguistic knowledge has been used for the parsing of very local and controlled contexts, such as verbal phrases, and the extraction of morphologically explicit information.",
        "On the other hand, statistical knowledge has contributed to the process of disambiguation of nominal events, following the current trend in the Word Sense Disambiguation field.",
        "Our tool is grounded on simple and well-known technologies; namely, a standard preprocessing stage, finite state techniques, and Bayesian-based techniques for word sense disambiguation.",
        "In addition, it is conceived from a highly modular perspective.",
        "Thus, an effort has been put on separating linguistic knowledge from the processing thread.",
        "In this way we guarantee a low-cost maintainance of the system, and simplify the task of enriching the grammatical knowledge (which can be carried out even by naive programmers such as linguists) when additional data is obtained from corpus exploitation.",
        "Evita is a component within a larger suite of tools.",
        "It is one of the steps within a processing sequence which aims at providing basic semantic information (such as temporal relations or intensional context boundaries) to applications like Question Answering or Narrative Understanding, for which text understanding is shown to be fundamental, in addition to shallow-based techniques.",
        "Nonetheless, Evita can also be used independently for purposes other than those above.",
        "Additional tools within the TimeML research framework are (a) GUTime, a recognizer of temporal expressions which extends Tempex for TimeML (Mani, 2005), (b) a tool devoted to the temporal ordering and anchoring of events (Mani and Schiffman, forthcoming), and (c) Slinket, an application in charge of identifying subordination contexts that introduce intensional events like those exemplified in (1-2) (Verhagen et al., 2005).",
        "Together with these, Evita provides capabilities for a more adequate treatment of temporal and intensional information in textual sources, thereby contributing towards incorporating greater inferential capabilities to applications within QA and related fields, a requisite that has been shown necessary in the Introduction section.",
        "Further work on Evita will be focused on two main areas: (1) improving the sense disambiguation of candidates to event nominals by experimenting with additional learning techniques, and (2) improving event classification.",
        "The accuracy ratio for this latter task is already fairly acceptable (86.26%), but it still needs to be enhanced in order to guarantee an optimal detection of subordinating intensional contexts (recall examples 1-2).",
        "Both lines of work will involve the exploration and use of word sense disambiguation techniques."
