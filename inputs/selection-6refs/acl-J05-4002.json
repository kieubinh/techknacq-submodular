        "Over recent years, approaches to a broad range of natural language processing (NLP) applications have been proposed that require knowledge about the similarity of words.",
        "The application areas in which these approaches have been proposed range from speech recognition and parse selection to information retrieval (IR) and natural language generation.",
        "For example, language models that incorporate substantial lexical knowledge play a key role in many statistical NLP techniques (e.g., in speech recognition and probabilistic parse selection).",
        "However, they are difficult to acquire, since many plausible combinations of events are not seen in corpus data.",
        "Brown et al. (1992) report that one can expect 14.7% of the word triples in any new English text to be unseen in a training corpus of 366 million English words.",
        "In our own experiments with grammatical relation data extracted by a Robust Accurate Statistical Parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll 1995; Carroll and Briscoe 1996) from the British National Corpus (BNC), we found that 14% of noun-verb direct-object co-occurrence tokens and 49% of noun-verb direct-object co-occurrence types in one half of the data set were not seen in the other half.",
        "A statistical technique using a language model that assigns a zero probability to these previously unseen events will rule the correct parse or interpretation of the utterance impossible.",
        "Similarity-based smoothing (Hindle 1990; Brown et al.",
        "1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) provides an intuitively appealing approach to language modeling.",
        "In order to estimate the probability of an unseen co-occurrence of events, estimates based on seen occurrences of similar events can be combined.",
        "For example, in a speech recognition task, we might predict that cat is a more likely subject of growl than the word cap, even though neither co-occurrence has been seen before, based on the fact that cat is “similar” to words that do occur as the subject of growl (e.g., dog and tiger), whereas cap is not.",
        "However, what is meant when we say that cat is “similar” to dog?",
        "Are we referring to their semantic similarity, e.g., the components of meaning they share by virtue of both being carnivorous four-legged mammals?",
        "Or are we referring to their distributional similarity, e.g., in keeping with the Firthian tradition,1 the fact that these words tend to occur as the arguments of the same verbs (e.g., eat, feed, sleep) and tend to be modified by the same adjectives (e.g., hungry and playful).",
        "In some applications, the knowledge required is clearly semantic.",
        "In IR, documents might be usefully retrieved that use synonymous terms or terms subsuming those specified in a user’s query (Xu and Croft 1996).",
        "In natural language generation (including text simplification), possible words for a concept should be similar in meaning rather than just in syntactic or distributional behavior.",
        "In these application areas, distributional similarity can be taken to be an approximation to semantic similarity.",
        "The underlying idea is based largely on the central claim of the distributional hypothesis (Harris 1968), that is: The meaning of entities, and the meaning of grammatical relations among them, is related to the restriction of combinations of these entities relative to other entities.",
        "This hypothesized relationship between distributional similarity and semantic similarity has given rise to a large body of work on automatic thesaurus generation (Hindle 1990; Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998a; Curran and Moens 2002; Kilgarriff 2003).",
        "There are inherent problems in evaluating automatic thesaurus extraction techniques, and much research assumes a gold standard that does not exist (see Kilgarriff [2003] and Weeds [2003] for more discussion of this).",
        "A further problem for distributional similarity methods for automatic thesaurus generation is that they do not offer any obvious way to distinguish between linguistic relations such as synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy (see Caraballo [1999] and Lin et al.",
        "[2003] for work on this).",
        "Thus, one may question",
        "the benefit of automatically generating a thesaurus if one has access to large-scale manually constructed thesauri (e.g., WordNet [Fellbaum 1998], Roget’s [Roget 1911], the Macquarie [Bernard 1990] and Moby2).",
        "Automatic techniques give us the opportunity to model language change over time or across domains and genres.",
        "McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) investigate using distributional similarity methods to find predominant word senses within a corpus, making it possible to tailor an existing resource (WordNet) to specific domains.",
        "For example, in the computing domain, the word worm is more likely to be used in its ‘malicious computer program’ sense than in its ‘earthworm’ sense.",
        "This domain knowledge will be reflected in a thesaurus automatically generated from a computing-specific corpus, which will show increased similarity between worm and virus and reduced similarity between worm and caterpillar.",
        "In other application areas, however, the requirement for “similar” words to be semantically related as well as distributionally related is less clear.",
        "For example, in prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity resolution, it is necessary to decide whether the prepositional phrase attaches to the verb or the noun as in the examples (1) and (2).",
        "1.",
        "Mary ((visited their cottage) with her brother).",
        "2.",
        "Mary (visited (their cottage with a thatched roof)).",
        "Hindle and Rooth (1993) note that the correct decision depends on all four lexical events (the verb, the object, the preposition, and the prepositional object).",
        "However, a statistical model built on the basis of four lexical events must cope with extremely sparse data.",
        "One approach (Resnik 1993; Li and Abe 1998; Clark and Weir 2000) is to induce probability distributions over semantic classes rather than lexical items.",
        "For example, a cottage is a type of building and a brother is a type of person, and so the co-occurrence of any type of building and any type of person might increase the probability that the PP in example (1) attaches to the verb.",
        "However, it is unclear whether the classes over which probability distributions are induced need to be semantic or whether they could be purely distributional.",
        "If we know that two words tend to behave the same way with respect to prepositional phrase attachment, does it matter whether they mean similar things?",
        "Other arguments for using semantic classes over distributional classes can similarly be disputed (Weeds 2003).",
        "For example, it is not necessary for a class of objects to have a name or symbolic label for us to know that the objects are similar and to exploit that information.",
        "Distributional classes do conflate word senses, but in a task such as PP-attachment ambiguity resolution, we are unlikely to be working with sense-tagged examples and therefore it is for word forms that we will wish to estimate probabilities of different attachments.",
        "Finally, distributional classes may be over-fitted to a specific corpus, but this may be beneficial to the extent that the over-fitting reflects a specific domain or dialect.",
        "Further, recent empirical evidence suggests that techniques based on distributional similarity may perform as well on this task as those based on semantic similarity.",
        "Li (2002) shows that using a fairly small corpus (126,084 sentences from the Wall Street Journal) and a distributional similarity technique, it is possible to outperform a state-of-the-art, WordNet-based technique in terms of accuracy, although not in terms of coverage.",
        "Pantel and Lin (2000) report performance of 84.3% using an unsupervised approach to prepositional phrase attachment based on distributional similarity",
        "techniques.",
        "This significantly outperforms previous unsupervised techniques and is drawing close to the state-of-the-art supervised techniques (88.2%).",
        "Having discussed why distributional similarity is important, we now turn to how to formulate it.",
        "As we have said, two words are distributionally similar if they appear in similar contexts.",
        "We therefore need to consider what is meant by context.",
        "For example, two words could be considered to appear in the same context if they appear in the same sentence, the same document, or the same grammatical dependency relation.",
        "The effect of the type of context used is discussed by Kilgarriff and Yallop (2000).",
        "They show that the use of sentence-level and document-level context leads to “looser” thesauri more akin to Roget’s, whereas the use of grammatical dependency relation level context leads to “tighter” thesauri more akin to WordNet.",
        "The use of grammatical dependency relations as context gives us a tighter thesaurus because it restricts distributionally similar words to those that are plausibly inter-substitutable (Church et al.",
        "1994), giving us the following definition of distributional similarity: The distributional similarity of two words is the extent to which they can be inter-substituted without changing the plausibility3 of the sentence.",
        "This concept of lexical substitutability highlights the relationship between distributional similarity and semantic similarity, since semantic similarity can be thought of as the degree of synonymy that exists between two words, where synonymy is defined (Church et al.",
        "1994) as follows: Two words are absolute synonyms if they can be inter-substituted in all possible contexts without changing the meaning.",
        "In our empirical work, we focus on finding semantic relationships between words such as synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy that might be found in a tighter thesaurus such as WordNet.",
        "Hence, the proposed framework is based on the concept of substitutability, and we use grammatical dependency relations as context.",
        "However, since the framework is based on features, there is no reason why someone wishing to find topical relationships between words, as might be found in Roget’s, could not use the framework.",
        "We simply do not repeat the earlier work of Kilgarriff and Yallop (2000).",
        "However, a number of questions still remain, which this work does investigate:",
        "1.",
        "Is lexical substitutability and therefore distributional similarity symmetric?",
        "The concept of substitution is inherently asymmetric.",
        "It is possible to measure the appropriateness of substituting word A for word B without measuring the appropriateness of substituting word B for word A. Similarity has been defined in terms of inter-substitutability; but we ask whether there is something in the inherent asymmetry of substitution that can be exploited by an asymmetric measure of distributional similarity.",
        "2.",
        "Are all contexts equally important?",
        "For example, some verbs, e.g., have and get, are selectionally weak in the constraints they place on their arguments (Resnik 1993).",
        "Should such contexts be considered on equal terms with selectionally strong contexts in the calculation of distributional similarity?",
        "3.",
        "Is it necessary to consider the difference in extent to which each word appears in each context?",
        "Is it enough to know that both words can occur in each context, or do similar words occur in similar contexts with similar probabilities?",
        "In order to answer these questions, we take a pragmatic, application-oriented approach to evaluation that is based on the assumption that we want to know which words are distributionally similar because particular applications can make use of this information.",
        "However, high performance in one application area is not necessarily correlated with high performance in another application area (Weeds and Weir 2003a).",
        "Thus, it is not clear that the same characteristics that make a distributional similarity measure useful in one application will make it useful in another.",
        "For example, with regard to the question about symmetry, in some applications we may prefer a word A that can be substituted for word B in all of the contexts in which B occurs.",
        "In other applications, we may prefer a word A that can be substituted for word B in all of the contexts in which A occurs.",
        "For example, asked for a semantically related word to dog, we might say animal, since animal can generally be used in place of dog, whereas we might be less likely to say dog for animal, since dog cannot generally be used in place of animal.",
        "This preference in the direction of the relationship between the two words is not necessarily maintained when one considers language modeling in the face of sparse data.",
        "If we want to learn what other contexts animal can occur in, we might look at the co-occurrences of words such as dog, since we know that dog can generally be replaced by animal.",
        "If we want to learn what other contexts dog can occur in, we are less likely to look at the co-occurrences of animal, since we know that animal can occur in contexts in which dog cannot.",
        "Rather than attempt to find a single universally optimal distributional similarity measure, or propose using a radically different distributional similarity measure in each possible application, we propose a flexible, parameterized framework for calculating distributional similarity (Section 2).",
        "Within this framework, we cast the problem of finding distributionally similar words as one of co-occurrence retrieval (CR), for which we can measure precision and recall by analogy with the way that they are measured in document retrieval.",
        "Different models within this framework allow us to investigate how frequency information is incorporated into the distributional similarity measure.",
        "Different parameter settings within each model allow us to investigate asymmetry in similarity.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the data and the neighbor set comparison technique used throughout our empirical work.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss a number of existing distributional similarity measures and discuss the extent to which these can be simulated by settings within the CR framework.",
        "In Section 5 we evaluate the CR framework on a semantic task (WordNet prediction) and on a language modeling task (pseudo-disambiguation)."

        "A typical approach to performing pseudo-disambiguation is as follows.",
        "A large set of noun-verb direct-object pairs is extracted from a corpus, of which a portion is used as test data and another portion is used as training data.",

        "Noun-verb pairs (n, v1) in the test data are replaced with noun-verb-verb triples (n, v1, v2) and the task is to decide which of the two verbs is the most likely to take the noun as its direct object.",

        "In order to construct the test set from the test data, we took all10 of the test data set aside for each target noun and modified it as follows.",

        "Ten test instances11 were then selected for each target noun in a two-step process of (1) while more than ten triples remained, discarding duplicate triples and (2) randomly selecting ten triples from those remaining after step 1.",
        "At this point, we have 10,000 test instances pertaining to high-frequency nouns and 10,000 test instances pertaining to low-frequency nouns, and there are no biases towards the higher-frequency or lower-frequency nouns within these sets.",
        "Each of these sets was split into five disjoint subsets, each containing two instances for each target noun.",
        "We use these five subsets in two ways.",

        "In fivefold cross validation, we compute the optimal parameter settings in four of the subsets and the error rate at this optimal parameter setting in the remaining subset.",
        "This is repeated five times with a different subset held out each time.",
        "We then compute an average optimal error rate.",
        "We cannot, however, compute an average optimal parameter setting, since this would assume a convex relationship between parameter settings and error rate.",
        "In order to study the relationship between parameter settings and error rate, we combine three of the sets to form a development set and two of the sets to form a test set.",
        "The development set is used to optimize parameters and the test set",
        "to determine error rates at the optimal settings.",
        "In graphs showing the relationship between error rate and parameter settings, it is the error rate in this development set that is shown.",
        "In the case of the CRMs, the parameters that are optimized are β, γ, and k (the number of nearest neighbors).12 For the existing measures, the only parameter to be optimized is k. Having constructed the test sets, the task is to take each test instance (n, v1, v2) and use the nearest neighbors of noun n (as computed from the training data) to decide which of (n, v1) and (n, v2) was the original co-occurrence.",

        "This suggests that distributional similarity can be used in language modeling even when there is relatively little corpus data over which to calculate distributional similarity.",
        "We now consider the effects of the different parameters on performance.",
        "Since we use the development set to determine the optimal parameters, we consider performance on the development set as each parameter is varied.",
        "Table 7 shows the optimized parameter settings in the development set, error rate at these settings in the development set, and error rate at these settings in the test set.",
        "For the CRMs, we considered how the performance varies with each parameter when the other parameters are held constant at their optimum values.",
        "Figure 6 shows how performance varies with β, and Figure 7 shows how performance varies with γ for the additive and difference-weighted t-test based and MI-based CRMs.",
        "For reference, the optimal error rates for the best performing existing distributional similarity measure (simlin) is also shown as a straight line on each graph.",

        "To begin with, considering",
        "Bar chart illustrating cross-validated optimal error rates for each measure when k is optimised.",
        "more neighbors increases performance, since more neighbors allow decisions to be made in a greater number of cases.",
        "However, when k increases beyond an optimal value, a greater number of these decisions will be in the wrong direction, since these words are not very similar to the target word, leading to a decrease in performance.",
        "In a small number of cases (when using the ALLR-based CRMs or the WMI-based CRMs for high frequency nouns), performance peaks at k = 1.",
        "This suggests that these measures may be very good at finding a few very close neighbors.",
        "The majority of models, including the additive t-test based and additive MI-based CRMs, perform significantly better at low values of γ (0.25-0.5) and high values of β (around 0.8).",
        "This indicates that a potential neighbor with high-precision retrieval of informative features is more useful than one with high-recall retrieval.",
        "In other words, it seems that it is better to sacrifice being able to make decisions on every test instance with a small number of neighbors in favor of not having neighbors that predict incorrect verb co-occurrences.",
        "This also suggests why we saw fairly low performance by the α- skew divergence measure on this task, since it is closest to a high-recall setting in the additive t-test based model.",
        "The low values of γ indicate that a combination of precision and recall that is closer to a weighted arithmetic mean is generally better than one that is closer to an unweighted harmonic mean.",
        "However, this does not hold for the t-test based CRMs for low-frequency nouns.",
        "Here a higher value of γ is optimal, indicating that, in this case, requiring both recall and precision results in high performance."

        "Here, we cast the problem of measuring distributional similarity as one of co-occurrence retrieval (CR), for which we can measure precision and recall by analogy with the way they are measured in document retrieval.",
        "This CR framework has then allowed us to systematically explore various characteristics of distributional similarity measures.",
        "First, we asked whether lexical substitutability is necessarily symmetric.",
        "To this end, we have explored the merits of symmetry and asymmetry in a similarity measure by varying the relative importance attached to precision and recall.",
        "We have seen that as the distribution of word B moves away from being identical to that of word A, its similarity with A can decrease along one or both of two dimensions.",
        "When B occurs in contexts that word A does not, precision is lost but B may remain a high-recall neighbor of word A.",
        "When B does not occur in contexts that A does, recall is lost but B may remain a high-precision neighbor of word A.",
        "Through our experimental work, which is more thorough than that presented in Weeds and Weir (2003b), we have shown that the kind of neighbor preferred appears to depend on the application in hand.",
        "High-precision neighbors were more useful in the language modeling task of pseudo-disambiguation and high-recall neighbors were more highly correlated with WordNet-derived neighbor sets.",
        "Thus, similarity appears to be inherently asymmetric.",
        "Further, it would seem unlikely that any single, unparameterized measure of distributional similarity would be able to do better on both tasks.",
        "Performance of CRMs with respect to β (at optimal values of k and γ).",
        "Second, we asked whether all contexts are equally important in the calculation of distributional similarity.",
        "To this end, we have explored the way in which frequency information is utilized using different co-occurrence retrieval models (CRMs).",
        "Using different weight functions, we have investigated the relative importance of different co-occurrence types.",
        "In earlier work (Weeds and Weir 2003b), we saw that using MI to weight features gave improved performance on the two evaluation tasks over type-based or token-based CRMs.",
        "Here, we have seen that further gains can be made by using the t-test as a weight function.",
        "This leads to significant improvements on the pseudo-disambiguation task for all nouns and marginal improvements on the WordNet prediction task for low-frequency nouns.",
        "To some extent, this supports the findings of Curran and Moens (2002), who investigated a number of weight functions for distributional similarity and showed that the t-test performed better than a number of other weight functions including MI.",
        "Third, we asked whether it is necessary to consider the difference in extent to which each word appears in each context.",
        "To this end, we have herein proposed difference",
        "Performance of CRMs with respect to γ (at optimal values of k and β).",
        " weighted versions of each model in which the similarity of two words in respect of an individual feature is defined using the same principles that we use to define the similarity of two words in respect of all their features.",
        "We have compared these difference-weighted CRMs to their additive counterparts and shown that difference-weighting does not seem to be a major factor and does not improve results when using the best-performing CRMs.",
        "Another important contribution of this work on co-occurrence retrieval is a better understanding of existing distributional similarity measures.",
        "By comparing existing measures with the CR framework, we can analyze their CR characteristics.",
        "As discussed in Weeds and Weir (2003b), the Dice Coefficient and Jaccard’s Coefficient are exactly simulated by γ = 1 in the additive type-based model and Lin’s Measure is almost equivalent to the harmonic mean of precision and recall in the additive MI-based model.",
        "Here, we also show that the L1 Norm is exactly simulated by the (unparameterized) difference-weighted token-based model, Hindle’s Measure is exactly simulated by γ = 0, β = 0 in the additive MI-based model, and the α-skew divergence measure is most similar to high-recall settings in the additive t-test based CRM.",
        "Knowing that Lin’s Measure is almost equivalent to the harmonic mean of precision and recall in the additive MI-based model explains why this measure does badly on the WordNet prediction task for low-frequency nouns.",
        "We have seen that recall is more important than precision in the WordNet prediction task, whereas the nearest neighbors of a target noun according to Lin’s Measure have both high precision and high recall.",
        "Conversely, knowing that the α-skew divergence measure is most closely approximated by high-recall settings in the additive t-test based model explains why this measure performs poorly on the pseudo-disambiguation task, since we have seen that high precision is required for optimal performance on this task.",
        "Finally, our evaluation of measures has been performed over a set of 2,000 nouns, and we have shown that the performance of distributional similarity techniques for low-frequency nouns is not significantly lower than for high-frequency nouns.",
        "This suggests that distributional techniques might be used even when there is relatively little data available.",
        "In the distributional domain, this means that we can use probability estimation techniques for rare words with greater confidence.",
        "In the semantic domain, we might be able to use distributional techniques to extend existing semantic resources to cover rare or new words or automatically generate domain-, genre-, or dialect-specific resources.",
        "There are a number of major directions in which this work can be extended.",
        "First, although the set of CRMs defined here is more extensive than that defined in Weeds and Weir (2003b), it is still not exhaustive, and other models might be proposed.",
        "Further, it would be interesting to combine CRMs with the feature reweighting scheme of Geffet and Dagan (2004).",
        "These authors compare distributional similarity scores with human judgments of semantic entailment and show that substantial (approximately 10%) improvements over using Lin’s Measure can be achieved by first calculating similarity using Lin’s Measure and then recalculating similarity using a relative feature focus score, which indicates how many of a word’s nearest neighbors shared that feature.",
        "Second, there are other potential application-based tasks that could be used to evaluate CRMs and distributional similarity methods in general.",
        "In particular, we see potential for the use of distributional similarity methods in prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity resolution.",
        "This task has been previously tackled using semantic classes to predict what is ultimately distributional information.",
        "Accordingly, we believe that it should be possible to do better using the CR framework.",
        "Finally, in order to be able to truly rival manually generated thesauri, distributional techniques need to be able to distinguish between different semantic relations such as synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy.",
        "These are important linguistic distinctions, particularly in the semantic domain, since we are unlikely, say, to want to replace a word with its antonym.",
        "Weeds, Weir, and McCarthy (2004) give preliminary results on the the use of precision and recall to distinguish between hypernyms and hyponyms in sets of distributionally related words."
