        "The automated analysis of large corpora has many useful applications (Church and Mercer 1993).",
        "Suitable language repositories can be used for deriving models of a given natural language, as needed for speech recognition (Ostendorf, Digalakis, and Kimball 1996; Jelinek 1997; Chelba and Jelinek 2002), language generation (Oh and Rudickny 2000), and text correction (Kukich 1992; Amengual and Vidal 1998; Strohmaier et al.",
        "2003b).",
        "Other corpus-based methods determine associations between words (Grefenstette 1992; Dunning 1993; Lin et al.",
        "1998), which yields a basis for computing thesauri, or dictionaries of terminological expressions and multiword lexemes (Gaizauskas, Demetriou, and Humphreys 2000; Grefenstette 2001).",
        "From multilingual texts, translation lexica can be generated (Gale and Church 1991; Kupiec 1993; Kumano and Hirakawa 1994; Boutsis, Piperidis, and Demiros 1999; Grefenstette 1999).",
        "The analysis of technical texts is used to automatically build dictionaries of acronyms for a given field (Taghva and Gilbreth 1999; Yeates, Bainbridge, and Witten 2000), and related methods help to compute dictionaries that cover the special vocabulary of a given thematic area (Strohmaier et al.",
        "2003a).",
        "In computer-assisted language learning (CALL), mining techniques for corpora are used to create individualized and user-centric exercises for grammar and text understanding (Schwartz, Aikawa, and Pahud 2004; Brown and Eskenazi 2004; Fletcher 2004a).",
        "By Zipf's law, most words, phrases, and specific grammatical constructions have a very low frequency.",
        "Furthermore, the number of text genres and special thematic",

        "areas that come with their own picture of language is large.",
        "This explains that most of the aforementioned applications can only work when built on top of huge heterogeneous corpora.",
        "Since the Web represents by far the largest public repository for natural language texts, and since Web search engines such as Google offer simple access to pages where language material of a given orthographic, grammatical, or thematic kind is found, many recent experiments and technologies use the Web as a corpus (Kehoe and Renouf 2002; Morley, Renouf, and Kehoe 2003; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003; Resnik and Smith 2003; Way and Gough 2003; Fletcher 2004b).",
        "One potential problem for Web-based corpus linguistics is caused by the fact that words and phrases occurring in Web pages are sometimes erroneous.",
        "Typing errors represent one widespread phenomenon.",
        "Many Web pages, say, in English, are written by non-native speakers, or by persons with very modest language competence.",
        "As a consequence, spelling errors and grammatical bugs result.",
        "The character sets that are used for writing Web pages are often not fully adequate for the alphabet of a given language, which represents another systematic source for inaccuracies.",
        "Furthermore, a small number of texts found in the Web is obtained via optical character recognition (OCR), which may again lead to garbled words.",
        "As a consequence of these and other error sources, the Web contains a considerable number of \"bad\" pages with language material that is inappropriate for corpus construction.",
        "In one way or the other, all the aforementioned applications are affected by these inadequacies.",
        "While the problem is probably not too serious for approaches that merely collect statistical information about given language items, the construction of dictionaries and related linguistic knowledge bases – which are, after all, meant to be used in different scenarios of automated language processing – becomes problematic if too many erroneous entries are retrieved from Web pages.",
        "Obviously, in computer-assisted language learning it is a principal concern that words and phrases from the Web that are presented to the user are error free.",
        "In discussions we found that problems resulting from erroneous language material in Web pages for distinct applications are broadly acknowledged (see also Section 4.4 of Kilgarriff and Grefenstette [2003]).",
        "Still, to the best of our knowledge, a serious analysis of the frequency and distribution of orthographic errors in the Web is missing, and no general methods have been developed that help to detect and exclude pages with too many erroneous words.",
        "In this article we first report on a series of experiments that try to answer the following questions:",
        "1.",
        "What are important types of orthographic errors found in Web pages?",
        "2.",
        "How frequent are errors of a given kind?",
        "For a given error level (percentage of erroneous tokens) t, which percentage of Web pages exceeds error level t?",
        "3.",
        "How do these figures depend on the language, on the thematic area, and on the genre of the Web pages that are considered?",
        "How do these figures depend on the document format of the Web pages that are considered?",
        "We then look at the problem indicated above.",
        "4.",
        "Which methods help to automatically detect Web pages with many orthographic errors?",
        "Which methods help to mark orthographic errors found in Web pages?",
        "To answer questions 1-3, we retrieved and analyzed a collection of large English and German corpora from the Web, using suitable queries to Web search engines.",
        "In our error statistics we wanted to distinguish between (1) \"general\" Web pages collected without any specific thematic focus on the one hand and Web pages from specific thematic areas on the other hand, and (2) between Web pages written in HTML and Web documents written in PDF.",
        "To cover the first difference, for both languages we retrieved two general corpora as well as a number of corpora for specific thematic areas.",
        "All these corpora only contain HTML pages.",
        "A parallel series of general corpora was collected that are composed of PDF documents.",
        "Details are provided in Section 2.",
        "Special Vocabulary.",
        "Web pages often contain tokens that do not belong to the standard vocabulary of the respective language.",
        "Typical categories are, for example, special names, slang, archaic language, expressions from foreign languages, and special expressions from computer science/programming.",
        "Classification and detection of special vocabulary is outside the scope of the present article.",
        "Since sometimes a clear separation between special vocabulary and errors is difficult, we briefly come back to this problem in Section 5.4.",
        "Proper Errors.",
        "Focusing on garbled standard vocabulary, tokens may be seriously damaged in an \"unexplainable\" way.",
        "Most of the remaining errors can be assigned to one of the four classes mentioned above:",
        "• typing errors (i.e., errors caused by a confusion of keys when typing a document),",
        "• spelling errors (\"cognitive\" errors resulting from insufficient language competence),",
        "• errors resulting from inadequate character encoding, and",
        "• OCR errors.",
        "In order to estimate the number of errors of a given kind in the corpora, special error dictionaries were built.",
        "These dictionaries, which only list garbled words of a given language that do not accidentally represent correct words, try to cover a high number of the conventional errors of each type that are typically found in Web pages and other documents.",
        "Section 3 motivates the use of error dictionaries for error detection.",
        "Details of the construction of the error dictionaries are discussed in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we estimate the number of orthographic errors in the corpora that remain undetected because they do not occur in the error dictionaries.",
        "We also estimate the percentage of correct tokens of the corpora that are erroneously treated as errors since they appear in the error dictionaries.",
        "Our results show that the number of tokens of a text that appear in the error dictionaries can be considered as a lower approximation of the number of real orthographic errors.",
        "In Section 6, we describe the distribution of orthographic errors of the types distinguished above in the general test corpora, counting occurrences of entries of the error dictionaries.",
        "Section 7 summarizes the most important differences that arise when using PDF corpora, or corpora for special thematic areas.",
        "Section 8 presents various results that illuminate the relationship between the error rate of a document and its genre.",
        "In our experiments we observed in all corpora a rich spectrum of error rates, ranging from perfect documents to a small number of clearly unacceptable pages.",
        "This motivates the design of filters that efficiently recognize and reject pages with an error rate beyond a user-specified threshold.",
        "The construction of appropriate filters is described in Section 9, where we also demonstrate the effect of using these filters, comparing the figures obtained in Section 6 with the corresponding figures for filtered corpora.",
        "Filters work surprisingly well due to a Zipf-like distribution of error frequencies in Web pages.",
        "In Section 10, we present two experiments that exemplify how the methods developed in the article may in fact help to improve corpus-based methods.",
        "The general question of how deeply distinct methods from computational linguistics based on Web corpora are affected by orthographic errors in Web pages and to what extent the methods developed in the article help to remedy these deficiencies are too complex to be discussed here.",
        "The main insights and contributions are summarized in the Conclusion (Section 11) where we also comment on future work and on some practical difficulties one has to face when collecting and analyzing large corpora from the Web."

        "Error dictionaries, even subdictionaries of modest size, can be used as filters that help to detect and eliminate pages with many orthographic errors.",
        "Filters with user-defined thresholds work well for both languages.",
        "Obviously, the possibility of deleting pages with many orthographic errors and of marking all entries of error dictionaries in the remaining documents opens a wide range of interesting applications in distinct areas of corpus linguistics.",
        "To exemplify possible applications we showed how to improve the quality of Web-crawled dictionaries for text correction.",
        "With these filtered dictionaries, higher values for correction accuracy were obtained than with those directly obtained from Web crawls.",
        "In a second experiment, we showed how error dictionaries may be used to improve the automated collection of translation correspondences, avoiding translation pairs with orthographic errors.",
        "Going beyond corpus linguistics, it might be interesting to design (special modes of) Web search engines where the error rate of a given document is used as one parameter in the ranking of answers.",
        "In many search scenarios, answer documents with a large number of orthographic errors appear to be less reliable, and the user might wish to concentrate on \"professional\" or carefully edited Web pages.",
        "In our practical work we found that the collection and analysis of very large Web corpora is difficult for many reasons.",
        "For example, it is not clear how to treat pages with artificial vocabulary that is only introduced to obtain a better ranking.",
        "We learned that often these junk lists are intensionally enriched with many orthographic errors to obtain a better ranking, in particular for erroneous queries.",
        "In our experiments, some of these pages were found immediately, looking at error rates, and excluded.",
        "Later, when inspecting documents for genre classification, other less eye-catching examples were found.",
        "Some portions of text occurred in several documents.",
        "The conversion of Web pages into ASCII represents a potential source for new errors.",
        "In particular the conversion of German PDF documents to ASCII turned out to be very error prone.",
        "Nonstandard vocabulary (special names, foreign language expressions, archaic language, programming code, slang, etc.)",
        "is another source that makes various pages inappropriate for corpus construction.",
        "One step for future work is the development of special dictionaries for frequent foreign language expressions, archaic language, programming code, and slang.",
        "Special dictionaries for these expressions would not only help to detect and exclude pages with a high amount of nonstandard vocabulary, but they could also be used as additional filters in the construction of error dictionaries.",
        "The results in Section 5.2 indicate that the overproduction of our error dictionaries could be reduced in a significant way by eliminating entries that represent expressions of the earlier-mentioned type.",
        "As a matter of fact, new types of spelling errors were found during the experiments described earlier.",
        "It might be interesting to enlarge the error dictionaries for spelling errors, taking the new patterns into account.",
        "We also found that enlarged error dictionaries that store with each garbled entry the correct word from which it was derived are very useful for error correction.",
        "In contrast to our first intuitions, the number of ambiguities arising from this correction strategy is small, and the predictive power of enlarged error dictionaries is high.",
        "More details on text correction with error dictionaries will be given in a forthcoming paper."
