        "The discriminative reranking methods allow us to incorporate various kinds of features to distinguish the correct parse tree from all other candidates.",
        "With such feature design flexibility, it is non-trivial to employ an appropriate feature set that has a good discriminative ability for parse reranking.",
        "In early studies, feature sets were given heuristically by simply preparing task-dependent feature templates (Collins, 2000; Collins, 2002).",
        "These ad-hoc solutions might provide us with reasonable levels of per",
        "formance.",
        "However, they are highly task dependent and require careful design to create the optimal feature set for each task.",
        "Kernel methods offer an elegant solution to these problems.",
        "They can work on a potentially huge or even infinite number of features without a loss of generalization.",
        "The best known kernel for modeling a tree is the tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002), which argues that a feature vector is implicitly composed of the counts of subtrees.",
        "Although kernel methods are general and can cover almost all useful features, the set of subtrees that is used is extremely redundant.",
        "The main question addressed in this paper concerns whether it is possible to achieve a comparable or even better accuracy using just a small and non-redundant set of subtrees.",
        "In this paper, we present a new application of boosting for parse reranking.",
        "While tree kernel implicitly uses the all-subtrees representation, our boosting algorithm uses it explicitly.",
        "Although this set-up makes the feature space large, the 11-norm regularization achived by boosting automatically selects a small and relevant feature set.",
        "Such a small feature set is useful in practice, as it is interpretable and makes the parsing (reranking) time faster.",
        "We also incorporate a variant of the branch-and-bound technique to achieve efficient feature selection in each boosting iteration."
