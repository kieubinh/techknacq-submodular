        "Existing work has typically been based on techniques that extract key textual elements, such as keywords (also known as significant terms) as weighed by their tf*idf score, or concepts (such as events or entities) with linguistic and/or statistical analysis.",
        "Then, sentences are selected according to either the important textual units they contain or certain types of inter-sentence relations they hold.",
        "Event-based summarization which has emerged recently attempts to select and organize sentences in a summary with respect to events or sub-events that the sentences describe.",
        "With regard to the concept of events, people do not have the same definition when introducing it in different domains.",
        "While traditional linguistics work on semantic theory of events and the semantic structures of verbs, studies in information retrieval (IR) within topic detection and tracking framework look at events as narrowly defined topics which can be categorized or clustered as a set of related documents (TDT).",
        "IR events are broader (or to say complex) events in the sense that they may include happenings and their causes, consequences or even more extended effects.",
        "In the information extraction (IE) community, events are defined as the pre-specified and structured templates that relate an action to its participants, times, locations and other entities involved (MUC-7).",
        "IE defines what people call atoRgaragess of their distinct perspectives, people all agree that events are collections of activities together with associated entities.",
        "To apply the concept of events in the context of text summarization, we believe it is more appropriate to consider events at the sentence level, rather than at the document level.",
        "To avoid the complexity of deep semantic and syntactic processing, we complement the advantages of statistical techniques from the IR community and structured information provided by the IE community.",
        "Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 369–376, Sydney, July 2006. c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics We propose to extract semi-structured events with shallow natural language processing (NLP) techniques and estimate their importance for inclusion in a summary with IR techniques.",
        "Though it is most likely that documents narrate more than one similar or related event, most event-based summarization techniques reported so far explore the importance of the events independently.",
        "Motivated by this observation, this paper addresses the task of event-relevance based summarization and explores what sorts of relevance make a contribution.",
        "To this end, we investigate intra-event relevance, that is action-entity relevance, and inter-event relevance, that is event-event relevance.",
        "While intra-event relevance is measured with frequencies of the associated events and entities directly, inter-event relevance is derived indirectly from a general WordNet similarity utility, distributional similarity in the documents to be summarized, named entity clustering and so on.",

        "Event-based summarization has been investigated in recent research.",
        "It was first presented in (Daniel, Radev and Allison, 2003), who treated a news topic in multi-document summarization as a series of sub-events according to human understanding of the topic.",
        "They determined the degree of sentence relevance to each sub-event through human judgment and evaluated six extractive approaches.",
        "Their paper concluded that recognizing the sub-events that comprise a single news event is essential for producing better summaries.",
        "However, it is difficult to automatically break a news topic into sub-events.",
        "Later, atomic events were defined as the relationships between the important named entities (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004), such as participants, locations and times (which are called relations) through the verbs or action nouns labeling the events themselves (which are called connectors).",
        "They evaluated sentences based on co-occurrence statistics of the named entity relations and the event connectors involved.",
        "The proposed approach claimed to outperform conventional tf*idf approach.",
        "Apparently, named entities are key elements in their model.",
        "However, the constraints defining events seemed quite stringent.",
        "The application of dependency parsing, anaphora and co-reference resolution in recognizing events were presented involving NLP and IE techniques more or less (Yoshioka and Hara-guchi, 2004), (Vanderwende, Banko and Menezes, 2004) and (Leskovec, Grobelnik and Fraling, 2004).",
        "Rather than pre-specifying events, these efforts extracted (verb)-(dependent relation)-(noun) triples as events and took the triples to form a graph merged by relations.",
        "As a matter of fact, events in documents are related in some ways.",
        "Judging whether the sentences are salient or not and organizing them in a coherent summary can take advantage from event relevance.",
        "Unfortunately, this was neglected in most previous work.",
        "Barzilay and La-pata (2005) exploited the use of the distributional and referential information of discourse entities to improve summary coherence.",
        "While they captured text relatedness with entity transition sequences, i.e. entity-based summarization, we are particularly interested in relevance between events in event-based summarization.",
        "Extractive summarization requires ranking sentences with respect to their importance.",
        "Successfully used in Web-link analysis and more recently in text summarization, Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is one of the most popular ranking algorithms.",
        "It is a kind of graph-based ranking algorithm deciding on the importance of a node within a graph by taking into account the global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying on only the local node-specific information.",
        "A graph can be constructed by adding a node for each sentence, phrase or word.",
        "Edges between nodes are established using inter-sentence similarity relations as a function of content overlap or grammatically relations between words or phrases.",
        "The application of PageRank in sentence extraction was first reported in (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "The similarity between two sentence nodes according to their term vectors was used to generate links and define link strength.",
        "The same idea was followed and investigated exten",
        "sively (Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "Yoshioka and Haragu-chi (2004) went one step further toward event-based summarization.",
        "Two sentences were linked if they shared similar events.",
        "When tested on TSC-3, the approach favoured longer summaries.",
        "In contrast, the importance of the verbs and nouns constructing events was evaluated with PageRank as individual nodes aligned by their dependence relations (Vanderwende, 2004; Leskovec, 2004).",
        "Although we agree that the fabric of event constitutions constructed by their syntactic relations can help dig out the important events, we have two comments.",
        "First, not all verbs denote event happenings.",
        "Second, semantic similarity or relatedness between action words should be taken into account."
