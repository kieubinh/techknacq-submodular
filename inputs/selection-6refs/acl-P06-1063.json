        "We introduce a new method for recovering empty nodes and their antecedents (capturing long distance dependencies) from parser output in CFG trees using LFG f-structure reentrancies.",
        "Our main findings are (i) using QuestionBank training data improves parser performance to 89.75% labelled bracketing f-score, an increase of almost 11% over the baseline; (ii) back-testing experiments on non-question data (Penn-II WSJ Section 23) shows that the retrained parser does not suffer a performance drop on non-question material; (iii) ablation experiments show that the size of training material provided by QuestionBank is sufficient to achieve optimal results; (iv) our method for recovering empty nodes captures long distance dependencies in questions from the ATIS corpus with high precision (96.82%) and low recall (39.38%).",

        "This can limit the applicability of grammatical resources induced from treebanks in that such resources underperform when used on a different type of text or for a specific task.",
        "In this paper we present work on creating QuestionBank, a treebank of parse-annotated questions, which can be used as a supplementary training resource to allow parsers to accurately parse questions (as well as other text).",
        "Alternatively, the resource can be used as a standalone training corpus to train a parser specifically for questions.",
        "Either scenario will be useful in training parsers for use in question answering (QA) tasks, and it also provides a suitable resource to evaluate the accuracy of these parsers on questions.",
        "We use a semi-automatic “bootstrapping” method to create the question treebank from raw text.",
        "We show that a parser trained on the question treebank alone can accurately parse questions.",
        "Training on a combined corpus consisting of the question treebank and an established training set (Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank), the parser gives state-of-the-art performance on both questions and a non-question test set (Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank).",
        "Section 2 describes background work and motivation for the research presented in this paper.",
        "Section 3 describes the data we used to create the corpus.",

        "This shows a negative effect on parser performance even when the test data is not radically different from the training data (both the Penn II and Brown corpora consist primarily of written texts of American English, the main difference is the considerably more varied nature of the text in the Brown corpus).",
