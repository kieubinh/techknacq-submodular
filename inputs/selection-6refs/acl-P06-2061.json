        "A desired feature of computer-assisted translation (CAT) systems is the integration of the human speech into the system, as skilled human translators are faster at dictating than typing the translations (Brown et al., 1994).",
        "Additionally, incorporation of a statistical prediction engine, i.e. a statistical interactive machine translation system, to the CAT system is another useful feature.",
        "A statistical prediction engine provides the completions to what a human translator types (Foster et al., 1997; Och et al., 2003).",
        "Then, one possible procedure for skilled human translators is to provide the oral translation of a given source text and then to post-edit the recognized text.",
        "In the post-editing step, a prediction engine helps to decrease the amount of human interaction (Och et al., 2003).",
        "In a CAT system with integrated speech, two sources of information are available to recognize the speech input: the target language speech and the given source language text.",
        "The target language speech is a human-produced translation of the source language text.",

        "The idea of incorporating ASR and MT models was independently initiated by two groups: researchers at IBM (Brown et al., 1994), and researchers involved in the TransTalk project (Dymetman et al., 1994; Brousseau et al., 1995).",
        "In (Brown et al., 1994), the authors proposed a method to integrate the IBM translation model 2 (Brown et al., 1993) with an ASR system.",
        "The main idea was to design a language model (LM) to combine the trigram language model probability with the translation probability for each target word.",

        "In the TransTalk project, the authors improved the ASR performance by rescoring the ASR N-best lists with a translation model.",
        "They also introduced the idea of a dynamic vocabulary for a speech recognition system where translation models were generated for each source language sentence.",
        "The better performing of the two is the N-best rescoring.",
        "Recently, (Khadivi et al., 2005) and (Paulik et al., 2005a; Paulik et al., 2005b) have studied the integration of ASR and MT models.",
        "The first work showed a detailed analysis of the effect of different MT models on rescoring the ASR N-best lists.",

        "respectively.",
        "They showed improvement in the ASR N-best rescoring when some proposed features are extracted from the MT N-best list.",
        "The main concept among all features was to generate different kinds of language models from the MT N-best list.",
        "All of the above methods are based on an N-best rescoring approach.",
        "In this paper, we study different methods for integrating MT models to ASR word graphs instead of N-best list.",
        "We consider ASR word graphs as finite-state automata (FSA), then the integration of MT models to ASR word graphs can benefit from FSA algorithms.",
        "The ASR word graphs are a compact representation of possible recognition hypotheses.",
        "Thus, the integration of MT models to ASR word graphs can be considered as an N-best rescoring but with very large value for N. Another advantage of working with ASR word graphs is the capability to pass on the word graphs for further processing.",
        "For instance, the resulting word graph can be used in the prediction engine of a CAT system (Och et al., 2003).",
        "The remaining part is structured as follows: in Section 2, a general model for an automatic text dictation system in the computer-assisted translation framework will be described.",

        "We have studied different approaches to integrate MT with ASR models, mainly using finite-state automata.",
        "We have proposed three types of transducers to rescore the ASR word graphs: lexicon-based, phrase-based and fertility-based transducers.",
        "All improvements of the combined models are statistically significant at the 99% level with respect to the baseline system, i.e. ASR only.",
        "In general, N-best rescoring is a simplification of word graph rescoring.",
        "As the size of N-best list is increased, the results obtained by N-best list rescoring approach the results of the word graph rescoring.",
        "But we should consider that the statement is correct when we use exactly the same model and the same implementation to rescore the N-best list and word graph.",
        "Figure 1 shows the effect of the N-best list size on the recognition WER of the evaluation set.",
        "As we expected, the recognition results of N-best rescoring improve as N becomes larger, until the point that the recognition result converges to its optimum value.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, we should not expect that word graph rescoring methods outperform the N-best rescoring method, when the size of N-best lists are large enough.",
        "In Table 2, the recognition results are calculated using a large enough size for N-best lists, a maximum of 5,000 per sentence, which results in the average of 1738 hypotheses",
        "per sentence.",
        "An advantage of the word graph rescoring is the confidence of achieving the best possible results based on a given rescoring model.",
        "The word graph rescoring methods presented in this paper improve the baseline ASR system with statistical significance.",
        "The results are competitive with the best results of N-best rescoring.",
        "For the simple models like IBM-1, the transducer-based integration generates similar or better results than N-best rescoring approach.",
        "For the more complex translation models, IBM-3 to IBM-5, the N-best rescoring produces better results than the transducer-based approach, especially for IBM5.",
        "The main reason is due to exact estimation of IBM-5 model scores on the N-best list, while the transducer-based implementation of IBM-3 to IBM-5 is not exact and simplified.",
        "However, we observe that the fertility-based transducer which can be considered as a simplified version of IBM3 to IBM-5 models can still obtain good results, especially if we compare the results on the evaluation set."
