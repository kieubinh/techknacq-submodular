        "There are many ways to make use of parsers’ output.",
        "One particular form of data that can be extracted from parses is information about subcategorization.",

        "Roland and Jurafsky (1998) have suggested that there are substantial subcategorization differences between written corpora and spoken corpora.",
        "For example, while written corpora show a much higher percentage of passive structures, spoken corpora usually have a higher percentage of zero-anaphora constructions.",
