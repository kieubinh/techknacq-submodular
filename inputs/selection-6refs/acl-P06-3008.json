        "How useful are these six PMs in the prediction of rhetorical relations in Chinese texts?",
        "In our opinion, this question can be answered partly through a comparison with Chinese cue phrases.",
        "Cue phrases are widely discussed and exploited in the literature of both Chinese studies and RST applications as a major surface device.",
        "Unfortunately, Chinese cue phrases in natural texts are difficulty to identify automatically.",
        "As known, Chinese words are made up of 1, 2, or more characters, but there is no explicit word delimiter between any pair of adjacent words in a string of characters.",
        "Thus, they are not known before tokenization (“ fenci” in Chinese, meaning “separating into words”, or “word segmentation” so as to recognize meaningful words out of possible overlaps or combinations).",
        "The task may sound simple, but has been the focus of considerable research efforts (e.g. Webster and Kit, 1992; Guo 1997; Wu, 2003).",
        "Since many cue phrases are made up of high-frequency characters (e.g. “而-ER” in “而 -er” meaning “but/so/and”, “ 然 而 -ran’er” meaning “but/however”, “因而-yin’er” meaning “so/because of this”, “ \" -ergie meaing “in addition” etc.",
        "; “此-ci” in “此后-cihou” meaning “later/hereafter”, “ 因 此-yinci” meaning “as a result”, “ 由 此 看 来 -youcikanlai” meaning “on this ground/hence”, etc.",
        "), a considerable amount of computation must be done before these cue phrases can ever been exploited.",
        "Apart from tokenization, POS and WSD are other necessary steps that should be taken before making use of some common cue phrases.",
        "They are all hard nuts in Chinese language engineering.",
        "Interestingly, many researches done in these three areas have made use of the information carried by PMs (e.g. Sun et al.",
        "1998).",
        "Chan et al.",
        "(2000) did a study on identify Chinese connectives as signals of rhetorical relations for their Chinese summarizer.",
        "Their tests were successful.",
        "But like PMs, Chinese cue phrases are not in a one-to-one mapping relationship with rhetorical relations, either.",
        "In our finished portion of CJPL corpus, we’ve identified 161 Types of cue phrases 12 at or above our EUDA level, recording 539 tokens.",
        "These cue phrases are scattered in 477 EDUAs, indicating 20.5% of the total relations in our finished portion of the corpus.",
        "Our six PMs, on the other hand, have 551 tokens in the same finished portion, delimiting 345 EUDAs (and 206 structural elements), and indicating 14.8% of the total relations.",
        "However, since there are far more types of cue phrases than types of punctuation marks, 90.1% of cue phrases are sparser at or above our EDUA level than the least frequently used PM – Ellipsis in this case.",
        "And Chinese cue phrases don’t signal all the rhetorical relations at all levels.",
        "For instance, CONJUNTION is the most frequently used relation in our annotated text (taking 22.1 % of all the discursive relations), but it doesn’t have strong correlation with any lexical item.",
        "Its most frequent lexical cue is “也 -ye”, taking 2.4%.",
        "ELABORATION is another common relation in CJPL, but it is rarely marked by cue phrases.",
        "ATTRIBUTION, SOLUTIONHOOD and DISJUNCTION are amongst other lowest marked relations in Chinese – they happen to be signaled quite significantly by a punctuation mark.",
        "Given the cost to recognize Chinese cue phrases accurately, the sparseness of many of these cues, and the risk of missing all cue phrases for a particular discursive relation, punctuation marks with strong rhetorical preferences appear to be useful supplements to cue phrases."
