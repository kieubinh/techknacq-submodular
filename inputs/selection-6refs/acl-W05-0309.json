        "There is a pressing need for a consensus on a task-oriented level of semantic representation that can enable the development of powerful new semantic analyzers in the same way that the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) enabled the development of statistical syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001).",
        "We believe that shallow semantics expressed as a dependency structure, i.e., predicate-argument structure, for verbs, participial modifiers, and nom-inalizations provides a feasible level of annotation that would be of great benefit.",
        "This annotation, coupled with word senses, minimal co-reference links, �This work is funded by the NSF via Grant EIA02-05448 .",
        "event identifiers, and discourse and temporal relations, could provide the foundation for a major advance in our ability to automatically extract salient relationships from text.",

        "The Proposition Bank project is a major step towards providing this type of annotation.",
        "It takes a practical approach to semantic representation, adding a layer of predicate argument information, or semantic roles, to the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "The Frame Files that provide guidance to the annotators constitute a rich English lexicon with explicit ties between syntactic realizations and coarse-grained senses, Frame-sets.",
        "PropBank Framesets are distinguished primarily by syntactic criteria such as differences in sub-categorization frames, and can be seen as the top-level of an hierarchy of sense distinctions.",
        "Groupings of fine-grained WordNet senses, such as those developed for Senseval2 (Palmer et al., to appear) provide an intermediate level, where groups are distinguished by either syntactic or semantic criteria.",
        "WordNet senses constitute the bottom level.",
        "The PropBank Frameset distinctions, which can be made consistently by humans and systems (over 90% accuracy for both), are surprisingly compatible with the groupings; 95% of the groups map directly onto a single PropBank frameset sense (Palmer et al., 2004).",
        "The semantic annotation provided by PropBank is only a first approximation at capturing the full richness of semantic representation.",

        "PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is an annotation of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994) with ‘predicate-argument’ structures, using sense tags for highly polysemous words and semantic role labels for each argument.",
        "An important goal is to provide consistent semantic role labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0 John] broke [ARG1 the window] and [ARG1 The window] broke.",
        "PropBank can provide frequency counts for (statistical) analysis or generation components in a machine translation system, but provides only a shallow semantic analysis in that the annotation is close to the syntactic structure and each verb is its own predicate.",
        "In PropBank, semantic roles are defined on a verb-by-verb basis.",
        "An individual verb’s semantic arguments are simply numbered, beginning with 0.",
        "Polysemous verbs have several framesets, corresponding to a relatively coarse notion of word senses, with a separate set of numbered roles, a role-set, defined for each Frameset.",
        "For instance, leave has both a DEPART Frameset ([ARG0 John] left [ARG1 the room]) and a GIVE Frameset, ([ARG0 I] left [ARG1 my pearls] [AR G2 to my daughter-in-law] [ARGM-LOC in my will].)",
        "While most Frame-sets have three or four numbered roles, as many as six can appear, in particular for certain verbs of motion.",

        "There are several other annotation projects, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), Salsa (Ellsworth et al., 2004), and the Prague Tectogrammatics (Haji-cova and Kucerova, 2002), that share similar goals.",
        "Berkeley's FrameNet project, (Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al., 2002) is committed to producing rich semantic frames on which the annotation is based, but it is less concerned with annotating complete texts, concentrating instead on annotating a set of examples for each predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives), and attempting to describe the network of relations among the semantic frames.",
