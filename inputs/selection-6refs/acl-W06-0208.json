        "Information Extraction (IE) is the task of identifying event descriptions in natural language text and extracting information related to those events.",
        "Many IE systems use extraction patterns or rules to identify the relevant information (Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000).",
        "Most of these systems use annotated training data to learn pattern matching rules based on lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic information.",
        "The learned patterns are then used to locate relevant information in new texts.",
        "IE systems typically focus on information about events that are relevant to a specific domain, such as terrorism (Sundheim, 1992; Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Chieu et al., 2003), management succession (Sundheim, 1995; Yangarber et al., 2000), or job announcements (Califf and Mooney, 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 2000).",
        "Supervised learning systems for IE depend on domain-specific training data, which consists of texts associated with the domain that have been manually annotated with event information.",
        "The need for domain-specific training data has several disadvantages.",
        "Because of the manual labor involved in annotating a corpus, and because a new corpus must be annotated for each domain, most annotated IE corpora are relatively small.",
        "Language is so expressive that it is practically impossible for the patterns learned from a relatively small training set to cover all the different ways of describing events.",
        "Consequently, the IE patterns learned from manually annotated training sets typically represent only a subset of the IE patterns that could be useful for the task.",
        "Many recent approaches in natural language processing (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Nigam et al., 2000; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) have recognized the need to use unannotated data to improve performance.",
        "While the Web provides a vast repository of unannotated texts, it is non-trivial to identify texts that belong to a particular domain.",
        "The difficulty is that web pages are not specifically annotated with tags categorizing their content.",
        "Nevertheless, in this paper we look to the Web as a vast dynamic resource for domain-specific IE learning.",
        "Our approach exploits an existing set of IE patterns that were learned from annotated training data to automatically identify new, domain-specific texts from",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics the Web.",
        "These web pages are then used for additional IE training, yielding a new set of domain-specific IE patterns.",
        "Experiments on the MUC-4 test set show that the new IE patterns improve coverage for the domain.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the MUC-4 IE task and data that we use in our experiments.",
        "Section 3 describes how we create a baseline IE system from the MUC-4 training data.",
        "Section 4 describes the collection and preprocessing of potentially relevant web pages.",
        "Section 5 then explains how we use the IE patterns learned from the MUC-4 training set as anchors to learn new IE patterns from the web pages.",
        "We also compute the semantic affinity of each new pattern to automatically infer the type of information that it will extract.",
        "Section 6 shows experimental results for two types of extractions, victims and targets, on the MUC-4 test set.",
        "Finally, Section 7 compares our approach to related research, and Section 8 concludes with ideas for future work.",
        "2 The MUC-4 IE Task and Data The focus of our research is on the MUC-4 information extraction task (Sundheim, 1992), which is to extract information about terrorist events.",
        "The MUC-4 corpus contains 1700 stories, mainly news articles related to Latin American terrorism, and associated answer key templates containing the information that should be extracted from each story.",
        "We focused our efforts on two of the MUC-4 string slots, which require textual extractions: human targets (victims) and physical targets.",
        "The MUC-4 data has proven to be an especially difficult IE task for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the texts are entirely in upper case, roughly 50% of the texts are irrelevant (i.e., they do not describe a relevant terrorist event), and many of the stories that are relevant describe multiple terrorist events that need to be teased apart.",
        "The best results reported across all string slots in MUC-4 were in the 50%-70% range for recall and precision (Sundheim, 1992), with most of the MUC-4 systems relying on heavily hand-engineered components.",
        "Chieu et al.",
        "(2003) recently developed a fully automatic template generator for the MUC-4 IE task.",

        "AutoSlog-TS is a weakly supervised learner that requires two sets of texts for training: texts that are relevant to the domain and texts that are irrelevant to the domain.",
        "The MUC-4 data includes relevance judgments (implicit in the answer keys), which we used to partition our training set into relevant and irrelevant subsets.",
        "AutoSlog-TS’ learning process has two phases.",
        "In the first phase, syntactic patterns are applied to the training corpus in an exhaustive fashion, so that extraction patterns are generated for (literally) every lexical instantiation of the patterns that appears in the corpus.",
        "For example, the syntactic pattern “<subj> PassVP” would generate extraction patterns for all verbs that appear in the corpus in a passive voice construction.",
        "The subject of the verb will be extracted.",
        "In the terrorism domain, some of these extraction patterns might be: “<subj> PassVP(murdered) ” and “<subj> Pass VP(bombed).",
        "” These would match sentences such as: “the mayor was murdered”, and “the embassy and hotel were bombed”.",
        "Figure 1 shows the 17 types of extraction patterns that AutoSlog-TS currently generates.",
        "PassVP refers to passive voice verb phrases (VPs), ActVP refers to active voice VPs, InfVP refers to infinitive VPs, and AuxVP refers to VPs where the main verb is a form of “to be” or “to have”.",
        "Subjects (subj), direct objects (dobj), PP objects (np), and possessives can be extracted by the patterns.",
        "In the second phase, AutoSlog-TS applies all of the generated extraction patterns to the training corpus and gathers statistics for how often each pattern occurs in relevant versus irrelevant texts.",
        "The extraction patterns are subsequently ranked based on their association with the domain, and then a person manually reviews the patterns, deciding which ones to keep1 and assigning thematic roles to them.",
        "We manually defined selectional restrictions for each slot type (victim and target)",
        "and then automatically added these to each pattern when the role was assigned.",
        "On our training set, AutoSlog-TS generated 40,553 distinct extraction patterns.",
        "A person manually reviewed all of the extraction patterns that had a score > 0.951 and frequency > 3.",
        "This score corresponds to AutoSlog-TS’ RlogF metric, described in (Riloff, 1996).",
        "The lowest ranked patterns that passed our thresholds had at least 3 relevant extractions out of 5 total extractions.",
        "In all, 2,808 patterns passed the thresholds.",

        "Unannotated texts have been used for weakly supervised training of IE systems (Riloff, 1996) and in bootstrapping methods that begin with seed words or patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000).",
        "However, those previous systems rely on preexisting domain-specific corpora.",
        "For example, EXDISCO (Yangarber et al., 2000) used Wall Street Journal articles for training.",
        "AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996) and Meta-bootstrapping (Riloff and Jones, 1999) used the MUC-4 training texts.",
        "Meta-bootstrapping was also trained on web pages, but the “domain” was corporate relationships so domain-specific web pages were easily identified simply by gathering corporate web pages.",
        "The KNOWITALL system (Popescu et al., 2004) also uses unannotated web pages for information extraction.",
        "However, this work is quite different from ours because KNOWITALL focuses on extracting domain-independent relationships with the aim of extending an ontology.",
        "In contrast, our work focuses on using the Web to augment a domain-specific, event-oriented IE system with new, automatically generated domain-specific IE patterns acquired from the Web."

        "We have shown that it is possible to learn new extraction patterns for a domain-specific IE task by automatically identifying domain-specific web pages using seed patterns.",
        "Our approach produced a 5% increase in recall for extracting targets and a 3% increase in recall for extracting victims of terrorist events.",
        "Both increases in recall were at the cost of a small loss in precision.",
        "In future work, we plan to develop improved ranking methods and more sophisticated semantic affinity measures to further improve coverage and minimize precision loss.",
        "Another possible avenue for future work is to embed this approach in a bootstrapping mechanism so that the most reliable new IE patterns can be used to collect additional web pages, which can then be used to learn more IE patterns in an iterative fashion.",
        "Also, while most of this process is automated, some human intervention is required to create the search queries for the document collection process, and to generate the seed patterns.",
        "We plan to look into techniques to automate these manual tasks as well."
