        "Different corpus annotation projects are driven by different goals, are applied to different types of data (different genres, different languages, etc.)",
        "and are created by people with different intellectual backgrounds.",
        "As a result of these and other factors, different annotation efforts make different underlying theoretical assumptions.",
        "Thus, no annotation project is really theory-neutral, and in fact, none should be.",
        "It is the theoretical concerns which make it possible to write the specifications for an annotation project and which cause the resulting annotation to be consistent and thus usable for various natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "Of course the theories chosen for annotation projects tend to be theories that are useful for NLP.",
        "They place a high value on descriptive adequacy (they cover the data), they are formalized sufficiently for consistent annotation to be possible, and they tend to share major theoretical assumptions with other annotation efforts, e.g., the noun is the head of the noun phrase, the verb is the head of the sentence, etc.",
        "Thus the term theory-neutral is often used to mean something like NLP -friendly.",
        "Obviously, the annotation compatibility problem that we address here is much simpler than it would be if we had to consider theories which place a low emphasis on NLP-friendly properties (Minimalism.",
        "Optimality Theory, etc.).",
        "As annotation projects are usually research efforts, the inherent theoretical differences may be viewed as part of a search for the truth and the enforcement of adherence to a given (potentially wrong) theory could hamper this search.",
        "In addition, annotation of particular phenomena may be simplified by making theoretical assumptions conducive to describing those phenomena.",
        "For example, relative pronouns (e.g., that in the NP the book that she read) may be viewed as pronouns in an anaphora annotation project, but as intermediate links to arguments for a study of predicate argument structure.",
        "On the other hand, many applications would benefit by merging the results of different annotation projects.",
        "Thus, differences between annotation projects may be viewed as obstacles.",
        "For example, combining two or more corpora annotated with the same information may improve a system (i.e., \"there's no data like more data.\") To accomplish this, it may be necessary to convert corpora annotated according to one set of specifications into a different system or to convert two annotation systems into a third system.",
        "For example, to obtain lots of part of speech data for English, it is advantageous to convert POS tags from several tagsets (see Section 2) into a common form.",
        "For more temporal data than is available in Timex3 format, one might have to convert Timex2 and Timex3 tags into a common form (See Section 5).",
        "Compromises that do not involve conversion can be flawed.",
        "For example, a machine learner may determine that feature A in framework 1 predicts feature A' in framework 2.",
        "However, the system may miss that features A and B in framework 1 actually both correspond to feature A', i.e., they are subtypes.",
        "In our view, directly modeling the parameters of compatibility would be preferable.",
        "Some researchers have attempted to combine a number of different resource annotations into a single merged form.",
        "One motivation is that the merged representation may be more than the sum of its parts.",
        "It is likely that inconsistencies and errors (often induced by task-specific biases) can be identified and adjusted in the merging process; inferences may be drawn from how the component annotation systems interact; a complex annotation in a single framework may be easier for a system to process than several annotations in different frameworks; and a merged framework will help guide further annotation research (Pustojevsky, et.",
        "al.",
        "2005).",
        "Another reason to merge is that a merged resource in language A may be similar to an existing resource in language B.",
        "Thus merging resources may present opportunities for constructing nearly parallel resources, which in turn could prove useful for a multilingual application.",
        "Merging PropBank (Kingsbury, and Palmer 2002) and NomBank (Meyers, et.",
        "al.",
        "2004) would yield a predicate argument structure for nouns and verbs, carrying more similar information to the Praque Dependency TreeBank's TectoGrammatical structure (Hajicova and Ceplova, 2000) than either component.",
        "This report and an expanded online version http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/corpuswg/Annotation Compatibility both describe how to find correspondences between annotation frameworks.",
        "This information can be used to combine various annotation resources in different ways, according to one’s research goals, and, perhaps, could lead to some standards for combining annotation.",
        "This report will outline some of our initial findings in this effort with an eye towards maintaining and updating the online version in the future.",
        "We hope this is a step towards making it easier for systems to use multiple annotation resources."

        "Predicate argument relations are labeled relations between two words/phrases of a linguistic description such that one is a semantic predicate or functor and the other is an argument of this predicate.",

        "relation between the functor read and the phrase The eminent linguist or possibly the word linguist if assuming a dependency framework.",
        "Typically, the functor imposes selectional restrictions on the argument.",
        "The functor may impose word order restrictions as well, although this would only effect \"local\" arguments (e.g., not arguments related by WH extraction).",
        "Another popular way of expressing this relation is to say that read assigns the SUBJECT role to The eminent linguist in that sentence.",
        "Unfortunately, this way of stating the relation sometimes gives the false impression that a particular phrase can only be a member of one such relation.",
        "However, this is clearly not the case, e.g., in The eminent linguist who John admires read the book, The eminent linguist is the argument of: (1) a SUBJECT relation with read and an OBJECT relation with admires.",
        "Predicate-argument roles label relations between items and are not simply tags on phrases (like Named Entity Tags, for example).",
        "There are several reasons why predicate argument relations are of interest for natural language processing, but perhaps the most basic reason is that they provide a way to factor out the common meanings from equivalent or nearly equivalent utterances.",
        "For example, most systems would represent the relation between Mary and eat in much the same way in the sentences: Mary ate the sandwich, The sandwich was eaten by Mary, and Mary wanted to eat the sandwich.",
        "Crucially, the shared aspect of meaning can be modeled as a relation with eat (or ate) as the functor and Mary as the argument (e.g., SUBJECT).",
        "Thus providing predicate",
        "argument relations can provide a way to generalize over data and, perhaps, allow systems to mitigate against the sparse data problem.",
        "Systems for representing predicate argument relations vary drastically in granularity, In particular, there is a long history of disagreement about the appropriate level of granularity of role labeling, the tags used to distinguish between predicate argument relations.",
        "At one extreme, no distinction is made between predicate relations, one simply marks that the functor and argument are in a predicate-argument relation (e.g., unlabeled dependency trees).",
        "In another approach, one might distinguish among the arguments of each predicate with a small set of labels, sometimes numbered -- examples of this approach include Relational Grammar (Perlmutter 1984), PropBank and NomBank.",
        "These labels have different meanings for each functor, e.g., the subject of eat, write and devour are distinct.",
        "This assumes a very high level of granularity, i.e., there are several times the number of possible relations as there are distinct functors.",
        "So 1000 verbs may license as many as 5000 distinct relations.",
        "Under other approaches, a small set of relation types are generalized across functors.",
        "For example, under Relational Grammar's Universal Alignment Hypothesis (Perlmutter and Postal 1984, Rosen 1984), subject, object and indirect object relations are assumed to be of the same types regardless of verb.",
        "These terms thus are fairly coarse-grained distinctions between types of predicate/argument relations between verbs and their arguments.",
        "Some predicate-neutral relations are more fine grained, including Panini's Karaka of 2000 years ago, and many of the more recent systems which make distinctions such as agent, patient, theme, recipient, etc.",
        "(Gruber 1965, Fillmore 1968, Jackendoff 1972).",
        "The (current) International Annotation of Multilingual Text Corpora project (http://aitc.aitc.net.org/nsf/iamtc/) takes this approach.",
        "Critics claim that it can be difficult to maintain consistency across predicates with these systems without constantly increasing the inventory of role labels to describe idiosyncratic relations, e.g., the relation between the verbs multiply, conjugate, and their objects.",
        "For example, only a very idiosyncratic classification could capture the fact that only a large round object (like the Earth) can be the object of circumnavigate.",
        "It can also be unclear which of two role labels apply.",
        "For example, there can be a thin line between a recipient and a goal, e.g., the prepositional object of John sent a letter to the Hospital could take one role or the other depending on a fairly subtle ambiguity.",
        "To avoid these problems, some annotation research (and some linguistic theories) has abandoned predicate-neutral approaches, in favor of the approaches that define predicate relations on a predicate by predicate basis.",
        "Furthermore, various balances have been attempted to solve some of the problems of the predicate-neutral relations.",
        "FrameNet defines roles on a scenario by scenario basis, which limits the growth of the inventory of relation labels and insures consistency within semantic domains or frames.",
        "On the other hand, the predicate-by-predicate approach is arguably less informative then the predicate-neutral approach, allowing for no generalization of roles across predicates.",
        "Thus although PropBank/NomBank use a strictly predicate by predicate approach, there have been some attempts to regularize the numbering for semantically related predicates.",
        "Furthermore, the descriptors used by the annotators to define roles can sometimes be used to help make finer distinctions (descriptors often include familiar role labels like agent, patient, etc.)",
        "The diversity of predicate argument labeling systems and the large inventory of possible role labels make it difficult to provide a simple mapping (like Table 1 for part of speech conversion) between these types of systems.",
