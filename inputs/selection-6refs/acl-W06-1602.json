        "Although superlative noun phrases (the nation’s largest milk producer, the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted, etc.)",
        "received considerable attention in formal linguistics (Szabolcsi, 1986; Gawron, 1995; Heim, 1999; Farkas and Kiss, 2000), this interest is not mirrored in computational linguistics and NLP.",
        "On the one hand, this seems remarkable, since superlatives are fairly frequently found in natural language.",
        "On the other hand, this is probably not that surprising, given that their semantic complexity requires deep linguistic analysis that most wide-coverage NLP systems do not provide.",
        "But even if NLP systems incorporated linguistic insights for the automatic processing of superlatives, it might not be of help: the formal semantics literature on superlatives focuses on linguistically challenging examples (many of them artificially constructed) which might however rarely occur in real data and would therefore have little impact on the performance of NLP systems.",
        "Indeed, no corpus-based studies have been conducted to get a comprehensive picture of the variety of configurations superlatives exhibit, and their distribution in real occurring data.",
        "In this paper we describe our work on the analysis of superlative adjectives, which is empirically grounded and is implemented into an existing wide-coverage text understanding system.",
        "To get an overview of the behaviour of superlatives in text, we annotated newswire data, as well as queries obtained from search engines logs.",
        "On the basis of this corpus study, we propose, implement and evaluate a syntactic and semantic analysis for superlatives.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated approach to the interpretation of superlatives for open-domain texts that is grounded on actual corpus-evidence and thoroughly evaluated.",
        "Some obvious applications that would benefit from this work are question answering, recognition of entailment, and more generally relation extraction systems."

        "Accordingly, “the oldest character” can be interpreted as the character such that there is no older character, in the given context.",

        "The comparison set denotes the set of entities that are compared to each other with respect to a certain dimension (see Section 2.3).",
        "In “the oldest character in the book”, the members of the comparison set are characters in the book, and the dimension of comparison is age.",

        "We have presented the first empirically grounded study of superlatives, and shown the feasibility of their semantic interpretation in an automatic fashion.",
        "Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Discourse Representation Theory we have implemented a system that is able to recognise a superlative expression and its comparison set with high accuracy.",
        "For developing and testing our system, we have created a collection of over 3,000 instances of superlatives, both in newswire text and in natural language questions.",
        "This very first corpus of superlatives allows us to get a comprehensive picture of the behaviour and distribution of superlatives in real occurring data.",
        "Thanks to such broad view of the phenomenon, we were able discover issues previously unnoted in the formal semantics literature, such as the interaction of prenominal possessives and superlatives, which cause problems at the syntax-semantics interface in the determination of the comparison set.",
        "Similarly problematic are hyphenated superlatives, which are tagged as normal adjectives in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Moreover, this work provides a concrete way of evaluating the output of a stochastic wide-coverage parser trained on the CCGBank (Hock-enmaier and Steedman, 2002).",
        "With respect to superlatives, our experiments show that the quality of the raw output is not entirely satisfactory.",
        "However, we have also shown that some simple post-processing rules can increase the performance considerably.",
        "This might indicate that the way superlatives are annotated in the CCGbank, although consistent, is not fully adequate for the purpose of generating meaningful semantic representations, but probably easy to amend."

      "text": [
        "Given the syntactic and semantic complexity of superlative expressions, there is still wide scope for improving the coverage and accuracy of our system.",
        "One obvious improvement is to amend CCGbank in order to avoid the need for postpro-cessing rules, thereby also allowing the creation of more accurate language models.",
        "Another aspect which we have neglected in this study but want to consider in future work is the interaction between superlatives and focus (Heim, 1999; Gawron, 1995).",
        "Also, only one of the possible types of superlative was considered, namely the attributive case.",
        "In future work we will consider the interpretation of predicative and adverbial superlatives, as well as comparative expressions.",
        "Finally, we would like to investigate the extent to which existing NLP systems (such as open-domain QA systems) can benefit from a detailed analysis of superlatives."
