        "The current study is a response to a question that proponents of syntactically-informed machine translation frequently encounter: How sensitive is a syntactically-informed machine translation system to the quality of the input syntactic analysis?",
        "It has been shown that phrasal machine translation systems are not affected by the quality of the input word alignments (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "This finding has generally been cast in favorable terms: such systems are robust to poor quality word alignment.",
        "A less favorable interpretation of these results might be to conclude that phrasal statistical machine translation (SMT) systems do not stand to benefit from improvements in word alignment.",
        "In a similar vein, one might ask whether contemporary syntactically-informed machine translation systems would benefit from improvements in parse accuracy.",
        "One possibility is that current syntactically-informed SMT systems are deriving only limited value from the syntactic analyses, and would therefore not benefit from improved analyses.",
        "Another possibility is that syntactic analysis does indeed contain valuable information that could be exploited by machine learning techniques, but that current parsers are not of sufficient quality to be of use in SMT.",
        "With these questions and concerns, let us begin.",
        "Following some background discussion we describe a set of experiments intended to elucidate the impact of parse quality on SMT."

        "Various combinations of these features are used, for example a new feature is created that combines the POS of the parent, lexeme of the parent, POS of the child and lexeme of the child.",
        "Each feature is also conjoined with the direction and distance of the parent, e.g. does the child precede or follow the parent, and how many tokens intervene?",

        "Each source treelet is matched to a treelet translation pair; together, the target language treelets in those treelet translation pairs will form the target translation.",

        "Finally the ordering of all the nodes is determined, and the target tree is specified, and the target sentence is produced by reading off the labels of the nodes in order.",
        "Translations are scored according to a log-linear combination of feature functions, each scoring different aspects of the translation process.",

        "Despite the degradation in parse accuracy caused by the dramatic differences between the Wall Street Journal text and the technical articles, the treelet SMT system was able to extract useful patterns.",
        "Research on syntactically-informed SMT is not impeded by the accuracy of contemporary parsers.",
        "One significant finding is that as few as 250 sentences suffice to train a dependency parser for use in the treelet SMT framework.",
        "To date our research has focused on translation from English to other languages.",
        "One concern in applying the treelet SMT framework to translation from languages other than English has been the expense of data annotation: would we require 40,000 sentences annotated for syntactic dependencies, i.e., an amount comparable to the Penn Treebank, in order to train a parser that was sufficiently accurate to achieve the machine translation quality that we have seen when translating from English?",
        "The current study gives hope that source languages can be added with relatively modest investments in data annotation.",
        "As more data is annotated with syntactic dependencies and more accurate parsers are trained, we would hope to see similar improvements in machine translation output.",
        "We challenge others who are conducting research on syntactically-informed SMT to verify whether or to what extent their systems are sensitive to parse quality."
