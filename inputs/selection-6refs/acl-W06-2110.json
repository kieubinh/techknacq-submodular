        "Multiword expressions (hereafter MWEs) are lexical items that can be decomposed into multiple simplex words and display lexical, syntactic and/or semantic idiosyncracies (Sag et al., 2002; Calzolari et al., 2002).",
        "In the case of English, MWEs are conventionally categorised syntactico-semantically into classes such as compound nominals (e.g. New York, apple juice, GM car), verb particle constructions (e.g. hand in, battle on), non-decomposable idioms (e.g. a piece of cake, kick the bucket) and light-verb constructions (e.g. make a mistake).",
        "MWE research has focussed largely on their implications in language understanding, fluency and robustness (Pearce, 2001; Sag et al., 2002; Copestake and Lascarides, 1997; Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Wid-dows and Dorow, 2005).",
        "In this paper, our goal is to identify individual token instances of English verb particle constructions (VPCs hereafter) in running text.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we follow Baldwin (2005) in adopting the simplifying assumption that VPCs: (a) consist of a head verb and a unique prepositional particle (e.g. hand in, walk off); and (b) are either transitive (e.g. hand in, put on) or intransitive (e.g. battle on).",
        "A defining characteristic of transitive VPCs is that they can generally occur with either joined (e.g.",
        "He put on the sweater) or split (e.g.",
        "He put the sweater on) word order.",
        "In the case that the object is pronominal, however, the VPC must occur in split word order (c.f.",
        "*He handed in it) (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002; Villavicencio, 2003).",
        "The semantics of the VPC can either derive transparently from the semantics of the head verb and particle (e.g. walk off) or be significantly removed from the semantics of the head verb and/or particle (e.g. lookup); analogously, the selectional preferences of VPCs can mirror those of their head verbs or alternatively diverge markedly.",
        "The syntax of the VPC can also coincide with that of the head verb (e.g. walk off) or alternatively diverge (e.g. lift off).",
        "In the following, we review relevant past research on VPCs, focusing on the extraction/identification of VPCs and the prediction of the compositionality/productivity of VPCs.",
        "There is a modest body of research on the identification and extraction of VPCs.",
        "Note that in the case of VPC identification we seek to detect individual VPC token instances in corpus data, whereas in the case of VPC extraction we seek to arrive at an inventory of VPC types/lexical items based on analysis of token instances in corpus data.",

        "While our interest is in VPC identification – a fundamentally syntactic task – we draw on the shallow semantic processing employed in these methods in modelling the semantics of VPCs relative to their base verbs.",
        "The contribution of this paper is to combine syntactic and semantic features in the task of VPC identification.",
        "The basic intuition behind the proposed method is that the selectional preferences of VPCs over predefined argument positions,2 should provide insight into whether a verb and preposition in a given sentential context combine to form a VPC (e.g. Kim handed in the paper) or alternatively constitute a verb-PP (e.g. Kim walked in the room).",
        "That is, we seek to identify individual preposition token instances as intransitive prepositions (i.e. prepositional particles) or transitive particles based on analysis of the governing verb.",
