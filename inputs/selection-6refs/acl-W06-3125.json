        "The statistical machine translation approach used in this work implements a log-linear combination of feature functions along with a translation model which is based on bilingual n-grams (de Gispert and Mari˜no, 2002).",
        "This translation model differs from the well known phrase-based translation approach (Koehn et al., 2003) in two basic issues: first, training data is monotonously segmented into bilingual units; and second, the model considers n-gram probabilities instead of relative frequencies.",
        "This translation approach is described in detail in (Mari˜no et al., 2005).",
        "For those translation tasks with Spanish or English as target language, an additional tagged (using POS information) target language model is used.",
        "Additionally a reordering strategy that includes POS information is described and evaluated.",
        "Translation results for all six translation directions proposed in the shared task are presented and discussed.",
        "Both translation directions are considered for the pairs: English-Spanish, English-French, and English-German.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly outlines the baseline system.",
        "Section 3 describes in detail the implemented POS-based reordering strategy.",
        "Section 4 presents and discusses the shared task results and, finally, section 5 presents some conclusions and further work."

        "As already mentioned, the translation model used here is based on bilingual n-grams.",
        "It actually constitutes a language model of bilingual units, referred to as tuples, which approximates the joint probability between source and target languages by using bilingual n-grams (de Gispert and Mari˜no, 2002).",
        "Tuples are extracted from a word-to-word aligned corpus according to the following two constraints: first, tuple extraction should produce a monotonic segmentation of bilingual sentence pairs; and second, no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraint.",
        "See (Crego et al., 2004) for further details.",
        "For all experiments presented here, the translation model consisted of a 4-gram language model of tuples.",

        "In this case, each translation unit carried the information of its target side POS-tags, though this is not used for translation model estimation (only in order to evaluate the target POS language model at decoding time).",
        "Due to the non-availability of POS-taggers for French and German, it was not possible to incorporate this feature in all translation tasks considered, being only used for those translation tasks with Spanish and English as target languages.",
        "The search engine for this translation system is described in (Crego et al., 2005) and implements a beam-search strategy based on dynamic programming, taking into account all feature functions described above, along with the bilingual n-gram translation model.",

        "An optimization tool, which is based on a downhill simplex method was developed and used for computing log-linear weights for each of the feature functions.",
        "This algorithm adjusts the weights so that a non-linear combination of BLEU and KIST scores is maximized over the development set for each of the six translation directions considered.",
        "This baseline system is actually very similar to the system used for last year’s shared task “Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine Translation” of ACL’05 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts: Data-Driven Machine Translation and Beyond (Banchs et al., 2005), whose results are available at: http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/ mt-shared-task/.",

        "In this section we outline the reordering framework used for the experiments (Crego and Mari˜no, 2006).",
        "A highly constrained reordered search is performed by means of a set of reordering patterns (linguistically motivated rewrite patterns) which are used to extend the monotone search graph with additional arcs.",
        "To extract patterns, we use the word-to-word alignments (the union of both alignment directions) and source-side POS tags.",
        "The main procedure consists of identifying all crossings produced in the",
        "word-to-word alignments.",
        "Once a crossing has been detected, its source POS tags and alignments are used to account for a new instance of pattern.",
        "The target side of a pattern (source-side positions after reordering), is computed using the original order of the target words to which the source words are aligned.",
        "See figure 1 for a clarifying example of pattern extraction.",
        "The monotone search graph is extended with re-orderings following the patterns found in training.",
        "The procedure identifies first the sequences of words in the input sentence that match any available pattern.",
        "Then, each of the matchings implies the addition of an arc into the search graph (encoding the reordering learnt in the pattern).",
        "However, this addition of a new arc is not performed if a translation unit with the same source-side words already exists in the training.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of the procedure.",
        "Once the search graph is built, the decoder traverses the graph looking for the best translation.",
        "Hence, the winner hypothesis is computed using all the available information (the whole SMT models).",
        "The reordering strategy is additionally supported by a 5-gram language model of reordered source POS-tags.",
        "In training, POS-tags are reordered according with the extracted reordering patterns and word-to-word links.",
        "The resulting sequence of source POS-tags are used to train the n-gram LM.",
        "Notice that this reordering framework has only been used for some translation tasks (Spanish-to-English, English-to-Spanish and English-to-French).",
        "The reason is double: first, because we did not have available a French POS-tagger.",
        "Second, because the technique used to learn reorderings (detailed below) does not seem to apply for language pairs like German-English, because the agglutinative characteristic of German (words are formed by joining morphemes together).",
        "Table 1 shows the improvement of the original baseline system described in section 2 (base), enhanced using reordering graphs (+rgraph) and provided the tagged-source language model (+pos).",
        "The experiments in table 1 were not carried out over the official corpus of this shared task.",
        "The Spanish-English corpus of the TC-Star 2005 Evaluation was used.",
        "Due to the high similarities between both corpus (this shared task corpus consists of a subset of the whole corpus used in the TC-Star 2005 Evaluation), it makes sense to think that comparable results would be obtained.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the official corpus of the shared task (HLT-NAACL 2006) was used when building and tuning the present shared task system."
