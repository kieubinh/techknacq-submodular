        "A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages Tobias Kuhn?",
        "ETH Zurich and University of Zurich What is here called controlled natural language (CNL) has traditionally been given many different names.",
        "Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed.",
        "They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations.",
        "Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella.",
        "To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here.",
        "A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today.",
        "Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other.",
        "The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction Controlled, processable, simplified, technical, structured, and basic are just a few examples of attributes given to constructed languages of the type to be discussed here.",
        "We will call them controlled natural languages (CNL) or simply controlled languages.",
        "Basic English, Caterpillar Fundamental English, SBVR Structured English, and Attempto Controlled English are some examples; many more will be presented herein.",
        "This article investigates the nature of such languages, provides a general classification scheme, and explores existing approaches.",
        "As the variety of attributes suggests, there is no general agreement on the characteristic properties of CNL, making it a very fuzzy term.",
        "There are two main reasons for this.",
        "First, CNL approaches emerged in different environments (industry, academia, and government), in different disciplines (computer science, philosophy, linguistics, and engineering), and over many decades (from the 1930s until today).",
        "People from different backgrounds often used and continue to use different names for the same kind of language.",
        "Second, although controlled natural languages seem to share important ?",
        "Chair of Sociology, in particular of Modeling and Simulation, ETH Zurich, and Institute of Computational Linguistics, University of Zurich.",
        "Personal Web site: http://www.tkuhn.ch.",
        "Submission received: 26 October 2012; revised version received: 7 March 2013; accepted for publication: 25 April 2013. doi:10.1162/COLI a 00168 ?",
        "2014 Association for Computational Linguistics  properties, they also exhibit a very wide variety: Some are inherently ambiguous, others are as precise as formal logic; virtually everything can be expressed in some, only very little in others; some look perfectly natural, others look more like programming languages; some are defined by just a handful of grammar rules, others are so complex that no complete grammar exists.",
        "This variety makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the fundamental properties.",
        "This article aims at resolving this problem by giving an overview of existing CNLs and by providing a general classification scheme.",
        "Generally, this work has several, partly overlapping, goals, ranging from purely theoretical to more practical objectives (listed in this order): \u0001 To give us a better understanding of the nature of CNL \u0001 To establish a common terminology and a common model for CNL \u0001 To provide a starting point for researchers interested in CNL \u0001 To help CNL developers make design decisions Although a wide variety of CNLs have been applied to a wide variety of problem domains, virtually all of them seem to be relevant to the field of computational linguistics.",
        "Among other techniques, they involve lexical analyses, grammar and style checking, ambiguity detection, machine translation, and computational semantics.",
        "Unsurprisingly, most CNLs are based on English.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, the survey presented in this article is restricted to these languages and excludes existing approaches based on other natural languages, such as German and Chinese.",
        "The classification scheme to be presented, however, is general and not restricted to English in any way.",
        "In what follows, the relevant background is discussed (Section 2), a classification scheme is introduced (Section 3), existing English-based CNLs are classified and described based on a small sample (Section 4), the results are analyzed (Section 5), and finally the conclusions are discussed (Section 6).",
        "The appendix shows the full list of languages with short descriptions for each of them.",
        "2.",
        "Background Controlled natural language being such a fuzzy term, it is important to clarify its meaning, to establish a common definition, and to understand the differences in related terms.",
        "In addition, it is helpful to review previous attempts to classify and characterize CNLs.",
        "2.1 Definition As mentioned earlier, there is no generally agreed-upon definition for controlled natural language and for closely related terms including controlled language, constrained natural language, simplified language, and controlled English.",
        "The following two quotations illustrate this: A controlled language (CL) is a restricted version of a natural language which has been engineered to meet a special purpose, most often that of writing technical documentation for non-native speakers of the document language.",
        "A typical CL uses a well-defined subset of a language's grammar and lexicon, but adds the terminology needed in a technical domain.",
        "(Kittredge 2003, page 441) 122 Kuhn A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages Controlled natural language is a subset of natural language that can be accurately and efficiently processed by a computer, but is expressive enough to allow natural usage by non-specialists.",
        "(Fuchs and Schwitter 1995, page 1) Both descriptions exhibit a strong bias towards one particular type of CNL (these types are discussed in more detail subsequently): The first quotation focuses on technical languages that are designed to improve comprehensibility, whereas the second one only covers languages that can be interpreted by computers.",
        "They agree, however, on the fact that a CNL is based on a certain natural language but is more restrictive.",
        "It is also generally agreed that CNLs are constructed languages, which means languages that did not emerge naturally but have been engineered.",
        "The use of the term subset is misleading though, because many CNLs are not proper subsets of the underlying natural language.",
        "Many of these languages have small deviations from natural grammar or semantics.",
        "Others make use of unnatural elements such as colors and parentheses to increase readability and precision.",
        "Some even consider the programming language COBOL a controlled natural language (Sowa 2000a).",
        "The subset relation in its mathematical sense is clearly too strict to cover a large part of the languages commonly called CNL.",
        "Although they all clearly share important properties, the specific languages can be quite different in their coverage and nature.",
        "It is not surprising that O?Brian (2003), who compared English-based CNLs of different types, came to the conclusion that no common core language can be identified.",
        "To meet these problems, the following definition is proposed here: Definition 1 (long) A language is called a controlled natural language if and only if it has all of the following four properties: 1.",
        "It is based on exactly one natural language (its ?base language?).",
        "2.",
        "The most important difference between it and its base language (but not necessarily the only one) is that it is more restrictive concerning lexicon, syntax, and/or semantics.",
        "3.",
        "It preserves most of the natural properties of its base language, so that speakers of the base language can intuitively and correctly understand texts in the controlled natural language, at least to a substantial degree.",
        "4.",
        "It is a constructed language, which means that it is explicitly and consciously defined, and is not the product of an implicit and natural process (even though it is based on a natural language that is the product of an implicit and natural process).",
        "Properties 2 and 3 are deliberately vague, because it is not possible or desirable to draw a strict line there.",
        "Properties 1 and 3 refer to the N in CNL: naturalness; Properties 2 and 4 refer to the C: control.",
        "We will later be able to be a little more precise concerning Property 3.",
        "We leave it for now, and we can summarize this relatively verbose definition in the form of the following short version: Definition 2 (short) A controlled natural language is a constructed language that is based on a certain natural language, being more restrictive concerning lexicon, syntax, and/or semantics, while preserving most of its natural properties.",
        "123  As a further remark, we should note that the term language is used in a sense that is restricted to sequential languages and excludes visual languages such as diagrams and the like.",
        "We can verify that Definition 2 includes virtually all languages that have been called CNL, and it excludes natural languages (because they are not constructed), languages such as Esperanto (because they are not based on one particular natural lan-guage), and common formal languages (because they lack intuitive understandability).",
        "2.2 Related Terms Before we move on to examine the types and properties of languages, we should discuss a number of terms that are related to CNL and are easy to confuse: sublanguage, fragments of language, style guide, phraseology, controlled vocabulary, and constructed language.",
        "Sublanguages are languages that naturally arise when ?a community of speakers (i.e., ?experts?)",
        "shares some specialized knowledge about a restricted semantic domain [and] the experts communicate about the restricted domain in a recurrent situation, or set of highly similar situations?",
        "(Kittredge 2003, page 432).",
        "As with controlled natural language, a sublanguage is based on exactly one natural language and is more restricted.",
        "The crucial difference between the two terms is that sublanguages emerge naturally, whereas CNLs are explicitly and consciously defined.",
        "Fragments of language is a term denoting ?a collection of sentences forming a naturally delineated subset of [a natural] language?",
        "(Pratt-Hartmann and Third 2006).",
        "The term is closely related to CNL and the difference seems to be mainly a methodological one: Fragments of language are identified rather than defined, they are closely kept in the context of the full natural language and related fragments, and their purpose is rather to theoretically study them than to directly use them to solve a particular problem.",
        "A CNL can be seen as a fragment of a language ?developed for the purpose of supporting some technical activity?",
        "(Pratt-Hartmann 2009, page 1).",
        "Style guides are documents containing instructions on how to write in a certain natural language.",
        "Some style guides such as ?How to Write Clearly?",
        "(European Commission 2011) provide ?hints, not rules?",
        "and therefore do not describe a new language, but only give advice on how to use the given natural language.",
        "However, other style guides such as the Plain Language Guidelines (PLAIN 2011) are stricter and do describe a language that is not identical to the respective full language.",
        "The question of whether such a language can be considered a CNL depends on whether the style guide defines a new language or whether it merely describes good practices that have emerged naturally.",
        "Phraseology is a term that denotes a ?set of expressions used by a particular person or group?",
        "(Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2000).",
        "Typically, this term is used when the grammatical structure is simpler than in full natural language.",
        "In contrast to sublanguages and fragments of languages, a phraseology is not a selection of sentences but a selection of phrases.",
        "Phraseologies can be natural or constructed, and in the latter case they are usually considered CNLs.",
        "Controlled vocabularies are standardized collections of names and expressions, including ?lists of controlled terms, synonym rings, taxonomies, and thesauri?",
        "(ANSI/NISO 2005).",
        "Mostly, controlled vocabularies target a specific, narrow domain.",
        "In contrast to CNL, they do not deal with grammatical issues, that is, how to combine the terms to write complete sentences.",
        "Many CNL approaches, especially domain-specific ones, include controlled vocabularies.",
        "124 Kuhn A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages Constructed languages (or artificial languages or planned languages) are languages that did not emerge naturally but have been consciously defined.",
        "In this broad sense, the term includes (but is not limited to) languages such as Esperanto, programming languages, and CNLs.",
        "2.3 Types and Properties Let us now turn to the nature of CNLs.",
        "To bring order to their seemingly chaotic variety, more than 40 properties of such languages and their environments have been identified (Wyner et al. 2010).",
        "Many of these properties, however, are fuzzy and do not allow for a strict categorization.",
        "For the survey to be presented in Section 4, we collect nine general and clear-cut properties and give them letter codes.",
        "As it turns out, however, these properties mainly describe the application environment of languages and not so much the languages themselves.",
        "For that reason, a classification scheme is introduced in the next section to describe the fundamental nature of CNLs and other languages.",
        "In general, controlled natural languages can be roughly subdivided according to the problem they are supposed to solve (Schwitter 2002): to improve communication among humans, especially speakers with different native languages (we will use the letter code C for these languages); to improve manual, computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic translation (T); and to provide a natural and intuitive representation for formal notations (F).",
        "The last type includes approaches for automatic execution of texts, which requires, at least conceptually, a mapping to an executable formalism.",
        "As we will see, these three types emerged at different points in time: Type C is the oldest, type T emerged later, and type F is the most recent of the three.",
        "Although this seems to be a sensible and useful subdivision, a simpler version based on just two types dominates the literature.",
        "Huijsen (1998) introduced the distinction between ?human-oriented?",
        "and ?computer-oriented?",
        "languages.",
        "The former roughly corresponds to type C, the latter to the types T and F. However, Huijsen observes that ?it is often difficult to qualify a controlled language as either human-oriented or machine-oriented, since often simplification works both ways?",
        "(page 2).",
        "Because these types describe problems rather than languages, reusing a language in a different problem domain can change its type even if the language itself has not changed at all.",
        "Other similar categorizations include the distinction between ?naturalistic?",
        "(type C and T) and ?formalistic?",
        "(type F) languages (Pool 2006; Clark et al. 2010) and the distinction between readability and translatability (Reuther 2003).",
        "Another apparent fact is that some languages originated from academia (letter code A), some from industry (I), some from a government or a UN agency (G), and others from a combination of the three.",
        "In addition, the distinction between general purpose languages and those for a particular restricted domain is often discussed (Pool 2006).",
        "This is related to the distinction of whether the lexicon is open or closed (Adriaens and Schreors 1992).",
        "We will use the letter code D to denote languages targeting a specific and narrow domain.",
        "A further important difference is the one between written and spoken languages.",
        "We will use W to denote languages that are intended to be written, and S for those that are intended to be spoken.",
        "However, none of these distinctions seems to describe a fundamental language property: Languages that originated in one environment can later be used in another; the lexicon can later be declared open or closed; written languages can be read aloud; and spoken languages can be written down.",
        "The rules that define a CNL can be proscriptive or prescriptive (Nyberg, Mitamura, and Huijsen 2003), or a combination of the two.",
        "Proscriptive rules describe what is 125  not allowed, whereas prescriptive rules describe what is allowed.",
        "Languages defined by proscriptive rules alone must have some starting point in the form of a given (natural) language.",
        "Languages with only prescriptive rules, in contrast, typically start from scratch.",
        "As we will see, there is a close connection of this distinction to the concept of simplicity as introduced in the next section.",
        "Because of their lack of generality, we do not include here more specific low-level properties such as the support for subclauses and free compounding (Adriaens and Schreors 1992), specific restrictions on grammatical tenses and modal verbs (O?Brien 2003), and support for interrogative and imperative sentences (Wyner et al. 2010).",
        "Table 1 summarizes the letter codes.",
        "Any two of these properties can overlap, and therefore any combination is possible in theory (with the exception that no language should be neither W nor S).",
        "Finally, there is one additional aspect of constructed languages that deserves at-tention: their life cycle.",
        "Some languages are not much more than abstract ideas, others have left this stage being applied to concrete problems, and yet others have progressed to widespread application in productive environments.",
        "At different stages of maturity, languages can be discontinued or abandoned, which signifies the end of their life cycle.",
        "Obviously, these different stages flow into each other and it is often difficult to name a concrete year of birth or death (especially the latter, as most CNLs die silently).",
        "Where possible, we will keep track of these life cycle properties.",
        "3.",
        "PENS Classification Scheme As we have seen, the CNL properties introduced here describe application domains rather than the languages themselves.",
        "Certainly, several fundamental language properties have been identified and discussed in the literature, such as expressiveness (Mitamura and Nyberg 1995; Boyd, Zowghi, and Farroukh 2005; Pool 2006), complexity (Mitamura and Nyberg 1995), grammar modifications (Pool 2006), understandability, natural look-and-feel, ambiguity, predictability, and formality of definition (Wyner et al. 2010).",
        "However, these properties are all very fuzzy and do not allow for strict categorization.",
        "To construct a principled classification scheme for such fundamental language properties, it makes sense to condense them to a few dimensions that are to a large degree (though not entirely) independent of each other.",
        "Ambiguity, predictability, and formality of definition can be subsumed by a dimension that we can call precision.",
        "Table 1 Letter codes for properties of CNLs.",
        "Code Property C The goal is comprehensibility T The goal is translation F The goal is formal representation (including automatic execution) W The language is intended to be written S The language is intended to be spoken D The language is designed for a specific narrow domain A The language originated from academia I The language originated from industry G The language originated from a government 126 Kuhn A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages Expressiveness can make up a second dimension.",
        "Grammar modifications, under-standability, and natural look-and-feel can be combined to a dimension of naturalness.",
        "A fourth dimension can be called complexity or?to have a dimension of the type ?more is better??simplicity.",
        "This is how we arrive at the four dimensions Preci-sion, Expressiveness, Naturalness, and Simplicity that underlie the PENS classification scheme.1 It seems that all fundamental language properties mentioned in the existing literature fall into one of these general dimensions, or can be broken down into different aspects that can be mapped to these dimensions.",
        "There are no strong dependencies between any two dimensions (for any dimension pair, it is easy to imagine languages that are at the top, bottom, and opposite ends in these two dimensions).",
        "Furthermore, there is no obvious dimension pair that could be merged in a meaningful way.",
        "Together, this seems to indicate that this set of dimensions is minimal yet complete.",
        "The development of this scheme originated from the insight that CNLs can be conceptually located somewhere in the gray area between natural languages on the one end and formal languages on the other.",
        "Generally, CNLs are more formal than natural languages but more natural than formal ones.",
        "For instance, a natural language such as English is very expressive, but complex and imprecise.",
        "A formal language such as propositional logic, in contrast, is very simple and precise, but at the same time unnatural and inexpressive.",
        "CNLs must be somewhere in the middle, but where exactly?",
        "It seems obvious that all four of the dimensions are continuous in nature or at least very fine-grained.",
        "In fact, one can argue that each of the dimensions is actually multidimensional and that representing it in one dimension is a rough simplification.",
        "Such simplifications are necessary, however, in order to get a precise measure for such vague concepts such as expressiveness.",
        "Intuitively, PENS uses a natural language such as English and a formal language such as propositional logic as pegs to span a conceptual space in which different kinds of controlled natural languages can be placed.",
        "In order to get a general but strict classification scheme, PENS drastically simplifies things by restricting each of its four dimensions to five classes, to be numbered from 1 to 5.",
        "These five classes are non-overlapping and consecutively cover the one-dimensional space between the two extremes: English on the one end and propositional logic on the other.",
        "For precision and simplicity, English is on the bottom end of the scale in class 1, which we write as P1 and S1.",
        "Propositional logic is on the opposite end of the scale in class 5, represented with P5 and S5.",
        "For expressiveness and naturalness, the roles are switched: English is at the top end (E5 and N5) and propositional logic at the bottom (E1 and N1).",
        "In this way, the scheme defines a conceptual space for CNLs that includes natural and formal languages as special cases.",
        "Combining the four dimensions gives 54 = 625 classes, represented with shorthand such as P1E5N5S1 for English and P5E1N1S5 for propositional logic.",
        "The difficult and interesting part of this intellectual exercise is where and how to draw the borders between the five classes of each dimension.",
        "The decision to use five classes for each dimension, and not four or six, is somewhat arbitrary.",
        "A larger number of classes allows for more detailed classifications, although it also gets more difficult to come up with strict and objective criteria to define these classes.",
        "Five seems to be a good middle ground.",
        "1 These four dimensions had first been sketched as ?design principles?",
        "in the author's doctoral thesis (Kuhn 2010), where ?precision?",
        "was called ?clearness.?",
        "127  3.1 Precision The precision dimension of the PENS scheme captures the degree to which the meaning of a text in a certain language can be directly retrieved from its textual form, that is, the sequence of language symbols.",
        "Natural language is very imprecise in this sense, because a large amount of context information is needed to grasp the meaning of typical sentences.",
        "Formal logic languages, on the other hand, have maximal precision, because their meaning is strictly defined solely on the basis of the possible sequences of their language symbols.",
        "The symbol grounding problem, that is, the problem of mapping symbols to their counterparts in the real world, is not considered here, because it affects all languages, including both natural and formal ones.",
        "On this precision dimension, languages are divided into the five classes P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, as follows: Imprecise languages (P1).",
        "Virtually every sentence of these languages is vague to a certain degree.",
        "Without taking context into account, most sentences of a certain complexity are ambiguous.",
        "The automatic interpretation of such languages is ?AI-complete,?",
        "which means it is a problem for which no complete solutions are in sight.",
        "These languages require a human reader to check whether a given statement is syntactically correct, and include borderline statements on which readers disagree.",
        "The same applies to the semantic properties of the language.",
        "All natural languages belong to this category.",
        "Less imprecise languages (P2).",
        "For these languages, the degree of ambiguity and vagueness is considerably lower than in natural languages, and their interpretation depends much less on context.",
        "They restrict the use and/or the meaning of a wide range of the respective ambiguous, vague, or context-dependent constructs.",
        "However, these constructs are still too dominant to make automatic interpretation reliable.",
        "Such languages are typically not related to a formal (i.e., mathematically precise) underpinning.",
        "Reliably interpretable languages (P3).",
        "The syntax of these languages is heavily restricted, though not necessarily formally defined.",
        "The restrictions are strong enough to make automatic interpretation reliable.",
        "There is a logical underpinning or at least a formal conceptual scheme, in which the semantics of sentences can be represented.",
        "However, the mapping of sentences to their formal representations is itself not defined in a fully formal way, but requires external background knowledge, heuristics, or user feedback.",
        "Deterministically interpretable languages (P4).",
        "Such languages are fully formal on the syntactic level; that is, they are (or can be) defined by a formal grammar.",
        "Each text in such a language can be deterministically parsed to a formal logic representation, or a small set of all possible representations (including all and only the possible ones).",
        "Based on the underlying formalism, these representations describe the meaning of the sentences, but they may be underspecified in the sense that they require certain parameters, background axioms, external resources, or heuristics to enable sensible deductions.",
        "Languages with fixed semantics (P5).",
        "These languages are fully formal and fully specified on both the syntactic and semantic levels.",
        "Each text has exactly one meaning, which can be automatically derived.",
        "The circumstances in which inferences hold or do not hold are fully defined.",
        "What conclusions follow from a given text in the language (e.g., whether it is consistent and which sentences of the language are a consequence of the text) can be defined with mathematical rigor, without the help of heuristics or external resources.",
        "128 Kuhn A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages 3.2 Expressiveness The dimension of expressiveness describes the range of propositions that a certain language is able to express.",
        "A language X is more expressive than a language Y if language X can describe everything that language Y can, but not vice versa.",
        "The relation of ?being more expressive?",
        "does not constitute a total order: For two given languages of nonequal expressiveness, it can be the case (and often is the case) that neither is more expressive than the other.",
        "This entails that ranking a general set of languages in a linear order according to their expressiveness cannot be done in a completely objective way.",
        "A classification scheme, such as the one presented here, must therefore rely on only a subset of all possible expressiveness features.",
        "These expressiveness features should be general and important ones, and at the same time allow for a balanced and clear discrimination between the languages to be classified.",
        "The PENS classification scheme employs the following five expressiveness features: (a) universal quantification over individuals (possibly limited) (b) relations of arity greater than 1 (e.g., binary relations) (c) general rule structures (if?then statements with multiple universal quantification that can target all argument positions of relations) (d) negation (strong negation or negation as failure) (e) general second-order universal quantification over concepts and relations For each of these features to be considered fulfilled, they should be an integral part of the language and not just manifested by a few special cases.",
        "There are a number of other important features that could be considered, for example, support for existential quantification, equality, and types of supported speech acts (such as declarative, interrogative, directive, and indirect speech acts).",

        "Conclusions To conclude, we can come back to the aims set out in the Introduction of this article.",
        "The first goal was to get a better theoretical understanding of the nature of controlled languages.",
        "First of all, this article shows that despite the wide variety of existing CNLs, they can be covered by a single definition.",
        "The criteria of the proposed definition include virtually all languages that have been called CNLs in the literature.",
        "We could show that these languages form a widely scattered but connected cloud in the conceptual space between natural languages on the one end and formal languages on the other.",
        "The informal statement that CNLs are more formal than natural languages but more natural than formal ones is substantiated and verified.",
        "The next goal was to establish a common terminology and a common model.",
        "We emphasized the difference between characteristics of the environments of languages on the one hand and the properties of the languages themselves on the other.",
        "Both aspects are important, but the second is more difficult to capture in a quantitative way.",
        "Nine general properties have been collected to describe the application environments of CNLs.",
        "As a novel addition to this model, we proposed the four-dimensional PENS scheme to describe inherent language properties.",
        "This scheme allows for classification of CNLs on a discrete scale on the dimensions of precision, expressiveness, naturalness, 146 Kuhn A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages and simplicity.",
        "Together, this allows us to formally model the important properties of languages and their environments in a simple way, and to put order and structure to a previously fuzzy and disconnected field.",
        "The third goal was to provide a starting point for researchers interested in CNL.",
        "The most important conclusion in this respect is the fact that many more CNLs exist than have been found in any previous survey.",
        "Previously, the most comprehensive overview counted 41 CNLs (Pool 2006) based on various natural languages, whereas this survey covers 100 languages for English alone.",
        "The diversity of languages and the different environments in which they were studied and used apparently had the consequence that many CNL researchers and developers were not aware of a large number of relevant languages.",
        "As a starting point for researchers, this work presents a diverse sample of twelve important and influential languages, along with a long list of all CNLs collected.",
        "The introduced model of languages and environments can also facilitate the identification of a particular research focus and the collection of relevant prior work.",
        "The fourth goal was to help CNL developers make design decisions.",
        "To that aim, the data of this survey can be used to direct developers to existing CNL approaches in a given environment and problem domain.",
        "The data can reveal whether a certain kind of CNL usage is common, rare, or inexistent until now, which can be used as an indication of the amount of original work required.",
        "Furthermore, the typical language properties of CNLs in terms of precision, expressiveness, naturalness, and simplicity can be retrieved for a given usage scenario.",
        "This information might be very useful to identify important design decisions and to find existing approaches to build upon.",
        "I would like to conclude with the observation that the study of controlled languages is a very dynamic and highly interdisciplinary field, for the most part occupying small niches in the academic, industrial, and governmental worlds.",
        "However, adding all these niches together gives us a large body of past and ongoing work.",
