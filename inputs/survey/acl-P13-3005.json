        "Dependency parsing is one of the mainstream research areas in natural language processing.",
        "Dependency representations are useful for a number of NLP applications, for example, machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005), information extraction (Yakushiji et al., 2006), analysis of typologically diverse languages (Bunt et al., 2010) and parser stacking (?vrelid et al., 2009).",
        "There were several shared tasks organized on dependency parsing (CoNLL 2006?2007) and labeled dependencies (CoNLL 2008?2009) and there were a number of attempts to compare various dependencies intrinsically, e.g. (Miyao et al., 2007), and extrinsically, e.g. (Wu et al., 2012).",
        "In this paper we focus on practical issues of data representation for dependency parsing.",
        "The central aspects of our discussion are (a) three dependency formats: two ?classic?",
        "representations for dependency parsing, namely, Stanford Basic (SB) and CoNLL Syntactic Dependencies (CD), and bilexical dependencies from the HPSG English Resource Grammar (ERG), so-called DELPH-IN Syntactic Derivation Tree (DT), proposed recently by Ivanova et al. (2012); (b) three state-of-the art statistical parsers: Malt (Nivre et al., 2007), MST (McDonald et al., 2005) and the parser of Bohnet and Nivre (2012); (c) two approaches to word-category disambiguation, e.g. exploiting common PTB tags and using supertags (i.e. specialized ERG lexical types).",
        "We parse the formats and compare accuracies in all configurations in order to determine how parsers, dependency representations and grammatical tagging methods interact with each other in application to automatic syntactic analysis.",
        "SB and CD are derived automatically from phrase structures of Penn Treebank to accommodate the needs of fast and accurate dependency parsing, whereas DT is rooted in the formal grammar theory HPSG and is independent from any specific treebank.",
        "For DT we gain more expres-sivity from the underlying linguistic theory, which challenges parsing with statistical tools.",
        "The structural analysis of the schemes in Ivanova et al. (2012) leads to the hypothesis that CD and DT are more similar to each other than SB to DT.",
        "We recompute similarities on a larger treebank and check whether parsing results reflect them.",
        "The paper has the following structure: an overview of related work is presented in Section 2; treebanks, tagsets, dependency schemes and parsers used in the experiments are introduced in Section 3; analysis of parsing results is discussed in Section 4; conclusions and future work are outlined in Section 5."
