        "The hypothesis is that a graph can be partitioned into densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to each other.",

        "A nice way to represent the data is to construct a graph on which each vertex represents a data point and the edge weight carries the similarity of two vertices.",
        "The clustering problem in graph perspective is then formulated as partitioning the graph into subgraphs such that the edges in the same subgraph have high weights and the edges between different subgraphs have low weights.",
        "In the next section, we define essential graph notation to facilitate discussions in the rest of this survey.",
        "A graph is a triple G=(V,E,W) where V = [v1,vN} is a set of vertices, EQV*Vis a set of edges, and W = (w^j.. =1 N is called adjacency matrix in which each element indicates a non-negative weight ( wi;- > 0) between two vertices vt and Vj.",
        "In this survey we target at hard clustering problem which means we partition vertices of the graph into non-overlapping clusters, i.e., let C = (C1, ..., CK) be a partition of V such that (1) Ci*0 for iE {1,..., K}.",
        "The hypothesis behind graph-based clustering can be stated in the following ways:",
        "(1) The graph consists of dense subgraphs such that a dense subgraph contains more well-connected internal edges connecting the vertices in the subgraph than cutting edges connecting the vertices across subgraphs.",
        "(2) A random walk that visits a subgraph will likely stay in the subgraph until many of its vertices have been visited (Dongen, 2000).",
        "(3) Among all shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, links between different dense subgraphs are likely to be in many shortest paths (Dongen, 2000).",
        "Modeling addresses the problem of transforming the problem into graph structure, specifically, designating the meaning of vertices and edges in the graph, computing the edge weights for weighted graph, and constructing the graph.",
        "Luxburg (2006) stated three most common methods to construct a graph: s -neighborhood graph, k-nearest neighbor graph, and fully connected graph.",
        "Luxburg analyzed different behaviors of the three graph construction methods, and stated that some graph-cluster algorithms (e.g., spectral clustering) can be quite sensitive to the choice of graphs and parameters ( and ).",
        "As a general recommendation, Luxburg suggested exploiting nearest neighbor graph as the first choice, which is less vulnerable to the choices of parameters than other graphs.",
        "Unfortunately, theoretical justifications on the choices of graphs and parameters do not exist and as a result, the problem has been ignored by practitioners.",
        "A measure is an objective function that rates the quality of a clustering, thus called quality measure.",
        "By optimizing the quality measure, we can obtain the \"optimal\" clustering.",
        "It is worth noting that quality measure should not be confused with vertex similarity measure where it is used to compute edge weights.",
        "Furthermore, we should distinguish quality measure from evaluation measure which will be discussed in section 2.6.",
        "The main difference is that cluster quality measure directly identifies a clustering that fulfills a desirable property while evaluation measure rates the quality of a clustering by comparing with a ground-truth clustering.",
        "We summarize various quality measures in Table 1, from the basic density measures (intra-cluster and inter-cluster), to cut-based measures (ratio cut, ncut, performance, expansion, conductance, bicriteria), then to the latest proposed measure modularity.",
        "Each of the measures has strengths and weaknesses as commented in Table 1.",
        "Optimizing each of the measures is NP-hard.",
        "As a result, many efficient algorithms, which have been claimed to solve the optimal problem with polynomial-time complexity, yield suboptimal clustering.",
        "We categorize graph clustering algorithms into two major classes: divisive and agglomerative (Table 2).",
        "In the divisive clustering class, we categorize algorithms into several subclasses, namely, cut-based, spectral clustering, multilevel, random walks, shortest path.",
        "Divisive clustering follows top-down style and recursively splits a graph into subgraphs.",
        "In contrast, agglomerative clustering works bottom-up and iteratively merges singleton sets of vertices into subgraphs.",

        "The connection between clustering and spectrum of Laplacian matrix (L) basically lies in the following important proposition: the multiplicity k of the eigenvalue 0 of L equals to the number of connected components in the graph.",

        "Unnorma-lized clustering aims to optimize ratiocut measure while normalized clustering aims to optimize ncut measure (Shi and Malik, 2000), thus spectral clustering actually relates with cut-based clustering.",
        "The success of spectral clustering is mainly based on the fact that it does not make strong assumptions on the form of the clusters and can solve very general problems like intertwined spirals which k-means clustering handles much worse.",
        "Unfortunately, spectral clustering could be unstable under different choices of graphs and parameters as mentioned in section 2.3.",
        "Luxburg et al.",
        "(2005) compared unnorma-lized clustering with normalized version and proved that normalized version always converges to a sensible limit clustering while for unnorma-lized case the same only holds under strong additional assumptions which are not always satisfied.",
        "The running complexity of spectral clustering equals to the complexity of computing the eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix which is 0(\\F\\).",

        "The third set of algorithms is based on multilevel graph partitioning paradigm (Karypis and Kumar, 1999) which consists of three phases: coarsening phase, initial partitioning phase and refinement phase.",
        "Two approaches have been developed in this category, one is multilevel recursive bisection which recursively splits into two parts by performing multilevel paradigm with complexity of 0(\\V\\logK) ; the other is multilevel K way partitioning which performs coarsening and refinement only once and directly partitions the graph into K clusters with complexity of 0(\\V\\ + KlogK).",
        "The latter approach is superior to the former one for less running complexity and comparable (sometimes better) clustering quality.",
        "The fourth set of algorithms is based on the second interpretation of the hypothesis in section 2.2, i.e., a random walk is likely to visit many vertices in a cluster before moving to the other cluster.",
        "An outstanding approach in this category is presented in Dogen (2000), named Markov clustering algorithm (MCL).",
        "The algorithm iteratively applies two operators (expansion and inflation) by matrix computation until convergence.",
        "Expansion operator simulates spreading of random walks and inflation models demotion of inter-cluster walks; the sequence matrix computation results in eliminating inter-cluster interactions and leaving only intra-cluster components.",
        "The complexity of MCL is 0(m \\V\\) where m is the number of resources allocated for each vertex.",
        "A key point of random walk is that it is actually linked to spectral clustering (Luxburg, 2006), e.g., ncut can be expressed in terms of transition probabilities and optimizing ncut can be achieved by computing the stationary distribution of a random walk in the graph.",
        "The final set of algorithms in divisive category is based on the third interpretation of the hypothesis in section 2.2, i.e., the links between clusters are likely to be in the shortest paths.",
        "Girvan and Newman (2003) proposed the concept of edge betweenness which is the number of shortest paths connecting any pair of vertices that pass through the edge.",

        "(2004) used information centrality for each edge and stated that it performs better than betweenness but with a higher complexity of 0(\\V\\\\E\\).",
        "The agglomerative category contains much fewer algorithms.",
        "Newman (2004) proposed an algorithm that starts each vertex as singletons, and then iteratively merges clusters together in pairs, choosing the join that results in the greatest increase (or smallest decrease) in modularity score.",
        "The algorithm converges if there is only cluster left in the graph, then from the clustering hierarchy, we choose the clustering with maximum modularity.",

        "First, as we mentioned earlier, a clustering algorithm is usually proposed to optimize some quality measure, therefore, it is not fair to compare an algorithm that favors one measure with the other one that favors some other measure.",
        "Second, there is not a perfect measure that captures the full characteristics of cluster structures; therefore a perfect algorithm does not exist.",
        "Third, there is no definition for so called \"best clustering\".",
        "The \"best\" depends on applications, data characteristics, and granularity.",
        "We discussed various quality measures in section 2.4, however, a clustering optimizing some quality measure does not necessarily translate into effectiveness in real applications with respect to the ground truth clustering and thus an evaluation measure plays the role of evaluating how well the clustering matches the gold standard.",
        "Two questions arise: (1) what constraints (properties, criteria) should an ideal evaluation measure satisfy?",
        "(2) Do the evaluation measures ever proposed satisfy the constraints?",
        "For the first question, there have been several attempts on it: Dom (2001) developed a parametric technique for describing the quality of a clustering and proposed five \"desirable properties\" based on the parameters; Meila (2003) listed 12 properties associated with the proposed entropy measure; Amigo et al.",

        "Word clustering can be solved by following a two-step procedure: (1) classification step by representing each word as a feature vector and computing the similarity of two words; (2) clustering step which applies some clustering algorithm, e.g., single-link clustering, complete-link clustering, average-link clustering, such that similar words are grouped together.",
        "Matsuo et al.",
        "(2006) presented a graph clustering algorithm for word clustering based on word similarity measures by web counts.",
        "A word cooccurrence graph is constructed in which the vertex represents a word, and the edge weight is computed by applying some similarity measure (e.g., PMI, x) on a co-occurrence matrix, which is the result of querying a pair of words to a search engine.",
        "Then an agglomerative graph clustering algorithm (Newman, 2004), which is surveyed in section 2.5, is applied.",
        "They showed that the similarity measure % performs better than PMI, for one reason, PMI performs worse when a word group contains rare or frequent words, for the other reason, PMI is sensitive to web output inconsistency, e.g., the web count of w-±is below the web count of w-±ANDW2 in extreme case.",
        "They also showed that their graph clustering algorithm outperforms average-link agglomerative clustering by almost 32% using %similarity measure.",
        "The concern of their approach is the running complexity for constructing co-occurrence matrix, i.e., for n words, 0(n) queries are required which is intractable for a large graph.",
        "Ichioka and Fukumoto (2008) applied similar approach as Matsuo et al.",
        "(2006) for Japanese Onomatopoetic word clustering, and showed that the approach outperforms k-means clustering by 16.2%.",
        "Word sense disambiguation is the problem of identifying which sense of a word (meaning) is conveyed in the context of a sentence, when the word is polysemic.",
        "In contrast to supervised WSD which relies on predefined list of senses from dictionaries, unsupervised WSD induces word senses directly from the corpus.",
        "Among those unsupervised WSD algorithms, graph-based clustering algorithms have been found competitive with supervised methods, and in many cases outperform most vector-based clustering methods.",
        "Dorow and Widdows (2003) built a cooccurrence graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur more than a given threshold.",
        "They then applied Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL) which is surveyed in section 2.5, but cleverly circumvent the problem of choosing the right parameters.",
        "Their algorithm not only recognizes senses of polysemic words, but also provides high-level readable cluster name for each sense.",
        "Unfortunately, they neither discussed further how to identify the sense of a word in a given context, nor compared their algorithm with other algorithms by conducting experiments.",
        "Véronis (2004) proposed a graph based model named HyperLex based on the small-world properties of co-occurrence graphs.",
        "Detecting the different senses (uses) of a word reduces to isolating the high-density components (hubs) in the co-occurrence graph.",
        "Those hubs are then used to perform WSD.",
        "To obtain the hubs, HyperLex finds the vertex with highest relative frequency in the graph at each iteration and if it meets some criteria, it is selected as a hub.",
        "Agirre (2007) proposed another method based on PageRank for finding hubs.",
        "HyperLex can detect low-frequency senses (as low as 1%) and most importantly, it offers an excellent precision (97% compared to 73% for baseline).",
        "Agirre (2007) further conducted extensive experiments by comparing the two graph based models (HyperLex and PageRank) with other supervised and non-supervised graph methods and concluded that graph based methods perform close to supervised systems in the lexical sample task and yield the second-best WSD systems for the Senseval-3 all-words task."

        "In this survey, we organize the sparse related literature of graph clustering into a structured presentation and summarize the topic as a five part story, namely, hypothesis, modeling, measure, algorithm, and evaluation.",
        "The hypothesis serves as a basis for the whole graph clustering methodology, quality measures and graph clustering algorithms construct the backbone of the methodology, modeling acts as the interface between the real application and the methodology, and evaluation deals with utility.",
        "We also survey several typical NLP problems, in which graph-based clustering approaches have been successfully applied.",
        "We have the following final comments on the strengths and weaknesses of graph clustering approaches:",
        "(1) Graph is an elegant data structure that can model many real applications with solid mathematical foundations including spectral theory, Markov stochastic process.",
        "(2) Unlike many other clustering algorithms which act greedily towards the final clustering and thus may miss the optimal clustering, graph clustering transforms the clustering problem into optimizing some quality measure.",
        "Unfortunately, those optimization problems are NP-Hard, thus, all proposed graph clustering algorithms only approximately yield \"optimal\" clustering.",
        "(3) Graph clustering algorithms have been criticized for low speed when working on large scale graph (with millions of vertices).",
        "This may not be true since new graph clustering algorithms have been proposed, e.g., the multilevel graph clustering algorithm (Karypis and Kumar, 1999) can partition a graph with one million vertices into 256 clusters in a few seconds on current generation workstations and PCs.",
        "Nevertheless, scalability problem of graph clustering algorithm still needs to be explored which is becoming more important in social network study.",
        "We envision that graph clustering methods can lead to promising solutions in the following emerging NLP problems:",
        "(1) Detection of new entity types, relation types and event types (IE area).",
        "For example, the eight event types defined in the ACE program may not be enough for wider usage and more event types can be induced by graph clustering on verbs.",
        "(2) Web people search (IR area).",
        "The main issue in web people search is the ambiguity of the person name.",
        "Thus by extracting attributes (e.g., attended schools, spouse, children, friends) from returned web pages, constructing person graphs (involving those attributes) and applying graph clustering, we are optimistic to achieve a better person search engine."
