        "Recently, various dialogue translation systems have been proposed (Bub and others, 1997; Kurematsu and Morimoto, 1996; Rayner and Carter, 1997; Rosé and Levin, 1998; Sumita and others, 1999; Yang and Park, 1997; Vidal, 1997).",
        "If we want to make a conversation proceed smoothly using these translation systems, it is important to use not only linguistic information, which comes from the source language, but also extralinguistic information, which does not come from the source language, but, is shared between the participants of the conversation.",
        "Several dialogue translation methods that use extralinguistic information have been proposed.",
        "Horiguchi outlined how \"spoken language pragmatic information\" can be translated (Horiguchi, 1997).",
        "However, she did not apply this idea to a dialogue translation system.",
        "LuperFoy et al.",
        "proposed a software architec",
        "ture that uses \"a pragmatic adaptation\" (LuperFoy and others, 1998), and Mima et al.",
        "proposed a method that uses \"situational information\" (Mima and others, 1997).",
        "LuperFoy et al.",
        "simulated their method on man-machine interfaces and Mima et al.",
        "preliminarily evaluated their method.",
        "Neither study, however, applied its proposals to an actual dialogue translation system.",
        "The above mentioned methods will need time to work in practice, since it is hard to obtain the extralinguistic information on which they depend.",
        "We have been paying special attention to \"politeness,\" because a lack of politeness can interfere with a smooth conversation between two participants, such as a clerk and a customer.",
        "It is easy for a dialogue translation system to know which participant is the clerk and which is the customer from the interface (such as the wires to the microphones).",
        "This paper describes a method of \"politeness\" selection according to a participant's social role (a clerk or a customer), which is easily obtained from the extralinguistic environment.",
        "We incorporated each participant's social role into transfer rules and transfer dictionary entries.",
        "We then conducted an experiment with 23 unseen dialogues (344 utterances).",
        "Our method achieved a recall of 65% and a precision of 86%.",
        "These rates could be improved to 86% and 96%, respectively (see Section 4).",
        "It is therefore possible to use a \"participant's social role\" (a clerk or a customer in this case) to appropriately make the translation results \"polite,\" and to make the conversation proceed smoothly with a dialogue translation system.",
        "Section 2 analyzes the relationship between a particular participant's social role (a clerk) and politeness in Japanese.",
        "Section 3 describes our proposal in detail using an English-to-Japanese",
        "translation system.",
        "Section 4 shows an experiment and results, followed by a discussion in Section 5.",

        "We investigated Japanese outputs of a dialogue translation system to see how many utterances should be polite expressions in a current translation system for travel arrangement.",
        "We input 1,409 clerk utterances into a Transfer Driven Machine Translation system (Sumita and others, 1999) (TDMT for short).",
        "The inputs were closed utterances, meaning the system already knew the utterances, enabling the utterances to be transferred at a good quality.",
        "Therefore, we used closed utterances as the inputs to avoid translation errors.",
        "As a result, it was shown that about 70% (952) of all utterances should be improved to use polite expressions.",
        "This result shows that a current translation system is not enough to make a conversation smoothly.",
        "Not surprisingly, if all expressions were polite, some Japanese speakers would feel insulted.",
        "Therefore, Japanese speakers do not have to use polite expression in all utterances.",
        "We classified the investigated data into different types of English expressions for Japanese politeness, i.e., into honorific titles, parts of speech such as verbs, and canned phrases, as shown in Table 1; however, not all types appeared in the data.",
        "For example, when the clerk said \"How will you be paying, Mr. Suzuki,\" the Japanese translation was made polite as \"donoyouni oshiharaininarimasu-ka suzuki-sama\" in place of the standard expression \"donoyouni shiharaimasu-ka suzuki-san.\"",
        "Table 1 shows that there is a difference in how expressions should be made more polite according to the type, and that many polite expressions can be translated by using only local information, i.e., transfer rules and dictionary entries.",
