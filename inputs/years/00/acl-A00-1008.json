        "A key component of Atlas is APE, the Atlas Planning Engine, a \"just-intime\" planner specialized for easy construction and quick generation of hierarchically organized dialogues.",
        "APE is a domain and task-independent system.",
        "Although to date we have used APE as a dialogue manager for intelligent tutoring systems, APE could also be used to manage other types of human-computer conversation, such as an advice-giving system or an interactive help system.",
        "Planning is an essential component of a dialogue-based ITS.",
        "Although there are many reasons for using natural language in an ITS, as soon as the student gives an unexpected response to a tutor question, the tutor needs to be able to",
        "plan in order to achieve its goals as well as respond appropriately to the student's statement.",
        "Yet classical planning is inappropriate for dialogue generation precisely because it assumes an unchanging world.",
        "A more appropriate approach is the \"practical reason\" approach pioneered by Bratman (1987, 1990).",
        "According to Bratman, human beings maintain plans and prefer to follow them, but they are also capable of changing the plans on the fly when needed.",
        "Bratman's approach has been introduced into computer science under the name of reactive planning (Georgeff and Ingrand 1989, Wilkins et al.",
        "1995).",
        "In this paper we discuss the rationale for the use of reactive planning as well as the use of the hierarchical task network (HTN) style of plan operators.",
        "Then we describe APE (the Atlas Planning Engine), a dialogue planner we have implemented to embody the above concepts.",
        "We demonstrate the use of APE by showing how we have used it to add a dialogue capability to an existing ITS, the Andes physics tutor.",
        "By showing dialogues that Atlas-Andes can generate, we demonstrate the advantages of this architecture over the finite-state machine approach to dialogue management."

        "For an ITS, planning is required in order to ensure a coherent conversation as well as to accomplish tutorial goals.",
        "But it is impossible to plan a whole conversation in advance when the student can respond freely at every turn, just as human beings cannot plan their daily lives in advance because of possible changes in conditions.",
        "Classical planning algorithms are inappropriate because the tutor must be able to change plans based on the",
        "student's responses.",
        "For this reason we have adopted the ideas of the philosopher Michael Bratman (1987, 1990).",
        "Bratman uses the term \"practical reason\" to describe his analysis since he is concerned with how to reason about practical matters.",
        "For human beings, planning is required in order to accomplish one's goals.",
        "Bratman's key insight is that human beings tend to follow a plan once they have one, although they are capable of dropping an intention or changing a partial plan when necessary.",
        "In other words, human beings do not decide what to do from scratch at each turn.",
        "Bratman and others who have adopted his approach use a tripartite mental model that includes beliefs, desires and intentions (Bratman, Israel and Pollack 1988, Pollack 1992, Georgeff et al.",
        "1998), hence the name \"BDI model.\" Beliefs, which are uninstantiated plans in the speaker's head, are reified by the plan library.",
        "Desires are expressed as the agent's goals.",
        "Intentions, or plan steps that the agent has committed to but not yet acted on, are stored in an agenda.",

        "Hierarchical decomposition asserts that each goal can be achieved via a series of subgoals instead of relying on means-end reasoning.",
        "Hierarchical decomposition is more appropriate to dialogue generation for a number of reasons.",
        "First, decomposition is better suited to the type of large-scale dialogue planning required in a real-world tutoring system, as it is easier to establish what a human speaker will say in a given situation than to be able to understand why in sufficient detail and generality to do means-end planning.",
        "Second, Hierarchical decomposition minimizes search time.",
        "Third, our dialogues are task-oriented and have a hierarchical structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "In such a case, matching the structure of the domain simplifies operator development because they can often be derived from transcripts of human tutoring sessions.",
        "The hierarchy information is also useful in determining appropriate referring expressions.",
        "Fourth, interleaved planning and execution is important for dialogue generation because we cannot predict the human user's future utterances.",
        "In an HTN-based system, it is straightforward to implement interleaved planning and execution because one only needs to expand the portion of the plan that is about to be executed.",
        "Finally, the conversation is in a certain sense the trace of the plan.",
        "In other words, we care much more about the actions generated by the planner than the states involved, whether implicitly or explicitly specified.",
