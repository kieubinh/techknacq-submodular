        "One major goal of information extraction (IE) technology is to help users quickly identify a variety of relations and events and their key players in a large volume of documents.",
        "In contrast with this goal, state-of-the-art information extraction systems, as shown in the various Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs), extract a small number of relations and events.",
        "For instance, the most recent MUC, MUC-7, called for the extraction of 3 relations (person-employer, maker-product, and organization-location) and 1 event (spacecraft launches).",
        "Our goal is to develop an IE system which scales up to extract as many types of relations and events as possible with a minimum amount of porting effort combined with high accuracy.",
        "Currently, REES handles 100 types of relations and events, and it does so in a modular, configurable, and scalable manner.",

        "As the first step in building a large-scale relation and event extraction system, we developed ontologies of the relations and events to be extracted.",
        "These ontologies represent a wide variety of domains: political, financial, business, military, and life-related events and relations.",
        "\"Relations\" covers what in MUC-7 are called Template Elements (TEs) and Template Relations (TRs).",
        "There are 39 types of relations.",
        "While MUC TE's only dealt with singular entities, REES extracts both singular and plural entities (e.g., \"five executives\").",
        "The TR relations are shown in italic in the table below.",
        "\"Events\" are extracted along with their event participants, e.g., \"who did what to whom when and where?\"",

      "heading": "2.1 Tagging Modules",
      "text": [
        "The tagging component consists of three modules as shown in Figure 3: NameTagger, NPTagger and EventTagger.",
        "Each module relies on the same pattern-based extraction engine, but uses different sets of patterns.",
        "The NameTagger recognizes names of people, organizations, places, and artifacts (currently only vehicles).",
        "The NPTagger then takes the XML-tagged output of the NameTagger through two phases.",
        "First, it recognizes non-recursive Base Noun Phrase (BNP) (our specifications for BNP resemble those in Ramshaw and Marcus 1995).",
        "Second, it recognizes complex NPs for only the four main semantic types of NPs, i.e., Person, Organization, Location, and Artifact (vehicle, drug and weapon).",
        "It makes post-modifier attachment decisions only for those NPs that are crucial to the extraction at hand.",
        "During this second phase, relations which can be recognized locally (e.g., Age, Affiliation, Maker) are also recognized and stored using the XML attributes for the NPs.",
        "For instance, the XML tag for \"President of XYZ Corp.\" below holds an AFFILIATION attribute with the ID for \"XYZ Corp.\" <PNP ID=\"03\" AFFILIATION=\"04\">President of <ENTITY ID=\"04\">XYZ Corp.</ENTITY> </PNP> Building upon the XML output of the NPTagger, the EventTagger recognizes events applying its lexicon-driven, syntactically-based generic patterns.",
        "These patterns tag events in the presence of at least one of the arguments specified in the lexical entry for a predicate.",
        "Subsequent patterns try to find additional arguments as well as place and time adjunct information for the tagged event.",
        "As an example of the EventTagger's generic patterns, consider the simplified pattern below.",
        "This pattern matches on an event-denoting verb that requires a direct object of type weapon (e.g., \"fire a gun\")",
        "The important aspect of REES is its declarative, lexicon-driven approach.",
        "This approach requires a lexicon entry for each event-denoting word, which is generally a &=concatenation, AND=Boolean operator, $VP and $ARTIFACT are macro references for complex phrases.",
        "verb.",
        "The lexicon entry specifies the syntactic and semantic restrictions on the verb's arguments.",
        "For instance, the following lexicon entry is for the verb \"attack.\"",
        "It indicates that the verb \"attack\" belongs to the CONFLICT ontology and to the ATTACK_TARGET type.",
        "The first argument for the verb \"attack\" is semantically an organization, location, person, or artifact (ARGl_SEM), and syntactically a subject (ARG l_SYN).",
        "The second argument is semantically an organization, location, person or artifact, and syntactically a direct object.",
        "The third argument is semantically a weapon and syntactically a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition \"with\".",
        "About 50 generic event extraction patterns, supported by lexical information as shown above, allow extraction of events and their arguments in cases like: An Iraqi warplane attacked the frigate Stark with missiles May 17, 1987.",
        "This generic, lexicon-driven event extraction approach makes REES easily portable because new types of events can be extracted by just adding new verb entries to the lexicon.",
        "No new patterns are required.",
        "Moreover, this approach allows for easy customization capability: a person with no knowledge of the pattern language would be able to configure the system to extract new events.",
        "While the tagging component is similar to other pattern-based IE systems (e.g., Appelt et al.",
        "1995; Aone et al.",
        "1998, Yangarber and Grishman 1998), our EventTagger is more portable through a lexicon-driven approach."

        "REES outputs the extracted information in the form of either MUC-style templates, as illustrated in Figure 1 and 2, or XML.",
        "A crucial part of a portable, scalable system is to be able to output different types of relations and events without changing the template generation code.",
        "REES maps XML-tagged output of the co-reference module to templates using declarative template definitions, which specifies the template label (e.g., ATTACK_ TARGET), XML attribute names (e.g., ARGUMENT1), corresponding template slot names (e.g., ATTACKER), and the type restrictions on slot values (e.g., string).",
        "One of the challenges of event extraction is to be able to recognize and merge those event descriptions which refer to the same event.",
        "The Template Generation module uses a set of declarative, customizable rules to merge co-referring events into a single event.",
        "Often, the rules reflect pragmatic knowledge of the world.",

        "There was a significant drop between the training and blind sets in event extraction: 11 points.",
        "We believe that the main reason is that the total number of events in the training set is fairly low: 801 instances of 61 types of events (an average of 13/event), where 35 of the event types had fewer than 10 instances.",
