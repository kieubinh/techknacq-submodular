      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "In recent years, speech and natural language technologies have matured enough to enable the development of spoken dialogue systems in limited domains.",
        "Most existing systems employ dialogue strategies pre-specified during the design phase of the dialogue manager without taking into account characteristics of actual dialogue interactions.",
        "More specifically, mixed initiative systems typically employ rules that specify conditions (generally based on local dialogue context) under which initiative may shift from one agent to the other.",
        "Previous research, on the other hand, has shown that changes in initiative strategies in human-human dialogues can be dynamically modeled in terms of characteristics of the user and of the ongoing dialogue (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998) and that adaptability of initiative strategies in dialogue systems leads to better system performance (Litman and Pan, 1999).",
        "However, no previous dialogue system takes into account these dialogue characteristics or allows for initiative-oriented adaptation of dialogue strategies.",
        "In this paper, we describe MIMIC, a voice-enabled telephone-based dialogue system that provides movie showtime information, emphasizing its dialogue management aspects.",
        "MIMIC improves upon previous systems along two dimensions.",
        "First, MIMIC automatically adapts dialogue strategies based on participant roles, characteristics of the current utterance, and dialogue history.",
        "This automatic adaptation allows appropriate dialogue strategies to be employed based on both local dialogue context and dialogue history, and has been shown to result in significantly better performance than non-adaptive systems.",
        "Second, MIMIC employs an initiative module that is decoupled from the goal selection process in the dialogue manager, while allowing the outcome of both components to jointly determine the strategies chosen for response generation.",
        "As a result, MIMIC can exhibit drastically different dialogue behavior with very minor adjustments to parameters in the initiative module, allowing for rapid development and comparison of experimental prototypes and resulting in general and portable dialogue systems."

      "text": [
        "In naturally occurring human-human dialogues, speakers often adopt different dialogue strategies based on hearer characteristics, dialogue history, etc.",
        "For instance, the speaker may provide more guidance if the hearer is having difficulty making progress toward task completion, while taking a more passive approach when the hearer is an expert in the domain.",
        "Our main goal is to enable a spoken dialogue system to simulate such human behavior by dynamically adapting dialogue strategies during an interaction based on information that can be automatically detected from the dialogue.",
        "Figure 1 shows an excerpt from a dialogue between MIMIC and an actual user where the user is attempting to find the times at which the movie Analyze This playing at theaters in Montclair.",
        "S and U indicate system and user utterances, respectively, and the italicized utterances are the output of our automatic speech recognizer.",
        "In addition, each system turn is annotated with its task and dialogue initiative holders, where task initiative tracks the lead in the process toward achieving the dialogue participants' domain goal, while dialogue initiative models the lead in determining the current discourse focus (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998).",
        "In our information query application domain, the system has task (and thus dialogue) initiative if its utterances provide helpful guidance toward achieving the user's domain goal, as in utterances (6) and (7) where MIMIC provided valid response choices to its query intending to solicit a theater name, while the system has",
        "user queries (steps 1-8)5 (van Beek et al., 1993; Raskutti and Zukerman, 1993; Qu and Beale, 1999), and 2) providing answers to well-formed queries (steps 9-11)."

      "heading": "3.2.3 Strategy Selection",
      "text": [
        "Previous work has argued that initiative affects the degree of control an agent has in the dialogue interaction (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998).",
        "Thus, a cooperative system may adopt different strategies to achieve the same goal depending on the initiative distribution.",
        "Since task initiative models contribution to domain/problemsolving goals, while dialogue initiative affects the cur-5An alternative strategy to step (4) is to perform a database lookup based on the ambiguous query and summarize the results (Litman et al., 1998), which we leave for future work.",
        "rent discourse goal, we developed alternative strategies for achieving the goals in Figure 4 based on initiative distribution, as shown in Table 1.",
        "The strategies employed when MIMIC has only dialogue initiative are similar to the mixed initiative dialogue strategies employed by many existing spoken dialogue systems (e.g., (Bennacef et al., 1996; Stent et al., 1999)).",
        "To instantiate an attribute, MIMIC adopts the InfoSeek dialogue act to solicit the missing information.",
        "In contrast, when MIMIC has both initiatives, it plays a more active role by presenting the user with additional information comprising valid instantiations of the attribute (GiveOptions).",
        "Given an invalid query, MIMIC notifies the user of the failed query and provides an open-ended prompt when it only has dialogue initiative.",
        "When MIMIC has both initiatives, however, in addition to No-tifyFailure, it suggests an alternative close to the user's original query and provides a limited prompt.",
        "Finally, when MIMIC has neither initiative, it simply adopts No-tifyFailure, allowing the user to determine the next discourse goal."

        "MIMIC employs a simple template-driven utterance generation approach.",
        "Templates are associated with dialogue acts as shown in Table 2.6 The generation component receives from the dialogue manager the selected dialogue acts and the parameters needed to instantiate the templates.",
        "It then generates the system response, which is sent to the TTS module for spoken output synthesis.",

        "To illustrate MIMIC's adaptation capabilities, we return to the dialogue in Figure 1, which is repeated in Figure 5 and annotated with the cues detected in each user turn (in boldfaced italics) and the dialogue acts employed for response generation in each system turn (in boldface).",

        "The cue AmbiguousAction is detected in utterance (3) because the mandatory attribute theater was not specified and cannot be inferred (since the town of Montclair has multiple theaters).",
        "The bpas representing its effect are instantiated as follows (Figure 3): mtâ€“aa USD = 0.35, rnt_aa (0) 0.65; 771d-aa({S}) = 0.7, Md-aa (0) = 0.3.",
        "Combining the current bpas with the effects of the observed cue, we obtain the following new bpas:",
        "The updated bpas indicate that MIMIC should have dialogue but not task initiative when attempting to resolve the detected ambiguity in utterance (4).",
        "MIMIC selects Instantiate as its goal to be achieved (Figure 4), which, based on the initiative distribution, leads it to select the InfoSeek action (Table 1) and generate the query \"What theater would you like?\" The user's response in (5) again triggers AmbiguousAction, as well as NoNewInfo since the semantic representations of (3) and (5) are identical, given the dialogue context.",
        "When the effects of these cues are taken into account, we have the following initiative distribution for utterance (6):",
        "Although Instantiate is again selected as the goal, MIMIC now has both task and dialogue initiatives; thus it selects both GiveOptions and InfoSeek to achieve this goal and generates utterances (6) and (7).",
        "The additional information, in the form of valid theater choices, helps the user provide the missing value in (8), allowing MIMIC to answer the query in (9) and prompt for the next query.",
        "However, despite the limited prompt, the user provides a well-formed query in (11), triggering TakeOverTask.",
        "Thus, MIMIC answers the query and switches to an open-ended prompt in (13), relinquishing task initiative to the user.",
        "In addition to its automatic adaptation capabilities, another advantage of MIMIC is the ease of modifying its adaptation behavior, enabled by the decoupling of the initiative module from the goal and strategy selection processes.",
        "For instance, a system-initiative version of MIMIC can be achieved by setting the initial bpas as follows:",
        "(1) S: Hello, this is MIMIC, the movie information system.",

        "This is because in the Dempster-Shafer theory, if the initial bpas or the bpas for a cue provide definite evidence for drawing a certain conclusion, then no subsequent cue has any effect on changing that conclusion.",
        "Thus, MIMIC will retain both initiatives throughout the dialogue.",
        "Alternatively, versions of MIMIC with different adaptation behavior can be achieved by tailoring the initial bpas and/or the bpas for each cue based on the application.",
        "For instance, for an electronic sales agent, the effect of InvalidAction can be increased so that when the user orders an out-of-stock item, the system will always take over task initiative and suggest an alternative item."

        "User satisfaction was assessed by asking the subjects to fill out a questionnaire after interacting with each version of the system.",
        "Furthermore, a number of performance features, largely based on the PARADISE dialogue evaluation scheme (Walker et al., 1997), were automatically logged, derived, or manually annotated.",
        "In addition, we logged the cues automatically detected in each user utterance, as well as the initiative distribution for each turn and the dialogue acts selected to generate each system response.",
        "The features gathered from the dialogue interactions were analyzed along three dimensions: system performance, discourse features (in terms of characteristics of the resulting dialogues, such as the cues detected in user utterances), and initiative distribution.",
        "Our results show that MIMIC's adaptation capabilities 1) led to better system performance in terms of user satisfaction, dialogue efficiency (shorter dialogues), and dialogue quality (fewer ASR timeouts), and 2) better matched user expectations (by giving up task initiative when the user intends to have control of the dialogue interaction) and more efficiently resolved dialogue anomalies (by taking over task initiative to provide guidance when no progress is made in the dialogue, or to constrain user utterances when ASR performance is poor)."
