        "For the sake of argument, let's consider a translator to be a black box with source text in and target text out.",
        "We feed that box with texts and, to be really tricky, we input the same text a couple of times.",
        "Looking at the results, the first thing we notice is that though the different translations are quite similar, they're not exactly the same.",
        "Nothing to worry about, this may simply exemplify the potential for synonymy and paraphrase.",
        "But let's further suppose the text to translate is too big for one individual to translate in the given time frame.",
        "In realistic conditions, such a text would be split among perhaps half a dozen translators, each with his own vocabulary, experience and stylistic preferences, which would normally lead to the well known problem of non-uniformity of the translation.",
        "It is therefore part of the normal translation process to have a reviser look at a translator's output.",
        "His job will be to spot any typos (taken in a very broad sense to include missing chapters!).",
        "Usually, at this point the translator probably has submitted the preliminary version to a spell checker, so what could be done automatically at that level has already been done.",
        "No automatic detection of typical translation mistakes has been attempted though.",
        "That's the gap TransCheck is designed to fill.",
        "The concept of a \"translation checker\" was initially proposed in Isabelle and al.",
        "[8] and eventually led to a demonstration prototype concerned with the detection of a very restricted type of mistake: deceptive cognates.",
        "In comparison, the system described in this paper goes much further toward a \"real \" usable translation checker by allowing for the detection of errors of omission, the comparison of diverse numerical expressions and the flagging of inconsistent terminology.",
        "On the interface side, it allows for the automatic alignment of the source and target texts, the flagging of potential mistakes and the possibility of saving any modifications made to the target text."
