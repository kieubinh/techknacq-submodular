        "With the explosion of information in Internet, Natural language QA is recognized as a capability with great potential.",
        "Traditionally, QA has attracted many AI researchers, but most QA systems developed are toy systems or games confined to lab and a very restricted domain.",
        "More recently, Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-8) designed a QA track to stimulate the research for real world application.",
        "Due to little linguistic support from text analysis, conventional IR systems or search engines do not really perform the task of information retrieval; they in fact aim at only document retrieval.",
        "The following quote from the QA Track Specifications (www.research.att.com/ –singhal/qa-track-spec.txt) in the TREC community illustrates this point.",
        "Kupiec (1993) presented a QA system MURAX using an on-line encyclopedia.",
        "This system used the technology of robust shallow parsing but suffered from the lack of basic information extraction support.",
        "In fact, the most siginifcant IE advance, namely the NE (Named Entity) technology, occured after Kupiec (1993), thanks to the MUC program (MUC-7 1998).",
        "High-level IE technology beyond NE has not been in the stage of possible application until recently.",
        "AskJeeves launched a QA portal (www.askjeeves.com).",
        "It is equipped with a fairly sophisticated natural language question parser, but it does not provide direct answers to the asked questions.",
        "Instead, it directs the user to the relevant web pages, just as the traditional search engine does.",
        "In this sense, AskJeeves has only done half of the job for QA.",
        "We believe that QA is an ideal test bed for demonstrating the power of IE.",
        "There is a natural cooperation between IE and IR; we regard QA as one major intelligence which IE can offer IR.",
        "An important question then is, what type of IE can support IR in QA and how well does it support it?",
        "This forms the major topic of this paper.",
        "We structure the remaining part of the paper as follows.",
        "In Section 1, we first give an overview of the underlying IE technology which our organization has been developing.",
        "Section 2 discusses the QA system.",
        "Section 3 describes the limitation of the current system.",
        "Finally, in Section 4, we propose a more sophisticated QA system supported by three levels of IE."

        "The last decade has seen great advance and interest in the area of IE.",
        "In the US, the DARPA sponsored Tipster Text Program [Grishman 1997] and the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) [MUC-7 1998] have been the driving force for developing this technology.",
        "In fact, the MUC specifications for various IE tasks have become de facto standards in the IE research community.",
        "It is therefore necessary to present our IE effort in the context of the MUC program.",
        "MUC divides IE into distinct tasks, namely, NE (Named Entity), TE (Template Element), TR (Template Relation), CO (Co-reference), and ST (Scenario Templates) [Chinchor & Marsh 1998].",
        "Our proposal for three levels of IE is modelled after the MUC standards using MUC-style representation.",
        "However, we have modified the MUC IE task definitions in order to make them more useful and more practical.",
        "More precisely, we propose a hierarchical, 3-level architecture for developing a kernel IE system which is domain-independent throughout.",
        "The core of this system is a state-of-the-art NE tagger [Srihari 1998], named Textract 1.0.",
        "The Textract NE tagger has achieved speed and accuracy comparable to that of the few deployed NE systems, such as NetOwl [Krupka & Hausman 1998] and Nymble [Bikel et al. 1997].",
        "It is to be noted that in our definition of NE, we significantly expanded the type of information to be extracted.",
        "In addition to all the MUC defined NE types (person, organization, location, time, date, money and percent), the following types/sub-types of information are also identified by the TextractNE module:",
        "• duration, frequency, age • number, fraction, decimal, ordinal, math equation • weight, length, temperature, angle, area, capacity, speed, rate • product, software • address, email, phone, fax, telex, www • name (default proper name)",
        "Subtype information like company, government agency, school (belonging to the type organization) and military person, religious person (belonging to person) are also identified.",
        "These new subtypes provide a better foundation for defining multiple relationships between the identified entities and for supporting question answering functionality.",
        "For example, the key to a question processor is to identify the asking point (who, what, when, where, etc.).",
        "In many cases, the asking point corresponds to an NE beyond the MUC definition, e.g. the how+adjective questions: how long (duration or length), how far (length), how often (frequency), how old (age), etc.",
        "Level-2 IE, or CE (Correlated Entity), is concerned with extracting predefined multiple relationships between the entities.",
        "Consider the person entity as an example; the TextractCE prototype is capable of extracting the key relationships such as age, gender, affiliation, position, birth_time, birthplace, spouse, parents, children, where _from, address, phone, fax, email, descriptors.",
        "As seen, the information in the CE represents a mini-CV or profile of the entity.",
        "In general, the CE template integrates and greatly enriches the information contained in MUC TE and TR.",
        "The final goal of our IE effort is to further extract open-ended general events (GE, or level 3 IE) for information like who did what (to whom) when (or how often) and where.",
        "By general events, we refer to argument structures centering around verb notions plus the associated information of time/frequency and location.",
        "We show an example of our defined GE extracted from the text below:",
        "The core of the system consists of three kernel IE modules and six linguistic modules.",
        "The multilevel linguistic modules serve as an underlying support system for different levels of IE.",
        "The IE results are stored in a database which is the basis for IE-related applications like QA, BR (Browsing, threading and visualization) and AS (Automatic Summarization).",
        "The approach to IE taken here, consists of a unique blend of machine learning and FST (finite state transducer) rule-based system [Roche & Schabes 1997].",
        "By combining machine learning with an FST rule-based system, we are able to exploit the best of both paradigms while overcoming their respective weaknesses [Srihari 1998, Li & Srihari 2000]."

        "Therefore, the NE tagger has been proven to be very helpful.",
