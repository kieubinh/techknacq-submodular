        "In any real world use, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system will encounter words that are not in its lexicon, what we term 'unknown words'.",
        "Unknown words are problematic because a NLP system will perform well only if it recognizes the words that it is meant to analyze or translate: the more words a system does not recognize the more the system's performance will degrade.",
        "Even when unknown words are infrequent, they can have a disproportionate effect on system quality.",
        "For example, Min (1996) found that while only 0.6% of words in 300 emails were misspelled, this meant that 12% of the sentences contained an error (discussed in (Min and Wilson, 1998)).",
        "Words may be unknown for many reasons: the word may be a proper name, a misspelling, an abbreviation, a number, a morphological variant of a known word (e.g. recleared), or missing from the dictionary.",
        "The first step in dealing with unknown words is to identify the class of the unknown word; whether it is a misspelling, a proper name, an abbreviation etc.",
        "Once this is known, the proper action can be taken, misspellings can be corrected, abbreviations can be expanded and so on, as deemed necessary by the particular text processing application.",
        "In this paper we introduce a system for categorizing unknown words.",
        "The system is based on a multi component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one category of unknown words.",
        "The main focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors.",
        "Both components use a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word.",
        "Results from the two components are combined using a weighted voting procedure.",
        "The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we outline the overall architecture of the unknown word categorizer.",
        "The name identifier and the misspelling identifier are introduced in section 3.",
        "Performance and evaluation issues are discussed in section 4.",
        "Section 5 considers portability issues.",
        "Section 6 compares the current system with relevant preceding research.",
        "Concluding comments can be found in section 6."

        "The goal of our research is to develop a system that automatically categorizes unknown words.",
        "According to our definition, an unknown word is a word that is not contained in the lexicon of an NLP system.",
        "As defined, 'unknown-ness' is a relative concept: a word that is known to one system may be unknown to another system.",
        "Our research is motivated by the problems that we have experienced in translating live closed captions: live captions are produced under tight time constraints and contain many unknown words.",
        "Typically, the caption transcriber has a five second window to transcribe the broadcast dialogue.",
        "Because of the live nature of the broadcast, there is no opportunity to post-edit the transcript in any way.",
        "Although motivated by our specific requirements, the unknown word categorizer would benefit any NLP system that encounters unknown words of differing categories.",
        "Some immediately obvious domains where unknown words are frequent include email messages, internet chat rooms, data typed in by call centre operators, etc.",
        "To deal with these issues we propose a multicomponent architecture where individual components specialize in identifying one particular type of",
        "unknown word.",
        "For example, the misspelling identifier will specialize in identifying misspellings, the abbreviation component will specialize in identifying abbreviations, etc.",
        "Each component will return a confidence measure of the reliability of its prediction, c.f.",
        "(Elworthy, 1998).",
        "The results from each component are evaluated to determine the final category of the word.",
        "There are several advantages to this approach.",
        "Firstly, the system can take advantage of existing research.",
        "For example, the name recognition module can make use of the considerable research that exists on name recognition, e.g. (McDonald, 1996), (Mani et al., 1996).",
        "Secondly, individual components can be replaced when improved models are available, without affecting other parts of the system.",
        "Thirdly, this approach is compatible with incorporating multiple components of the same type to improve performance (cf. (van Halteren et al., 1998) who found that combining the results of several part of speech taggers increased performance)."

        "The goal of the name identifier is to differentiate between those unknown words which are proper names, and those which are not.",
        "We define a name as word identifying a person, place, or concept that would typically require capitalization in English.",
        "One of the motivations for the modular architecture introduced above, was to be able to leverage existing research.",
        "For example, ideally, we should be able to plug in an existing proper name recognizer and avoid the problem of creating our own.",
        "However, the domain in which we are currently operating - live closed captions - makes this approach difficult.",
        "Closed captions do not contain any case information, all captions are in upper case.",
        "Existing proper name recognizers rely heavily on case to identify names, hence they perform poorly on our data.",
        "A second disadvantage of currently available name recognizers is that they do not generally return a confidence measure with their prediction.",
        "Some indication of confidence is required in the multicomponent architecture we have implemented.",
        "However, while currently existing name recognizers are inappropriate for the needs of our domain, future name recognizers may well meet these requirements and be able to be incorporated into the architecture we propose.",
        "For these reasons we develop our own name identifier.",
        "We utilize a decision tree to model the characteristics of proper names.",
        "The advantage of decision trees is that they are highly explainable: one can readily understand the features that are affecting the analysis (Weiss and Indurkhya, 1998).",
        "Furthermore, decision trees are well-suited for combining a wide variety of information.",
        "For this project, we made use of the decision tree that is part of IBM's Intelligent Miner suite for data mining.",
        "Since the point of this paper is to describe an application of decision trees rather than to argue for a particular decision tree algorithm, we omit further details of the decision tree software.",
        "Similar results should be obtained by using other decision tree software.",
        "Indeed, the results we obtain could perhaps be improved by using more sophisticated decision-tree approaches such as the adaptive-resampling described in (Weiss et al., 1999).",
        "The features that we use to train the decision tree are intended to capture the characteristics of names.",
        "We specify a total of ten features for each unknown word.",
        "These identify two features of the unknown word itself as well as two features for each of the two preceding and two following words.",
        "The first feature represents the part of speech of the word.",
        "We use an in-house statistical tagger (based on (Church, 1988)) to tag the text in which the unknown word occurs.",
        "The tag set used is a simplified version of the tags used in the machine-readable version of the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (OALD).",
        "The tag set contains just one tag to identify nouns.",
        "The second feature provides more informative tagging for specific parts of speech (these are referred to as 'detailed tags' (DETAG)).",
        "This tagset consists of the nine tags listed in Table 1.",
        "All parts of speech apart from noun and punctuation tags are assigned the tag 'OTHER'.",
        "All punctuation tags are assigned the tag 'BOUNDARY'.",
        "Words identified as nouns are assigned one of the remaining tags depending on the information provided in the OALD (although the unknown word, by definition, will not appear in the OALD, the preceding and following words may well appear in the dictionary).",
        "If the word is identified in the OALD as a common noun it is assigned the tag 'COM'.",
        "If it is identified in the OALD as a proper name it is assigned the tag 'NAME'.",
        "If the word is specified as both a name and a common noun (e.g. `bill'), then it is assigned the tag `NCOM'.",
        "Pronouns are assigned the tag PRON'.",
        "If the word is in a list of titles that we have compiled, then the tag 'TITLE' is assigned.",
        "Similarly, if the word is a member of the class of words that can follow a name (e.g. jr'), then the tag 'POST' is assigned.",
        "A simple rule-based sys",
        "tern is used to assign these tags.",
        "If we were dealing with data that contains case information, we would also include fields representing the existence/non-existence of initial upper case for the five words.",
        "However, since our current data does not include case information we do not include these features."

        "We define a misspelling as an unintended, orthographically incorrect representation (with respect to the NLP system) of a word.",
        "A misspelling differs from the intended known word through one or more additions, deletions, substitutions, or reversals of letters, or the exclusion of punctuation such as hyphenation or spacing.",
        "Like the definition of 'unknown word', the definition of a misspelling is also relative to a particular NLP system.",
        "Like the name identifier, we make use of a decision tree to capture the characteristics of misspellings.",

        "Our corpus frequency variable specifies the frequency of each unknown word in a 2.6 million word corpus of business news closed captions.",
        "Word Length: (Agirre et al., 1998) note that their predictions for the correct spelling of misspelled words are more accurate for words longer than four characters, and much less accurate for shorter words.",

        "Our word length variables measures the number of characters in each word.",
        "Edit distance: Edit-distance is a metric for identifying the orthographic similarity of two words.",
        "Typically, one edit-distance corresponds to one substitution, deletion, reversal or addition of a character.",
        "(Damerau, 1964) observed that 80% of spelling errors in his data were just one edit-distance from the intended word.",
        "Similarly, (Mitton, 1987) found that 70% of his data was within one edit-distance from the intended word.",
        "Our edit distance feature represents the edit distance from the unknown word to the closest suggestion produced by the unix spell checker, ispell.",
        "If ispell does not produce any suggestions, an edit distance of thirty is assigned.",
        "In previous work we have experimented with more sophisticated distance measures.",
        "However, simple edit distance proved to be the most effective (Toole, 1999).",
        "Character sequence frequency: A characteristic of some misspellings is that they contain character sequences which are not typical of the language, e.g.tlted, wful.",
        "Exploiting this information is a standard way of identifying spelling errors when using a dictionary is not desired or appropriate, e.g. (Hull and Srihari, 1982), (Zamora et al., 1981).",
        "To calculate our character sequence feature, we firstly determine the frequencies of the two least frequent character trigram sequences in the word in each of a selection of corpora.",
        "In previous work we included each of these values as individual features.",
        "However, the resulting trees were quite unstable as one feature would be relevant to one tree, whereas a different character sequence feature would be relevant to another tree.",
        "To avoid this problem, we developed a composite feature that is the sum of all individual character sequence frequencies.",
        "Non-English characters: This binary feature specifies whether a word contains a character that is not typical of English words, such as accented characters, etc.",
        "Such characters are indicative of foreign names or transmission noise (in the case of captions) rather than misspellings."

        "Of the 7000 cases, 70.4% were manually identified as names and 21.3% were identified as mis-spellings.The remaining cases were other types of unknown words such as abbreviations, morphological variants, etc.",
        "Seventy percent of the data was randomly selected to serve as the training corpus.",
        "The remaining thirty percent, or 2100 records, was reserved as the test corpus.",

        "The average precision and recall data for the ten test sets are given in Table 3, together with the baseline case of assuming that we categorize all unknown words as names (the most common category).",
        "With the baseline case we achieve 70.4% precision but with 0% recall.",
        "In contrast, the decision tree approach obtains 77.1% precision and 73.8% recall.",
        "We also trained a decision tree using not only the features identified in our discussion on misspellings but also those features that we introduced in our discussion of name identification.",
        "The results for this tree can be found in the second line of Table 3.",
        "The inclusion of the additional features has increased precision by approximately 5%.",
        "However, it has also decreased recall by about the same amount.",
        "The overall F-score is quite similar.",
        "It appears that the name features are not predictive for identifying misspellings in this domain.",
        "This is not surprising considering that eight of the ten features specified for name identification are concerned with features of the two preceding and two following words.",
        "Such word-external information is of little use in identifying a misspelling.",
        "An analysis of the cases where the misspelling decision tree failed to identify a misspelling revealed two major classes of omissions.",
        "The first class contains a collection of words which have typical characteristics of English words, but differ from the intended word by the addition or deletion of a syllable.",
        "Words in this class include creditability for credibility, coordinatored for coordinated, and representives for representatives.",
        "The second class contains misspellings that differ from known words by the deletion of a blank.",
        "Examples in this class include webpage, crewlizeilibers, and rainshower.",
        "The second class of misspellings can be addressed by adding a feature that specifies whether the unknown word can be split up into two component known words.",
        "Such a feature should provide strong predictability for the second class of words.",
        "The first class of words are more of a challenge.",
        "These words have a close ho-mophonic relationship with the intended word rather than a close homographic relationship (as captured by edit distance).",
        "Perhaps this class of words would benefit from a feature representing phonetic distance rather than edit distance.",
        "Among those words which were incorrectly identified as misspellings, it is also possible to identify common causes for the misidentification.",
        "Among these words are many foreign words which have character sequences which are not common in English.",
        "Examples include khanchanalak, phytoplankton, bryceen.",
        "The results for our name identifier are given in Table 4.",
        "Again, the decision tree approach is a significant improvement over the baseline case.",
        "If we take the baseline approach and assume that all unknown words are names, then we would achieve a precision of 70.4%.",
        "However, using the decision tree approach, we obtain 86.5% precision and 92.9% recall.",
        "We also trained a tree using both the name and misspelling features.",
        "The results can be found in the second line of Table 4.",
        "Unlike the case when we trained the misspelling identifier on all the features, the extended tree for the name identifier provides increased recall as well as increased precision.",
        "Unlike the case with the misspelling decision-tree, the misspelling-identification features do provide predictive information for name identification.",
        "If we review the features, this result seems quite reasonable: features such as corpus frequency and non-English characters can provide evidence for/against name iden",
        "tification as well as for/against misspelling identification.",
        "For example, an unknown word that occurs quite frequently (such as clinton) is likely to be a name, whereas an unknown word that occurs infrequently (such as wind) is likely to be a misspelling.",
        "A review of the errors made by the name identifier again provides insight for future development.",
        "Among those unknown words that are names but which were not identified as such are predominantly names that can (and did) appear with determiners.",
        "Examples of this class include steelers in the steelers, and pathfinder in the pathfinder.",
        "Hence, the name identifier seems adept at finding the names of individual people and places, which typically cannot be combined with determiners.",
        "But, the name identifier has more problems with names that have similar distributions to common nouns.",
        "The cases where the name identifier incorrectly identifies unknown words as names also have identifiable characteristics.",
        "These examples mostly include words with unusual character sequences such as the misspellings szetion and fwlantg.",
        "No doubt these have similar characteristics to foreign names.",
        "As the misidentified words are also correctly identified as misspellings by the misspelling identifier, these are less problematic.",
        "It is the task of the decision-making component to resolve issues such as these.",
        "The final results we include are for the unknown word categorizer itself using the voting procedure outlined in previous discussion.",
        "As introduced previously, confidence measure is used as a tiebreaker in cases where the two components make positive decision.",

        "The precision metric identifies the number of correct misspelling or name categorizations over the total number of times a word was identified as a misspelling or a name.",
        "The recall metric identifies the number of times the system correctly identifies a misspelling or name over the number of misspellings and names existing in the data.",
        "As illustrated in Table 5, the unknown word categorizer achieves 86% precision and 89.9% recall on the task of identifying names and misspellings.",
        "An examination of the confusion matrix of the tiebreaker decisions is also revealing.",
        "We include the confusion matrix for one test data set in Table 6.",
        "Firstly, in only about 5% of the cases was it necessary to revert to confidence measure to determine the category of the unknown word.",
        "In all other cases the predictions were compatible.",
        "Secondly, in the majority of cases the decision-maker rules in favour of the name prediction.",
        "In hindsight this is not surprising since the name decision tree has higher results and hence is likely to have higher confidence measures.",
        "A review of the largest error category in this confusion matrix is also insightful.",
        "These are cases where the decision-maker classifies the unknown word as a name when it should be a misspelling (37 cases).",
        "The words in this category are typically examples where the misspelled word has a phonetic relationship with the intended word.",
        "For example, teint for tempt, floyda for florida, and dimow part of the intended word democrat.",
        "Not surprisingly, it was these types of words which were identified as problematic for the current misspelling identifier.",
        "Augmenting the misspelling identifier with features to identify these types of misspellings should also lead to improvement in the decision-maker.",
