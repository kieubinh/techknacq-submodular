        "In this paper, we describe and evaluate an implemented system for general-knowledge question answering.",
        "Open-ended question-answering systems that allow users to pose a question of any type, in any language, without domain restrictions, remain beyond the scope of today's text-processing systems.",
        "We investigate instead a restricted, but nevertheless useful variation of the problem (TREC-8, 2000): Given a large text collection and a set of questions specified in English, find answers to the questions in the collection.",
        "In addition, the restricted task guarantees that:",
        "• the answer exists in the collection, • all supporting information for the answer lies in a single document, and • the answer is short – less than 50 bytes in length.",
        "Consider, for example, the question Which country has the largest part of the Amazon rain forest?, taken from the TREC8 Question Answering development corpus.",
        "The answer (in document LA032590-0089) is Brazil.",
        "Previous research has addressed similar question-answering (QA) scenarios using a variety of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) techniques.",
        "Lehnert (1978) tackles the difficult task of answering questions in the context of story understanding.",
        "Unlike our restricted QA task, questions to Lehnert's system often require answers that are not explicitly mentioned in the story.",
        "Her goal then is to answer questions by making inferences about actions and actors in the story using world knowledge in the form of scripts, plans, and goals (Schank and Abelson, 1977).",
        "More recently, Burke et al.",
        "(1995; 1997) describe a system that answers natural language questions using a database of question-answer pairs built from existing frequently-asked question (FAQ) files.",
        "Their FAQFinder system uses IR techniques to match the given question to questions in the database.",
        "It then uses the Word-Net lexical semantic knowledge base (Miller et al., 1990; Fellbaum, 1998) to improve the quality of the match.",
        "Kupiec (1993) investigates a closed-class QA task that is similar in many respects to the TREC8 QA task that we address here: the system answers general-knowledge questions using an encyclopedia.",
        "In addition, Kupiec assumes that all answers are noun phrases.",
        "Although our task does not explicitly include a \"noun phrase\" constraint, the answer length restriction effectively imposes the same bias toward noun phrase answers.",
        "Kupiec's MURAX system applies a combination of statistical (IR) and linguistic (NLP) techniques.",
        "A series of secondary boolean search queries with proximity constraints is combined with shallow parsing methods to find relevant sections of the encyclopedia, to extract answer hypotheses, and to confirm phrase relations specified in the question.",
        "In an evaluation on 70 \"Trivial",
        "Pursuit\" who and what questions, Kupiec concludes that robust natural language analysis can add to the quality of the information retrieval process.",
        "In addition, he claims that, for their closed-class QA task, vector space IR methods (Salton et al., 1975) appear inadequate.",
        "We present here a new approach to the restricted question-answering task described above.",
        "Like MURAX, our system draws from both statistical and linguistic sources to find answers to general-knowledge questions.",
        "The underlying architecture of the system, however, is very different: it combines vector space IR techniques for document retrieval, a vector space approach to query-dependent text summarization, shallow corpus-based syntactic analysis, and knowledge-based semantic analysis.",
        "We evaluate the system on the TREC8 QA development corpus as well as the TREC8 QA test corpus.",
        "In particular, all parameters for the final QA system are determined using the development corpus.",

        "Furthermore, the first guess is correct for 16 out of the 22 development questions and 53 out of 91 of the test questions.",
        "More importantly, we investigate the relative role of each statistical and linguistic knowledge source in the proposed IR/NLP question-answering system.",
        "In contrast to previous results, we find that statistical knowledge of word co-occurrences as computed by vector space models of IR can be used to quickly and accurately locate relevant documents in the restricted QA task.",
        "When used in isolation, vector space methods for query-dependent text summarization, however, provide relatively small increases in performance.",

        "Given a question, the goal of the IR component is then to return a ranked list of those text chunks (e.g. documents, sentences, or paragraphs) from the indexed collection that are most relevant to the query and from which answer hypotheses can be extracted.",
        "Next, the QA system optionally applies one or more linguistic filters to the text chunks to extract an ordered list of answer hypotheses.",

        "This is a clear indication that the heuristics used in the semantic type checking component, which were designed based on the development corpus, do not generalize well to different question sets.",
        "Replacing the current heuristics with a Named Entity identification component or learning the heuristics using standard inductive learning techniques should help with the scalability of this linguistic filter.",
        "Nevertheless, it is somewhat surprising that very weak syntactic information (the NP filter) and weak semantic class information (question type checking) can produce such improvements.",

        "As noted above, the final system (with the liberal 50-byte answer chunker) correctly answers 22 out of 38 questions for the development corpus.",
        "Of the 16 errors, the text retrieval component is responsible for five (31.2%), the text summarization component for ten (62.5%), and the linguistic filters for one (6.3%).",

        "We have described and evaluated a series of question-answering systems, each of which incorporates a different combination of statistical and linguistic knowledge sources.",
        "We find that even very weak linguistic knowledge can offer substantial improvements over purely IR-based techniques especially when smoothly integrated with the text passage preferences computed by the IR subsystems.",
        "Although our primary goal was to investigate the use of statistical and linguistic knowledge sources, it is possible to compare our approach and our results to those for systems in the recent TREC8 QA evaluation.",
        "Scores on the TREC8 test corpus for systems participating in the QA evaluation ranged between 3 and 146 correct.",
        "Discarding the top three scores and the worst three scores, the remaining eight systems achieved between 52 and 91 correct.",
        "Using the liberal answer chunker, our final QA system equals the best of these systems (91 correct); without it, our score of 65 correct places our QA system near the middle of this group of eight.",
        "Like the work described here, virtually all of the top-ranked TREC8 systems use a combination of IR, and shallow NLP for their QA systems.",
        "IBM's AnSel system (Prager et al., 2000), for example, employs finite-state patterns as its primary shallow NLP component.",
        "These are used to recognize a fairly broad set of about 20 named entities.",
        "The IR component indexes only text passages associated with these entities.",
        "The AT&T QA system (Singhal et al., 2000), the Qanda system (Breck et al., 2000), and the SyncMatcher system (Oard et al., 2000) all employ vector-space methods from IR, named entity identifiers, and a fairly simple question type determiner.",
        "In addition, SyncMatcher uses a broad-coverage dependency parser to enforce phrase relationship constraints.",
        "Instead of the vector space model, the LASSO system (Moldovan et al., 2000) uses boolean search operators for paragraph retrieval.",
        "Recognition of answer hypotheses in their system relies on identifying named entities.",
        "Finally, the Cymphony QA system (Srihari and Li, 2000) relies heavily on named entity identification; it also employs standard IR techniques and a shallow parser.",
        "In terms of statistical and linguistic knowledge sources employed, the primary difference between these systems and ours is our lack of an adequate named entity tagger.",
        "Incorporation of such a tagger will be a focus of future work.",
        "In addition, we believe that the retrieval and summarization components can be improved by incorporating automatic relevance feedback (Buckley, 1995) and coreference resolution.",
        "Morton (1999), for example, shows that coreference resolution improves passage retrieval for their question-answering system.",
        "We also plan to reconsider paragraph-based summaries given their coverage on the test corpus.",
        "The most critical area for improvement, however, is the linguistic filters.",
        "The semantic type filter will be greatly improved by the addition of a named entity tagger, but we believe that additional gains can be attained by augmenting named entity identification with information from WordNet.",
        "Finally, we currently make no attempt to confirm any phrase relations from the query.",
        "Without this, system performance will remain severely limited."
