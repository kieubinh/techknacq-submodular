        "The Specificity Rule for determining the most specific part of the list of simple binding terms constituting a macro-noun phrase chooses the first simple term in the list which has either of the following two characteristics: a) The head was identified by the Morphology Shape Rule.",
        "b) The noun phrase maps to a UMLS concept having one of the following semantic types: `Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein', 'Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide', 'Nucleotide Sequence', 'Immunologic Factor', or 'Gene or Genome'.",
        "For example, in (5), the second simple term, TNF-alpha promoter, maps to the Meta-thesaurus with semantic type 'Nucleotide Se-quence' and is thus considered to be the most specific term in this complex-noun phrase.",
        "(5) binding_term( [transcriptionally active kappaB motifs], [in the TNF-alpha promoter], [in normal cells]) In identifying binding terms as arguments of a complete binding predication, as indicated above, we examine only those binding relations cued by some form of the verb bind (bind, binds, bound, and binding).",
        "The list of minimal syntactic phrases constituting the partial parse of the input sentence is examined from left to right; for each occurrence of a form of binds, the two binding terms serving as arguments are then sought.",
        "(During the tagging process, we force bind, binds, and bound to be labeled as \"verb,\" and binding as \"noun.\") A partial analysis of negation and coordination is undertaken by ARBITER, but anaphora resolution and a syntactic treatment of re-lativization are not attempted.",
        "With the added constraint that a binding argument must have been identified as a binding term based on the domain knowledge resources used, the partial syntactic analysis available to ARBITER supports the accurate identification of a large number of binding predications asserted in the research literature.",
        "It is convenient to categorize binding predications into two classes depending on which form of bind cues the predication: a) binding and b) bind, binds, and bound.",
        "In our test collection (discussed below), about half of the binding relationships asserted in the text are cued by the gerundive or participial form binding.",
        "In this syntactic predication, the resources available from the underspecified syntactic parse serve quite well as the basis for correctly identifying the arguments of the binding relationship.",
        "The most common argument configuration associated with binding is for both arguments to occur to the right, cued by prepositions, most commonly of and to; however, other frequent patterns are of-by and to-by.",
        "Another method of argument cuing for binding is for the subject of the predication to function syntactically as a modifier of the head binding in the same simple noun phrase.",
        "The object in this instance is then cued by either of or to (to the right).",
        "A few other patterns are seen and some occurrences of binding do not cue a complete predication; either the subject is missing or neither argument is explicitly mentioned.",
        "However, the examples in (6) fairly represent the interpretation of binding.",
        "(6) These results suggest that 2 amino acids, Thr-340 and Ser-343, play important but distinct roles in promoting the binding of ar-restin to rhodopsin.",
        "<arrestin> BINDS <rhodopsin> Surprisingly, arrestin binding to phospho-rylated T340E did not increase to the level observed for wild-type rhodopsin.",
        "<arrestin> BINDS <phosphorylated t340e>",
        "The arguments of forms of bind other than binding invariably occur on either side of the cuing verb form.",
        "The default strategy for identifying both arguments in these instances is to choose the closest binding term on either side of the verb.",
        "In the cases we have investigated, this strategy works often enough to be useful for the surface object.",
        "However, due to predicate coordination as well as relativization, such a strategy often fails to identify correctly the surface subject of bind (binds or bound) when more than",
        "one binding term precedes the verb.",
        "We therefore use the strategy summarized in (7) for recovering the surface subject in such instances.",
        "(7) When more than one binding term precedes a form of bind other than binding, choose the most specific of these binding terms as the surface subject of the predication.",
        "\"Most specific\" is determined (recursively) for a series of binding terms in the same way that the most specific part of a complex binding term is determined.",
        "The input text (8) provides an example of a binding predication cued by binds in which the arguments appear (immediately) on either side of the cuing verb.",
        "The two macro-noun phrases serving as potential arguments are underlined.",
        "(8) A transcription factor, Auxin Response Factor 1, that binds to the sequence TGTCTC in auxin response elements was cloned from Arabidopsis by using a yeast one-hybrid system.",
        "(9) <auxin response factor 1> BINDS",
        "<sequence tgtctc> In the extracted binding relationship in (9), the Specificity Rule chooses Auxin Response Factor 1 from the first macro-noun phrase because it maps to the UMLS Metathesaurus with semantic type 'Amino Acid, Peptide, or Pro-tein'.",
        "In the second argument, the sequence TGTCTC has a head that submits to the Morphology Shape Rule and hence is considered to be more specific than auxin response elements.",
        "In (10), the Specificity Rule applies correctly to select the surface subject of the binding predication when multiple binding terms appear to the left of the verb.",
        "(10) Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein has a single lipid-binding site that can reversibly bind phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidyl-choline and transfer these lipids between membrane compartments in vitro.",
        "<phosphatidylinositol transfer protein> BINDS <phosphatidylcholine> <phosphatidylinositol transfer protein> BINDS <phosphatidylinositol>",
        "Both Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and a single lipid-binding site occur to the left of bind and have been identified as binding terms by the first phase of processing.",
        "However, Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein maps to the corresponding Metathesaurus concept with semantic type 'Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, thus causing it to be more specific than a single lipid-binding site.",
        "The second predication listed in (10) was correctly extracted due to coordination processing.",
        "ARBITER pursues limited coordination identification in the spirit of Agarwal and Bog-gess (1992) and Rindflesch (1995).",
        "Only binding terms are considered as candidates for coordination.",
        "For each conjunction encountered, the phrase immediately to the right is examined; if it is a binding term, all contiguous binding terms occurring immediately to the left of the conjunct are considered to be coordinate with the right conjunct.",
        "Coordination inside the simple noun phrase is not considered, and therefore structures such as The TCR alpha beta or gamma delta chains are not recognized.",
        "Nonetheless, as indicated in (11), this limited approach to noun phrase coordination is often effective.",
        "(11) Purified recombinant NC1, like authentic NC 1, also bound specifically to fibronectin, collagen type I, and a laminin 5/6 complex."
