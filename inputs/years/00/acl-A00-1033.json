        "Current information extraction (IE) systems are quite successful in efficient processing of large free text collections due to the fact that they can provide a partial understanding of specific types of text with a certain degree of partial accuracy using fast and robust language processing strategies (basically finite state technology).",
        "They have been \"made sensitive\" to certain key pieces of information and thereby provide an easy means to skip text without deep analysis.",
        "The majority of existing IE systems are applied to English text, but there are now a number of systems which process other languages as well (e.g., German (Neumann et al., 1997), Italian (Ciravegna et al., 1999) or Japanese (Sekine and Nobata, 1998)).",
        "The majority of current systems perform a partial parsing approach using only very few general syntactic knowledge for the identification of nominal and prepositional phrases and verb groups.",
        "The combination of such units is then performed by means of domain-specific templates.",
        "Usually, these templates",
        "are triggered by domain-specific predicates attached only to a relevant subset of verbs which express domain-specific selectional restrictions for possible argument fillers.",
        "In most of the well-known shallow text processing systems (cf. (Sundheim, 1995) and (SAIC, 1998)) cascaded chunk parsers are used which perform clause recognition after fragment recognition following a bottom-up style as described in (Abney, 1996).",
        "We have also developed a similar bottom-up strategy for the processing of German texts, cf. (Neumann et al., 1997).",
        "However, the main problem we experienced using the bottom-up strategy was insufficient robustness: because the parser depends on the lower phrasal recognizers, its performance is heavily influenced by their respective performance.",
        "As a consequence, the parser frequently wasn't able to process structurally simple sentences, because they contained, for example, highly complex nominal phrases, as in the following example: \"[Die vom Bundesgerichtshof and den Wettbewerbshiitern als Verstof3 gegen das Kartellverbot gegeif3elte zentrale TV-Vermarktung] ist gdngige Praxis.\" Central television marketing, censured by the German Federal High Court and the guards against unfair competition as an infringement of anti-cartel legislation, is common practice.",
        "During free text processing it might be not possible (or even desirable) to recognize such a phrase completely.",
        "However, if we assume that domain-specific templates are associated with certain verbs or verb groups which trigger template filling, then it will be very difficult to find the appropriate fillers without knowing the correct clause structure.",
        "Furthermore in a sole bottom-up approach some ambiguities – for example relative pronouns – can't be resolved without introducing much underspecification into the intermediate structures.",
        "Therefore we propose the following divide-and-conquer parsing strategy: In a first phase only the verb groups and the topological structure of a sentence according to the linguistic field the",

        "In a second phase, general (as well as domain-specific) phrasal grammars (nominal and prepositional phrases) are applied to the contents of the different fields of the main and sub-clauses (see fig. 1) This approach offers several advantages:",
        "• improved robustness, because parsing of the sentence topology is based only on simple indicators like verbgroups and conjunctions and their interplay, • the resolution of some ambiguities, including relative pronouns vs. determiner, subjunction vs. preposition and sentence coordination vs. NP coordination, and • a high degree of modularity (easy integration of domain-dependent subcomponents).",
        "The shallow divide-and-conquer parser (DC-PARSER) is supported by means of powerful morphological processing (including on-line compound analysis), efficient POS-filtering and named entity recognition.",
        "Thus the architecture of the complete shallow text processing approach consists basically of two main components: the preprocessor and the DC-PARSER itself (see fig. 2)."

        "The DC-PARSER relies on a suitably configured preprocessing strategy in order to achieve the desired simplicity and performance.",
        "It consists of the following main steps: Tokenization The tokenizer maps sequences of consecutive characters into larger units called tokens and identifies their types.",
        "Currently we use more than 50 domain-independent token classes including generic classes for semantically ambiguous tokens (e.g., \"10:15\" could be a time expression or volleyball result, hence we classify this token as number-dot compound) and complex classes like abbreviations or complex compounds (e.g., \"AT&T-Chief\").",
        "It proved that such variety of token classes simplifies the processing of subsequent submodules significantly.",
        "Morphology Each token identified as a potential wordform is submitted to the morphological analysis including on-line recognition of compounds (which is crucial since compounding is a very productive process of the German language) and hyphen coordination (e.g., in \"An- and Verkauf\" (purchase and sale) \"An-\" is resolved to \"Ankauf\" (purchase)).",
        "Each token recognized as a valid word form is associated with the list of its possible readings, characterized by stem, inflection information and part of speech category.",
        "POS-filtering Since a high amount of German word forms is ambiguous, especially word forms with a verb readings and due to the fact that the quality of the results of the DC-PARSER relies essentially on the proper recognition of verb groups, efficient disambiguation strategies are needed.",
        "Using case-sensitive rules is straightforward since generally only nouns (and proper names) are written in standard German with a capitalized initial letter (e.g., \"das Unternehmen\" - the enterprise vs. \"wir un-ternehmen\" - we undertake).",
        "However for disambiguation of word forms appearing at the beginning of the sentence local contextual filtering rules are applied.",
        "For instance, the rule which forbids the verb written with a capitalized initial letter to be followed by a finite verb would filter out the verb reading of the word \"unternehmen\" in the sentence",
        "\"Unternehmen sind an Gewinnmaximierung intere-siert.\" (Enterprises are interested in maximizing their profits).",
        "A major subclass of ambiguous wordforms are those which have an adjective or attributivly used participle reading beside the verb reading.",
        "For instance, in the sentence \"Sie bekannten, die bekannten Bilder gestohlen zu haben.\" (They confessed they have stolen the famous paintings.)",
        "the wordform \"bekannten\" is firstly used as a verb (confessed) and secondly as an adjective (famous).",
        "Since adjectives and attributively used participles are in most cases part of a nominal phrase a convenient rule would reject the verb reading if the previous word form is a determiner or the next word form is a noun.",
        "It is important to notice that such rules are based on some regularities, but they may yield false results, like for instance the rule for filtering out the verb reading of some word forms extremely rarely used as verbs (e.g., \"recht\" - right, to rake (3rd person,sg)).",
        "All rules are compiled into a single finite-state transducer according to the approach described in (Roche and Schabes, 1995).2 Named entity finder Named entities such as organizations, persons, locations and time expressions are identified using finite-state grammars.",
        "Since some named entities (e.g. company names) may appear in the text either with or without a designator, we use a dynamic lexicon to store recognized named entities without their designators (e.g., \"Braun AG\" vs. \"Braun\") in order to identify subsequent occurrences correctly.",
        "However a named entity, consisting solely of one word, may be also a valid word form (e.g., \"Braun\" – brown).",
        "Hence we classify such words as candidates for named entities since generally such ambiguities cannot be resolved at this level.",
        "Recognition of named entities could be postponed and integrated into the fragment recognizer, but performing this task at this stage of processing seems to be more appropriate.",
        "Firstly because the results of POS-filtering could be partially verified and improved and secondly the amount of the word forms to be processed by subsequent modules could be considerably reduced.",
        "For instance the verb reading of the word form \"achten\" (watch vs. eight) in the time expression \"am achten Oktober 1995\" (at the eight of the October 1995) could be filtered out if not done yet."

        "Verb groups A verb grammar recognizes all single occurrences of verbforms (in most cases corresponding to LVP) and all closed verbgroups (i.e., sequences of verbforms, corresponding to RVP).",

        "Because the dog ate the beef which was put on the window sill after it had been prepared by the woman.",
        "Two sorts of recursion can be distinguished: 1) middle field (MF) recursion, where the embedded base clause is framed by the left and right verb parts of the embedding sentence, and 2) the rest field (RF) recursion, where the embedded clause follows the right verb part of the embedding sentence.",
        "In order to express and handle this sort of recursion using a finite state approach, both recursions are treated as iterations such that they destructively substitute recognized embedded base clauses with their type.",
        "Hence, the complexity of the recognized structure of the sentence is reduced successively.",
        "However, because subclauses of MF-recursion may have their own embedded RF-recursion the CLAUSE COMBINATION (CC) is used for bundling subsequent base clauses before they would be combined with subclauses identified by the outer MF-recursion.",
        "The BC and CC module are called until no more base clauses can be reduced.",
