        "The need for knowledge The knowledge is infinite and no matter how large a knowledge base is, it is not possible to store all the concepts and procedures for all domains.",
        "Even if that were possible, the knowledge is generative and there are no guarantees that a system will have the latest information all the time.",
        "And yet, if we are to build common-sense knowledge processing systems in the future, it is necessary to have general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge that is up to date.",
        "Our inability to build large knowledge bases without much effort has impeded many ANLP developments.",
        "The most successful current Information Extraction systems rely on hand coded linguistic rules representing lexico-syntactic patterns capable of matching natural language expressions of events.",
        "Since the rules are hand-coded it is difficult to port systems across domains.",
        "Question answering, inference, summarization, and other applications can benefit from large linguistic knowledge bases.",
        "The basic idea A possible solution to the problem of rapid development of flexible knowledge bases is to design an automatic knowledge acquisition system that extracts knowledge from texts for the purpose of merging it with a core ontological knowledge base.",
        "The attempt to create a knowledge base manually is time consuming and error prone, even for small application domains, and we believe that automatic knowledge acquisition and classification is the only viable solution to large-scale, knowledge intensive applications.",
        "This paper presents an interactive method that acquires new concepts and connections associated with user-selected seed concepts, and adds them to the WordNet linguistic knowledge structure (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "The sources of the new knowledge are texts acquired from the Internet or other corpora.",
        "At the present time, our system works in a semi-automatic mode, in the sense that it acquires concepts and relations automatically, but their validation is done by the user.",
        "We believe that domain knowledge should not be acquired in a vacuum; it should expand an existent ontology with a skeletal structure built on consistent and acceptable principles.",
        "The method presented in this paper is applicable to any Machine Readable Dictionary.",
        "However, we chose WordNet because it is freely available and widely used.",
        "Related work This work was inspired in part by Marti Hearst's paper (Hearst 1998) where she discovers manually lexico-syntactic patterns for the HYPERNYMY relation in WordNet.",
        "Much of the work in pattern extraction from texts was done for improving the performance of Information Extraction systems.",
        "Research in this area was done by (Kim and Moldovan 1995) (Riloff 1996), (Soderland 1997) and others.",

        "It consists of four parts: (1) discovery of new concepts, (2) discovery of new lexical patterns, (3) discovery of new relationships reflected by the lexical patterns, and (4) the classification and integration of the knowledge discovered with a WordNet - like knowledge base."

        "The concepts and the relationships acquired can be useful in answering difficult questions that normally cannot be easily answered just by using the information from WordNet.",
        "Consider the processing of the following questions after the new domain knowledge has been acquired:",
        "Q1: What factors have an impact on the interest rate?",
        "Q2: What happens with the employment when the economic growth rises?",
        "Q3: How does deflation influence prices?",
        "of the relationship was not specified in the text).",
        "Figure 6 shows a portion of the new domain knowledge that is relevant to these questions.",
        "The first question can be easily answered by extracting the relationships that point to the concept interest rate.",
        "The factors that influence the interest rate are Fed, inflation, economic growth, and employment.",
        "The last two questions ask for more detailed information about the complex relationship among these concepts.",
        "Following the path from the deflation concept up to prices, the system learns that deflation influences direct proportionally real interest rate, and real interest rate has an inverse proportional impact on prices.",
        "Both these relationships came from the sentence: Thus, the deflation and the real interest rate are positively correlated, and so a higher real interest rate leads to falling prices.",
        "This method may be adapted to acquire information when the question concepts are not in the knowledge base.",
        "Procedures may be invoked to discover these concepts and the relations in which they may be used."

        "The knowledge acquisition technology described above is applicable to any domain, by simply selecting appropriate seed concepts.",
        "We started with five concepts interest rate, stock market, inflation, economic growth, and employment and from a corpus of 5000 sentences we acquired a total of 362 concepts of which 319 contain the seeds and 43 relate to these via selected relations.",
        "There were 22 distinct lexico-syntactic patterns discovered used in 63 instances.",
        "Most importantly, the new concepts can be integrated with an existing ontology.",
        "The method works in an interactive mode where the user accepts or declines concepts, patterns and relationships.",
        "The manual operation took on average 40 minutes per seed for the 5000 sentence corpus.",
        "KAT is useful considering that most of the knowledge base construction today is done manually.",
        "Complex linguistic phenomena such as coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, and others have to be dealt with in order to increase the automation of the knowledge acquisition system.",
        "Without a good handling of these problems the results are not always accurate and human intervention is necessary."
