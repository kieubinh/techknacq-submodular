        "The task of Information Extraction (IE) is the selective extraction of meaning from free natural language text.1 \"Meaning\" is understood here in terms of a fixed set of semantic objects – entities, relationships among entities, and events in which entities participate.",
        "The semantic objects belong to a small number of types, all having fixed regular structure, within a fixed and closely circumscribed subject domain.",
        "The extracted objects are then stored in a relational database.",
        "In this paper, we use the nomenclature accepted in current IE literature; the term subject domain denotes a class of textual documents to be processed, e.g., \"business news,\" and scenario denotes the specific topic of interest within the domain, i.e., the set of facts to be extracted.",
        "One example of a scenario is \"management succession,\" the topic of MUC-6 (the Sixth Message Understanding Conference); in this scenario the system seeks to identify events in which corporate managers left",
        "their posts or assumed new ones.",
        "We will consider this scenario in detail in a later section describing experiments.",
        "IE systems today are commonly based on pattern matching.",
        "The patterns are regular expressions, stored in a \"pattern base\" containing a general-purpose component and a substantial domain and scenario-specific component.",
        "Portability and performance are two major problem areas which are recognized as impeding widespread use of IE.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach, which addresses both of these problems by automatically discovering good patterns for a new scenario.",
        "The viability of our approach is tested and evaluated with an actual IE system.",
        "In the next section we describe the problem in more detail in the context of our IE system; sections 2 and 3 describe our algorithm for pattern discovery; section 4 describes our experimental results, followed by comparison with prior work and discussion, in section 5."

        "Our IE system, among others, contains a a back-end core engine, at the heart of which is a regular-expression pattern matcher.",
        "The engine draws on attendant knowledge bases (KBs) of varying degrees of domain-specificity.",
        "The KB components are commonly factored out to make the systems portable to new scenarios.",
        "There are four customizable knowledge bases in our IE system: the Lexicon contains general dictionaries and scenario-specific terms; the concept base groups terms into classes; the predicate base describes the logical structure of events to be extracted, and the pattern base contains patterns that catch the events in text.",
        "Each KB has a• substantial domain-specific component, which must be modified when mov",
        "ing to new domains and scenarios.",
        "The system allows the user (i.e. scenario developer) to start with example sentences in text which contain events of interest, the candidates, and generalize them into patterns.",
        "However, the user is ultimately responsible for finding all the candidates, which amounts to manually processing example sentences in a very large training corpus.",
        "Should s/he fail to provide an example of a particular class of syntactic/semantic construction, the system has no hope of recovering the corresponding events.",
        "Our experience has shown that (1) the process of discovering candidates is highly expensive, and (2) gaps in patterns directly translate into gaps in coverage.",
        "How can the system help automate the process of discovering new good candidates?",
        "The system should find examples of all common linguistic constructs relevant to a scenario.",
        "While there has been prior research on identifying the primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or corpus (Grishman et al., 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process.",
        "The difficulty is that one of the best indications of the relevance of the passages is precisely the presence of these constructs.",
        "Because of this circularity, we propose to acquire the constructs and passages in tandem."

        "We feel that the generalization technique in pattern discovery offers a great opportunity for combating sparseness of data, though this requires further research.",
