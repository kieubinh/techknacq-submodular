        "Even moderately long documents typically address sew~ral topics or different aspects of the same topic.",

        "The uses of this procedure include information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Reynar, 1999), summarization (Reynar, 1998), text understanding, anaphora resolution (Kozima, 1993), language modelling (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Beeferman et al., 199717) and improving document navigation for the visually disabled (Choi, 2000).",
        "This paper focuses on domain independent methods for segmenting written text.",
        "We present a new algorithm that builds on previous work by Reynar (Reynar, 1998; Reynar, 1994).",
        "The primary distinction of our method is the use of a ranking scheme and the cosine similarity measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979) in formulating the similarity matrix.",
        "We propose that the similarity values of short text segments is statistically insignificant.",

        "They proposed that text segments with similar vocabulary are likely to be part of a coherent topic segment.",
        "Implementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al., 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance model (Beeferman et al., 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion.",
        "Methods for finding the topic boundaries include sliding window (Hearst, 1994), lexical chains (Morris, 1988; Kan et al., 1998), dynamic programming (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998), agglomerative clustering (Yaari, 1997) and divisive clustering (Reynar, 1994).",
        "Lexical cohesion methods are typically used for segmenting written text in a collection to improve information retrieval (Hearst, 1994; Reynat, 1998).",
        "Multi-source methods combine lexical cohesion with other indicators of topic shift such as cue phrases, prosodic features, reference, syntax and lexical attraction (Beeferman et al., 1997a) using decision trees (Miike et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Litman and Passonneau, 1995) and probabilistic models (Beeferman et al., 1997b; Hajime et al., 1998; Reynar, 1998).",
        "Work in this area is largely motivated by the topic detection and tracking (TDT) initiative (Allan et al., 1998).",
        "The focus is on the segmentation of transcribed spoken text and broadcast news stories where the presentation format and regular cues can be exploited to improve accuracy."
