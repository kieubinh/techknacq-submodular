        "The goal of this paper is to describe how the EuroWordNet framework for representing lexical meaning is being modified within an Italian National Project in order to include information on adjectives.",
        "The focus is on the 'new' semantic relations being encoded and on the revisions we have made to the EuroWordNet Top Ontology structure.",
        "We also briefly discuss the utility of the information which is being encoded for computational applications.",
        "Relational adjectives, on the other hand, mean something like \"relating/pertaining to, associated with\", and usually have a morphologically strong link with a noun.",
        "Typical examples are musical, atomic, chemical 5.",
        "Synonymy is the basic relation encoded for all the PoSs (since it is used to build synsets).",
        "While in WN the noun and verb networks are then mainly developed around the superordinate (hyper/hyponymy) relationship, the organization of descriptive adjectives can \"be visualized in terms of barbell-like structures, with a direct antonym in the centre of each disk surrounded by its semantically similar adjectives (which constitute the indirect antonyms of the adjectives in the opposed disk)\" (Fellbaum 1998a: 212).",
        "The main relation encoded for these adjective synsets is antonymy, claimed to be the most prominent relation, both from a psycholinguistic point of view and from a more strictly lexical-semantic one, in the definition of the semantics of descriptive adjectives.",
        "Hyponymy is substituted by a 'similarity' relation.",
        "Relational adjectives, on the contrary, are not organized in this way, because their semantics cannot be described by using these relations.",
        "Indeed, they only point to the noun to which they pertain (e.g. atomic is linked to atom).",
        "Finally, information on the selectional preferences of both descriptive and relational adjectives is sometimes encoded (e.g., between high and degree), by using an 'is_attribute_of' relation."

        "For example, musicale (musical) can modify the noun voce (voice) when we want to say that a voice is sweet-sounding and melodious, but can also be combined with the noun strumento (instrument) when we want to indicate that an instrument can be used to produce music.",

        "For instance, it will be possible to infer semantic preferences of certain classes: e.g., all the adjectives occurring in the taxonomy of contenente (containing) will occur as attributes of concrete nouns; adjectives found in the taxonomy of affetto (affected by an illness) will never be predicated of nouns referring to objects, etc.",
        "Furthermore, it will also be possible to infer information on syntactic characteristics /I/11 of adjectives found in the same taxonomy: e.g., the hyponyrns of atto (suitable for) are always found in predicative position (and do not accept any complements); the hyponyms of privo (lacking) may occur both in attributive and in predicative position (and may take certain prepositional complements), etc.",

        "First of all, we moved the PROPERTY and RELATION nodes under the SITUATION COMPONENT node.",
        "This was done for two interconnected reasons: first of all, because this distinction is not directly linked to Aktionsart (lexical aspect), while the distinctions under SITUATION TYPE are Aktionsart distinctions, i.e. they are connected with the \"the procedural characteristics (i.e. the 'phasal structure', 'time extension' and 'manner of development') ascribed to any given situation referred to by a verb phrase\" (Bache 1982: 70) ~deg.",
        "Secondly, adjectives may refer to PROPERTIES or RELATIONS, but they may be either stative or not (cfr.",

        "1985; Peters et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Thus, in our system it has to be possible to specify that an adjective expresses a PROPERTY while being DYNAMIC.",
        "In any case, since many adjectives may have both a DYNAMIC sense and a STATIC one, we have also the possibility to under-specify this information Io Of course, in EWN all 2oes (and therefore also nouns or adjectives) can be classified according to their Aktionsart.",
        "by linking adjectives directly to the SITUATION TYPE node.",
        "Adjectives may indicate many different types of properties: temporal (passeggiata mattutina morning walk), psychological (canzone triste sad song), social (uomo ricco - rich man), physical (superficie legnosa - wooden surface), physiological (bambino magro - thin child), perceptive (minestra calda hot soup), quantitative (magra ricompensa - poor reward) and intensity properties (vino forte - strong wine).",
        "In the EWN TO there are already nodes which may be used to represent these distinctions (TIME, MENTAL, SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, QUANTITY) but we needed to better specify or also add some features.",
        "For example, we have added, under the already present node PHYSICAL, the node MATERIAL, to represent, among others, some Italian adjectives ending in -oso (for example legnoso - wooden, acquoso watery) which indicate the property of containing a certain material.",
        "Moreover, we added the node PHYSIOLOGICAL (to classify adjectives corresponding to tired, hungry, sick, etc.)",
        "under PHYSICAL.",
        "For adjectives denoting an intensity, we then added the node INTENSITY directly under the SITUATION COMPONENT node.",
        "One of the main problem we had was that no Top Concept in the EWN TO could be used to classify the reference-modifying adjectives (cf. above).",
        "These are a very particular kind of adjectives, because they do not indicate a property of the referent of the noun they modify.",
        "So, aiming at showing the distinction between referent-modifiers and reference-modifiers, we created two new Top Concepts under the node PROPERTY: ATTRIBUTE and FUNCTIONAL, where the latter can be used for reference-modifying adjectives (according to the definition provided by Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 for the category referred to by these adjectives: \"a function from properties to properties\").",
        "Like all descriptive adjectives, also the reference-modifiers classified under the node FUNCTIONAL can be linked to other SITUATION COMPONENTS.",
        "Functional adjectives for which the temporal aspect prevails (ex former, presente - present) can be classified under the node TIME; adjectives referring to some 'epistemological' property (potenziale potential, necessario - necessary) can be linked tO MODAL 11; etc.",
        "A particular case of functional adjectives are the 'argumental' ones.",
        "They introduce a comparison between different entities (e.g., simile - similar, diverso - different, etc.).",
        "A comparison presupposes a relation between different entities so these adjectives can be linked to both PROPERTY and RELATION.",
        "Since in the EWN TO these two Top Concepts were two different kinds of SITUATION TYPE, they were mutually exclusive; now, in the IWN revised TO they can be conjoined.",

        "For these three senses of the adjective we would encode different relations, extractable from our sources: depressol IS_CAUSEDBY deprimere (to lower) The relations encoded could, e.g., help disambiguate the occurrences of the adjective in contexts such as: Gianni era depresso (Gianni was depressed) or Quella regione ~ depressa (That area is depressed).",
        "Indeed, by checking the semantic information encoded for the two senses of depressione linked to depresso, it's possible to provide the right interpretation for the sentences under analysis; on the other hand, the first sense of the adjective would be excluded because of the IS A VALUE OF relation encoded.",
        "In this case, also the TO links could be helpful: actually, depresso2 would be linked to SOCIAL and CONDITION, while depresso3 would be linked to MENTAL and EXPERIENCE.",
