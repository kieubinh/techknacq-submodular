        "However, the information about sentence frames provided in WordNet does not correspond to the generalizations that are apparent in FrameNet.",
        "For example, WordNet gives the same sentence frames for Senses 1 and 2, while in the FrameNet database, the senses of argue defined relative to the Statement and Conversation frames are characterized by different argument structures: only Statement argue allows finite clausal complements expressing Message; Conversation argue has the properties of other reciprocal communication words, which Statement argue lacks, and does not allow clausal Complements (or any other expression of Message).",
        "COMLEX (Meyers et al.",
        "1995) recognizes the syntactic frames in which argue occurs, but does not provide information about the linking of syntactic constituents with semantic roles, or about the different complementation properties of different senses of ambiguous words.",
