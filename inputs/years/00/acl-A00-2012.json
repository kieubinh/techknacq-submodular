        "Morphologically, Arabic is a non-concatenative language.",
        "The basic problem with generating Arabic verbal morphology is the large number of variants that must be generated.",
        "Verbal stems are based on triliteral or quadriliteral roots (3- or 4-radicals).",
        "Stems are formed by a derivational combination of a root morpheme and a vowel melody; the two are arranged according to canonical patterns.",
        "Roots are said to interdigitate with patterns to form stems.",
        "For example, the Arabic stem katab (he wrote) is composed of the morpheme ktb (notion of writing) and the vowel melody morpheme `a-a'.",
        "The two are coordinated according to the pattern CVCVC (C=consonant, V=vowel).",
        "There are 15 triliteral patterns, of which at least 9 are in common use, and 4 much rarer quadriliteral patterns.",
        "All these patterns undergo some stem changes with respect to voweling in the 2 tenses (perfect and imperfect), the 2 voices (active and passive), and the 5 moods (indicative, subjunctive, jussive, imperative and energetic).'",
        "The stem used in the conjugation of the verb may differ depending on the person, number, gender, tense, mood, and the presence of certain root consonants.",
        "Stem changes combine with suffixes in the perfect indicative (e.g., katab-naa 'we wrote', kutib-a 'it was written') and the imperative (e.g. uktub-uu `write', plural), and with both prefixes and suffixes for the imperfect tense in the indicative, subjunctive, and jussive moods (e.g. ya-ktub-na `they write, feminine plural') and in the energetic mood (e.g. ya-ktub-unna or ya-ktub-un `he certainly writes').",
        "There are a total of 13 person-number-gender combinations.",
        "Distinct prefixes are used in the active and passive voices in the imperfect, although in most cases this results in a change in the written form only if diacritic marks are used.2 Most previous computational treatments of Arabic morphology are based on linguistic models that describe Arabic in a non-concatenative way and focus primarily on analysis.",
        "Beesley (1991) describes a system that analyzes Arabic words based on Koskenniemi's 1 The jussive is used in specific constructions, for example, negation in the past with the negative particle lam (e.g., lam aktub 'I didn't write').",
        "The energetic expresses corroboration of an action taking place.",
        "The indicative is common to both perfect and imperfect tenses, but the subjunctive and the jussive are restricted to the imperfect tense.",
        "The imperative has a special form, and the energetic can be derived from either the imperfect or the imperative.",
        "(1983) two-level morphology.",
        "In Beesley (1996) the system is reworked into a finite-state lexical transducer to perform analysis and generation.",
        "In two-level systems, the lexical level includes short vowels that are typically not realized on the the surface level.",
        "Kiraz (1994) presents an analysis of Arabic morphology based on the CV-, moraic-, and affixational models.",
        "He introduces a multi-tape two-level model and a formalism where three tapes are used for the lexical level (root, pattern, and vocalization) and one tape for the surface level.",
        "In this paper, we propose a computational approach that applies a concatenative treatment to Arabic morphology generation by separating the issue of infixation from other inflectional variations.",
        "We are developing an Arabic morphological generator using MORPHE (Leavitt, 1994), a tool for modeling morphology based on discrimination trees and regular expressions.",
        "MORPHE is part of a suite of tools developed at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, for knowledge-based machine translation.",
        "Large systems for MT from English to Spanish, French, German, Portuguese and a prototype for Italian have already been developed.",
        "Within this framework, we are exploring English to Arabic translation and Arabic generation for pedagogical purposes.",
        "We generate Arabic words including short vowels and diacritic marks, since they are pedagogically useful and can always be stripped before display.",
        "Our approach seeks to reduce the number of rules for generating morphological variants of Arabic verbs by breaking the problem into two parts.",
        "We observe that, with the exception of a few verb types, there is very little interaction between stem changes and the processes of prefixation and suffixation.",
        "It is therefore possible to decouple, in large part, the problem of stem changes from that of prefixes and suffixes.",
        "The gain is a significant reduction in the size number of transformational rules, as much as a factor of three for certain verb classes.",
        "This improves the space efficiency of the system and its maintainability by reducing duplication of rules, and simplifies the rules by isolating different types of changes.",
        "To illustrate our approach, we focus on a particular type of verbs, termed hollow verbs, and show how we integrate their treatment with that of more regular verbs.",
        "We also discuss how the approach can be extended to other classes of verbs and other parts of speech."
