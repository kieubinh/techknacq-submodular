        "In the Japanese language, since word order in a sentence is relatively free compared with European languages, dependency analysis has been shown to be practical and effective in both rule-based and stochastic approaches to syntactic analysis.",
        "In dependency analysis of a Japanese sentence, among various source of ambiguities in a sentence, dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses are one of the most problematic ones, partly because word order in a sentence is relatively free.",
        "In general, dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses cause scope ambiguities of subordinate clauses, which result in enormous number of syntactic ambiguities of other types of phrases such as noun phrases.1 1 In our preliminary corpus analysis using the stochastic dependency analyzer of Fujio and Matsumoto (1998), about 30% of the 210,000 sentences in EDR bracketed corpus (EDR, 1995) have dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses, for which the precision of chunk (bun-setsu) level dependencies is about 85.3% and that of sentence level is about 25.4% (for best one) – 35.8% (for best five), while for the rest 70% of EDR bracketed corpus, the precision of chunk (bunsetsu) level dependencies is about 86.7% and that of sentence level is about 47.5% (for best one) 60.2% (for best five).",
        "In addition to that, when assuming that those ambiguities of subordinate clause dependencies are initially resolved in some way, the chunk level precision increases to 90.4%, and the sentence level precision to 40.6% (for best one) 67.7% (for best five).",
        "This result of our preliminary analysis In the Japanese linguistics, a theory of Mi-nami (1974) regarding scope embedding preference of subordinate clauses is well-known.",
        "Minami (1974) classifies Japanese subordinate clauses according to the breadths of their scopes and claim that subordinate clauses which inherently have narrower scopes are embedded within the scopes of subordinate clauses which inherently have broader scopes (details are in section 2).",
        "By manually analyzing several raw corpora, Minami (1974) classifies various types of Japanese subordinate clauses into three categories, which are totally ordered by the embedding relation of their scopes.",
        "In the Japanese computational linguistics community, Shirai et al.",
        "(1995) employed Minami (1974)'s theory on scope embedding preference of Japanese subordinate clauses and applied it to rule-based Japanese dependency analysis.",
        "However, in their approach, since categories of subordinate clauses are obtained by manually analyzing a small number of sentences, their coverage against a large corpus such as EDR bracketed corpus (EDR, 1995) is quite low.2 In order to realize a broad coverage and high performance dependency analysis of Japanese sentences which exploits scope embedding preference of subordinate clauses, we propose a corpus-based and statistical alternative to the rule-based manual approach (section 3).3 clearly shows that dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses are among the most problematic source of syntactic ambiguities in a Japanese sentence.",
        "First, we formalize the problem of deciding scope embedding preference as a classification problem, in which various types of linguistic information of each subordinate clause are encoded as features and used for deciding which one of given two subordinate clauses has a broader scope than the other.",
        "As in the case of Shirai et al.",
        "(1995), we formalize the problem of deciding dependency preference of subordinate clauses by utilizing the correlation of scope embedding preference and dependency preference of Japanese subordinate clauses.",
        "Then, as a statistical learning method, we employ the decision list learning method of Yarowsky (1994), where optimal combination of those features are selected and sorted in the form of decision rules, according to the strength of correlation between those features and the dependency preference of the two subordinate clauses.",
        "We evaluate the proposed method through the experiment on learning dependency preference of Japanese subordinate clauses from the EDR bracketed corpus (section 4).",
        "We show that the proposed method outperforms other related methods/models.",
        "We also evaluate the estimated dependencies of subordinate clauses in Fujio and Matsumoto (1998)'s framework of the statistical dependency analysis of a whole sentence, in which we successfully increase the precisions of both chunk level and sentence level dependencies thanks to the estimated dependencies of sub ordinate clauses."
