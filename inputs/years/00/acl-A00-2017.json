        "The task of predicting the most likely word based on properties of its surrounding context is the archetypical prediction problem in natural language processing (NLP).",

        "Examples include part-of speech tagging, word-sense disambiguation, speech recognition, accent restoration, word choice selection in machine translation, context-sensitive spelling correction and identifying discourse markers.",
        "Most approaches to these problems are based on n-gram-like modeling.",
        "Namely, the learning methods make use of features which are conjunctions of typically (up to) three consecutive words or POS tags in order to derive the predictor.",
        "In this paper we show that incorporating additional information into the learning process is very",
        "beneficial.",
        "In particular, we provide the learner with a rich set of features that combine the information available in the local context along with shallow parsing information.",

      "text": [
        "The most influential problem in motivating statistical learning application in NLP tasks is that of word selection in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998).",
        "There, word classifiers are derived from a probabilistic language model which estimates the probability of a sentence s using Bayes rule as the product of conditional probabilities,",
        "where hi is the relevant history when predicting w2.",
        "Thus, in order to predict the most likely word in a given context, a global estimation of the sentence probability is derived which, in turn, is computed by estimating the probability of each word given its local context or history.",
        "Estimating terms of the form Pr (w1h) is done by assuming some generative probabilistic model, typically using Markov or other independence assumptions, which gives rise to estimating conditional probabilities of n-grams type features (in the word or POS space).",
        "Machine learning based classifiers and maximum entropy models which, in principle, are not restricted to features of these forms have used them nevertheless, perhaps under the influence of probabilistic methods (Brill, 1995; Yarowsky, 1994; Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994).",
        "It has been argued that the information available in the local context of each word should be augmented by global sentence information and even information external to the sentence in order to learn",
        "better classifiers and language models.",
        "Efforts in this directions consists of (1) directly adding syntactic information, as in (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996), and (2) indirectly adding syntactic and semantic information, via similarity models; in this case n-gram type features are used whenever possible, and when they cannot be used (due to data sparsity), additional information compiled into a similarity measure is used (Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "Nevertheless, the efforts in this direction so far have shown very insignificant improvements, if any (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "We believe that the main reason for that is that incorporating information sources in NLP needs to be coupled with a learning approach that is suitable for it.",
        "Studies have shown that both machine learning and probabilistic learning methods used in NLP make decisions using a linear decision surface over the feature space (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999).",
        "In this view, the feature space consists of simple functions (e.g., n-grams) over the the original data so as to allow for expressive enough representations using a simple functional form (e.g., a linear function).",
        "This implies that the number of potential features that the learning stage needs to consider may be very large, and may grow rapidly when increasing the ex-pressivity of the features.",
        "Therefore a feasible computational approach needs to be feature-efficient.",
        "It needs to tolerate a large number of potential features in the sense that the number of examples required for it to converge should depend mostly on the number features relevant to the decision, rather than on the number of potential features.",
        "This paper addresses the two issues mentioned above.",
        "It presents a rich set of features that is constructed using information readily available in the sentence along with shallow parsing and dependency information.",
        "It then presents a learning approach that can use this expressive (and potentially large) intermediate representation and shows that it yields a significant improvement in word error rate for the task of word prediction.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we formalize the problem, discuss the information sources available to the learning system and how we use those to construct features.",
        "In section 3 we present the learning approach, based on the SNoW learning architecture.",

        "Let C be the set of all target words.",

        "This process, which we call the focus of attention (FOA) would be beneficial only if we can guarantee that, with high probability,",

        "The effect of the confusion set size on training is minimal (although it does affect training time).",
        "We note that for the naive Bayes algorithm the notion of negative examples does not exist, and therefore regardless of the size of confusion set in training, it learns exactly the same representations.",
        "Thus, in the NB column, the confusion set size in training makes no difference.",
        "The application in which a word predictor is used might give a partial solution to the FOA problem.",
        "For example, given a prediction task in the context of speech recognition the phonemes that constitute the word might be known and thus suggest a way to generate a small confusion set to be used when evaluating the predictors.",
        "Tables 4,5 present the results of using artificially simulated speech recognizer using a method of general phonetic classes.",
        "That is, instead of transcribing a word by the phoneme, the word is transcribed by the phoneme classes(Jurafsky and Martin, 200).",
        "Specifically, these experiments deviate from the task definition given above.",
        "The confusion sets used are of different sizes and they consist of verbs with different prior probabilities in the corpus.",
        "Two sets of experiments were conducted that use the phonetic transcription of the words to generate confusion sets.",
        "In the first experiment (Table 4), the transcription of each word is given by the broad phonetic groups to which the phonemes belong i.e., nasals, fricative, etc.4.",
        "For example, the word \"b_u_y\" is transcribed using phonemes as \"b_Y\" and here we transcribe it as \"P_V1\" which stands for \"Plosive_Vowell\".",
        "This partition results in a partition of the set of verbs into several confusions sets.",
        "A few of these confusion sets consist of a single word and therefore have 100% baseline, which explains the high baseline.",
        "Error Rate for Training and testing with confusion sets determined based on phonetic classes (PC) from a simulated speech recognizer.",
        "In this case only confusion sets that have less than 98% baseline are used, which explains the overall lower baseline.",
        "Table 5 presents the results of a similar experiment in which only confusion sets with multiple words were used, resulting in a lower baseline.",
        "As before, Train All means that training is done with all 278 targets together while Train PC means that the PC confusion sets were used also in training.",
        "We note that for the case of SNoW, used here with the sparse Winnow algorithm, that size of the confusion set in training has some, although small, effect.",
        "The reason is that when the training is done with all the target words, each target word representation with all the examples in which it does not occur are used as negative examples.",
        "When a smaller confusion set is used the negative examples are more likely to be \"true\" negative."

        "Given a prediction task (a sentence with a missing word) the word representations are evaluated on it and compete for the most likely word to complete the sentence.",
        "We have described a language that allows one to define expressive feature types and have exhibited experimentally the advantage of using those on word prediction task.",
        "We have argued that the success of this approach hinges on the combination of using a large set of expressive features along with a learning approach that can tolerate it and converges quickly despite the large dimensionality of the data.",
        "We believe that this approach would be useful for other disambiguation tasks in NLP.",
        "We have also presented a preliminary study of a reduction in the confusion set size and its effects on the prediction performance.",
