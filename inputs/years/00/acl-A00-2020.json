        "In order to ensure accuracy in a corpus, typically several experts pass over the corpus to ensure consistency.",
        "For large corpora this can be a tremendous expense.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for automatically detecting errors in a marked corpus using an anomaly detection technique.",
        "This technique detects anomalies or elements which do not fit in with the rest of the corpus.",
        "When applied to marked corpora, the anomalies tend to be errors in the markings of the corpus.",
        "To detect the anomalies, we first compute a probability distribution over the entire corpus.",
        "Then we apply a statistical test which identifies which elements are anomalies.",
        "In this case the anomalies are the elements with very low likelihood.",
        "These elements are marked as errors and are thrown out of the corpus.",
        "The model is recomputed on the remaining elements.",
        "At conclusion, we are left with two data sets: one the normal elements and the second the detected anomalous elements.",
        "We evaluate this method over the part of speech tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "In one experiment, our method detected 1000 anomalies within a data set of 1.25 million tagged elements.",
        "Human judges evaluated the results of the application of this method and verified that 69% of identified anomalies are in fact tagging errors.",
        "In another experiment, our method detected 4000 anomalies of which 44% are tagging errors."
