        "Yet there are still many research challenges: current systems are limited in the interaction they support and brittle in many respects.",
        "We show how spoken dialogue systems can learn to support more natural interaction on the basis of their previous experience.",
        "One way that current spoken dialogue systems are quite limited is in their strategies for detecting and repairing problems that arise in conversation.",

        "We can train systems to improve their ability to detect problems by exploiting dialogues collected in interactions with human users.",
        "The initial segments of these dialogues can be used to predict that a problem is likely to occur.",

        "Our experiments apply the machine learning program RIPPER (Cohen, 1996) to automatically induce a \"problematic dialogue\" classification model.",
        "RIPPER takes as input the names of a set of classes to be learned, the names and ranges of values of a fixed set of features, and training data specifying the class and feature values for each example in a training set.",
        "Its output is a classification model for predicting the class of future examples.",
        "In RIPPER, the classification model is learned using greedy search guided by an information gain metric, and is expressed as an ordered set of if-then rules.",
        "To apply RIPPER, the dialogues in the corpus must be encoded in terms of a set of classes (the output classification) and a set of input features that are used as predictors for the classes.",
        "We start with the dialogue categories described above, but since our goal is to develop algorithms that predict/identify problematic dialogues, we treat HANGUP, WIZARD and TASKFAILURE as equivalently problematic.",
        "Thus we train the classifier to distinguish between two classes: TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEMATIC.",
        "Note that our categorization is inherently noisy because we do not know the real reasons why a caller hangs up or a wizard takes over the call.",
        "The caller may hang up because she is frustrated with the system, or she may simply dislike automation, or her child may have started crying.",
        "Similarly, one wizard may have low confidence in the system's ability to recover from errors and use a conservative approach that results in taking over many calls, while another wizard may be more willing to let the system try to recover.",
        "Nevertheless we take these human actions as a human labelling of these calls as problematic.",
        "Given this classification, approximately 36% of the calls in the corpus of 4774 dialogues are PROBLEMATIC and 64% are TASKSUCCESS.",
        "Next, we encoded each dialogue in terms of a set of 196 features that were either automatically logged by one of the system modules, hand-labelled by humans, or derived from raw features.",

        "We encode features for the first four exchanges because we want to predict failures before they happen.",
        "Since 97% of the dialogues in our corpus are five exchanges or less, in most cases, any potential problematic outcome will have occurred by the time the system has participated in five exchanges.",
        "Because the system needs to be able to predict whether the dialogue will be problematic using information it has available in the initial part of the dialogue, we train classifiers that only have access to input features from exchange 1, or only the features from exchange 1 and exchange 2.",

        "We compare results for predicting problematic dia",
        "logues, with results for identifying problematic dialogues, when the classifier has access to features representing the whole dialogue.",
        "We utilized features logged by the system because they are produced automatically, and thus could be used during runtime to alter the course of the dialogue.",
        "The system modules that we collected information from were the acoustic processer/automatic speech recognizer (ASR) (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear), the natural language understanding (NLU) module (Gorin et al., 1997), and the dialogue manager (DM) (Abella and Gorin, 1999).",
        "Below we describe each module and the features obtained from it.",
        "ASR takes as input the acoustic signal and outputs a potentially errorful transcription of what it believes the caller said.",
        "The ASR features for each of the first four exchanges were the output of the speech recognizer (recog), the number of words in the recognizer output (recog-numwords), the duration in seconds of the input to the recognizer (asr-duration), a flag for touchtone input (dtmf-flag), the input modality expected by the recognizer (rg-modality) (one of: none, speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, touchtone-card, speech+touchtone-card, touchtone-date, speech+touchtone-date, or none-final-prompt), and the grammar used by the recognizer (rg-grammar).",
        "The motivation for the ASR features is that any one of them may have impacted performance.",
        "For example, it is well known that longer utterances are less likely to be recognized correctly, thus asr-duration could be a clue to incorrect recognition results.",
        "In addition, the larger the grammar is, the more likely an ASR error is, so the name of the grammar rg-grammar could be a predictor of incorrect recognition.",
        "The natural language understanding (NLU) module takes as input a transcription of the user's utterance from ASR and produces 15 confidence scores representing the likelihood that the caller's task is one of the 15 task types.",
        "It also extracts other relevant information, such as phone or credit card numbers.",
        "Thus 15 of the NLU features for each exchange represent the 15 confidence scores.",
        "There are also features that the NLU module calculates based on processing the utterance.",
        "These include an intra-utterance measure of the inconsistency between tasks that the user appears to be requesting (inconsistency), a measure of the coverage of the utterance by salient grammar fragments (salience-coverage), a measure of the shift in context between utterances (context-shift), the task with the highest confidence score (top-task), the task with the second highest confidence score (nexttop-task), the value of the highest confidence score (top-confidence), and the difference in values between the top and next-to-top confidence scores (duff-confidence).",
        "The motivation for these NLU features is to make use of information that the NLU module has based on processing the output of ASR and the current discourse context.",
        "For example, for utterances that follow the first utterance, the NLU module knows what task it believes the caller is trying to complete.",
        "If it appears that the caller has changed her mind, then the NLU module may have misunderstood a previous utterance.",
        "The context-shift feature indicates the NLU module's belief that it may have made an error (or be making one now).",
        "The dialogue manager (DM) takes the output of NLU and the dialogue history and decides what it should say to the caller next.",
        "It decides whether it believes there is a single unambiguous task that the user is trying to accomplish, and how to resolve any ambiguity.",
        "The DM features for each of the first four exchanges are the task-type label which includes a label that indicates task ambiguity (sys-label), utterance id within the dialogue (implicit in the encoding), the name of the prompt played before the user utterance (prompt), and whether that prompt was a reprompt (reprompt), a confirmation (confirm), or a subdialogue prompt (subdial), a superset of the reprompts and confirmation prompts.",
        "The DM features are primarily motivated by previous work.",
        "The task-type label feature is to capture the fact that some tasks may be harder than others.",
        "The utterance id feature is motivated by the idea that the length of the dialogue may be important, possibly in combination with other features like task-type.",
        "The different prompt features for initial prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and subdialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frustrating for callers and that callers are likely to hyperarticulate when they have to repeat themselves, which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al., 1992; Levow, 1998).",
        "The DM features also include running tallies for the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number of confirmation prompts (num-confirms), and number of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had been played up to each point in the dialogue, as well as running percentages (percent-reprompts, percent.",
        "confirms, percent-subdials).",
        "The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999).",
        "The features obtained via hand-labelling were human transcripts of each user utterance (tscript), a set of semantic labels that are closely related to the system task-type labels (human-label), age (age) and gender (gender) of the user, the actual modality of the user utterance (user-modality) (one of: nothing, speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, non-speech),",
        "and a cleaned transcript with non-word noise information removed (clean-tscript).",
        "From these features we calculated two derived features.",
        "The first was the number of words in the cleaned transcript (cltscript numwords), again on the assumption that utterance length is strongly correlated with ASR and NLU errors.",
        "The second derived feature was based on calculating whether the human-label matches the sys-label from the dialogue manager (rsuccess).",
        "There were four values for rsuccess: rcorrect, rmismatch, rpartial-match and rvacuous-match, indicating respectively correct understanding, incorrect understanding, partial understanding, and the fact that there had been no input for ASR and NLU to operate on, either because the user didn't say anything or because she used touch-tone.",
        "The whole-dialogue features derived from the per-utterance features were: num-utts, num-reprompts, percent-reprompts, num-confirms, percent-confirms, num-subdials, and per-cent-subdials for the whole dialogue, and the duration of the entire dialogue in seconds (dial-duration).",
        "In the experiments, the features in Figure 5 except the Hand-Labelled features are referred to as the AUTOMATIC feature set.",
        "We examine how well we can identify or predict problematic dialogues using these features, compared to the full feature set including the Hand-Labelled features.",
        "As mentioned earlier, we wish to generalize our problematic dialogue predictor to other systems.",
        "Thus we also discuss how well we can predict problematic dialogues using only features that are both automatically acquirable during runtime and independent of the HMIHY task.",
        "The subset of features from Figure 5 that fit this qualification are in Figure 6.",
        "We refer to them as the AUTO, TASK-INDEP feature set.",
        "The output of each RIPPER experiment is a classification model learned from the training data.",
        "To evaluate these results, the error rates of the learned classification models are estimated using the resam-pling method of cross-validation.",
        "In 5-fold cross-validation, the total set of examples is randomly divided into 5 disjoint test sets, and 5 runs of the learning program are performed.",
        "Thus, each run uses the examples not in the test set for training and the remaining examples for testing.",
        "An estimated error rate is obtained by averaging the error rate on the testing portion of the data from each of the 5 runs.",
        "Since we intend to integrate the rules learned by RIPPER into the HMIHY system, we examine the precision and recall performance of specific hypotheses.",
        "Because hypotheses from different cross-validation experiments cannot readily be combined together, we apply the hypothesis learned on one randomly selected training set (80% of the data) to that set's respective test data.",

        "These features seem to provide good general indicators of the system's success in recognition and understanding.",
        "The fact that the main focus of the rules is detecting ASR and NLU errors and that none of the DM behaviors are used as predictors also indicates that, in all likelihood, the DM is performing as well as it can, given the noisy input that it is getting from ASR and NLU.",
        "To identify potential improvements in the problematic dialogue predictor, we analyzed which hand-labelled features made large performance improvements, under the assumption that future work can focus on developing automatic features that approximate the information provided by these hand-labelled features.",
        "The analysis indicated that the rsuccess feature alone improves the performance of the TOPLINE from 88.5%, as reported in (Langkilde et al., 1999), to 92.3%.",
        "Using rsuccess as the only feature results in 73.75% accuracy for exchange 1, 81.9% accuracy for exchanges 1&2 and 85.3% accuracy for the full dialogue.",
        "In addition, for Exchanges 1&2, the accuracy of the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set plus the rsuccess feature is 86.5%, which is only 0.2% less than the accuracy of ALL the features for Exchanges 1&2 as shown in Table 1.",
        "The rules that RIPPER learns for Exchanges 1&2 when the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set is augmented with the single hand-labelled rsuccess feature is shown below.",
        "Note that the rsuccess feature is frequently used in the rules and that RIPPER learns rules that combine the rsuccess feature with other features, such as the confidence, asr-duration, and salience-coverage features."

        "In summary, our results show that: (1) All feature sets significantly improve over the baseline; (2) Using automatic features from the whole dialogue, we can identify problematic dialogues 23% better than the baseline; (3) Just the first exchange provides sig",
        "nificantly better prediction (8%) than the baseline; (4) The second exchange provides an additional significant (7%) improvement, (5) A classifier based on task-independent automatic features performs with less than 1% degradation in error rate relative to the automatic features.",
        "Even with current accuracy rates, the improved ability to predict problematic dialogues means that it may be possible to field the system without human agent oversight, and we expect to be able to improve these results.",
        "The research reported here is the first that we know of to automatically analyze a corpus of logs from a spoken dialogue system for the purpose of learning to predict problematic situations.",
        "Our work builds on earlier research on learning to identify dialogues in which the user experienced poor speech recognizer performance (Litman et al., 1999).",
        "However, that work was based on a much smaller set of experimental dialogues where the notion of a good or bad dialogue was automatically approximated rather than being labelled by humans.",
        "In addition, because that work was based on features synthesized over the entire dialogues, the hypotheses that were learned could not be used for prediction during runtime.",
        "We are exploring several ways to improve the performance of and test the problematic dialogue predictor.",
        "First, we noted above the extent to which the hand-labelled feature rsuccess improves classifier performance.",
        "In other work we report results from training an rsuccess classifier on a per-utterance level (Walker et al., 2000), where we show that we can achieve 85% accuracy using only fully automatic features.",
        "In future work we intend to use the (noisy) output from this classifier as input to our problematic dialogue classifier with the hope of improving the performance of the fully automatic feature sets.",
        "In addition, since it is more important to minimize errors in predicting PROBLEMATIC dialogues than errors in predicting TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we intend to experiment with RIPPER's loss ratio parameter, which instructs RIPPER to achieve high accuracy for the PROBLEMATIC class, while potentially reducing overall accuracy.",
        "Finally, we plan to integrate the learned rulesets into the HMIHY dialogue system to improve the system's overall performance."
