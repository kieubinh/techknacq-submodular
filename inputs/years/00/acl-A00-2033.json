        "A long-standing issue regarding algorithms that manipulate context-free grammars (CFGs) in a \"topdown\" left-to-right fashion is that left recursion can lead to nontermination.",
        "This is most familiar in the case of top-down recursive-descent parsing (Aho et al., 1986, pp.",
        "181-182).",
        "A more recent motivation is that off-the-shelf speech recognition systems are now available (e.g., from Nuance Communications and Microsoft) that accept CFGs as language models for constraining recognition; but as these recognizers process CFGs top-down, they also require that the CFGs used be non-left-recursive.",
        "The source of the problem can be seen by considering a directly left-recursive grammar production such as A 4 Aa.",
        "Suppose we are trying to parse, or recognize using a speech recognizer, an A at a given position in the input.",
        "If we apply this production top-down and left-to-right, our first subgoal will be to parse or recognize an A at the same input position.",
        "This immediately puts us into an infinite recursion.",
        "The same thing will happen with an indirectly left-recursive grammar, via a chain of subgoals that will lead us from the goal of parsing or recognizing an A at a given position to a descendant subgoal of parsing or recognizing an A at that position.",
        "In theory, the restriction to non-left-recursive CFGs puts no additional constraints on the languages that can be described, because any CFG can in principle be transformed into an equivalent non-left-recursive CFG.",
        "However, the standard algorithm for carrying out this transformation (Aho et al., 1986, pp.",
        "176-178) (Hoperoft and Ullman, 1979, p. 96) – attributed to M. C. Paull by Hoperoft and Ullman (1979, p. 106) – can produce transformed grammars that are orders of magnitude larger than the original grammars.",
        "In this paper we develop a number of improvements to Paull's algorithm, which help somewhat but do not completely solve the problem.",
        "We then go on to develop an alternative approach based on the left-corner grammar transform, which makes it possible to remove left recursion with no significant increase in size for several grammars for which Paull's original algorithm is impractical.",
        "2 Notation and Terminology Grammar nonterminals will be designated by \"low order\" upper-case letters (A, B, etc.",
        "); and terminals will be designated by lower-case letters.",
        "We will use \"high order\" upper-case letters (X, Y, Z) to denote single symbols that could be either terminals or nonterminals, and Greek letters to denote (possibly empty) sequences of terminals and/or nonterminals.",
        "Any production of the form A –* a will be said to be an A-production, and a will be said to be an expansion of A.",
        "We will say that a symbol X is a direct left corner of a nonterminal A, if there is an A-production with X as the leftmost symbol on the right-hand side.",
        "We define the left-corner relation to be the reflexive transitive closure of the direct-left-corner relation, and we define the proper-left-corner relation to be the transitive closure of the direct-left-corner relation.",
        "A nonterminal is left recursive if it is a proper left corner of itself; a nonterminal is directly left recursive if it is a direct left corner of itself; and a nonterminal is indirectly left recursive if it is left recursive, but not directly left recursive."

        "Some statistics on the test grammars are contained in Table 1.",
        "The criterion we use to judge effectiveness of the algorithms under test is the size of the resulting grammar, measured in terms of the total number of terminal and nonterminal symbols needed to express the productions of the grammar.",
        "We use a slightly nonstandard metric, counting the symbols as if, for each nonterminal, there were a single production of the form A ai I • • • I an• This reflects the size of files and data structures typically used to store grammars for top-down processing more accurately than counting a separate occurrence of the left-hand side for each distinct right-hand side.",
        "It should be noted that the CT grammar has a very special property: none of the 535 left recursive nonterminals is indirectly left recursive.",
        "The grammar was designed to have this property specifically because Paull's algorithm does not handle indirect left recursion well.",

        "This algorithm is perhaps more familiar to some as the first phase of the textbook algorithm for transfomrming CFGs to Greibach normal form (Greibach, 1965).3 The subprocedure to eliminate direct left recursion performs the following transformation (Hoperoft and Ullman, 1979, p. 96): Let A 4 Aai I ...",

        "This transformation is embedded in the full algorithm (Aho et al., 1986, p. 177), displayed in Figure 1.",
        "The idea of the algorithm is to eliminate left recursion by transforming the grammar so that all the direct left corners of each nonterminal strictly follow that nonterminal in a fixed total ordering, in which case, no nonterminal can be left recursive.",
        "This is accomplished by iteratively replacing direct left corners that precede a given nonterminal with all their expansions in terms of other nonterminals that are greater in the ordering, until the nonterminal has only itself and greater nonterminals as direct left",

        "end end end transform the Ai-productions to eliminate direct left recursion end",
        "corners.",
        "Any direct left recursion for that nonterminal is then eliminated by the first transformation discussed.",
        "The difficulty with this approach is that the iterated substitutions can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the grammar.",
        "Consider the grammar consisting of the productions A1 0 I 1, plus A,+1 A,0 Ail for 1 < i < n. It is easy to see that Paull's algorithm will transform the grammar so that it consists of all possible Ai-productions with a binary sequence of length i on the right-hand side, for 1 < i < 71, which is exponentially larger than the original grammar.",
        "Notice that the efficiency of Paull's algorithm crucially depends on the ordering of the nonterminals.",
        "If the ordering is reversed in the grammar of this example, Paull's algorithm will make no changes, since the grammar will already satisfy the condition that all the direct left corners of each nonterminal strictly follow that nonterminal in the revised ordering.",
        "The textbook discussions of Paull's algorithm, however, are silent on this issue.",
        "In the inner loop of Paull's algorithm, for nonterminals A, and Ai, such that i > j and A3 is a direct left corner of we replace all occurrences of A3 as a direct left corner of Ai with all possible expansions of Ai.",
        "This only contributes to elimination of left recursion from the grammar if A, is a left-recursive nonterminal, and A3 lies on a path that makes A, left recursive; that is, if Ai is a left corner of A3 (in addition to A3 being a left corner of Ai).",
        "We could eliminate replacements that are useless in removing left recursion if we could order the nonterminals of the grammar so that, if i > j and Ai is a direct left corner of Ai, then A, is also a left corner of A3.",
        "We can achieve this by ordering the nonterminals in decreasing order of the number of distinct left corners they have.",
        "Since the left-corner relation is transitive, if C is a direct left corner of B, every left corner of C is also a left corner of B.",
        "In addition, since we defined the left-corner relation to be reflexive, B is a left corner of itself.",
        "Hence, if C is a direct left corner of B, it must follow B in decreasing order of number of distinct left corners, unless B is a left corner of C. Table 2 shows the effect on Paull's algorithm of ordering the nonterminals according to decreasing number of distinct left corners, with respect to the toy grammar.4 In the table, \"best\" means an ordering consistent with this constraint.",
        "Note that if a grammar has indirect left recursion, there will be multiple orderings consistent with our constraint, since indirect left recursion creates cycles in the the left-corner relation, so every nonterminal in one of these cycles will have the same set of left corners.",
        "Our \"best\" ordering is simply an arbitrarily chosen",
        "ordering respecting the constraint; we are unaware of any method for finding a unique best ordering, other than trying all the orderings respecting the constraint.",
        "As a neutral comparison, we also ran the algorithm with the nonterminals ordered lexicographically.",
        "Finally, to test how bad the algorithm could be with a really poor choice of nonterminal ordering, we defined a \"worst\" ordering to be one with increasing numbers of distinct left corners.",
        "It should be noted that with either the lexicographical or worst ordering, on all of our three large grammars Paull's algorithm exceeded a cut-off of 5,000,000 grammar symbols, which we chose as being well beyond what might be considered a tolerable increase in the size of the grammar.",
        "Let PA refer to Paull's algorithm with the nonterminals ordered according to decreasing number of distinct left corners.",
        "The second line of Table 3 shows the results of running PA on our three large grammars.",
        "The CT grammar increases only modestly in size, because as previously noted, it has no indirect left recursion.",
        "Thus the combinatorial phase of Paull's algorithm is never invoked, and the increase is solely due to the transformation applied to directly left-recursive productions.",
        "With the ATIS grammar and PT grammar, which do not have this special property, Paull's algorithm exceeded our cutoff, even with our best ordering of nonterminals.",
        "Some additional optimizations of Paull's aglo-rithm are possible.",
        "One way to reduce the number of substitutions made by the inner loop of the algorithm is to \"left factor\" the grammar (Aho et al., 1986, pp.",
        "178-179).",
        "The left-factoring transformation (LF) applies the following grammar rewrite schema repeatedly, until it is no longer applicable: LF: For each nonterminal A, let a be the longest nonempty sequence such that there is more than one grammar production of the form A – > af3.",

        "With left factoring, for each nonterminal A there will be only one A-production for each direct left corner of A, which will in general reduce the number of substitutions performed by the algorithm.",
        "The effect of left factoring by itself is shown in the third line of Table 3.",
        "Left factoring actually reduces the size of all three grammars, which may be unintuitive, since left factoring necessarily increases the number of productions in the grammar.",
        "However, the transformed productions are shorter, and the grammar size as measured by total number of symbols can be smaller because common left factors are represented only once.",
        "The result of applying PA to the left-factored grammars is shown in the fourth line of Table 3 (LF+PA).",
        "This produces a modest decrease in the size of the non-left-recursive form of the CT grammar, and brings the non-left-recursive form of the ATIS grammar under the cut-off size, but the non-left-recursive form of the PT grammar still exceeds the cut-off.",
        "The final optimization we have developed for Paull's algorithm is to transform the grammar to combine all the non-left-recursive possibilities for each left-recursive nonterminal under a new nonterminal symbol.",
        "This transformation, which we might call \"non-left-recursion grouping\" (NLRG), can be defined as follows: NLRG: For each left-recursive nonterminal A, let , an be all the expansions of A that do not have a left recursive nonterminal as the left most symbol.",
        "If n > 1, replace the set of productions A al, .",
        ", A an with the productions A-3 A', A' 4 al, , A' – > where A' is a new nonterminal symbol.",
        "Since all the new nonterminals introduced by this transformation will be non-left-recursive, Paull's algorithm with our best ordering will never substitute the expansions of any of these new nonterminals into the productions for any other nonterminal, which in general reduces the number of substitutions the algorithm makes.",
        "We did not empirically measure",
        "the effect on grammar size of applying the NLRG transformation by itself, but it is easy to see that it increases the grammar size by exactly two symbols for each left-recursive nonterminal to which it is applied.",
        "Thus an addition of twice the number of left-recursive nonterminals will be an upper bound on the increase in the size of the grammar, but since not every left-recursive nonterminal necessarily has more than one non-left-recursive expansion, the increase may be less than this.",
        "The fifth line of Table 3 (LF+NLRG+PA) shows the result of applying LF, followed by NLRG, followed by PA.",
        "This produces another modest decrease in the size of the non-left-recursive form of the CT grammar and reduces the size of the non-left-recursive form of the ATIS grammar by a factor of 27.8, compared to LF+PA.",

        "An alternate approach to eliminating left-recursion is based on the left-corner (LC) grammar transform of Rosenkrantz and Lewis (1970) as presented and modified by Johnson (1998).",

        "In Rosenkrantz and Lewis's original LC transform, schema 2 applied whenever B is a left corner of A, including all cases where B = A.",
        "In Johnson's version schema 2 applies when B = A only if A is a proper left corner of itself.",
        "Johnson then introduces schema 3 handle the residual cases, without introducing instances of nonterminals of the form AA that need to be allowed to derive the empty string.",
        "The original purpose of the LC transform is to allow simulation of left-corner parsing by top-down parsing, but it also eliminates left recursion from any noncyclic CFG.5 Furthermore, in the worst case, the total number of symbols in the transformed grammar cannot exceed a fixed multiple of the square of the number of symbols in the original grammar, in contrast to Paull's algorithm, which exponentiates the size of the grammar in the worst case.",
        "Thus, we can use Johnson's version of the LC transform directly to eliminate left-recursion.",
        "Before applying this idea, however, we have one general improvement to make in the transform.",
        "Johnson notes that in his version of the LC transform, a new nonterminal of the form A-X is useless unless X is a proper left corner of A.",
        "We further note that a new nonterminal of the form A-X, as well as the orginal nonterminal A, is useless in the transformed grammar, unless A is either the top nonterminal of the grammar or appears on the right-hand side of an original grammar production in other than the leftmost position.",
        "This can be shown by induction on the length of top-down derivations using the productions of the transformed grammar.",
        "Therefore, we will call the original nonterminals meeting this condition \"retained nonterminals\" and restrict the LC transform so that productions involving nonterminals of the form A-X are created only if A is a retained nonterminal.",
