        "Semantic interpretation has been an actively investigated issue on the research agenda of the logic-based paradigm of NLP in the late eighties (e.g., Charniak and Goldman (1988), Moore (1989), Pereira and Pollack (1991)).",
        "With the emergence of empirical methodologies in the early nineties, attention has almost completely shifted away from this topic.",
        "Since then, semantic issues have mainly been dealt with under a lexical perspective, viz. in terms of the resolution of lexico-semantic ambiguities (e.g., Schiitze (1998), Pedersen and Bruce (1998)) and the generation of lexical hierarchies from large text corpora (e.g., Li and Abe (1996), Hirakawa et al.",
        "(1996)) massively using statistical techniques.",
        "The research on semantic interpretation that was conducted in the pre-empiricist age of NLP was mainly driven by an interest in logical formalisms as carriers for appropriate semantic representations of NL utterances.",
        "With this representational bias, computational matters – how can semantic representation structures be properly derived from parse trees for a large variety of linguistic phenomena?",
        "became a secondary issue.",
        "In particular, this research lacked entirely quantitative data reflecting the accuracy of the proposed semantic interpretation mechanisms on real-world language data.",
        "One might be tempted to argue that recent evaluation efforts within the field of information extraction (IE) systems (Chinchor et al., 1993) are going to remedy this shortcoming.",
        "Given, however, the fixed number of knowledge templates and the restricted types of entities, locations, and events they encode as target information to be extracted, one readily realizes that such an evaluation framework provides, at best, a considerably biased, overly selective test environment for judging the understanding potential of text analysis systems which are not tuned for this special application.",
        "On the other hand, the IE experiments clearly indicate the need for a quantitative assessment of the interpretative performance of natural language understanding systems.",
        "We will focus on this challenge and propose such a general evaluation framework.",
        "We first outline the model of semantic interpretation underlying our approach and then focus on its empirical assessment for two basic syntactic structures of the German language, viz. genitives and auxiliary constructions, in two domains."

        "The problem of semantic interpretation can be described as the mapping from syntactic to semantic (or conceptual) representation structures.",
        "In our approach, the syntactic representation structures are given as dependency graphs (Hahn et al., 1994).",
        "Unlike constituency-based syntactic descriptions, dependency graphs consist of lexical nodes only, and these nodes are connected by vertices, each one of which is labeled by a particular dependency relation (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "For the purpose of semantic interpretation, dependency graphs can be decomposed into semantically interpretable subgraphs.1 Basically, two types of semantically interpretable subgraphs can be distinguished.",
        "The first one consists of lexical nodes which are labeled by content words only (lexical instances of verbs, nouns, adjectives or adverbs) and which are directly linked by a single dependency relation of any type whatsoever.",
        "Such a subgraph is illustrated in Figure 1 by Speicher - genatt - Computers.",
        "The second type of subgraph is also delimited by labels of content words but, in addition, a series of n 1... 4 intermediary lexical nodes may 'This notion and all subsequent criteria for interpretation are formally described in Romacker et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "appear between these content words, all of which are labeled by non-content words (such as auxiliary or modal verbs, prepositions).",
        "Hence, in contrast to direct linkage we speak here of indirect linkage between content words.",
        "Such a subgraph, with two intervening non-content words – the modal \"kann\" and the auxiliary \"werden\" – , is given in Figure 1 by Speicher – subject – kann – verbpart – werden – verbpart – erweitert.",
        "Another subgraph with just one intervening non-content word – the preposition \"mit\" – is illustrated by erweitert – ppadjunct – mit – pobject – SDRAM-Modulen.",
        "From these considerations follows that, e.g., the subgraph spanned by Speicher and SDRAM-Modulen does not form a semantically interpretable subgraph, since the content word erweitert intervenes on the linking path.",
        "Our approach to semantic interpretation subscribes to the principles of locality and composition-ality.",
        "It operates on discrete and well-defined units (subgraphs) of the parse tree, and the results of semantic interpretation are incrementally combined by fusing semantically interpretable subgraphs.",
        "As semantic target language we have chosen the framework of KL-ONE-type description logics (DL) (Woods and Schmolze, 1992).",
        "Since these logics are characterized by a settheoretical semantics we stay on solid formal ground.",
        "Furthermore, we take advantage of the powerful inference engine of DL systems, the description classifier, which turns out to be essential for embedded reasoning during the semantic interpretation process.",
        "By equating the semantic representation language with the conceptual one, we follow arguments discussed by Allen (1993).",
        "The basic idea for semantic interpretation is as follows: Each lexical surface form of a content word is associated with a set of concept identifiers representing its (different) lexical meanings.",
        "This way, lexical ambiguity is accounted for.",
        "These conceptual correlates are internal to the domain knowledge base, where they are described by a list of attributes or conceptual roles, and corresponding restrictions on permitted attribute values or role fillers are associated with them.",
        "As an example, consider the description for the concept COMPUTER-SYSTEM.",
        "It may be characterized by a set of roles, such as HAS-HARD-DISK or HAS-WORKING-MEMORY, with corresponding restrictions on the concept types of potential role fillers.",
        "HAS-WORKING-MEMORY, e.g., sanctions only fillers of the concept type MEMORY.",
        "These conceptual constraints are used for semantic filtering, i.e., for the elimination of syntactically admissible dependency graphs which, nevertheless, do not have a valid semantic interpretation.",
        "Semantic interpretation, in effect, boils down to finding appropriate conceptual relations in the domain knowledge that link the conceptual correlates of the two content words spanning the semantically interpretable subgraph, irrespective of whether a direct or an indirect linkage holds at the syntactic level.",
        "Accordingly, Figure 2 depicts the semantic/conceptual interpretation of the dependency structure given in Figure 1.",
        "Instances representing the concrete discourse entities and events in the sample sentence are visualized as solid rectangles containing a unique identifier (e.g., COMPUTER-SYSTEM.02).",
        "Labeled and directed edges indicate instance roles.",
        "Dashed rectangles characterize symbols used as makers for tense and modality.'",
        "Note that in Figure 2 each tuple of content words which configures a minimal subgraph in Figure 1 has already received an interpretation in terms of a relation linking the conceptual correlates.",
        "For example, Speicher genatt – Computers (cf.",
        "Figure 1, box 1) is mapped to COMPUTER-SYSTEM.02 HAS-WORKING-MEMORY MEMORY.01 (cf.",
        "Figure 2, box 1).",
        "However, the search for a valid conceptual relation is not only limited to a simple one-link slot-filler structure.",
        "We rather may determine conceptual relation paths between conceptual correlates of lexical items, the length of which may be greater than 1.",
        "(Thus, the need for role composition in the DL language becomes evident.)",
        "The directed search in the concept graph of the domain knowledge requires sophisticated structural and topological constraints to be manageable at all.",
        "These constraints are encapsulated in a special path finding and path evaluation algorithm specified in Markert and Hahn (1997).",
        "Besides these conceptual constraints holding in the domain knowledge, we further attempt to reduce the search space for finding relation paths by two kinds of syntactic criteria.",
        "First, the search may be constrained by the type of dependency relation holding between the content words of the currently considered semantically interpretable subgraph (direct linkage), or it may be constrained by the intervening lexical material, viz. the non-content words (indirect linkage).",
        "Each of these syntactic constraints has an immediate mapping to conceptual ones.",
        "For some dependency configurations, however, no syntactic constraints may apply.",
        "Such a case of unconstrained semantic interpretation (e.g., for genitive attributes directly linked by the genatt relation) leads to an exhaustive directed search in the knowledge base in order to find all conceptually compatible role fillings among the two concepts involved.",
        "Syntactic restrictions on semantic interpretation either come from lexeme classes or concrete lexemes.",
        "They are organized in terms of the lexeme class hierarchy superimposed on the fully lexicalized dependency grammar we use (Hahn et al., 1994).",
        "In the fragment depicted in Figure 3, the lexeme class of transitive verbs, VERBTRANS, requires that whenever a subject dependency relation is encountered, semantic interpretation is constrained to the conceptual roles AGENT or PATIENT and all their sub-relations (such as EXTENSION-PATIENT).",
        "All other conceptual roles are excluded from the subsequent semantic interpretation.",
        "Exploiting the property inheritance mechanisms provided by the hierarchic organization of the lexicalized dependency grammar, all concrete lexemes subsumed by the lexeme class VERBTRANS, like \"erweitern\" (extend), inherit the corresponding constraint.",
        "However, there are lexeme classes such as NOUN which do not render any constraints for dependency relations such as evidenced by genitive] attribute] (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "3).",
        "It may even happen that such restrictions can only be attached to concrete lexemes in order to avoid overgeneralization.",
        "Fortunately, we observed that this only happened to be the case for closed-class, i.e., non-content words.",
        "Accordingly, in Figure 3 the preposition \"with\" is characterized by the constraint that only the conceptual roles HAS-PART, INSTRUMENT, etc.",
        "must be taken into consideration for semantic interpretation.",
        "Since the constraints at the lexeme class or the lexeme level are hard-wired in the class hierarchy, we refer to the mapping of dependency relations (or idiosyncratic lexemes) to a set of conceptual relations (expanded to their transitive closure) as static interpretation.",
        "In contradistinction, the computation of relation paths for tuples of concepts during the sentence analysis process is called dynamic interpretation, since the latter process incorporates additional conceptual constraints on the fly.",
        "The above-mentioned conventions allow the specification of high-level semantic interpretation schemata covering a large variety of different syntactic constructions by a single schema.",
        "For instance, each syntactic construction for which no conceptual constraints apply (e.g., the interpretation of genitives, most adjectives, etc.)",
        "receives its semantic interpretation by instantiating the same interpretation schema (Romacker et al., 1999).",
        "The power of this approach comes from the fact that these high-level schemata are instantiated in the course of the parsing process by exploiting the dense specifications of the inheritance hierarchies both at the grammar level (the lexeme class hierarchy), as well as the conceptual level (the concept and role hierarchies).",
        "We currently supply up to ten semantic interpretation schemata for declaratives, relatives, and pas",
        "sives at the clause level, complement subcategorization via PPs, auxiliaries, all tenses at the VP level, pre and and postnominal modifiers at the NP level, and anaphoric expressions.",
        "We currently do not account for control verbs (work in progress), coordination and quantification."

        "Though similarities exist (viz. dealing with the performance of NLP systems in terms of their ability to generate semantic/conceptual structures), the semantic interpretation (SI) task has to be clearly distinguished from the information extraction (IE) task and its standard evaluation settings (Chinchor et a/., 1993).",
        "In the IE task, a small subset of the templates from the entire domain is selected into which information from the texts are mapped.",

        "Figure 3 for restrictions of this type).",
        "Second, one may investigate the appropriateness of the results from the search of the domain knowledge base, i.e., whether a relation between two concepts can be determined at all, and, if so, whether that relation (or role chain) is adequate.",
        "The conceptual constraints which come into play at this stage of processing are here referred to as dynamic constraint propagation, since they are to be computed on the fly, while judging the validity of the role chain in question.3 Third, interactions between the above-mentioned static constraints and dynamic constraint propagation may occur.",
        "This is the case for the interpretation of auxiliaries or prepositions, where intervening lexical material and associated constraints have to be accounted for simultaneously.",
        "In our evaluation study, we investigated the effects of category II and category III phenomena by considering genitives and modal as well as auxiliary verbs, respectively.",
        "The knowledge background is constituted by a domain ontology that is divided into an upper generic part (containing about 1,500 concepts and relations) and domain-specific extensions.",
        "We here report on the two specialized domains we deal with – a hardware-biased information technology (IT) domain model and an ontology covering parts of anatomical medicine (MED).",
        "Each of these two domain models adds roughly about 1,400 concepts and relations to the upper model.",
        "Corresponding lexeme entries in the lexicon provide linkages to the entire ontology.",
        "In order to avoid error chaining, we always assume a correct parse to be delivered for the semantic interpretation process.",
        "We took a random selection of 54 texts (comprising 18,500 words) from the two text corpora, viz.",
        "IT test reports and MEDical finding reports.",
        "For evaluation purposes (cf. Table 1), we concentrated on the interpretation of genitives (as an instance of direct linkage; GEN) and on the interpretation of periphrastic verbal complexes, i.e., passive, temporal and modal constructions (as instances of indirect linkage; MODAUX).",
        "The choice of these two grammatical patterns allows us to ignore the problems caused by syntactic ambiguity, since in our data no structural am-3Note that computations at the domain knowledge level which go beyond mere type checking are usually located outside the scope the semantic considerations.",
        "This is due to the fact that encyclopedic knowledge and its repercussions on the understanding process are typically not considered part of the semantic interpretation task proper.",

        "Even more so, when semantic and conceptual representations are collapsed.",

        "If one were to investigate the combined effects of syntactic ambiguity and semantic interpretation the evaluation scenario had to be changed.",
        "Methodologically, the first step were to explore the precision of a semantic interpretation task without structural ambiguities (as we do) and then, in the next step, incorporate the treatment of syntactic ambiguities (e.g., by semantic filtering devices, cf. Bonnema et al.",
        "(1997)).",
        "Several guidelines were defined for the evaluation procedure.",
        "A major issue dealt with the correctness of a semantic interpretation.",
        "In cases with interpretation, we considered a semantic interpretation to be a correct one, if the conceptual relation between the two concepts involved was considered adequate by introspection (otherwise, incorrect).",
        "This qualification is not as subjective as it may sound, since we applied really strict conditions adjusted to the fine-grained domain knowledge.4 Interpretations were considered to be correct in those cases which contained exactly one relation, as well as cases of semantical/conceptual ambiguities (up to three readings, the most), presumed the relation set contained the correct one.'",
        "A special case of incorrectness, called nil, occurred when no relation path could be determined though the two concepts under scrutiny were contained in the domain knowledge base and an interpretation should have been computed.",
        "We further categorized the cases where the system failed to produce an interpretation due to at least one concept specification missing (with respect to the two linked content words in a semantically interpretable subgraph).",
        "In all those cases without interpretation, insufficient coverage of the upper model was contrasted with that of the two domain models in focus, MED and IT, and with cases in which concepts referred to other domains, e.g., fashion or food.",

        "For instance, \"the infiltration of the stroma\" resulted in a correct reading - STROMA being the PATIENT Of the INFILTRATION event -, as well as in an incorrect one - being the AGENT of the INFILTRATION.",
        "Among the incorrect semantic interpretations we also categorized, e.g., the interpretation of the expression \"the prices of the manufacturers\" as a conceptual linkage from PRICE via PRICE-OF to PRODUCT via HAS-MANUFACTURER to MANUFACTURER (this type of role chaining can be considered an intriguing example of the embedded reasoning performed by the description logic inference engine), since it did not account for the interpretation that MANUFACTURERS fix PRICES as part of their marketing strategies.",

        "\"the surface of the storage medium\"), and abstract notions (e.g., \"the acceptance of IT technology\").",
        "Finally, we further distinguished evaluative expressions (e.g., \"the advantages of plasma display\") from figurative language, including idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"the heart of the notebook\").",
        "At first glance, the choice of genitives may appear somewhat trivial.",
        "From a syntactic point of view, genitives are directly linked and, indeed, constitute an easy case to deal with at the dependency level.",
        "From a conceptual perspective, however, they provide a real challenge.",
        "Since no static constraints are involved in the interpretation of genitives (cf.",
        "Figure 3, lexeme class NouN) and, hence, no prescriptions of (dis)allowed conceptual relations are made, an unconstrained search (apart from connectivity conditions imposed on the emerging role chains) of the domain knowledge base is started.",

        "First, interest in the deeper conceptual aspects of text interpretation has ceased in the past years, with almost all efforts devoted to robust and shallow syntactic processing of large data sets.",
        "This also results in a lack of sophisticated semantic and conceptual specifications, in particular, for larger text analysis systems.",
