        "Some of the most important works in I.E. have been dealing with domain dependent documents like (Moll et al., 1998; Hobbs et al., 1996).",

        "Assigning semantic field tags is in general a difficult task.",
        "This is due at least to the crucial need of the domain knowledge and also of the linguistic knowledge.",
        "Our approach considers that for some specific domains a semantic annotation can be achieved by a light parsing of the text which is based on the user of certain cue-words as a heuristic for describing its semantic structure."
