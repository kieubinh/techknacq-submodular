        "Judging from a small hand-checked section of the text, the error rate is fairly low; about one word in 40 contains an error.",
        "It should also be added that the version of the text with which I am working has already been subjected to some corrective measures after the initial data capture stage.",

        "The data entry specification for the project prescribes the use of <?> in all cases in which the keyboard operator has any doubt as to the identity of a printed character, and also when symbols appear in the text which cannot be represented in the Latin-1 codepage (except for Greek text, which is handled by other means).",
        "Other instances of the <7> tag were produced as indications of mistakes in OCR output.",
        "Some examples of the use of the error tag from the actual corpus include the following: The first is a case where <?> was used to mark an untypeable character.",

        "In the third row, <?> stands in for a single missing character, and in the fourth it does the same, but three times in a single word.",
        "Finally, in the last row the error tag indicates the omission of multiple characters, and even a word boundary.",
        "In fact, as Table 1 shows, words which include the error tag generally have error types which are more difficult to correct than average.",
        "Our confusion matrix-based approach is best at handling substitutions (e.g., onfin enfin), deletions (apellent appellent), and insertions (asselain –+ asselin), and cannot correct words with multiple errors at all.1 \"Unrecoverable\" errors are those in which no \"correction\" is possible, for example, when non-ASCII symbols occur in the original.",
        "The fact that the error tag is used to code such a wide variety of irregularities in the corpus makes it difficult to incorporate into our general error correction strategy.",
        "Since <7> so often occurred as a replacement for a single, missing character, however, I treated it as a character in the language model, but one with an extremely low probability, so that any suggested correction would have to get rid of it in order to appreciably increase the probability of the word.",
        "In short, <?> is included in the confusion matrix as a character which may occur as the result of interference from the noisy channel, but is highly unlikely to appear independently in the language.",
        "This approach ignores the many cases of multiple errors indicated by the error tag, but these probably pose too difficult a problem for this stage of the project anyhow.",
        "The funding available for the project does not currently allow us to pursue the possibility of computer-aided error correction; rather, the program must correct as many errors as it can without human intervention.",
        "Toward this end, we are willing to sacrifice the ability to cope with more 'Actually, it does have a mechanism for dealing with cases such as ab<?>ci<7><?>es, in which the error tag occurs multiple times, but stands for a single letter in each case.",

        "The actual performance of the spelling correction algorithm on words which include the error tag, while comparable to the performance on other words, is perhaps not as high as we might initially have hoped, given that they were already tagged as errors.",
        "Of the corrections suggested for words without <?>, 47% were accurate, while of the corrections suggested for words with <7>, 29% were accurate.2 Actually, if we include cases in which the program correctly identified an error as \"unrecoverable\" , and opted to make no change, the percentage for <?> suggestions rises to 71%.",
        "It may seem that these numbers in fact undermine the thesis that the error tagging in the Encyclopêclie was not useful in error correction.",
        "I.e., if the correction algorithm exhibits the correct behavior on 47% of untagged errors, and on 71% of tagged errors, it seems that the tags are helping out somewhat.",
        "Actually, this is not the case.",
        "First, we should not give the same weight to correct behavior on unrecoverable errors (which means giving up on correction) and correct behavior on other errors (which means actually finding the correct form).",
        "Second, the tagged errors are often simply 'worse' than untagged errors, so that even if the OCR or keyboard operator had made a guess at the correct form, they would have easily been identifiable as errors, and even errors of a certain type.",

        "For this reason, experience with the Encyclopedie project suggests that error tagging is not necessarily a great aid in performing automatic error correction.",
        "There is certainly a great deal of room for further investigation into the use of meta-data in spelling correction in general, however.",
        "While the error tag is a somewhat unique member of the tagset, in that it typically flags a subpart of a word, rather than a string of words, this should not be taken to mean that it is the only tag which could be employed in spelling correction.",
        "If nothing else, \"wider-scope\" markup tags can be helpful in determining when certain parts of the corpus should not be seen as representative of the language model, or should be seen as representative of a distinct language model.",

        "often marks Latin text in the Encyclopedie.)",
        "Ultimately, I believe that what is needed in order for text tagging to be useful in error correction is a recognition that the tagset will influence the correction process.",
        "Tags which are applied in such a way as to delimit sections of text which are relevant to correction (such as names, equations, and foreign language text), will be of greater use than tags which represent a mixture of such classes.",
        "Error tagging in particular should be most useful if it does not conflate quite distinct things that may be \"wrong\" with a text, such as illegibility of the original, unrenderable symbols, and OCR inaccuracies.",
        "Such considerations are certainly relevant in the evaluation of emerging text encoding standards, such as the specification of the Text Encoding Initiative."
