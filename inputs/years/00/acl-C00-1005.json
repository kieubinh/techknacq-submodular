        "A shared grammar also facilitates the difficult task of maintaining consistency within and across the individual parallel grammars.",
        "In machine translation, the specification of a shared grammar can furthermore be exploited for simplifying the transfer process.",
        "Without much ado, computational linguists engaged in multilingual grammar development have always tried to reduce their labour by importing existing grammar components in a simple \"copy-pastemodify\" fashion.",
        "But there were also a number of systematic attempts to create and describe shared grammars that are convincingly documented in publications.",
        "[Kam881 demonstrates the concept for a relatively restricted domain, the grammatical description of simple nominal expressions in five languages.",
        "[B0P881 were able to exploit the grammatical overlap of two Slavic languages, for the design of a lean transfer process in Russian to Czech machine translation.",
        "In multilingual application development within Microsoft research, grammar sharing has extensively been exploited – [Pin961, [GLPR971.",
        "However, all these approaches are rather opportunistic in the sense that existing grammatical descriptions based on existing grammar models were explored.",
        "We went a step further and started grammar design with a notion of a shared grammar for a family of related languages.",
        "Pursuing the goal of designing linguistically motivated grammatical",
        "resources for Slavic languages to be used in computational linguistics, one is inevitably confronted with primary problems stemming from the fact that different linguistic theories cut up grammars in quite different ways, and grammar formalisms differ in their degree of granularity.",
        "It cannot be expected, therefore, that the minimal differences between two languages or their shared elements form easily identifiable units in the available language-specific grammars.",
        "Therefore, an ontology conceptualising morphosyntactic \"building blocks\" would offer a solid basis for a shared grammar of Slavic in the sense of [ASU991.",
        "Our use of the term ontology is fairly pragmatic, namely, as representing a formal shared conceptualisation of a particular domain of interest.",
        "It describes concepts relevant for the domain, their relationships, as well as \"axioms\" about these concepts and relationships.",
        "Note that such a pragmatic approach does not presuppose any general all-encompassing ontology of language but rather \"mini-ontologies\" conceptualising the selected domain from various perspectives in a consistent way.",
        "The domain of interest in this project is the grammatical knowledge on Slavic morphosyn-tax contained in linguistic theories and linguistic descriptions.",

        "The former indicate possible conjunction of types, and thus introduce various dimensions of multiple inheritance.",
        "The latter indicate disjunction of types within the respective dimension of classification.",
        "our view, two orthogonal types of systematic relations have to be distinguished: syntagmatics and alignment, since they appear to be universally relevant for the well-formedness of utterances in any language (Hierarchy 1).2 Syntagmatic relations play a constitutive role in syntax by establishing instant connections between linguistic entities in various constructions.",
        "There is a covert, meaningful dimension of structural syntagmatics, and an overt, morphosyntactic, form-oriented dimension of combinatorial syntagmatics.",
        "With respect to the alignment relation, which is responsible for the actual linear distribution of syntactically relevant items, we assume that at least the continuity of syntactic units, the directionality of the head (or, more generally, of a certain syntactically significant entity) as well as the periphery of a syntactically determined domain are relevant dimensions of classification (Hierarchy 2).",
