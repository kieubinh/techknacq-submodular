        "ETAP-3 is a multipurpose NLP environment that was conceived in the 1980s and has been worked out in the Institute for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences (Apresjan et al.",
        "1992, 13oguslaysky 1995).",
        "The theoretical foundation of ETAP-3 is the Meaning Text linguistic theory by Igor' MelZuk and the Integral Theory of Language by Jurij Apresjan.",
        "ETAP-3 is a non-commercial environment primarily oriented at linguistic research rather than creating a marketable software product.",
        "The main focus of the research carried out with ETAP-3 is computational modelling of natural languages.",
        "This attitude explains our effort to develop the models in a way as linguistically sound as possible.",
        "We strive to incorporate into the system much linguistic knowledge irrespective of whether this knowledge is essential for better text processing (e.g. machine translation) or not.",
        "In particular, we want our parser to produce what we consider a correct syntactic representation of the sentence – first of all because we believe that this interpretation is a true fact about the natural language.",
        "We have had many occasions to see that in the long run the theoretical soundness and completeness of linguistic knowledge incorporated in an NLP application will pay.",
        "All NLP applications in ETAP-3 are largely based on an original system of three-value logic and use an original formal language of linguistic descriptions, FORET."

        "Another module, a new UNL converter responsible for the interface with the Universal Networking Language, a recent product designed",

        "The most important module of ETAP-3 is the MT system that serves five language pairs: (1) English-Russian, (2) Russian – English, (3) Russian – Korean.",
        "(4) Russian – French, and (5) Russian – German.",
        "By far the most advanced are the first two of these pairs.",
        "The system disposes of 50,000- strong so-called combinatorial dictionaries of Russian and English that contain syntactic, derivational, semantic, subcategorization, and collocational information.",
        "The system relies on comprehensive grammars of the two languages.",
        "For the other language pairs smaller scale prototypes are available.",
        "ETAP-3 is able to present multiple translations when it encounters an ambiguity it cannot resolve.",
        "By default, the system produces one parse and one translation that it considers the most probable.",
        "If the user opts for multiple translation, the system remembers the unresolved ambiguities and provides all mutually compatible parses and lexical choices.",
        "To give one example from the real output: the sentence They made a general remark that... , when submitted to the multiple translation option, yielded two Russian translations that correspond to radically different syntactic structures and lexical interpretations: (a) Oni sdelali obshchee zamechanie, chto...",
        "They made some common remark that ...) and (b) Oni vynudili generala otmetitr, chto...",

      "text": [
        "The module is designed for linguistic experiments in obtaining multiple meaning-retaining paraphrases of Russian and English sentences.",
        "The paraphrasing is based on the concept of lexical functions, one of the important innovations of the Meaning <=> Text theory.",
        "The following example shows the kind of paraphrases that can be produced by the module: (1) The director ordered John to write a report The director gave John an order to write a report – John was ordered by the director to write a report – John received an order form the director to write a report.",
        "It is a very promising direction of linguistic research and development that can be applied in a wide range of activities, including language learning and acquisition, authoring, and text planning.",
        "Besides that, lexical functions are used for ensuring adequate lexical choice in machine translation and in the UNL module.",
        "The module operates with Russian texts in which it finds a wide range of errors in grammatical agreement as well as case subcategorization and offers the user the correct version.",
        "The module is a standalone software application constructed as a dialogue type computer game intended for advanced students of Russian, English, and German as foreign languages who wish to enrich their vocabulary, especially to master the collocations of these natural languages and their periphrastic abilities.",

        "It can also be used native speakers of the three languages interested in increasing their command of the vocabulary (such as journalists, school teachers, or politicians).",

        "However, in a series of recent experiments, the MT module was supplemented by an example-based component of a translation memory type and a statistical component that provides semiautomatic extraction of translation equivalents from bilingual text corpora (see lomdin & Streiter 1999).",

        "A dictionary entry contains, in addition to the lemma name, information on syntactic and semantic features of the word, its subcategorization frame, a default translation, and rules of various types, and values of lexical functions for which the lemma is the keyword.",
        "The word's syntactic features characterize its ability/non-ability to participate in specific syntactic constructions.",
        "A word can have several syntactic features selected from a total of more than 200 items.",
        "Semantic features are needed to check the semantic agreement between the words in a sentence.",
        "The subcategorization frame shows the surface marking of the word's arguments (in terms of case, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.).",
        "Rules are an essential part of the dictionary entry.",
        "All the rules operating in ETAP-3 are distributed between the grammar and the dictionary.",
        "Grammar rules are more general and apply to large classes of words, whereas the rules listed or simply referred to in the dictionary are restricted in their scope and only apply to small classes of words or even individual words.",
        "This organization of the rules ensures the self-tuning of the system to the processing of each particular sentence.",
