        "The first is: how to generate numeral classifiers such as piece in 2 pieces of paper?",
        "To do this we use a semantic hierarchy originally developed for a different task.",
        "The second is: how far can such a hierarchy be reused?",
        "In English, uncountable nouns cannot be directly modified by numerals, instead the noun must be embedded in a noun phrase headed by a classifier.",
        "Knowing when to do this is a language specific property.",
        "For example, French deux renseignement must be translated as two pieces of information in English) In many languages, including most South-East Asian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Korean, the majority of nouns are uncountable and must be quantified by numeral classifier combinations.",
        "These languages typically have many different classifiers.",
        "There has been some work on the analysis of numeral classifiers in natural language processing, particularly for Japanese (Asahioka et al., 1990; Kamei and Muraki, 1995; Bond et al., * Visiting CSLI, Stanford University (1999-2000).",

        "We could only find one paper on generating classifiers in Thai (Sornlertlamvanich et al., 1994).",
        "One immediate application for the generation of classifiers is machine translation, and we shall take examples from there, but it is in fact needed for the generation of any quantified noun phrase with an uncountable head noun.",
        "The second question we address is: how far can an ontology be reused for a different task to the one it was originally designed for.",
        "There are several large ontologies now in use (WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998); Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997); Mikrokos-mos (Nirenburg, 1989)) and it is impractical to rebuild one for every application.",
        "However, there is no guarantee that an ontology built for one task will be useful for another.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the properties of numeral classifiers in more detail and suggest an improved algorithm for generating them.",
        "Section 3 introduces the ontology we have chosen, the Goi-Taikei ontology (ikehara et al., 1997).",
        "Then we show how to use the ontology to generate classifiers in Section 4.",
