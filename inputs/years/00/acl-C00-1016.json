        "Binding constraints are an important set of filters in the process of anaphor resolution'.",
        "As they delimit the relative positioning of anaphors and their possible antecedents in the grammatical geometry, these constraints are of crucial importance for restricting the search space for antecedent candidates and enhancing the performance of resolvers.",
        "From an empirical perspective, they stem from quite robust generalizations and exhibit a universal character, given their parameterized validity across natural languages.",
        "From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the relations among binding constraints involve non-trivial symmetry, which lends them a modular nature.",
        "Accordingly, they have typically been taken as one of the most intriguing and robust grammar modules.",
        "Sec Annex for examples and the definition of binding constraints.",
        "In contrast to this, however, the formal and computational handling of binding constraints has presented non-negligible resistance when it comes to their integration into the representation and processing of grammatical knowledge.",
        "In its mainstream formulation, the methodology for verifying the compliance of grammatical representations with binding constraints requires a series of extra grammatical parsing steps (Chomsky, 81).",
        "More recently, prominent unification-based frameworks either require special purpose extensions of the description formalism for a partial handling of these constraints (LFG: Dalrymple, 93), or offer no integration yet for them into the grammatical setup (HPSG: Pollard and Sag, 94.",
        "Backofen et al., 96).",
        "Our primary aim in this paper is to bridge this gap between the grammatical nature of binding constraints and their full integration into grammar processing.",
        "In Section 1, we review previous steps towards this goal proposed in the literature.",
        "Building on these contributions in Section 2, we introduce the rationale of a new methodology for the verification of binding constraints.",
        "In Section 3, in the light of this new approach, we show how these constraints are fully integrated into grammar and the drawbacks of current methodology are overcome."

        "In line with Gawron and Peters, 90, however, we take them as conditions on semantic interpretation, as they delimit non-local aspects of meaning composition.",
        "In what follows, we set up a semantics-driven methodology for verifying binding constraints, organized under the rationale that an NP is a binding machine: (i) it reads a representation of the context; (ii) updates its own semantics given this context and its own anaphoric potential (in accordance with its binding constraint, if it is a non-quantificational NP); (iii) and makes a contribution to the context, against which other NPs are interpreted.",
        "This rationale is in line with the insights of Johnson and Klein,90 concerning the processing of the semantics of nominals, and also the spirit (but by no means the letter) of the dynamic semantics framework (Chierchia, 95).",
        "The output of a nominal n as a binding machine is simply the incrementing of the context with a copy of its reference marker (Kamp and Reyle, 93).",
        "The internal state of the machine after its operation is a compacted representation of the anaphoric potential of n, if any, under the form of the set of the reference markers of the grammatically admissible antecedents of // this internal state results from the binding constraint, lexically associated to 11, being applied to the input.",
