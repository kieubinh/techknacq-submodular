        "Syntactic information extracted from local context, as verb-object relations, is another major source for exogeneous categorization that has been exploited in thesaurus extension methods.",
        "The endogenous approach can also be improved by exploiting the syntactic structure of the technical terms.",
        "In our approach, all components of technical terms are equally weighted, independently of their syntactic roles within the terms.",
