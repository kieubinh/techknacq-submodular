        "Today many web sites on the Internet provide online news services.",
        "Multilingual news articles are reported periodically, and across geographic barrier to disseminate to readers.",
        "Readers can access the news stories conveniently, but it takes much time for people to read all the news.",
        "This paper will present a personal news secretariat that helps on-line readers absorb news information from multiple sources in different languages.",
        "Such a news secretariat eliminates the redundant information in the news articles, reorganizes the news for readers, and helps them resolve the language barriers.",
        "Reorganization of news is some sort of document summarization, which creates a short version of original document.",
        "Recently, many papers touch on single document summarization (Hovy and Marcu, 1998a).",
        "Only a few touch on multiple document summarization (Chen and Huang, 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 1997; Radev and McKeown, 1998) and multilingual document summarization (Hovy and Marcu, 1998b).",
        "For multilingual multiple news summarization, several issues have to be addressed: ( I ) Translation among news stories in different languages The basic idea in multiple document summarizations is to identify which parts of news articles present similar reports.",
        "Because the news stories are in different languages, some kind of translation is required, e.g., term translation.",
        "Besides the problem of translation ambiguity, different news sites often use different names to refer the same entity.",
        "The translation of named entities, which are usually unknown words, is another problem.",
        "(2) Idiosyncrasy among languages",
        "Different languages have their own specific features.",
        "For example, a Chinese sentence is composed of characters without word boundary.",
        "Word segmentation is indispensable for Chinese.",
        "Besides, Chinese writers often assign punctuation marks at random, how to determine a meaningful unit for similarity checking is a crucial issue.",
        "Thus some tasks may be clone for specific languages during summarization.",
        "(3) Implicit information in news reports Some information is implicit in news stories.",
        "For example, the name of a country is usually not mentioned in a news article reporting an event that happened in that country.",
        "On the contrary, the country name is important in foreign news.",
        "Besides, time zone is used to specify date/time implicitly in the news.",
        "(4) User preference",
        "When users want to read documents in their familiar languages, news fragments in some",
        "languages are preferred to those in other languages.",
        "Even machine translation should be introduced to translate news fragments.",
        "Besides, if a user prefers the news from the view of his country, or more precisely, of some news sites, we should meet his need.",
        "Figure 1 shows the architecture of a multilingual summarization system, which is used to summarize the news from multiple sources in different languages.",
        "It is composed of three major components: several monolingual news clusterers, a multilingual news clusterer, and a news summarizer.",
        "The monolingual news clusterer receives a news stream from multiple on-line newspapers in its respective language, and directs them into several output news streams by using events.",
        "The multilingual news clusterer then matches and merges the news streams of the same event but in different languages in a cluster.",
        "The news summarizer summarizes the news stories for each event.",
        "The possible tasks for each component depend on the languages used.",
        "Some major tasks of a monolingual clusterer are listed below.",
        "(1) Identifying word boundaries for Chinese and Japanese sentences, (2) Extracting named entities like people, place, organization, time, date and monetary expressions, (3) Clustering news streams based on",
        "predefined topic set and named entities.",
        "The task for the multilingual clusterer is to align the news clusters in the same topic set, but in different languages.",
        "It is similar to document alignment in comparable corpus.",
        "Named entities are also useful cues.",
        "The major tasks for the news summarizer are shown as follows.",
        "(1) Partitioning a news story into several meaningful units (MUs), (2) Linking the meaningful units, denoting the same thing, from different news reports, (3) Displaying the summarization results under the consideration of language type users prefer, information decay and views of reporters.",
