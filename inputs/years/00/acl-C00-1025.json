        "Because tables provide rich information, table acquisition is useful for many applications such as document understanding, question-and-answering, text retrieval, etc.",
        "However, most of previous approaches on text data mining focus on text parts, and only few touch on tabular ones (Appelt and Israel, 1997; Gaizauskas and Wilks, 1998; Hurst, 1999a).",
        "Of the papers on table extractions (Douglas, Hurst and Quinn, 1995; Douglas and Hurst 1996; Hurst and Douglas, 1997; Ng, Lim and Koo, 1999), plain texts are their targets.",

        "The following shows an example.",
        "It depicts book titles, authors, and prices.",
        "When detecting if there is a table in free text, we should disambiguate the uses of the special symbols.",
        "That is, the special symbol may be a separator or content of cells.",
        "Previous papers employ grammars (Green and Krishnamoorthy, 1995), string-based cohesion measures (Hurst and Douglas, 1997), and learning methods (Ng, Urn and Koo, 1999) to deal with table recognition.",
        "Because of the simplicity of table construction methods in free text, the expressive capability is limited.",
        "Comparatively, the markup languages like HTML provide very flexible constructs for writers to design tables.",
        "The flexibility also shows that table extraction in HTML texts is harder than that in plain text.",
        "Because the HTML texts are huge on the web, and they are important sources of knowledge, it is indispensable to deal with table milling on HTML texts.",
        "Hurst (1999b) is the first attempt to collect a corpus from HTML files, LATEX files and a small number of ASCII files for table extraction.",
        "This paper focuses on HTML texts.",
        "We will discuss not only how to recognize tables from HTML texts, but also how to identify the roles of each cell (attribute and/or value), and how to utilize the extracted tables."
