        "We introduced an approach to the design of compact, yet highly expressive semantic interpretation schemata.",

        "First, the organization of grammar and domain",
        "knowledge, as well as semantic interpretation mechanisms, are based on inheritance principles.",
        "Sec(1101, interpretation schemata, abstract from particular linguistic phenomena (specific lexical items, lex-eine classes or dependency relations) in terms of general configuration patterns ill dependency graphs.",
        "Underlying these design decisions is a strict separation of linguistic and conceptual knowledge.",
        "A clearly defined interface is provided which allows these specifications to make reference to fine-grained hierarchical knowledge, no matter whether it is of grammatical or conceptual origin.",
        "The interface is divided into two levels.",
        "One makes use of static, high-level constraints supplied by the mapping of syntactic to conceptual roles or supplied as the meaning of closed word classes.",
        "The other uses these constraints in a dynamic search through a knowledge base, that is parametrized by few and simple schemata.",
        "Finally, at the level of conceptual interpretation inferences emerging from semantic representations are computed by a set of productions which make reference to a verbcategorial hierarchy.",
        "Also since the number of schemata at the semantic description layer remains rather small, their execution is easy to trace and thus supports the maintenance of large-scale NLP systems.",
        "The high abstraction level provided by inheritance-based semantic specifications allows easy porting across different application domains.",
        "Our experience rests on reusing the set of semantic schemata, once developed for the information technology domain in the medical domain without bather changes.",
