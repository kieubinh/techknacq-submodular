        "The last decade has witnessed great advances and interest in the area of Information Extraction (IE) from real-world texts.",
        "Systems that participated in the TIPSTER MUC competitions have been quite successful at extracting information from newswire messages and filling templates with information pertaining to events or situations of interest.",
        "Typically, the templates model queries regarding who did what to whom, when and where, and eventually why.",
        "Recently, a new trend in information processing from texts has emerged.",
        "Textual Question Answering (Q/A) aims at identifying the answer of a question in large collections of on-line documents.",
        "Instead of extracting all events of interest and their related entities, a Q/A system highlights only a short piece of text, accounting for the answer.",
        "Moreover, questions are expressed in natural language, are not constrained to a specific domain and are not limited to the six question types sought by IE systems (i.e. who' did what2 to whom3, when4 and whcre5, and eventually Why (;) .",
        "In open-domain Q/A systems, the finite-state technology and domain knowledge that made IE systems successful are replaced by a combination of (1) knowledge-based question processing, (2) new forms of text indexing and (3) lightweight abduction of queries.",
        "More generally, these systems combine creatively components of the NLP basic research infrastructure developed in the 80s (e.g. the computational theory of Q/A reported in (Lehnert 1978) and the theory of abductive interpretation of texts reported in (Hobbs et al.1993)) with other shallow techniques that make possible the open-domain processing on real-world texts.",
        "The idea of building open-domain Q/A systems that perform on real-world document collections was initiated by the eighth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-8), by organizing the first competition of answering fact-based questions such as \"Who came up with the name, El Nino?\".",
        "Resisting the temptation of merely porting and integrating existing IE and IR technologies into Q/A systems, the developers of the TREC Q/A systems have not only shaped new processing methods, but also inspired new research in the challenging integration of surface-text-based methods with knowledge-based text inference.",
        "In particular, two clear knowledge processing needs are presented: (1) capturing the semantics of open-domain questions and (2) justifying the correctness of answers.",
        "In this paper, we present our experiments with integrating knowledge-based NLP with shallow processing techniques for these two aspects of Q/A.",
        "Our research was motivated by the need to enhance the precision of an implemented Q/A system and by the requirement to prepare it for scaling to more complex questions than those presented in the TREC competition.",
        "In the remaining of the paper, we describe a Q/A architecture that allows the integration of knowledge-based NLP processing with shallow processing and we detail their interactions.",
        "Section 2 presents the functionality of several knowledge processing modules and describes the NLP techniques for question and answer processing.",
        "Section 3 explains the semantic and logical interactions of processing questions and answers whereas Section 4 highlights the inference aspects that implement the justification option of a Q/A system.",
        "Section 5 presents the results and the evaluations whereas Section 6 concludes the paper.",
        "2 The NIA' Techniques Surprising quality for open-domain textual Q/A can be achieved when several lightweight knowledge-based NLP techniques complement mostly shallow, surface-based approaches.",
        "The processing imposed by Q/A systems must be distinguished, on the one hand, from IR techniques, that locate sets of doe",
        "uments containing the required information, based on keywords techniques.",
        "Q/A systems are presented with natural language questions, far richer in semantics than a set of keywords eventually structured around some operators.",
        "Furthermore, the output of Q/A systems is either the actual answer identified in a text or small text fragments containing the answer.",
        "This eliminates the user's trouble of finding the required information in sometimes large sets of retrieved documents.",
        "Open-domain Q/A systems must also be distinguished, On the other hand, from IF systems that model the information need through database templates, thus less naturally than a textual answer.",
        "Moreover, open-domain IE is still difficult to achieve, because its linguistic pattern recognition relies on domain-dependent lexico-semantic knowledge.",
        "To be able to satisfy the open-domain constraints, textual Q/A systems replace the linguistic pattern matching capabilities of IE systems with methods that rely on the recognition of the question type and of the expected answer type.",
        "Generally, this information is available by accessing a classification based on the question„stent (i.e. what, how much, who) and the head of the first noun phrase of the question.",
        "Question processing also includes the identification of the question keywords.",
        "Empirical methods, based on a set of ordered heuristics operating on the phrasal parse of the question, extract keywords that are passed to the search engine.",
        "The overall precision of the Q/A system depends also on the recognition of the question focus, since the answer extraction, succeeding the In phase, is centered around the question focus.",
        "Unfortunately, empirical methods for focus recognition are hard to develop without the availability of richer semantic knowledge.",
        "Special requirements are set on the document processing component of a Q/A system.",
        "To speed-up the answer extraction, the search engine returns only those paragraphs from a document that contain all queried keywords.",
        "The paragraphs are ordered to promote the cases when the keywords not only are as close as possible, but also preserve the syntactic dependencies recognized in the question.",
        "Answers are extracted whenever the question topic and the answer type are recognized in a paragraph.",
        "Thereafter the answers are scored based on several bag-of-words heuristics.",
        "Throughout all this processing, the NLP techniques are limited to (a) named entity recognition; (b) semantic classification of the question type, based on information provided by an off-line question taxonomy and semantic class information available from WordNet (Fellbaum 1998); and (c) phrasal parsing produced by enhancing Frill's part-of-speech tagger with some rules for phrase formation.",
        "However simple, this technology surpasses 75% precision on trivia questions, as posed in the TREC8 competition (cf. (Moldovan et al.1999)).",
        "An impressive improvement of 14% is achieved when more knowledge-intensive NLP techniques are applied at both question and answer processing level.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of a system that has enhanced Q/A performance.",
        "As represented in Figure 1, all three modules of the Q/A system preserve the shallow processing components that determine good performance.",
        "In the Question Processing module, the Question Class recognizer, working against a taxonomy of questions,",
        "still constitutes the central processing that takes place at tins stage.",
        "However, a far richer representation of the question classes is employed.",
        "To be able to classify against the new question taxonomy each question is first fully parsed and transformed into a semantic representation that captures all relationships between phrase heads.",
        "The recognition of the question class is based on the comparison of the question semantic representation with the semantic representation of the nodes from the question taxonomy.",
        "Taxonomy nodes encode also the answer type, the question focus and the semantic class of question keywords.",
        "Multiple sets of keywords are generated based on their semantic class, all pertaining to the same original question.",
        "This feature enables the search engine to retrieve multiple sets of documents, pertaining to multiple sets of answers, that are extracted, combined and ranked based on several heuristics, reported in (Moldovan et al.1999).",
        "This process of obtaining multiple sets of answers increases the likelihood of finding the correct answer.",
        "However, the big boost in the precision of the knowledge-based Q/A system is provided by the option of enabling the justification of the extracted answer.",
        "All extracted answers are parsed and transformed in semantic representations.",
        "Thereafter, both semantic transformations for questions and answers are translated into logic forms and presented to a simplified theorem prover.",
        "The proof back-chains from the question to the answer, its trace generating a justification.",
        "The prover may access a set of abduction rules that relax the justification process.",
        "Whenever an answer cannot be proven, it is discarded.",
        "This option solves multiple situations when the correct answer is not ranked as the first return, due to stronger surface-text-based indicators in some other answers, which unfortunately are not correct.",
        "This architecture allows for simple integration of semantic and axiomatic knowledge sources in a Q/A system and determines efficient interaction of text-surface-based and knowledge-based NLP techniques."
