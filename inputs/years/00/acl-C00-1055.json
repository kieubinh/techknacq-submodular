        "We believe it is fair to say that the field of machine translation has been on a plateau for at least the past decade.'",
        "Traditional, hand-built MT systems held up very well in the ARPA MT evaluation (White and O'Connell 1994).",
        "These systems are relatively expensive to build and generally require a trained staff working for several years to produce a mature system.",
        "This is the current commercial state of the art: hand-building specialized lexicons and translation rules.",
        "A completely different type of system was competitive in this evaluation, namely, the purely statistical CANDIDE system built at IBM.",
        "It was generally felt that this system had also reached a plateau in that more data and more training was not likely to improve the quality of the output.",
        "Low Density Machine Translation However, in the case of \"Low Density Machine Translation\" (see Nirenburg and Raskin 1998, Jones and Havrilla 1998) commercial market forces are not likely to provide significant incentives for machine translation systems for Low Density (Non-Major) languages any time soon.",
        "Two noteworthy efforts to break past the data and labor bottlenecks for high-quality machine translation development are the following.",
        "The NSF Summer Workshop on Douglas Jones is now at National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Douglas.jones @NIST.gov 2 A sensible, plateau-friendly strategy may be to accumulate translation memory to improve both the long-term efficiency of human translators and the quality of machine translation systems.",
        "If we imagine that the plateau is really a kind of logarithmic function tending ever upwards, we need only be patient.",
        "Statistical Machine Translation held at Johns Hopkins University summer 1999 developed a public-domain version intended as a platform for further development of a CANDIDE-style MT system.",
        "Part of the goal here is to improve the translation by adding levels of linguistic analysis beyond the word N-gram.",
        "An effort addressing the labor bottleneck is the Expedition Project at New Mexico State University where a preliminary elicitation environment for a computational field linguistics system has been developed (the Boas interface; see Nirenburg and Raskin 1998) A Scoring Function for MT quality Our contribution toward working beyond this plateau is to look for a way to define a scoring function for the quality of the English output such that we can use it to machine-learn a good translation grammar.",
        "The novelty of our idea for this function is that we do not have to define the internals of it ourselves per se.",
        "We are able to define a successful function for two reasons.",
        "First, there is a growing body of software worldwide that has been designed to consume English; all we need is for each piece of software to provide a metric as to how English-like its input is.",
        "Second, we can tell whether the software had trouble with the input, either by system-internal diagnosis or by diagnosing the software's output.",
        "A good illustration is the facility in current word-processing software to put red squiggly lines underneath text it thinks should be revised.",
        "We know from experience that this feature is often only annoying.",
        "Nevertheless, imagine that it is correct some percentage of the time, and that each piece of software we use for this purpose is correct some percentage of the time.",
        "Our strategy is to",
        "extract or create numeric values from each piece of software that corresponds to the degree to which the software was happy with the input.",
        "That array of numbers is the heart of our scoring function for Englishness -- we are calling these numeric values \"indicators\" of Englishness.",
        "We then use that array of indicators to drive the machine translation development.",
        "In this paper we will report on how we have constructed a prototype of this function; in separate work we discuss how to insert this function into a machine-learning regimen designed to maximize the overall quality of the machine translation output."
