        "A thesaurus plays essential roles in information retrieval systems.",
        "In particular, a domain-specific thesaurus greatly improves the effectiveness of information retrieval.",
        "However, we arc confronted with the difficult problem of how to construct and maintain a domain-specific thesaurus.",
        "The goal of our present research is to establish a method for automatically generating a thesaurus from a text corpus of a domain and demonstrate its application to information retrieval.",
        "Thesauri arc classified into taxonomy-type thesauri and association thesauri.",
        "There has been various research on the extraction of taxonomic information from a corpus, including extraction of hyponyms by using linguistic patterns (Hearst 1992) and extraction of synonyms based on the similarity of sets of co-occurring words (Ruge 1991; Grefenstette 1992).",
        "However, the performance of these methods is limited, and they should be considered as aids to augment handmade thesauri.",
        "In contrast, an association thesaurus, that is a collection of pairs of semantically associated terms, can be possibly generated from a corpus entirely automatically.",
        "Word association norms based on co-occurrence information have been proposed by (Church and Hanks 1990).",
        "Here we focus on the automatic generation of an association thesaurus.",
        "Association thesauri are as useful as taxonomy-type thesauri in information retrieval.",
        "The improvement of retrieval effectiveness by using an association thesaurus has been reported by a number of papers (Ding and Croft 1994; Sch√ºtze and Pedersen 1994).",
        "We propose to use a corpus-dependent association thesaurus interactively.",
        "2 Automatic Generation of an Association Thesaurus from a Corpus 2.1 Outline of the thesaurus generation method The proposed thesaurus generation method consists of term extraction, co-occurrence data extraction, and correlation analysis, as shown in Fig. 1",
        "A thesaurus should consist of terms, each representing a domain-specific concept.",
        "Most of the terms representing important concepts are nouns, simple or compound, that frequently occur in the corpus.",
        "Therefore, we extract both simple nouns and compound nouns whose occurrence frequencies exceed a predetermined threshold.",
        "We also use a list of stop words since frequently occurring nouns are not always terms.",
        "Compound nouns are identified by a pattern matching method using a part-of-speech sequence pattern.",

        "A problem in extracting compound nouns is that a word sequence matched to the above pattern, which actually defines just the type of noun phrase, is not always a term.",
        "We filter out some kind of non-term noun phrases by using a list of stop words for the first and last elements of compound nouns.",
        "Stop words for the first clement of compound nouns include referential nouns (e.g. pniki (above-mentioned)) and determiner nouns (e.g. kaku (each)).",
        "Stop words for the last element of compound nouns include time/place nouns (e.g. nai (inside)) and relational nouns (e.g. koyuu (peculiar)).",
        "Another important problem we are confronted with in term extraction is the structural ambiguity of compound nouns.",
        "For our purpose, we need to extract non-maximal compound nouns as well as maximal compound nouns.",
        "Here a non-maximal compound noun means one that occurs as a part of a larger compound noun, and a maximal compound noun means one that occurs not as a part of a larger compound noun.",
        "We must disambiguate the structure of compound nouns to correctly extract non-maximal compound nouns.",
        "We have developed a statistical disambiguation method, the detail and evaluation of which are described in 2.2.",
        "Our purpose is to collect pairs of semantically or contextually associated terms, no matter what kind of association.",
        "So we extract co-occurrence in a window.",
        "That is, every pair of terms occurring together within a window is extracted as the window is moved through a text.",
        "The window size can be specified rather arbitrarily.",
        "Considering our purpose, the window should accommodate a few sentences.",
        "At the same time, the window size should not be too large from the viewpoint of computational load.",
        "Therefore, 20 to 50 words, excluding function words, seems to be an appropriate value.",
        "Note that we filter out any pair of words co-occurring within a compound noun.",
        "If such pairs were included in co-occurrence data, they would show high correlation.",
        "However, they would be redundant because compound nouns arc treated as entities in our thesaunts."

        "We have two alternatives regarding the range where we count occurrence frequencies of maximal compound nouns.",
