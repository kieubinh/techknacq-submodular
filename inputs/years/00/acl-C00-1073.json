        "Recent advances in spoken language understanding have made it possible to develop dialogue systems for many applications.",
        "The role of the dialogue manager in such systems is to interact in a natural way to help the user complete the tasks that the system is designed to support.",
        "Typically, an expert designs a dialogue manager by hand, and has to make many nontrivial design choices that can seriously impact system performance.",
        "This paper applies reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically learn design choices that optimize system performance for a chosen performance measure (Levin et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1998).",
        "Consider the spoken dialogue system named NJ-Fun, which we built to help users find fun places to go in New Jersey.",
        "A sample dialogue with NJ-Fun is shown in Figure 1, with system utterances labeled Si and user utterances labeled Ui.",
        "When NJFun greets the user, it can provide au open greeting such as utterance Si, expecting that the user will take the initiative.",
        "Alternatively, it can provide a directive greeting in which the system takes the initiative, as in \"Welcome to NJFun.",
        "Please say an activity name or say 'list activities' for a list of activities I know about.\"",
        "After the user's response Ul, NJFun must decide whether it should explicitly confirm its understanding, as in utterances S2 and S3.",
        "NJFun can also simply continue on with the dialogue, as when it does not explicitly confirm that the user wants to find out about wineries.",
        "In NJFun, as shown in more detail below, decisions about initiative and confirmation strategies alone result in a Si: Welcome to NJFun.",
        "How may I help you?",

        "search space of 242 potential global dialogue strategies.",
        "Furthermore, the performance of a dialogue strategy depends on many other factors, such as the user population, the robustness of the automatic speech recognizes (ASR), and task difficulty (Kamm et al., 1998; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995).",
        "In the main, previous research has treated the specification of the dialogue management strategy as an iterative design problem: several versions of a system are created, dialogue corpora are collected with human users interacting with different versions of the system, a number of evaluation metrics are collected for each dialogue, and the different versions are statistically compared (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Sanderman et al., 1998).",
        "Due to the costs of experimentation, only a few global strategies are typically explored in any one experiment.",
        "However, recent work has suggested that dialogue strategy can be designed using the formalism of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and the algorithms of RL (Biermann and Long, 1996; Levin et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1998; Singh et al., 1999).",
        "More specifically, the MDP formalism suggests a method for optimizing dialogue strategies from sample dialogue data.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is the potential for computing an optimal dialogue strategy within a much larger search space, musing a relatively small number of training dialogues.",

        "problem of optimizing dialogue strategy selection in the NJFun system, and experimentally demonstrates the utility of the approach.",

        "A companion paper provides only an abbreviated system and dialogue manager description, but includes additional results not presented here (Singh et al., 2000), such as analysis establishing the veracity of the MDP we learn, and comparisons of our learned strategy to strategies hand-picked by dialogue experts."

        "Due to space limitations, we present only a brief overview of how dialogue strategy optimization can be viewed as an RL problem; for more details, see Singh et al.",

        "(1998), Levin et al.",
        "(2000).",
        "A dialogue strategy is a mapping from a set of states (which summarize the entire dialogue so far) to a set of actions (such as the system's utterances and database queries).",
        "There are multiple reasonable action choices in each state; typically these choices are made by the system designer.",
        "Our RL-based approach is to build a system that explores these choices in a systematic; way through experiments with representative human users.",
        "A scalar performance measure, called a reward, is then calculated for each experimental dialogue.",
        "(We discuss various choices for this reward measure later, but in our experiments only terminal dialogue states have nonzero rewards, and the reward measures are quantities directly obtainable from the experimental set-up, such as user satisfaction or task completion.)",
        "This experimental data is used to construct an MDP which models the users' interaction with the system.",
        "The problem of learning the best dialogue strategy from data is thus reduced to computing the optimal policy for choosing actions in an MD?",
        "-- that is, the system's goal is to take actions so as to maximize expected reward.",
        "The computation of the optimal policy given the MDP can be done efficiently using standard RL algorithms.",
        "How do we build the desired MDP from sample dialogues?",
        "Following Singh et al.",
        "(1999), we can view a dialogue as a trajectory in the chosen state space determined by the system actions and user responses: Sr -4a10.1 S2 -4a2,1'2 83 ---3a3,r3 • • • Here si si+1 indicates that at the ith exchange, the system was in state executed action received reward and then the state changed to s,,+-1.",
        "Dialogue sequences obtained from training data can be used to empirically estimate the transition probabilities P(s'Is,a) (denoting the probability of a transition to state given that the system was in state s and took action a), and the reward function R(s, a).",
        "The estimated transition probabilities and reward function constitute an MDP model of the user population's interaction with the system.",
        "Given this MDP, the expected cumulative reward (or Q-value) Q(s, a) of taking action a from state s can be calculated in terms of the Q-values of successor states via the following recursive equation:",
        "These Q-values can be estimated to within a desired threshold using the standard RL value iteration algorithm (Sutton, 1991), which iteratively updates the estimate of Q(s, a) based on the current Q-values of neighboring states.",
        "Once value iteration is completed, the optimal dialogue strategy (according to our estimated model) is obtained by selecting the action with the maximum Q-value at each dialogue state.",
        "While this approach is theoretically appealing, the cost of obtaining sample human dialogues makes it crucial to limit the size of the state space, to minimize data sparsity problems, while retaining enough information in the state to learn an accurate model.",
        "Our approach is to work directly in a minimal but carefully designed state space (Singh et al., 1999).",
        "The contribution of this paper is to empirically validate a practical methodology for using RL to build a dialogue system that optimizes its behavior from dialogue data.",
        "Our methodology involves 1) representing a dialogue strategy as a mapping from each state in the chosen state space S to a set of dialogue actions, 2) deploying an initial training system that generates exploratory training data with respect to S, 3) constructing an MDP model from the obtained training data, 4) using value iteration to learn the optimal dialogue strategy in the learned MD?, and 4) redeploying the system using the learned state/action mapping.",

        "Informally, the NJFun dialogue manager sequentially queries the user regarding the activity, location and time attributes, respectively.",
        "NJFun first asks the user for the current attribute (and possibly the other attributes, depending on the initiative).",
        "If the current attribute's value is not obtained, NJFun asks for the attribute (and possibly the later attributes) again.",
        "If NJFun still does not obtain a value, NJFun moves on to the next attribute(s).",

        "The length of NJFun dialogues ranges from 1 to 12 user utterances before the database query.",
        "Although the NJFun dialogues are fairly short (since NJFun only asks for an attribute twice), the information access part of the dialogue is similar to more complex tasks.",
        "As discussed above, our methodology for using RI, to optimize dialogue strategy requires that all potential actions for each state be specified.",
        "Note that at some states it is easy for a human to make the correct action choice.",
        "We made obvious dialogue strategy choices in advance, and used learning only to optimize the difficult choices (Walker et al., 1998).",
        "In NJFun, we restricted the action choices to 1) the type of initiative to use when asking or reasking for an attribute, and 2) whether to confirm an attribute value once obtained.",
        "The optimal actions may vary with dialogue state, and are subject to active debate in the literature.",
        "The examples in Figure 2 show that NJFun can ask the user about the first 2 attributes1 using three types of initiative, based on the combination of the wording of the system prompt (open versus directive), and the type of grammar NJFun uses during ASR (restrictive versus non-restrictive).",
        "If NJFun uses an open question with an unrestricted grammar, it is using user initiative (e.g., GreetU).",
        "If NJFun instead uses a directive prompt with a restricted grammar, the system is using system initiative (e.g., GreetS).",
        "If NJFun uses a directive question with a non-restrictive grammar, it is using mixed initiative, because it allows the user to take the initiative by supplying extra information (e.g., ReAsk1M).",
        "NJFun can also vary the strategy used to confirm each attribute.",
        "If NJFun asks the user to explicitly verify an attribute, it is using explicit confirmation (e.g., ExpConf2 for the location, exemplified by S2 in Figure 1).",
        "If NJFun does not generate any confirmation prompt, it is using no confirmation (the NoConf action).",
        "Solely for the purposes of controlling its operation (as opposed to the learning, which we discuss in a moment), NJFun internally maintains an operations vector of 14 variables.",
        "2 variables track whether the system has greeted the user, and which attribute the system is currently attempting to obtain.",
        "For each of the 3 attributes, 4 variables track whether the system has obtained the attribute's value, the system's confidence in the value (if obtained), the number of times the system has asked the user about the attribute, and the type of ASR grammar most recently used to ask for the attribute.",
        "The formal state space S maintained by NJFun for the purposes of learning is much simpler than the operations vector, clue to the data sparsity concerns already discussed.",
        "The dialogue state space S contains only 7 variables, as summarized in Figure 3.",
        "S is computed from the operations vector using a hand-designed algorithm.",

        "We omit the full definition, but as an example, when NiFun is working on the second attribute (location), the history variable is set to 0 if NJFun does not have an activity, has an activity but has no confidence in the value, or needed two queries to obtain the activity.",
        "A.s mentioned above, the goal is to design a small state space that makes enough critical distinctions to support learning.",

        "The training phase of the experiment resulted in 311 complete dialogues (not all subjects completed all tasks), for which NJFun logged the sequence of states and the corresponding executed actions.",

        "Such data illustrates that the random action choice strategy led to a fairly balanced action distribution per state.",

        "Only 8 states that occur near the end of a dialogue were visited less than 10 times.",
        "The logged data was then used to construct the empirical MDP.",
        "As we have mentioned, the measure we chose to optimize is a binary reward function based On the strongest possible measure of task completion, called StrongComp, that takes on value 1 if NJFun queries the database using exactly the attributes specified ill the task description, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Then we computed the optimal dialogue strategy in this MDP using RL (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "The action choices constituting the learned strategy are in boldface in Figure 4.",
        "Note that no choice was fixed for several states, meaning that the Q-values were identical after value iteration.",
        "Thus, even when using the learned strategy, NJFun still sometimes chooses randomly between certain action pairs.",
        "Intuitively, the learned strategy says that the optimal use of initiative is to begin with user initiative, then back off to either mixed or system initiative when reasking for an attribute.",
        "Note, however, that the specific backoff method differs with attribute (e.g., system initiative for attribute 1, but generally mixed initiative for attribute 2).",
        "With respect to confirmation, the optimal strategy is to",
        "mainly confirm at lower confidence values.",
        "Again, however, the point where confirmation becomes unnecessary differs across attributes (e.g., confidence level 2 for attribute 1., but sometimes lower levels for attributes 2 and 3), and also depends on other features of the state besides confidence (e.g., grammar and history).",
        "This use of ASR.",
        "confidence by the dialogue strategy is more sophisticated than previous approaches, e.g. (Niimi and Kobayashi, 1996; Litman and Pan, 2000).",

        "One of our main results is that task completion as measured by StrongComp increased from 52% in training to 64% in testing (p < .06).5 There is also a significant interaction effect between strategy and task (p<.01) for StrongComp.",
        "Previous work has suggested that novice users perform comparably to experts after only 2 tasks (Kamm et al., 1998).",
        "Since our learned strategy was based on 6 tasks with each user, one explanation of the interaction effect is that the learned strategy is slightly optimized for expert users.",
        "To explore this hypothesis, we divided our corpus into dialogues with \"novice\" (tasks 1. and 2) and \"expert\" (tasks 3-6) users.",
        "We found that the learned strategy did in fact lead to a large and significant improvement in StrongComp for experts (EIC – .46, learned=.69, p<.001), and a non-significant degradation for novices (E1C=.66, learned=.55, p<.3).",
        "An apparent limitation of these results is that EIC may not he the best baseline strategy for comparison to our learned strategy.",

        "Although many types of measures have been used to evaluate dialogue systems (e.g., task success, dialogue quality, efficiency, usability (Daniel{ and Gerbino, 1995; Kamm et al., 1998)), we optimized only for one task success measure, StrongComp.",
        "However, we also examined the performance of the learned strategy using other evaluation measures (which possibly could have been used as our reward function).",
        "WeakComp is a relaxed version of task completion that gives partial credit: if all attribute values are either correct or wildcards, the value is the sum of the correct number of attributes.",
        "Otherwise, at least one attribute is wrong (e.g., the user says \"Lambertville\" but the system hears \"Morristown\"), and the value is -1.",
        "ASR is a dialogue quality measure that approximates speech recognition accuracy for the database query, and is computed by adding 1 for each correct attribute value and .5 for every wihicard.",

        "(1998)'s methodology is similar to that used here, in testing RL with an implemented system with human users.",
        "However that work only explored strategy choices at 13 states in the dialogue, which conceivably could have been explored with more traditional methods (as compared to the 42 choice states explored here).",
        "We also note that our learned strategy made dialogue decisions based on ASR, confidence in conjunction with other features, and also varied initiative and confirmation decisions at a finer grain than previous work; as such, our learned strategy is not a standard strategy investigated in the dialogue system literature.",
        "For example, we would not have predicted the complex and interesting back-off strategy with respect to initiative when reasking for an attribute.",
        "To see how our method scales, we are applying RL to dialogue systems for customer care and for travel planning, which are more complex task-oriented domains.",
        "As future work, we wish to understand the aforementioned results on the subjective reward measures, explore the potential difference between optimizing for expert users and novices, automate the choice of state space for dialogue systems, hives-tigate the use of a learned reward function (Walker et al., 1998), and explore the use of more informative non-terminal rewards."
