        "Ideally, an EBMT system must determine correspondences at a sub-sentence level if optimal adaptation of matching fragments is to be achieved (Collins, B., & Cunningham, P. 1995).",
        "In practice, EBMT systems that operate at sub-sentence level involve the dynamic derivation of the optimum length of segments of the input sentence by analysing the available parallel corpora.",
        "This requires a procedure for determining the best \"cover\" of an input text by segments of sentences contained in the database (Nirenburg, S. Domashnev, C., Grannes, D. 1993), (Cranias, L. et al. 1994), (Frederking, R., Nirenburg, S., 1994), (Sato, S. 1995).",
        "What is needed is a procedure for aligning parallel texts at sub-sentence level, (Sadler, V., Vendelmans, R. 1990), (Boutsis, S., Piperidis, S. 1998).",
        "If sub-sentence alignment is available, the approach is fully automated but is quite vulnerable to the problem of low quality, as well as to translational ambiguity problems when the produced segments are rather small.",
        "Several approaches aim at proceeding a step further, by attempting to build a transfer-rule base in the form of abstract representations through different types of generalization processes applied on the available corpora relying on different levels of linguistic information and processing (Kaji et al.",
        "92), (Juola, P. 1994), (Furuse, 0., Iida, H. 1996), (Veale, T. and Way, A.",
        "1997), (McTait, K., et al.",
        "1999), thus providing more complete \"context\" information to the translation phase.",
        "The deeper the linguistic analysis involved in such a process, the more flexible the final translation structures will be and the better the quality of the results.",
        "However, this kind of analysis unquestionably leads to more computationally expensive and difficult to obtain systems.",
        "Our approach consists in a fully modular analogical framework, which can cope with lack of resources, and will perform even better when these are available.",
        "Analogical Modelling (AM) has been proposed as an alternative model of language usage.",
        "The main assumption underlying this approach is that many aspects of speaker performance are better accounted for in terms of \"analogy\", i.e. the identification of similarities and differences with forms in memory (the lexicon), than by referring to explicit and inaccessible rules.",
        "By \"analogy\" we mean the process of matching between an input pattern and a database of stored examples (exemplars).",
        "The result of this matching process is a collection of examples called the \"analogical set\" and classification of the input pattern is achieved through extrapolation from this set.",
        "At any given time, the main source of knowledge consists in a database of stored translation examples.",
        "These examples themselves are used to classify new items, without intermediate abstraction in the form of rules.",
        "In order to achieve this exhaustive database search is needed, and during this search, less relevant examples need to be discarded.",
        "All text features are equally important initially, and serve to partition the database into several disjoint classes of examples.",
        "In contrast to most of the analogy-based systems our approach applies the same principles during the learning phase in an attempt to extract appropriate generalizations (translation rules) based on similarities and differences between input exemplars.",
        "In this way, analogy is treated as more",
        "than simple pairwise similarity between input and database exemplars, rather it is considered as the main relation underlying a more complex network of relations between database exemplars."

        "The main idea behind our approach is based on the observation that given any source and target language sentence pair, any alteration of the source sentence will most likely result in one or more changes in the respective target, while it is also highly likely that constant and variable units of the source sentence correspond to constant and variable target units respectively.",
        "Apart from cases of so called \"translational divergences\" (Dorn, B.",
        "1994) as well as cases of idiomatic expressions, in most cases the above assumption holds true.",
        "Especially in the case of technical sublanguages, where rather literal and accurate translation is expected, \"translational divergences\" are limited while idiomatic expressions can be captured and finally rejected from the main process, through certain constraints, as this will be explained later on.",
        "The matching process as this is described by (Daelemans W., et al., 1997) based on Skousen's analogical modelling algorithm (Skousen, R. 1989), consists of two subsequent stages.",
        "The first stage of the matching process is the construction of \"subcontexts\", these are sets of examples and they are obtained by matching the input pattern, feature by feature, to each database item on an equal /not-equal base, and classify the database examples accordingly.",
        "Taking the input pattern ABC as an example eight (-23) different and mutually disjoint subcontexts would be constructed: ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC where the macron denotes complementation.",
        "Thus exemplars in the second class share only the second and third feature with the input pattern.",
        "In the following stage \"supracontexts\" are constructed by generalising over specific feature values.",
        "This is done by systematically discarding features from the input pattern and taking the union of the subcontexts that are subsumed by this new pattern.",
        "Supracontexts can be ordered with respect to generality, so that most specific supracontext contains items that share all features with the input pattern while the less specific ones those items that share at least one feature.",
        "The most general supracontext contains all database examples whether or not they share any features with the input pattern.",
        "Some exemplary supracontexts together with the respective subcontexts for the input pattern ABC are presented in the following table.",
        "In addition, our approach introduces a second dimension to the above described process, that of language, by simultaneously performing the matching process to target language equivalents and aligning individual results, based on the principles described earlier.",
        "Therefore, what we are ultimately searching for, are source and target sentence pairs for which evidence of correspondence between any or all of respective subcontexts within the available training corpora is available.",
        "This will subsequently lead to links between respective supracontexts.",
