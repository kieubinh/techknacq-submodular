        "This procedure is trivial for a system if, given a context, one transfix rule can be selected unambiguously.",
        "Otherwise, choosing the best set of transfer rules may involve the evaluation of numerous competing sets.",
        "In fact, the number of possible transfer rule combinations increases exponentially with the length of the source language sentence.",
        "Tins situation mirrors the problem of choosing productions in a nondete•-ministic parser.",
        "In this paper, we describe a system for choosing transfer rules, based on statistical chart parsing (Bobrow, 1990; Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998).",
        "In our Machine Translation system, transfer rules are generated automatically from parsed parallel text along the lines of (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Meyers et al., 1996; Meyers et al., 1998b).",
        "Our system tends to acquire a large number of transfer rules, due mainly to alternative ways of translating the same sequences of words, non-literal translations in parallel text and parsing errors.",
        "It is therefore crucial that our system choose the best set of rules efficiently.",
        "While the technique discussed here obviously applies to similar such systems, it could also apply to hand-coded systems in which each word or group of words is related to more than one transfer rule.",
        "For example, both.",
        "Multra (Hein, 1996) and the Eurotra system described in (Way et al., 1997) require components for deciding which combination of transfer rules to use.",

        "There is some discussion about adding sonic transfer rules automatically acquired from corpora to Multra.2 Assuming that they over-generate rules (as we did), a system like the one we propose should be beneficial.",
        "In (Way et al., 1997), many different criteria are used to choose transfer rules to execute including: preferences for specific rules over general ones, and complex rule notation that insures that few rules can apply to the same set of words.",
        "The Pangloss Mark III system (Nirenburg",
        "and Frederking, 1995) uses a chart-walk algorithm to combine the results of three MT engines: an example-based engine, a knowledge-based engine, and a lexical-transfer engine.",
        "Each engine contributes its best edges and the chart-walk algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the combination of edges with the best overall score that covers the input string.",
        "Scores of edges are normalized so that the scores from the different engines are comparable and weighted to favor engines which tend to produce better results.",
        "Pangloss's algorithm combines whole MT systems.",

        "Also, we use a best-first search that incorporates a probabilistic-based figure of merit, whereas Pangloss uses an empirically based weighting scheme and what appears to be a top-down search.",
        "Best-first probabilistic chart parsers (Bo-brow, 1990; Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998) strive to find the best parse, without exhaustively trying all possible productions.",
        "A probabilistic figure of merit (Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998) is devised for ranking edges.",
        "The highest ranking edges are pursued first and the parser halts after it produces a complete parse.",
        "We propose an algorithm for choosing and applying transfer rules based on probability.",
        "Each final translation is derived from a specific set of transfer rules.",
        "If the procedure immediately selected these transfer rules and applied them in the correct order, we would arrive at the final translation while creating the minimum number of edges.",
        "Our procedure uses about 4 times this minimum number of edges.",
        "With respect; to chart parsing, (Charniak et al., 1998) report that their parser can achieve good results while producing about three times the minimum number of edges required to produce the final parse."
