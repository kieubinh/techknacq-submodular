        "Parsing for coordination should thus find the exact syntactic boundaries of these \"intended\" conjuncts/disjuncts.",
        "Previous work employed a preprocessing module for parsing to work on a constrained range of the candidate conjuncts/disjuncts (Kurohashi Nagao, 1994; Yang, 1995; Okumura Muraki, 1994).",
        "Combinatory categorial grammars (Steed-man, 1990; 2000) are known to explain a wide range of syntactic phenomena, such as coordination, ethaction and long distance dependency, without employing the notions of movement and empty categories.",
        "While CCGs offer explanations for various natural language phenomena with limited combinatory rules such as type raising and function composition, these are also well known to increase the complexity of parsing, giving rise to quite a few irrelevant syntactic analyses as well as relevant ones, a phenomenon often called as spurious ambiguity.",
        "In this paper, we propose to address the two types of ambiguity with predicate argument structures and semantic co-occurrence similarity information.\"",
        "For a more concrete discussion, we focus in this paper on coordination in Korean.",
