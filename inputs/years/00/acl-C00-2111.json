        "The UNL project of network-oriented multilingual communication has proposed a standard for encoding the meaning of natural language utterances as semantic hypergraphs intended to be used as pivots in multilingual information and communication systems.",

        "In this project, the strategy used to achieve this initial objective is free.",
        "The UNL-French deconverter under development first performs a \"localization\" operation within the UNL format, and then classical transfer and generation steps, using the Ariane-G5 environment and some UNL-specific tools.",
        "The use of classical transfer and generation steps in the context of an interlingual project may sound surprising.",
        "But it reflects many interesting issues about the status of the UNL language, designed as an interlingua, but diversely used as a linguistic pivot (disambiguated abstract English), or as a purely semantic pivot.",
        "After introducing the UNL language, we present the architecture of the UNL-French deconverter, which \"generates\" from the UNL interlingua by first \"localizing\" the UNL form for French, within UNL, and then applying slightly adapted but classical transfer and generation techniques, implemented in the Ariane-G5 environment, supplemented by some UNL-specific tools.",
        "Then, we discuss the use of the UNL language as a linguistic or semantic pivot for highly multilingual information systems."

        "The pivot paradigm is used: the representation of an utterance in the UNL interlingua (UNL stands for \"Universal Networking Language\") is a hypergraph where normal nodes bear UWs (\"Universal Words\", or interlingual acceptions) with semantic attributes, and arcs bear semantic relations (deep cases, such as agt, obj, goal, etc.).",
        "Hypernodes group a subgraph defined by a set of connected arcs.",
        "A UW denotes a set of interlingual acceptions (word senses), although we often loosely speak of \"the\" word sense denoted by a UW.",
        "Because English is known by all UNL developers, the syntax of a normal UW is: \"<English word or compound> ( <list of restrictions> ) '', e.g. \"look for ( icl>action, agt>human, obj >thing) \" Going from a text to the corresponding \"UNL text\" or interactively constructing a UNL text is called \"enconversion\", while producing a text from a sequence of UNL graphs is called \"deconversion\".",
        "This departure from the standard terms of analysis and generation is used to stress that this is not a classical MT project, but that UNL is planned to be the source format preferred for representing textual information in the envisaged multilingual network environment.",
        "The schedule of the project, beginning with deconversion rather than enconversion, also reflects that difference.",
        "14 languages have been tackled during the first - 3-year phase of the project (1997-1999), while many more are to be added in the second phase.",
        "Each group is free to reuse its own software tools and/or lingware resources, or to develop directly with tools provided by the UNL Center (UNU/IAS).",
        "Emphasis is on a very large lexical coverage, so that all groups spend most of their time on the UNL-NL lexicons, and develop tools and methods for efficient lexical development.",
        "By contrast, grammars have been initially limited to those necessary for deconversion, and will then be gradually expanded to allow for more naturalness in formulating text to be enconverted."
