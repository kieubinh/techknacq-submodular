        "How do referring expressions denote?",
        "According to Russell, a definite description such as \"the King of France\", denotes a unique individual by virtue of its meaning.",
        "But, according to Familiarity Theory (Heim, 1983), referring expressions need not denote uniquely by virtue of their meaning as they refer to individuals made familiar by the discourse or other context.",
        "This observation plays a key role in Centering Theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995) and other computational approaches in which referring expressions arc resolved by locating their antecedents in the discourse.",
        "The reference of pronouns like \"he\", definite descriptions like \"the woman\", and referential tenses like \"had\" clearly has more to do with salience in context than with uniqueness of meaning.",
        "Shn-ilarly, while names like \"Mary\" need not denote individuals prominent in the discourse context, We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments.",
        "they must nevertheless denote individuals familiar to conversants if they are successfully to refer.",
        "However, there is another class of referring expressions in relation to which we believe the concept of uniqueness of meaning does have an essential role to play.",
        "These include such definite descriptions as \"the first man\" and \"the first snowdrop of Spring\", along with such variations on these as \"the first three men\" and \"the first snowdrops of Spring\".",
        "In implementing a system of reference resolution, we have attempted to reconcile the notions of familiarity and uniqueness.",
        "This enables us to dereference expressions like \"the first snowdrop of Spring\" in a unified framework alongside anaphors') pronouns, referential tenses, names, and other definite descriptions like \"the man\".",
        "(1) Two men arrived.",
        "(2) The first man spoke.",
        "In the case of a referring expression like \"the first man\", there may be an antecedent of sorts in the discourse, but; it is not the individual referred to (or indeed an individual at all).",
        "We will say that the antecedent \"two men\" introduces a set, and that the referring expression \"the first man\" denotes, by virtue of the meaning of first, a unique subset of this familiar set.",
        "In the case of \"the first snowdrop of Spring\", there need be no explicit antecedent in the discourse.",
        "We will say that, in the same way that \"Mary\" denotes a familiar individual, \"the snowdrops of Spring\" denotes a familiar set, or I-We use this term to distinguish reflexives like \"herself\" from pronouns like \"he\" and \"hinC.",
        "property.",
        "Again, by virtue of the meaning of first, \"the first snowdrop of Spring\" can be said to denote a unique subset of the familiar set.",
        "We will not claim that it denotes a unique individual, but that rather it denotes a unique subset of the specified cardinality, i.e., 1.",
        "This treatment has the advantage that it extends to plural referring expressions.",
        "Below we outline the approach we have developed to the representation and resolution of referring expressions, before discussing in more detail its extension to deal with unfamiliar referents."

      "text": [
        "Our framework for reference resolution has been implemented in the system of language understanding described in (Ramsay, 1999).",
        "The starting point for reference resolution is the logical form we obtain from parsing.",
        "For example, the following is the logical form we get for the utterance \"Mary slept.\"",
        "We use the inference engine described in (Ramsay and Seville, 2000) to update the discourse model with a new discourse state containing the information explicitly represented in the logical form together with any further inferences which are licensed given the existing discourse model.",
        "Reference resolution, which involves carrying out a proof that a referring expression denotes, is implemented as part of the update step.",
        "We anchor a referring expression like ref (AD (named(D , Mary)&card(D, 1))) in the discourse model by proving the existence of an entity in the model which satisfies the properties specified by the referring expression, in this case AD (named(D , M ary)&card(D,1))2 .",
        "2Strictly speaking, it is a set which is denoted.",
        "For readability, our referring expressions conflate the properties of sets and their members.",
        "In this case, the cardinality is a property of the set denoted, but the name Mary is a property of its member.",
        "Given that many referring expressions do not in themselves denote uniquely, however, we need a theory of reference resolution to enable us to obtain the appropriate (i.e., intended) referent for any referring expression.",
        "We incorporate our theory of reference resolution into the actual representation of referring expressions; for example, we label anaphors with the property \"salient\" and pronouns (and also referential tenses) with the property \"centred\" 3:",
        "Reference resolution relies on maintaining, as in Centering Theory, a list of forward-looking centres for each discourse state (corresponding to an utterance) in the discourse.",
        "Furthermore, for the purposes of reference resolution, the discourse states themselves are organized into a discourse tree, which is constructed automatically based on referential cues4, as described in (Seville, 1999).",
        "0 (1) a rnani died in a parkk.",
        "(2) he; had i been sleeping there;.",
        "1 (3) a woman/ lovedâ€ž, (4) she/ hadm, hated him;.",
        "The nodes in such a tree correspond to discourse states.",
        "Those on the right-hand frontier are open, which essentially means that the entities mentioned in them are available to pronominal reference.",
        "The process of reference resolution for the various referring expressions can be briefly described as follows.",
        "Anaphors, characterised as salient, are resolved to a less oblique argument of the same verb (Pollard and Sag, 1994) within the current discourse state, which is constructed 3Here ref (AD(cds(D)) is a reference to the current discourse state and the properties 7n and f refer to male and female gender respectively.",
        "4 The tree illustrated was constructed using pronominal cues.",
        "Each discourse state was attached as a daughter of the highest node in the discourse tree to which all pronouns and referential tenses (like had) mentioned in it could be anchored.",
        "incrementally.",
        "We also start our search for the referents of pronouns and other centred entities in the current discourse state, which is necessary if we are to resolve such referring expressions as \"her\" in \"Mary took John with her.\" However, referring expressions containing the property centred are prevented from being dereferenced to salient entities, thus ensuring that the constraint of disjoint reference is met.",
        "If we fail to find the centred entity in the current discourse state, we search the previous open node and, if necessary, further open nodes in the discourse tree, in order to deal with long-distance pronominalisation.",
        "The dereferencing of other referring expressions like ref (AD (named(D , M ary)&card(D, 1))) is similar but; less constrained in that we consider entities mentioned in all nodes mentioned in the discourse tree, whether open or closed, in order of recency.",
        "This means that, essentially, names and definite descriptions are dereferenced to the most recently mentioned referent which is appropriate.",
        "Unlike in the case of pronouns, we also consider Discourse State 0, which doesn't correspond to an utterance but;, rather, contains the background knowledge assumed in the model.",
        "This is how we are able to deal with the first mention of a familiar referent like Mary (assuming that the properties AD (namcd(D , M ary)kcard(D, 1)) suffice to distinguish a particular entity in Discourse State 0 from all the others).",
        "Our approach extends naturally to cases like \"the first snowdrop of Spring\" because it is proof-theoretic and so able to exploit background knowledge in reference resolution.",
        "This can be illustrated, in the first instance, by examining the background knowledge which is used in updating the utterance \"Mary slept.\" The update step for this utterance yields Discourse State 1, containing (amongst others) the following facts: Discourse State 1 sleep(#134) O(#134, agent, #94) â€¢ ends _be f ore(#4(1), #133) aspect(simple, #133, #134) We were able to prove named(#94, Mary) and card(#94, 1) and so dereference ref (AD (named(D , M ary)&card(D, 1))) as the following were amongst the facts contained in Discourse State 0:",

        "Our reference resolution procedure exploits the fact that the house, #139, is explicitly represented in the forward looking centres of Discourse State 1 and that the intended referent, #46(#139), is clearly a function of this (its dependency having been preserved by Skolemization).",
        "In considering the potential referents for our referring expression in order of recency, we attempt to prove, not simply, for each referent, X, whether door(X) and card(X, 1), but door(Y) and card(Y, 1) where Y is a function of X.",
