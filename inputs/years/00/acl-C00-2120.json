        "The paper describes the main results of a comparison of the Tom (Tone-and-Break-Indices) approach (Pierrehumbert, 1.980; Silverman et al., 1996) to annotating English speech data with_ information about intonation and one of the British School approaches (e.g., Brazil et al.",
        "(1.980)), Systemic; Functional Grammar (sFG; (Halliday, 1967; Halliday, 1970)).",
        "The goal of this comparison is the definition of a mapping between the two systems.",
        "This attempt has a twofold motivation.",
        "First, it is motivated by computational application in concept-to-speech systems, in which text in spoken mode is automatically generated from an underlying abstract meaning representation.",
        "It is widely acknowledged that in order for spoken language technology to gain wider acceptance, it has to improve on the quality of output considerably.",
        "Here, appropriate intona-Hon is one of the major factors (cf. Cole et al.",
        "(1995)).",
        "The concrete goal we are pursuing is to connect an off-the-shelf speech synthesizer for English (rEsTivAL; (Black et al., 1998)) with an automatic text generation system for English based on SFG (Matthiessen 13ateman, 1991).",
        "Since in the SFG approach, intonation is accounted for as part of grammar rather than as an independent component, it is straightforward to extend the grammatical resources of a systemically based text generation system with an account of intonation (cf. Teich et al.",
        "(1.997) implementing such an approach for German concept-to-speech generation).",
        "Connecting such a system to a speech synthesizer requires mapping the output of the generator to the input requirements of the speech synthesizer.",
        "In the FESTIVAL system, the intonation of the text to be synthesized can be manipulated by annotation with Tom labels.",
        "Therefore, a mapping between the SFG and the ToBI annotation systems is required.",
        "Second, there is a theoretical motivation.",
        "With a mapping between the Tom and the SFG systems for intonation annotation, it will be possible to link the phonetic analysis of speech data to an interpretation of intonational meaning as it is proposed by SFG.",
        "Existing speech corpora that are acoustically analysed and annotated with Toni can then be used to test some of the assumptions brought forward by SFG about the nature of intonation.",
        "Also, with a mapping between Tom and SFG annotations, an exchange of annotated corpora between Tom and SFG users would be possible.",
        "We report on the analysis of a speech corpus compiled from Halliday (1970) with Tom and SFG labels (Sec.",
        "3).",
        "The intonation analysis is based on an acoustic analysis of the speech data in terms of fundamental frequency (FO).",
        "The data are represented in EMU (Cassidy & Harrington, 1996), a database system for storing speech data that provides for a multiple-tier analysis of acoustic (e.g., FO contour and speech waveform) and phonological (segmental and suprasegmental) features.",
        "We present the major differences and commonalities between TOBI and SFG (Sec.",
        "2).",
        "On the basis of the corpus analysis, we identify matches between the tunes assumed by Halliday and unique sequences of TOBI tones (Sec.",

        "The majority of text-to-speech systems that allow for the manipulation of an input string so as to control intonation employ the Tom system (Silverman et al., 1996), which is based on the autosegmental-metrical approach originally set up by Pierrehumbert (1980) to describe American English intonation.",
        "Versions of TOBI for other languages have been developed, e.g., Grice et al.",
        "(1996) for German, and are also widely used in computational contexts.",
        "One major theoretical difference between the TOBI approach and the British School approaches, such as the one advocated by SFG, is that in the latter there is a built-in focus on the relation between intonation and meaning.",
        "In SFG, intonation contours are distinguished according to their differential meanings, i.e., they label pitch movements that are commonly interpreted by the speakers of (British) English as having quite different pragmatic purport (cf. Teich et al.",
        "(1997)).",
        "This is what makes the SFG approach attractive in the context of concept-to-speech generation, in which it is crucial to be able to represent criteria for selecting an intonation contour appropriate in a given context.",
        "Tom, on the other hand, is a phonetic-phonological annotation scheme for intonation.",
        "Since it is widely used, there exist numerous tools supporting analysis with a high degree of analytical rigor.",
        "It seems therefore doubly significant to combine the two approaches in an attempt to achieve high-quality synthesized speech output.",
        "While clearly some fundamental theoretical differences exist between the TOBI and SFG approaches, more technically there is a basic commonality.",
        "Any annotation scheme for intonation must establish three principal constructs for the representation of intonation: the units of intonation, a set of categories that describe the pitch movement occurring in that unit, and a set of labels that mark the nuclear stress on which the pitch movement is realised.",

        "The Tom analysis for the final tone in a sequence are essentially the same as for the utterances given in Table 2.",
        "The first tone group in a sequence is more often than not an intermediate phrase rather than a separate intonation phrase.",

        "In this paper we have presented the results of a comparison between the Tom and the SFG systems for analysing intonation.",
        "The goal of this comparison has been to establish equivalents between them.",
        "The motivation behind this is to make the two systems collaborate in concept-to-speech generation: Tom is a phonetic-phonological approach to the description of intonation, SFG offers a linguistic approach to intonation, focusing on the meaningful intonation patterns.",
        "Tom is widely used in speech synthesis, SFG is widely used in natural language generation.",
        "It seems therefore a promising step to combine the two approaches for concept-to-speech generation.",
        "Through this study we have established some basic matches between SFG tones and Toni sequences of pitch accents and edge tones.",
        "Here, we have concentrated on the SFG tones 1, 2 and 4.",
        "We have analysed tones 3 and 5 as well and identified their Toni equivalents using the same method (cf.",
        "Sections 3 and 4).",
        "In the next step we will integrate the SFG description of intonation for English in the existing SFG-based Penman generation system and then interface the FESTIVAL synthesizer with the generator using the correspendences established by our analyses.",
        "In another step of analysis we will look more closely at other kinds of realization of nuclear stresses, such as bitonal pitch accents, to establish whether they reflect linguistic meanings.",
        "What also remains to be investigated is the assignment of pitch accents other than the nuclear stress.",
        "Nuclear stress can be predicted on the basis of linguistic and pragmatic information, but it is not clear under which conditions other pitch accents should be placed.",
        "Our observation above (Sec.",
        "4) that pitch accents other than the nuclear stress are typically placed on the first syllable of a foot may be a possible motivation.",
        "We are aware that there is controversy among researchers about rhythm.",
        "However, if it turns out that rhythm is a useful concept in the prediction of non-nuclear pitch accents, then we will consider including it in our approach."
