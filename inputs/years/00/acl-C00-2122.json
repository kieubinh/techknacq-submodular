        "Since exactly one translation should be produced for each input utterance, a selection procedure is necessary.",
        "In order to benefit more from this diversity, the alternative translations are furthermore combined within the boundaries of single utterances, so as to form new compound translations.",
        "Combining translations from different sources within a multi-thread MT system has already proved beneficial in the past (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "Our present work differs from the work reported in there in several ways (apart from the trivial fact that we use 'four heads' rather than three).",
        "Firstly, we attempt to investigate a systematic solution to the incomparability of the various confidence values.",
        "Secondly, as we deal with speech to speech rather than text to text translation, different segmentations fcr each given input string are allowed, making the segment combination process significantly more complicated."

        "The task of evaluating",
        "translation quality is non-trivial also for human annotators, since the applicable criteria are diverse, and at the absence of a comprehensive translation theory, very often lead to contradicting conclusions.",
        "This difficulty is partially dealt with in section 4.1 below, but for practical reasons we tend to accept the need to rely on human judgment, partially theory assisted and partially intuitive, as inevitable.",
        "Another presupposition that underlies the current work is that the desirable resealing can be well approximated by means of linear polynomials.",
        "This assumption allows us to remain within the relatively friendly realm of linear equations (albeit inconsistent), and reflects two basic guiding principles: firstly, that the resealing is motivated by pragmatical needs, rather than by descriptive aspirations, and secondly, that it should not contradict the presupposed correlation between confidence and quality within each module, which implies that the resealing functions should be monotonous."

        "This implies that even though all translation modules share the same input data structure, both the chosen input string and its chosen segmentation may well differ across modules.",
        "This section provides the reader with very brief descriptions of the different translation subsystems, along with their respective confidence value calculation methods.",
        "• The ali subsystem implements an example based translation approach.",
        "Confidence values are calculated according to the matching-level of the input string with its counterparts in the database.",
        "• The stattrans (Och et al., 1999) subsystem is a statistical translation system.",
        "Confidence values are calculated according to a statistical language model of the target language, in conjunction with a statistical translation model.",

        "Here the translation invariant con",
        "sists of a recognized dialogue act, together with its extracted propositional content.",
        "The confidence value reflects the probability that the dialogue act was recognized correctly, together with the extent to which the propositional content was successfully extracted.",
        "• The deep translation path in itself consists of multiple pipelined modules: linguistic analysis, semantic construction, dialogue and discourse semantics, and transfer (Emele and Dorna, 1996) and generation (Kilger and Finkler, 1995) components.",
        "The transfer module receives disambiguation information from the context (Koch et al., 2000) and dialogue modules.",
        "The linguistic analysis part consists of several parsers which, in turn, also operate in parallel (Ruland et al., 1998).",
        "They include an HPSG parser, a Chunk Parser and a statistical parser, all producing data structures of the same kind, namely, the Verbmobil Interface Terms (VITs) (Schiehlen et al., 2000).",
        "Thus, within the deep processing path, a selection problem arises, similar to the larger scale problem of selecting the best translation.",
        "This internal selection process within the deep path is based on a probabilistic VIT model.",
        "Confidence values within the deep path are computed according to the amount of coverage of the input string by the selected parse, and are subject to modifications as a byproduct of combining and repairing rules that operate within the semantics mechanism.",
        "Another source of information which is used for calculating the 'deep' confidence values is the generation module, which estimates the percentage of each transfered VIT which can be successfully realized in the target language.",
        "Although all confidence values are finally scaled to the interval [0, 100] by their respective generating 'nodules, there seems to be hardly any reason to believe that such fundamentally different calculation methods would yield magnitudes that are directly comparable with one another.",
