        "Metonymy is a figure of speech in which the name of one thing is substituted for that of something to which it is related.",
        "The explicit term is 'the name of one thing' and the implicit term is 'the name of something to which it is related'.",
        "A typical example of metonymy is He read Shakespeare.",
        "(1) `Shakespeare' is substituted for 'the works of Shakespeare'.",
        "'Shakespeare' is the explicit term and 'works' is the implicit term.",
        "Metonymy is pervasive in natural language.",
        "The correct treatment of metonymy is vital for natural language processing applications, especially for machine translation (Kamei and Wakao, 1992; Fass, 1997).",
        "A metonymy may be acceptable in a source language but unacceptable in a target language.",
        "For example, a direct translation of 'he read Mao', which is acceptable in English and Japanese, is completely unacceptable in Chinese (Kamei and Wakao, 1992).",
        "In such cases, the machine translation system has to interpret metonymies to generate acceptable translations.",
        "Previous approaches to processing metonymy have used hand-constructed ontologies or semantic networks (Fass, 1988; Iverson and Helm-reich, 1992; Holland et al., 1996; Fass, 1997).1 1 As for metaphor processing, Ferrari (1996) used tex-Such approaches are restricted by the knowledge bases they use, and may only be applicable to domain-specific tasks because the construction of large knowledge bases could be very difficult.",
        "The method outlined in this paper, on the other hand, uses corpus statistics to interpret metonymy, so that a variety of metonymies can be handled without using hand-constructed knowledge bases.",
        "The method is quite promising as shown by the experimental results given in section 5.",
        "2 Recognition and Interpretation Two main steps, recognition and interpretation, are involved in the processing of metonymy (Fass, 1997).",
        "In the recognition step, metonymic expressions are labeled.",
        "In the interpretation step, the meanings of those expressions are interpreted.",
        "Sentence (1), for example, is first recognized as a metonymy and 'Shakespeare' is identified as the explicit term.",
        "The interpretation 'works' is selected as an implicit term and 'Shakespeare' is replaced by 'the works of Shakespeare'.",
        "A comprehensive survey by Fass (1997) shows that the most common method of recognizing metonymies is by selection-restriction violations.",
        "Whether or not statistical approaches can recognize metonymy as well as the selection-restriction violation method is an interesting question.",
        "Our concern here, however, is the interpretation of metonymy, so we leave that question for a future work.",
        "In interpretation, an implicit term (or terms) that is (are) related to the explicit term is (are) selected.",
        "The method described in this paper uses corpus statistics for interpretation.",
        "teal clues obtained through corpus analysis for detecting metaphors.",
        "This method, as applied to Japanese metonymies, receives a metonymy in a phrase of the form 'Noun A Case-Marker R Predicate V' and returns a list of nouns ranked in order of the system's estimate of their suitability as interpretations of the metonymy, assuming that noun A is the explicit term.",
        "For example, given Ford wo (accusative-case) kau (buy) (buy a Ford), zy6yOsya (car), best seller, ku-ruma (vehicle), etc.",
