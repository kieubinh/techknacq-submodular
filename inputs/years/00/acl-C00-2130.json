        "In previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we reported the results of corpus annotation experiments in which the subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal articles according to a scheme derived from work by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981) and including three classes: DIRECT ANAPHORA, DISCOURSE-NEW, and BRIDGING DESCRIPTION (Clark, 1977).",
        "This study showed that about half of the time, definite descriptions are used to introduce a new entity in the discourse, rather than to refer to an object already mentioned.",
        "We also observed that our subjects didn't always agree on the classification of a given definite; the problem was especially acute for bridging descriptions.",
        "In this paper, we present an implemented system for processing definite descriptions based on the results of that earlier study.",
        "In our system, techniques for recognising discourse-new descriptions play a role as important as techniques for identifying the antecedent of anaphoric ones.",
        "The system also incorporates robust techniques for processing bridging descriptions.",
        "A fundamental characteristic of our system is that it was developed so that its performance could be evaluated using the annotated corpus.",
        "In the paper, we discuss how we arrived at the optimal version of the system by measuring the performance of each method in this way.",
        "Because of the problems observed in our previous study concerning agreement between annotators, we evaluated the system both by measuring precision/recall against a 'gold stan-dard' and by measuring the agreement between the annotation it produces and the annotators."

      "text": [
        "At the moment, the only systems engaged in semantic interpretation whose performance can be evaluated on fairly unrestricted text such as the Wall Street Journal articles are based on a shallow-processing approach, i.e., that do not rely on extensive amounts of hand-coded commonsense knowledge (Carter, 1987; Appelt, 1995; Humphreys et al., 1998).1 Our system is of this type: it only relies on structural information, on the information provided by pm-existing lexical sources such as Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998), on minimal amounts of general hand-coded information, and on information that can be acquired automatically from a corpus.",
        "Although we believe that quantitative evaluations of the performance of a system on a large number of examples are the only true assessment of its performance, and therefore a shallow processing approach is virtually unavoidable for implemented systems until better sources of commonsense knowledge become available, we do know that this approach limits the performance of a system on those instances of definite descriptions which do require commonsense knowledge for their resolution.",
        "(We grouped these in what we call the 'bridging' class.)",
        "We",
        "nevertheless developed heuristic techniques for processing these types of definites as well, which may provide a baseline against which the gains in performance due to the use of commonsense knowledge can be assessed more clearly.",
        "Our system attempts to classify each definite description as either DIRECT ANAPHORA, DISCOURSE-NEW, and BRIDGING DESCRIPTION.",
        "'1'he first class includes definite descriptions whose head is identical to that of their antecedent, as in a house the house.",
        "The second includes definite descriptions that refer to objects not already mentioned in the text and not related to any such object.",
        "(Some of these definite descriptions refer to objects whose existence is widely known, such as discourse-initial references to the pope; other instances of discourse-new descriptions refer to objects that can be assumed to be unique, even if unfamiliar, such as the first woman to climb all Scottish Mumps.)",
        "Plurally, we classify as bridging descriptions all definite descriptions whose resolution deponds on knowledge of relations between objects, such as definite descriptions that refer to an object related to an entity already introduced in the discourse by a relation other than identity (Prince's `inferrables'), as in the flat ... the living mom; and definite descriptions that refer an object already introduced, but using a different predicate, as in the car ...the vehicle.",
        "In addition to this classification, the system tries to identify the antecedents of anaphoric descriptions and the anchors (Fraurud, 1990) of bridging ones.",
        "Accordingly, we developed three types of heuristics:",
        "• for resolving directly anaphoric descriptions.",
        "These include heuristics for dealing with segmentation and to handle modification.",
        "• for identifying discourse-new descriptions.",
        "Some of these heuristics attempt to recognize semantically functional definite descriptions (Hawkins, 1978; Loebner, 1987), whereas others try to recognize definite descriptions that are anchored via their modification (Clark and Marshall, 1981; Prince, 1981).",
        "• for identifying the anchor of a bridging description and the semantic relation between the bridging description and its anchor.",
        "WordNet is accessed, and heuristics for named entity recognition were also developed.",
        "The final configuration of the system was arrived at on the basis of an extensive evaluation of the heuristics using the corpus annotated in our previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).",
        "The evaluation was used both to determine which version of each heuristic worked better, and to identify the best order in which to try them.",
        "The corpus we used consists of 34 texts from the Penn Treebank I included in the Act./pci (Thrum.",
        "20 of these texts were treated as 'training corpus'; this corpus contains 1040 definite descriptions, of which 312 are anaphoric, 492 discourse-new, and 204 bridging.",
        "14 more texts were used as 'test corpus'; these include 464 definite descriptions, of which 154 have been classified as anaphoric, 218 as discourse-new, and 81 as bridging."

        "Segmentation In general, discourse entities have lifespans limited to pragmatically determined seG., MENTS that may be nested (see, e.g., (Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Fox, 1987)).",
        "E.g., in our corpus we found that about 10% of direct anaphoric definite descriptions have more than one possible antecedent if segmentation is not taken into account (Vieira and Poesio, 1999).",
        "Recognizing the hierarchical structure of segments in a text is, however-, still pretty much an open problem, as it involves reasoning about intentions;2 better results have been achieved on the simpler task of 'chunking' the text into approximate segments, generally by means of lexical density measures (Hearst, 1997) .",
        "In fact, the methods to limit the lifespan of discourse entity we considered for our system were even simpler.",
        "One type of heuristics we looked at are window-based techniques, i.e., considering as potential antecedents only the discourse entities within fixed-size windows of previous sentences, allowing however for some discourse entities to take a longer life span: we call this method LOOSE SEGMENTATION.",

        "We knew from the start that in general, a system can only resolve certain types of bridging descriptions when supplied with an adequate knowledge base; in fact, the typical way of implementing a system for resolving bridging references has been to restrict the domain and feed the system with hand-coded world knowledge (see, e.g., (Sidner, 1979) and especially (Carter, 1987)).",
        "Furthermore, the relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex (Clark, 1977; Sidner, 1979; Prince, 1981; Strand, 1996) and our own results indicate that the same description may relate to different anchors in a text, which makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).",
