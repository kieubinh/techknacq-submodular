      "text": [
        "Previous work on anaphora resolution has yielded a rich basis of theories and heuristics for finding antecedents.",
        "However, most research to date has neglected an important potential cue that is only available in spoken data: prosody.",
        "Prosodic marking can be used to change the antecedent of a pronoun, as demonstrated by this classic example from I ,akoll (1971) (capitals indicate a pitch accent):",
        "(I) John; called Jima a Republican, then he; insulted hi m1.",
        "(2) John;; called Jinn a Republican, then Bhij insulted",
        "But exactly how the antecedent changes due to the prosodic marking on the pronoun, and whether this effect happens consistently, is an open question.",
        "If consistent effects do exist, they would be useful for online pronoun interpretation in spoken dialog systems.",
        "Prosodic prominence directs the attention of the listener to what is important for understanding and interpretation.",
        "But how should this principle be applied when words that are normally not very prominent, such as pronouns, are accented?",
        "More generally, does acoustic marking provide systematic cues to characteristics of antecedents?",
        "More specifically, does it imply that the antecedent is \"unusual\" in some way'?",
        "These are the two hypotheses we investigate in this paper.",
        "Our data consists of 322 pronouns from a large corpus of spontaneous task-oriented dialog, the TRAINS93 corpus (Hecman and Allen, 1995).",
        "This corpus allows us to study pronouns as they occur in spontaneous unscripted discourse, and is one of the very few speech corpora to have been annotated with pronoun interpretation information.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we summarize relevant work on pronoun resolution and report on the few proposals for integrating prosody into pronoun resolution algorithms.",
        "Next, in Section 3, we present the dialogs used for our study and the attributes available in the annotation data, while Section 4 describes the acoustic measures that were computed automatically from the data.",
        "Section 5 explores whether there are systematic correlations between these properties and the acoustic measures fundamental frequency, duration, and intensity.",
        "For these measures, we find that most correlations are in fact due to speaker variation, and that speakers differ greatly in their overall prosodic characteristics.",
        "Finally, we investigate whether it is possible to use these acoustic features to predict properties of the antecedent using logistic regression.",
        "Again, we do not find acoustic features to be reliable predictors for the features of interest.",
        "Therefore, we conclude in Section 6 that acoustic measures cannot be used in speaker–independent online anaphora resolution algorithms to predict the features under investigation here."

        "There is a rich literature on resolving personal pronouns.",
        "Many approaches are based On a notion of attentional focus.",
        "Entities in attentional focus are highly salient, and pronouns are assumed to refer to the most salient entity in the discourse (cf. (Brennan et al., 1987; Az-zam et al., 1998; Strube, 1998)).",
        "Centering (Grosz et al., 1995) is a framework for predicting local attentional focus.",
        "It assumes that the most salient entity from sentence Sn_l that is realized in sentence S„ is most likely to be pronominalized in S„.",
        "That entity is termed the CI) (backward-looking center) of sentence S„.",
        "Finding the preferred ranking criteria is an active area of research.",
        "Byron and Stein (1998) adapted this approach, which had previously been applied to text, for spoken dialogs, but with limited success.",
        "In contrast to personal pronouns, demonstratives do not rely on calculations of salience.",
        "In fact, Linde (1979) found that while it was preferred for entities within the",
        "current local focus, that was used for items outside the current focus of attention.",
        "Passonneau (1989) showed that personal and demonstrative pronouns are used in contrasting situations: personal pronouns are preferred when both the pronoun and its antecedent are in subject position, while demonstrative pronouns are preferred when either the pronoun or its antecedent is not in subject position.",
        "She also found that personal pronouns tend to co-specify with pronouns or base noun phrases; the more clause or sentence-like the antecedent, the more likely the speaker is to choose a demonstrative pronoun.",
        "Pronoun resolution algorithms tend not to cover demonstratives.",
        "Notable exceptions are Webber's model for discourse deixis (Webber, 1991) and the model developed for spoken dialog by Eckert and Strube (1999).",
        "This algorithm encompasses both personal and demonstrative pronouns and exploits their contrastive usage patterns, relying on syntactic clues and verb suhcategorizations as input.",
        "Neither study investigated the influence of prosodic prominence on resolution.",
        "Most previous work on prosody and pronoun resolution has focussed on pitch accents and third person singular pronouns that co-specify with persons.",
        "Nakatani (1997) examined the antecedents of personal pronouns in a 20-minute narrative monologue.",
        "She found that pronouns tend to be accented if they occur in subject position, and if the backward-looking center (Grosz et al., 1995) was shifted to the referent of that pronoun.",
        "She then extended this result to a general theory of the interaction between prominence and discourse structure.",
        "Calm (1995) discusses accented pronouns on the basis of a theory about accentual correlates of salience.",
        "Kameyama (1998) interprets a pitch accent on pronouns in the framework of the alternative semantics (Rooth, 1992) theory of focus.",
        "She assumes that all potential antecedents are stored in a list.",
        "Pronouns are then resolved to the most preferred antecedent on that list which is syntactically and semantically compatible with the pronoun.",
        "Preference is modeled by an ordering on the set of antecedents.",
        "An accent on the pronoun signals that pronoun resolution should not be based on the default ordering, where the default is computed by a number of interacting syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and attentional constraints.",
        "Compared to he and she, it and that have been somewhat neglected.",
        "There are two reasons for this: First, it is not considered to be as accentable as he and she by native speakers of both British and American English, whereas that is more likely than it to bear a pitch accent.",
        "An informal study of the London-Lund corpus of spoken British English (Svartvik, 1990) confirmed that observation.",
        "Second, that frequently does not have a co-specifying NP antecedent, and most research on co-specification has focussed on pronouns and NPs.",
        "Work on accented demonstratives and pronoun resolution is extremely scarce.",
        "Pioneering studies were conducted by Fretheim and his collaborators.",
        "They tested the effect of accented sentence-initial demonstratives that co-specify with the preceding sentence on the resolution of ambiguous personal pronouns, and found that the pronoun antecedents switched when the demonstrative was accented (Fretheim et al., 1997).",
        "However, to our knowledge, there arc no studies that compare the co-specification preferences of accented vs. unaccented demonstratives."
