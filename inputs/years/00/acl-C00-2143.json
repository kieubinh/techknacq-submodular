        "The present paper describes a project aimed at developing the first annotated corpus of Russian texts.",
        "Large text corpora have been used in the computational linguistics community long enough: at present, over 20 large corpora for the main European languages arc available, the largest of them containing hundreds of millions of words (Language Resources (1997); Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993); Kurohashi, Nagao (1998)).",
        "So far, however, no annotated corpora for Russian have been developed.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the present project is the first attempt to fill the gap.",
        "Different tasks require different annotation levels that entail different amount of additional information about text structure.",
        "The corpus that is being created in the framework of the present project consists of several subcorpora that differ by the level of annotation.",
        "The following three levels arc envisaged:",
        "• lemmatized texts: for every word, its normal form (lemma) and part of speech arc indicated; • moiphologically tagged texts: for every word, a full set of morphological attributes is specified along with the lemma and the part of speech; • syntactically tagged texts: apart from the full morphological markup at the word level, every sentence has a syntax structure.",
        "We annotate Russian texts with dependency structures – a formalism that is more suitable for Slavonic languages with their relatively free word order.",
        "The structure not only contains information on which words of the sentence are syntactically linked, but also relegates each link to one of the several dozen syntactic types (at present, we use 78 syntactic relations).",
        "This formalism ensures a more complete and informative representation than any other syntactically annotated corpus.",
        "This is a major innovation, since the majority of syntactically annotated corpora, both those already available and under construction, represent the syntactic structure by means of constituents.",
        "The closest analogue to our work is the Czech annotated corpus collected at Charles University in Prague – see I Iajicova, Panevova, Sgall (1998).",
        "In this corpus, the syntactic data are also expressed in a dependency formalism, although the set of syntactic functional relations is much smaller as it only has 23 relations In what follows, we describe the types of texts used to create the corpus (Section 2), markup format (Section 3), annotation tools and procedures (Section 4), and types of linguistic data included in the markup (Section 5)."

      "text": [
        "The design principles were formulated as follows:",
        "• \"layered\" markup -- several annotation levels coexist and can be extracted or processed independently; • incrementality – it should be easy to add higher annotation levels; • convenient parsing of the annotated text by means of standard software packages.",
        "The most natural solution to meet this criteria is an XML-based markup language.",
        "We have tried to make our format compatible with TEI (Text Encoding for Interchange, see TEI Guidelines (1994)), introducing new elements or attributes only in situations where TEI markup does not provide adequate means to describe the text structure in the dependency grammar framework.",
        "Listed below are types of information about text structure that must be encoded in the markup, and relative tags/attributes used to bear them.",
        "a) Splitting of text into sentences.",
        "A special container element <S> (available in TED is used to delimit sentence boundaries.",
        "The element may have an (optional) ID attribute that supplies a unique identifier for the sentence within the text; this identifier may be used to store information about extra-sentential relations in the text.",
        "It may also have a COMMENT attribute, used by linguists to store observations about particular syntactic phenomena encountered in the sentence; b) Splitting of sentences into lexical items (words).",
        "The words arc delimited by a container element <W>.",
        "Like sentences, words may have a unique ID attribute that is used to reference the word within the sentence;",
        "c) Ascribing morphological features to words.",
        "Morphological information is ascribed to the word by means of two attributes born by the <W> tag: LEMMA– a normalized word form; FEAT – morphological features.",
        "d) Storing information about the syntax structure.",
        "To annotate the information about syntactic dependencies, we use two other attributes in the <W> element: DOM– the ID of the master word; LINK – syntactic function label.",
        "There are also special provisions in the formalism to store auxiliary information, e.g. multiple morphological analyses and syntax trees.",
        "They are expected to disappear from the final version of the corpus."

        "The procedure of corpus data acquisition is semiautomatic.",
        "An initial version of markup is generated by a computer using a general purpose morphological analyzer and syntax parser engine; after that, the results of the automatic processing are submitted to human post-editing.",
        "The analysis engine (morphology and parsing) is based upon the ETAP-3 machine translation engine – see Apresjan et al.",
        "(1992, 1993).",
        "To support the creation of annotated data, a set of tools was designed and implemented.",
        "All tools arc Win32 applications written in C++.",
        "The tools available are:",
        "• a program for sentence boundaries markup, called Chopper; • a post-editor for building, editing and managing syntactically annotated texts – Structure Editor (or StrEd).",
        "The amount of manual work required to build annotations depends on the complexity of the input data.",
        "StrEd offers different options for building structures.",
        "Most sentences can be reliably processed without any human intervention; in this case, a linguist should look through the processing result and confirm it.",
        "If the structure contains errors, the linguist can edit it using a user-friendly graphical interface (see screenshots below).",
        "If the errors are too many or no structure could be produced, the linguist may use a special Aplit-ond•un mode.",
        "This mode includes manual prechunking of the input phrase into pieces with a more transparent structure and applying the analyzer/parser to every chunk.",
        "Then the linguist must manually link the subtrees produced for every chunk into a single structure.",
        "If the linguist has encountered a very peculiar syntactic construction so that he/she is uncertain",
        "about the correct structure, he/she may mark as \"doubtful\" the whole sentence or single words whose functions are not completely clear.",
        "The information will be stored in the markup, and StrEd will visualize the respective sentence as One in need for further editing.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 presents the main dialog window for editing sentence properties.",
        "An operator can edit the markup directly, or edit single properties using a graphical interlace.",
        "The source text under analysis is written in an edit window in the top: \"Vatic, pis'mo bylo podpisano, ja mgnovenno dogadalsja, kto ego napisal !Although the letter was not signed, I instantly guessed who had written it].",
        "The information about.",
        "single words is written into a list: e.g. the first word xotja although/ has an identifier 11D---.\" A.\"; the lemmatized form is XOTJA; its feature list consists of a single feature --- a part-of-speech characteristic (it is a conjunction); the word depends on ;t word with ID= \" 8 \" by an adverbial relation (link type is \"adverb\").",
        "Hy double-clicking au item in the word list or pressing the button, a linguist can invoke dialog windows for editing properties of single words.",
        "I lowever, the most convenient way of editing the structure consists in invoking a Tree Editor window, shown in Fig. 2 with the same sentence as in the previous picture.",
        "The Tree Editor interface is simple and natural.",
        "Words of the source sentence are written on the left, their lemmas arc put into gray rectangles, and their morphological features are written on the right.",
        "The syntactic relations are shown as arrows directed from the master to the slave; the link types are indicated in rounded rectangles on the arcs.",
        "All text fields except for the source sentence are editable in-place.",
        "Moreover, one can drag the rounded rectangles: dropping it on a word means that this word is declared a new master for the word from which the rectangle was dragged.",
        "A single right-button click on the lemma rectangle",

        "Links are binary and oriented; they link single words rather than syntactic groups.",
        "For every syntactic group, one word (head) is chosen to represent it as a slave in larger syntactic units; all other members of the group become slaves of the head.",
        "In a typical case, the number of nodes in the syntactic tree corresponds to the number of word tokens.",
        "However, several exceptional situations occur in which the number of nodes may be less or even greater than the number of word tokens.",
        "The latter case is especially interesting.",
        "We postulate such a description in the following cases: a) Copulative sentences in the present tense where the auxiliary verb can be omitted.",
        "This is treated as a special \"zero-form\" of the copula, e.g. On – uchitel' [He is a teacher, lit.",
        "He – teacher].",
        "The copula should be introduced in the syntactic representation.",
        "b) Elliptical constructs (omitted members of contrasted coordinative expressions), like in Ja kupil rubashku, a on galstuk [I bought a shirt, and he bought a necktie, lit.",
        "I bought a shirt, and he a necktie].",
        "The latter type of sentences should be discussed in more detail.",
        "Elliptical constructions are known to be one of the toughest problems in the formalization of natural language syntax.",
        "In our corpus, we decided to reconstruct the omitted elements in the syntactic trees, marking them with a special \"phantom\" feature.",
        "In the above example, a phantom node is inserted into the sentence between the words on 'he' and galstuk `necktie'.",
        "This new node will have a lemma POKUPAT° [BUY] arid will bear exactly the same morphological features as the wordform kupil [bought] physically present in the sentence, plus a special \"phantom\" marker.",
        "In certain cases, the feature set for the phantom may differ from that of the prototype, e.g. in a slightly modified phrase Ja kupil rubashku, a ona galstuk [I bought a shirt, and she (bought) a necktie] the phantom node will have the feminine gender, as required by the agreement with the subject of the second clause.",
        "Most real-life elliptical constructs can be represented in this way.",
        "The inventory of syntactic relationship types generated by the ETAP-3 system is vast enough: at present, we count 78 different syntactic function types.",
        "All relationships are divided into 6",
        "major groups: actant, attributive, quantitative, adverbial, coordinative, auxiliary.",
        "For readers' convenience, we will give equivalent English examples: Actant relationships link the predicate word to its arguments.",
        "Some examples ([X] – master, – slave): predicative – Pete [Y] reads [X]; completive (1, 2, 3) – translate [X] the book [Y, 1-comp]] from [Y1, 2-compl] English into [Y2, 3-compl] Russian Attributive relationships often link a noun to a modifier expressed by an adjectve, another noun, a participle clause, etc: relative – The house [X] we live[Y 1 in.",
        "Quantitative relationships link a noun to a word with quantity semantics, or two such words one to another: quantitative -- five [Y] pages [X]; auxiliary-quantitative – thirty [Y] five [X]; Adverbial relationships link the predicate word to various adverbial modifiers: adverbial – come [X] in the evening [Y]; parenthetic – In my opinion [Y], that's [X1 right.",
        "Coordinative relationships serve for clauses coordinated by conjunctions: coordinative – buy apples [X] and pears[Y] ; coordinative-conjunctive unctive – buy apples and [X] pears [Y].",
        "Auxiliary relationships typically link two elements that form a single syntactic unit: analytical – will [X] buy [Y]; The list of syntactic relations is not closed.",
        "The process of data acquisition brings up a variety of rare syntactic constructions, hardly covered by traditional grammars.",
        "In some cases, this has led to the introduction of new syntactic link types in order to reflect the semantic relation between single words and make the syntactic structure unambiguous."
