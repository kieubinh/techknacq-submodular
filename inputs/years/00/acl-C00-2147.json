        "Multilingual information extraction (MUC6), summarization (AAAI 98).",
        "and cross-language information retrieval (Harman, 1995) have over the past three or four years become emerging technologies which are being driven in part by the development of the WWW, and also by the general availability of machine readable texts in many languages.",
        "It appeared to the authors that an interesting application could be built which demonstrated an integrated use of these technologies in combination with a variety of machine translation techniques.",
        "The system we describe here has as its central component a multilingual information extraction engine, which uses an ontology as its main controlling element.",
        "Extraction based summarization produces summaries, either in tabular form, or by generating sentences using structured information derived from texts.",
        "Summaries of this type are focused on whatever events, the underlying extraction system handles.",
        "The summaries are informative in nature.",
        "That is they provide specific facts which may allow a user to gain sufficient information without reference to the original documents.",
        "The potential applications are: producing personal profiles, assuming a series of documents on an individual are available over time; tracking complex events, assuming a script is available which describes the event in terms of simpler events; and monitoring for single event types in a data stream.",
        "This is the application we focus on in this paper.",
        "The method is particularly promising for texts in multiple languages as the structured information produced by information extraction is relatively easy to translate.",
        "The principle drawback is that an information extraction system of this kind needs such expensive resources as ontology (one for all languages) and otological lexicons (one per language).",
        "The development of the system itself is not expensive, if we can get these resources.",
        "The extraction method described here is based on the Mikrokosmos ontology (Mahesh, 1995), and uses the concepts in the ontology both to define an extraction template and to control the extraction process.",
        "At present the only information used from the Mikrokosmos lexicons.",
        "which supply language specific semantic and syntactic subcategorization information, is the mapping from a citation form to an ontological concept.",
        "The complete system is composed of many preexisting components and has been tested using two weeks of news from English, Spanish, Russian, and Japanese newspapers.",
        "We first give an overview of the steps used to generate an event based cross-document summary."

      "heading": "2 Overview of Processing",
      "text": [
        "The system uses a set of preexisting modules.",
        "These are: automatic language/codeset recognition for a text (Ludovik et al., 1999), sentence based summarization (biased towards domain keywords) (Cowie et al.., 1998), part of speech tagging, noun phrase recognition, proper name recognition and classification (Cowie et al.",
        "1993; Cowie, 1996), ontology based extraction, translation of the final filled template to English, and output generation.",
        "Additional document and template filters have been added at the front and back ends of the system to reduce the amount of text to be processed and to remove templates which are only sparsely filled.",
        "For example, when a text is gathered in Spanish by the web spider it will be checked to see if any of the person names of interest occur in the document using a list of names in Spanish.",
        "If this is the case the document is then part-of-speech tagged and noun phrases and proper names are recognized.",
        "In the present system proper names are handled using a table lookup process, rather than a more complex (and accurate) pattern based method.",
        "The ontology based extraction fills out the slots to produce a completed template.",
        "This is then translated by looking up words in the lexicon and by transliterating, or translating, proper names.",
        "The completed template is then stored with references to the original document.",
        "A set of templates are then used to produce one of a variety of reports either for all events or for a single event type.",
        "These can be sorted on the different slots in the template.",
        "A table is then produced using HTML containing links to each original document, to document summarization and translation tools, and the slot fillers from each template.",
        "In the rest of this paper we focus on the configurable extraction method, the preliminary tests carried out on the system, and we close with a discussion on the improvements to resources and tools needed to make this a robust and useful technology."

        "To perform an extraction, after the phrase recognition step, each headword in a sentence is looked up in the lexicon and its associated concepts found.",
