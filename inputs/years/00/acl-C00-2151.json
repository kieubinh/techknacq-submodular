        "Natural language utterances usually unfold over time, i. e., both listening and reading are carried out in an incremental left-to-right manner.",
        "Modeling a similar type of behaviour in computer-based solutions is a challenging and particularly interesting task for a number of quite different reasons that are most relevant in the context of spoken language systems:",
        "• Without any external signals about the end of an utterance, incremental analysis is the only means to segment the incoming stream of speech input.",
        "• An incremental analysis mode provides for a more natural (mixed-initiative) dialogue behaviour because partial results are already available well before the end of an utterance.",
        "• Parsing may already take place in concurrency to sentence production.",
        "Therefore the speaking time becomes available as computing time.",
        "• Dynamic expectations about the upcoming parts of the utterance might be derived right in time to provide guiding hints for other processing components, e. g., predictions about likely word forms for a speech recognizer (Hauenstein and Weber, 1994).",
        "In principle, two alternative strategies can be pursued when designing an incremental parsing procedure:",
        "1.",
        "To keep open all necessary structural hypotheses required to accomodate every possible continuation of an utterance.",
        "Tins is the strategy usually adopted in an incremental chart parser (Wiren, 1992).",
        "2.",
        "To commit to one or a limited number of interpretations where (a) either this commitment is made rather early and a mechanism for partial reanalysis is provided (Lombardo, 1992) or (b) it is delayed until sufficient information is eventually available to take an ultimate decision (Marcus, 1987).",
        "The apparent efficiency of human language understanding is usually attributed to an early commitment strategy.",
        "Our approach, in fact, represents an attempt to combine these two strategies: On the one hand, it keeps many of the available building blocks for the initial part of an utterance and passes an (updated) search space to the following processing step.",
        "Additionally, the optimal structural description for the data already available is determined.",
        "Tins not only makes an actual interpretation (together with expectations for possible continuations) available to subsequent processing components, but also opens up the possibility to use this information to effectively constrain the set of new structural hypotheses.",
        "Determining the optimal interpretation for a yet incomplete sentence, however, requires a parsing approach robust enough to analyse an arbitrary sentence prefix into a meaningful structure.",
        "Therefore two closely related questions need to be raised:",
        "1.",
        "Can the necessary degree of robustness be achieved?",
        "2.",
        "Is the information contained in the currently optimal structure useful to guide the subsequent analysis?",
        "To answer these questions and to estimate the potential for search space reductions against a possible loss of accuracy, a series of experiments has been conducted.",
        "Sections 2 and 3 introduce and motivate the framework of the experiments.",
        "Section 4 describes a number of heuristics for reuse of previous solutions and Section 5 presents the results.",
        "2 Robust Parsing in a Dependency Framework Our grammar models utterances as dependency trees, which consist of pairs of words so that one depends directly on the other.",
        "This subordination relation can be qualified by a label (e. g. to distinguish complements from modifiers).",
        "Since each word can only depend on one other word, a labeled tree is formed, usually with the finite verb as its root.",
        "The decision on which structure to postulate for an utterance is guided by explicit constraints, which are represented as universally quantified logical formulas about features of word forms and partial trees.",
        "For instance, one constraint might postulate that a relation labeled as 'Subject' can only occur between a noun and a finite verb to its right, or that two different dependencies of the same verb may not both be labeled 'Subject'.",
        "For efficiency reasons, these formulas may constrain individual dependency edges or pairs of edges only.",
        "The application of constraints can begin as soon as the first word of an utterance is read; no global information about the utterance is required for analysis of its beginning.",
        "Since natural language input will often exhibit irregularities such as restarts, repairs, hesitations and other grammatical errors, individual errors should not make further analysis impossible.",
        "Instead, a robust parser should continue to build a structure for the utterance.",
        "Ideally, this structure should be close to that of a similar, but grammatical utterance.",
        "This goal is attained by annotating the constraints that constitute the grammar with scores ranging from 0 to 1.",
        "A structure that violates one or more constraints is annotated with the product of the corresponding scores, and the structure with the highest combined score is defined as the solution of the parsing problem.",
        "In general, the higher the scores of the constraints, the more irregular constructions can be analysed.",
        "Parsing an utterance with annotated or soft constraints thus amounts to multidimensional optimization.",
        "Both complete and heuristic search methods can be employed to solve such a problem.",
        "Our robust approach also provides an easy way to implement partial parsing.",
        "If necessary, e. g., an isolated noun labeled as 'Subject' may form the root of a dependency tree, although this would violate the first constraint mentioned above.",
        "If a finite verb is available, however, subordinating the noun under the verb will avoid the error and thus produce a better structure.",
        "This capability is crucial for the analysis of incomplete utterances.",
        "Different levels of analysis can be defined to model syntactic as well as semantic structures.",
        "A dependency tree is constructed for each of these levels.",
        "Since constraints can relate the edges in parallel dependency trees to each other, having several trees contributes to the robustness of the approach.",
        "Altogether, the grammar used in the experiments described comprises 12 levels of analysis and 490 constraints (Schroder et al., 2000)."

        "An incomplete prefix can be analyzed directly if a grammar is robust enough to allow partial parsing as discussed in the previous section: If the constraint that forbids multiple trees receives a severe but non-zero penalty, missing governors or complements are acceptable as long as no better structure is possible.",
        "Experiments in prefix parsing using a dependency grammar of German have shown that even complex utterances with nested subclauses can be analysed in the second way.",
        "Figure la provides an example of this: Because the infinitive verb `ausmachen' is not yet visible, its complement 'Termin' is analysed as an isolated subtree, and the main verb `lassen' is lacking a complement.",
        "After the missing verb has been read, two additional dependency edges suffice to build the correct structure from the partial parse.",
        "This method allows direct comparison between incremental and non-incremental parser runs, since both methods use the same grammar.",

        "The runtime required by the incremental procedure as a percentage of the time required by the non-incremental search algorithm is given as the white bar.",

As expected, a trade-off between computing time and quality can be found.",

        ", 0,-.",
        "(-;i, ,,-... , g N: ,- ir ii'l ...' ar=q: nTime for incremental compared to non-incremental method",
        "The results available so far confirm the initial expectation that the grammar used is robust enough to reliably carry out such a prefix analysis, although it has originally been developed for the non-incremental case.",
        "The optimal structure as determined by the parser obviously contains relevant information about the sentence prefix, so that even very simple and cheap heuristics can achieve a considerable level of accuracy.",
        "Therefore, large parts of the search space can be excluded from repeated reanalysis, which eventually makes it even faster than its non-incremental counterpart.",
        "Most importantly, the observed speedup grows with the length of the utterance.",
        "On the other hand, none of the used structure-based heuristics produces a significant improvement of quality even if a large amount of computational resources is spent.",
        "Quite a number of cases can be identified where even the most expensive of our heuristics is not strong enough, e. g., the German sentence with a topicalized direct object: DieNom ,ACC: Frau sieht der,,,„„ Mann.",
        "The woman sees the man.",
        "The woman, the man sees.",
        "Here, when analysing the subsentence die Frau sieht, the parser will wrongly consider die Frau as the subject, because it appears to have the right case and there is a clear preference to do so.",
        "Later, when the next word comes in, there is no way to allow for die Frau to change its structural interpretation, because this is not licensed by any of the given heuristics.",
        "Therefore, substantially more problem-oriented heuristics are required, which should take into account not only the optimal structure, but also the conflicts caused by it.",
        "Using a weak but cheap heuristics, a fast approximation of the optimal structure can be obtained within a very restricted search space, and then refined by subsequent structural transformations (Foth et al., 2000).",
        "To a certain degree this resembles the idea of applying reason maintenance techniques for conflict resolution in incremental parsing (Wiren, 1990).",
        "In deciding which strategy is good enough to find the necessary first approximation the results of this paper might play a crucial role, since the possible contribution of individual heuristics in such an extended framework can be precisely estimated."
