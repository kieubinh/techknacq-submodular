        "The World Wide Web (13erners-Lee, 1989) seems to be an ideal environment Lr machine translation: it is easily accessible around the world using freely-available, easy-to-use tools which are available to persons speaking a myriad of languages, all of whom would like to be able to communicate with one another without language barriers.",
        "It is therefore not too surprising that a few companies have attempted to make machine translation available in this medium (AltaVista, 1.999; FreeTranslation, 1999; interTran, 1999).",
        "The primary use identified for these translators has been that of translating Web pages or amusing oneself with the inadequacies of machine translation (Yang and Lange, 1998).",
        "What these systems cannot be used for is real-time, speech-to-speech communication with translation.",
        "Real-time communication over the Internet has more properly been the domain of \"chat\" protocols: primarily Internet Relay Chat (IRC) (Oikarinen and Reed, 1993), and similar instant messaging protocols developed commercially (America Online Inc., 2000; Microsoft Corp., 2000; ICQ Inc., 1999).",
        "While some portals have been developed to permit access to chat using the Web (iTRIBE Inc., 1996), the primary point of access seems to be chat-specific client software.",
        "Although chat defines protocols and provides infrastructure, it is limited in the kind of data that it can transport, and client software is tightly focussed on the text domain.",
        "Such limitations have not, however, prevented researchers from experimenting with the possibilities of incorporating machine translation or speech into the chat experience (Lenzo, 1998; Seligman et al., 1998).",
        "The outcome of these experiments has been to show that commercial machine translation systems may be reasonably integrated into the chat room, and that commercial speech software can be connected to existing chat software to provide the desired experience.",
        "We have taken a different road.",
        "It has been noted (Seligman, 1997; Frederking et al., 2000) that broad-coverage machine translation and speech recognition cannot now be useful unless users can interact with the system to improve results.",
        "While Seligman et al.",
        "(1998) were able to effect user editing of speech recognition by editing text before submitting it for translation, they were unable to do the same for the translation system, primarily due to limitations of commercial software.",
        "Additional limitations are encountered in the communication medium: chat is not amenable to non-text interaction with translation agents, and commercial chat software does not, in any case, support such interaction.",
        "To deal with these limitations, we have developed a fully interactive, Web-based, chat-style translation system, supporting speech recognition and synthesis, local or third-party correction of speech recognition and machine translation, and online learning, Av hich can be used with nothing more than a Web browser and some simple add-ons.",
        "All intensive processing, including translation and speech recognition is performed at central servers, permitting access for those with limited computational resources.",
        "In addition, the modular design of the system and interface permit computational tasks to be easily distributed and different dialog configurations to be explored."

        "5.",
        "Both sides of the conversation are tracked automatically for all users, and displayed on their interfaces.",
        "Although the above is the original vision for the system, other configurations are easily imagined.",

        "Many changes of this nature are handled by easy modifications to the HTML code for given Web pages.",
        "More complicated tasks may be accomplished by modifications of underlying code.",
        "In order to produce the above configuration, the current system implements two user interfaces (Uls): the Client UI, which provides speech and text input capabilities to the primary end-users of the system; and the Editor UI, which provides translation editing capabilities to a. human translation expert.",

        "The Editor UI may be configured so that either of the two users, or a remote third party can act as editor.",

        "• The MT system provides for online updates of its knowledge base which allows for translations to improve over time.",
        "In order to take advantage of these capabilities, we have designed two editing tools, the chart editor and always-active learning, that enable a human expert to rapidly produce an accurate translation and to store that translation in the MT knowledge base for future use.",
        "As discussed in §3.2, our MT system may produce more than one translation for each part of the input, from which it attempts to select the best translation.",
        "The entire set of translations is available to the WebDIPLOMAT system, and is used in the chart editor.",
        "By double-clicking on words in the translation, the",
        "human editor is presented a popup-menu of alternative translations beginning at a particular location in the sentence (see Figure 2).",
        "When one of the alternatives is selected, it replaces the original word or words.",
        "in this way, a sentence may be rapidly edited to an acceptable state.",
        "In order to reduce development time, our MT system can be used in a rapid-deployment style: after a minimal knowledge base is constructed, the system is put into use with a human expert supervising, 50 that domain-relevant data may be elicited quickly.",
        "In order to support this, all utterances are considered for learning.",
        "When the editor presses the 'Accept/Learn' button, the original utterance and its translation are examined to determine if they are suitable for learning.",
        "Currently all utterances for which the forward translation has been edited are submitted for learning, although other criteria may also be entertained.",
        "More detail about online learning may be found in 10.2.",
        "Although the editor 1JI is primarily intended for use by a translation expert, it will sometimes also be used by those who are not as expert.",
        "For this situation, we have introduced a backtranslation capability which retranslates the edited forward translation into the language of the input.",
        "Although imperfect, backtranslation can often give the user all idea of whether the forward.",
