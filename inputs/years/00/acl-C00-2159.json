        "A parallel corpus is an important resource for corpus-based approaches to CLIR.",
        "These approaches use parallel corpora as statistical training data and then retrieve documents written in a language different from that of the query.",
        "One disadvantage of these approaches is lack of resources.",
        "Parallel corpora are not always readily available and those that are available tend to be relatively small or to cover only a small number of subjects.",
        "A bilingual comparable corpus is a set of texts in two different languages from the same domain or on the same topic.",
        "Unlike a parallel corpus it is composed independently in the respective language text sets.",
        "It can be more readily obtained from the Internet or CD-ROM resources than parallel corpora.",
        "Zanettin (1998) introduced several available bilingual comparable corpora such as news paper articles selected by dates and subject codes, medical articles from journals and textbooks, and articles for tourists from brochures and guides.",
        "Zanettin (1994) also reported that it is highly likely that much relevant information can be found across languages in a topic-related bilingual comparable corpus.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for extracting bilingual text pairs which share the same information from a bilingual comparable corpus, and show the possibility that the resulting bilingual text pairs can be useful for corpus-based CLIR approaches when we use them as training data instead of a parallel corpus.",
        "Sheridan (1998) also proposed an approach to building multilingual test collection from comparable corpora consisting of news articles.",
        "The idea is to reduce the work of manual relevance judgements by restricting news articles to be examined to a couple of days.",
        "Disadvantages to this approach are that it relies on time-sensitive texts, texts obtained by this approach are constrained to referencing specific events, and nontrivial work by humans is still necessary.",
        "On the other hand, our goal is to extract bilingual text pairs automatically from any kind of bilingual comparable corpora.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the basic idea for extracting relevant text pairs from a bilingual comparable corpus.",
        "Our method is based on a corpus-based CLIR method, so we overview previous corpus-based CUR approaches in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes an experimental procedure, the results it produced, and an analysis of the results.",
        "The conclusion is given in Section 5."

        "As we will describe in Section 3, several CLIR approaches that rely on parallel corpora have been proposed and lead to successful retrieval results.",
        "In those approaches, a parallel corpus used as training data should be large enough to obtain good retrieval results.",
        "Although we use a CLIR method which relies on a parallel corpus, we begin with a very small parallel corpus.",
        "We retrieve bilingual text pairs from a bilingual comparable corpus using the small parallel corpus as training data.",
        "Then we concatenate the text pairs to the initial small parallel corpus and grow the parallel corpus by iterating the retrieval and concatenation processes (Figure 1).",
        "This kind of bootstrapping method has a problem, however: It is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the text pairs obtained in the early stages of the iterations.",
        "In order to solve this problem, we concatenate only a small number of the most \"reliable\" text pairs to the initial parallel corpus in the early stages, then gradually increase the number of the text pairs which are concatenated to the initial parallel corpus.",
        "We will describe the details of the method in Section"

        "Another approach that relies on a parallel corpus has been suggested by Dunning and Davis (1993).",

      "text": [
        "For our bootstrapping method, we adopted a CLIR method which is based on the Information Mapping approach (Masuichi et al., 1999).",
        "Information Mapping is basically a variant of the vector space model, and is based on an approach first proposed by Schiltze (1995).",
        "The approach is closely related to Latent Semantic indexing, and the difference between these two is discussed in Schiitze and Pedersen (1997).",
        "Note that our bootstrapping method does not depend on any particular properties of the Information Mapping approach, so it could employ other corpus-based CLIR methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing.",
        "Information Mapping begins with a large word-by-word matrix.",
        "A list of n content-bearing words and in vocabulary words correspond to the columns and the rows of the matrix.",
        "The most frequently appearing n words in a training corpus are selected as content-bearing words and the most frequently appearing in words as vocabulary words.",
        "Each cell of the matrix holds the number of total cooccurrences between a content-bearing word and a vocabulary word in the training corpus.",
        "In this way, an n-dimensional vector which represents the word's distributional behavior is produced for each vocabulary word.",
        "Then the original n-dimensional vector space is converted into a condensed, lower-dimensional, real-valued matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Berry, 1992).",
        "The lower-dimensional vector space is called word space.",
        "A document vector and a query vector are calculated by summing the vectors corresponding to the vocabulary words in the document or the query, and the proximity between the two vectors is defined as the cosine of the angle between them.",
        "To apply this method to CLIR, we regard each translation pair in a training parallel corpus of language L1 and L2 as a single compound document and create a word-byword matrix and then a word space.",
        "The word space represents a language independent vector space for vocabulary words in both 1,1 and L2, and therefore query and document vectors in both L1 and L2 can be calculated and compared in the same word space."
