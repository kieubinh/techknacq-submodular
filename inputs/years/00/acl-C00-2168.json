      "text": [
        "In general, the issue of the selection of parameters for grammar acquisition is one of the main problems for which there is no single answer.",
        "Parameters applicable to more than one language are studied in the field of language universals as well as the principles-and-parameters approach (Chomsky 1981) and its successors (Chomsky 1995).",
        "Widely devised as the basis of universal grammar, the principles-and-parameters approach has focused on the universality of certain formal grammatical rules within that particular approach rather on the substantive and exhaustive list of universal parameters, a subset of which is applicable to each natural language, a lora!, with their corresponding sets of values, such as a parameter set of nominal cases.",
        "In some other approaches, parameters and parameter values are either not sought out or are expected to be obtained automatically (e.g. Brown et al.",
        "1990; Goldstein 1998), and, while holding promise for the future as a potential component of an elicitation system, cannot, at this time, form the basis of an entire system of this kind.",
        "In order to ensure uniformity and systematicity of operation of a language knowledge elicitation system, such as Boas, it is desirable to come up with a comprehensive list of all possible parameters in natural languages and, for each such parameter, to create a cumulative list of its possible values in all the languages that Boas can expect as SLs.",
        "Three basic methodological approaches are used in Boas.",
        "Expectation-driven methodology: covering the material by collecting cross-linguistic information on lexical and grammatical parameters, including their possible values and realizations, and asking the user to choose what holds in SL; while it is beyond the means of the current project to check all extant languages for possible new parameters, we have included information from 25 languages.",
        "Goal-driven methodology: in the spirit of the \"demand-side\" approach to NLP (Nirenburg 1996) Boas was tailored for elicitation of MT relevant parameters rather than any syntactic parameters that can be postulated.",
        "A parameter was considered to be relevant if it was necessary for the parser and the generator used in MT in the Expedition project (http://crl.NMSU.Edu/ expedition/).",
        "The parser used is a heuristic clause chunker developed at NMSU CRI., which replaces the complex system of phrase structure rules in a traditional grammar and uses language specific information, among them word order (SVO vs. SOV), clause element (subject, object, etc.)",
        "marking, agreement marking, noun phrase structure pattern, position of a head.",
        "• Data-driven methodology: prompting the user by English words and phrases and requesting translations or other renderings in SI., data-driven acquisition is the first choice, wherever feasible, because it is the easiest type of work for the usersi; In Boas, data-driven acquisition is guided by the resident English knowledge sources."

        "The parameters which are elicited through the syntax module of Boas include' what we call diagnostic and restricting parameters.",
        "Diagnostic parameters are those whose values help determine clause structure for correct structural transfer and translation of clause constituents.",
        "For example, in languages which use grammatical case, the subject is usually marked by the nominative, ergative or absolutive case; direct objects are usually marked by the accusative case, etc.",
        "The list of the currently used diagnostic parameters in Boas includes: basic sentence structure parameters: word order preferences, grammatical functions (subject marking direct object marking, indirect object marking, complement marking, adverbial marking, verb marking), clause element agreement marking, clause boundary marking, and basic noun phrase structure parameters: POS patterns with head marking, phrase boundary marking, noun phrase component agreement Restricting parameters determine the scope of usage of diagnostic parameters.",
        "Some of the diagnostic parameter values can only occur simultaneously with certain restricting parameter values.",
        "For example, in languages with the ergative construction the case of grammatical subject is restricted by the tense and aspect of the main verb (Ma chuk 1998).",
