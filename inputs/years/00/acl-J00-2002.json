        "An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities.",
        "To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text.",
        "One way to think of this problem is in terms of the notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents are selected from a graphical context.",
        "Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities.",
        "Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic.",
        "In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined as a set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics.",
        "Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages.",

        "In this paper a model for the resolution of multimodal references is presented.",
        "This is the problem of finding the referent of a symbol in one modality using information present either in the same or in other modalities.",
        "A model of this kind can be useful both for implementing intelligent multimodal tools (e.g., authoring tools to input natural language and graphics interactively for the automatic construction of tutorials or manuals) and from the point of view of human-computer interaction (HCI) where it can help in the design of computer interfaces in which the interpretation constraints of multimodal messages should be taken into account.",
        "Consider Figure 1 (adapted from Rist [1996]) in which a message is expressed through two different modalities, namely text and graphics.",
        "The figure illustrates a kind of reasoning required to understand multimodal presentations: in order to make sense of the message, the interpreter must realize what individuals are referred to by the pronouns he and it in the text.",
        "For the sake of argument, it is assumed that the graphical symbols in the figure are understood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon, in the same way that the words he, it, and washed are understood in terms of the textual",
        "Instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguistic antecedent.",
        "lexicon.",
        "It can easily be seen that given the graphical context, he should resolve to the man, and it should resolve to the car.",
        "However, this inference is not valid since the information inferred is not contained in the overt graphical context and the meaning of the words involved.",
        "One way to look at this problem is as a case of anaphoric inference.",
        "Consider that the information provided by graphical means can also be expressed through the following piece of discourse: There is a man, a car, and a bucket.",
        "He washed it.",
        "With Kamp's discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993) a discourse representation structure (DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun he is constrained to be the man can be built.",
        "However, the pronoun it has two possible antecedents, and conceptual knowledge is required to select the appropriate one.",
        "In particular, the knowledge that a man can wash objects with water, and that water is carried in buckets, must be employed.",
        "If these concepts are included in the interpretation context like DRT conditions (which should be retrieved from memory rather than from the normal flow of discourse), the anaphora can be solved.",
        "By analogy, situations like the one illustrated in Figure 1 have been considered problems of anaphors with pictorial antecedents in which the interpretation context is built not from a preceding text but from a graphical representation that is introduced with the text (Andre and Rist 1994).",
        "Consider now the converse situation shown in Figure 2 (adapted from Rist [19961), in which a drawing is interpreted as a map in the context of the preceding text.",
        "The dots and lines in the drawing, and their properties, do not have an interpretation and the picture in itself is meaningless.",
        "However, given the context introduced by the text, and also considering the common knowledge that Paris is a city in France, and Frankfurt a city in Germany, and that Germany lies to the east of France (to the right),",
        "it is possible to infer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middle, and right in the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken, and Frankfurt, respectively, and that the dotted lines denote borders between countries, and in particular, the lower segment denotes the border between France and Germany.",
        "In this example, graphical symbols can be thought of as \"variables\" of the graphical representation or \"graphical pronouns\" that can be resolved in terms of the textual antecedent.",
        "Here again, the inference is not valid, as the graphical symbols could be given other interpretations or none at all.",
        "The situation in Figure 2 has been characterized as an instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguistic antecedent, and further related examples can be found in Andre and Rist (1994).",
        "This situation, however, cannot be modeled very easily in terms of Kamp's DRT because the \"pronouns\" are not linguistic objects, and lacking a proper formalization of the graphical information, there is no straightforward way to express in a discourse representation structure that a dot representing \"a variable\" in the graphical domain has the same denotation as a natural language name or description introduced from text in a DRS.",
        "Furthermore, the situation in Figure 1 can be thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore the modality of the graphics, as was done above; but if the notion of modality is to be considered at all in the analysis, then the situation in Figure 1 poses the same kinds of problems as the one in Figure 2.",
        "In general, graphical objects, functioning as constant terms or as variables, introduced as antecedents or as pronouns, cannot be expressed in a DRS, since the rules constructing these structures are triggered by specific syntactic configurations of the natural language in which the information is expressed.",
        "However, this limitation can be overcome if graphical information can be expressed in a language with well-defined syntax and semantics.",
        "An alternative is to look at these kinds of problems in terms of the traditional linguistic notion of deixis (Lyons 1968).",
        "Deixis has to do with the orientational features of language, which are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of an utterance.",
        "Under this view, and in connection with the notion of graphical anaphora discussed above, it is possible to mention the deictic category of demonstrative pronouns: words like this and that permit us to make reference to extralinguistic objects.",
        "In Figure 1, for instance, the pronouns he and it can be supported by overt pointing acts at the time the expression he washed it is uttered.",
        "Note that the purpose of the pointing act is to provide the referents for the pronouns directly, greatly simplifying the resolution process.",
        "However, the deictic use of a pronoun does not necessarily have to be supported by a physical gesture, because deictic use is characterized, more generally, by the identification of the referent in a metalinguistic context.",
        "Ambiguity in such words is not unusual, as they can also function as anaphors if they are preceded by a linguistic context, and even as determiners with a deictic component (e.g., this car).",
        "Additionally, not only demonstratives and pronouns but also proper names, definite descriptions, and even indefinites can be used deictically.",
        "As a great variety of contextual factors are conceivably involved in the interpretation of a deictic expression, gestures, although prominent, should be thought of only as one particular kind of contextual factor.",
        "In summary, the denotation of a deictic term is the individual that is picked out by the human interpreter in relation to the interpretation context.' Consider that in the same way that an anaphoric inference is required for identifying the antecedent of an anaphoric term, an inference process is required for interpreting a term used deictically.",
        "We refer to this process as a deictic inference.",
        "The inference by",
        "which one determines that he and it are the man and the car is, accordingly, a deictic inference.",
        "For our purposes, it is important to investigate the nature of the relation between the notions of deixis and modality, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and inference, either deictic or anaphoric, on the other.",
        "According to Kamp (1981, 283), the difference between deictic and anaphoric pronouns is that, deictic and anaphoric pronouns select their referents from certain sets of antecedently available entities.",
        "The two pronoun's uses differ with regard to the nature of these sets.",
        "In the case of a deictic pronoun the set contains entities that belong to the real world, whereas the selection set for an anaphoric pronoun is made up of constituents of the representation that has been constructed in response to antecedent discourse.",
        "Our concern here is how \"the set of entities that belong to the real world\" is accessible to the interpreter.",
        "In normal deictic spatial situations the referent of a deictic term is perceived directly through the visual modality, and as a result of such a visual interpretation process, the object is represented by the subject.",
        "The question is how the information can be expressed in this intermediate \"visual\" representation.",
        "A plausible answer is that there is a coding system and a medium associated with each particular modality.",
        "Our suggestion is that the notion of modality is a representational notion, and not a sensory one as normally assumed in psychological discussion.",
        "In our sense, a modality is a formal language, with a lexicon and well-defined syntactic and semantic structures, with an associated medium in which the expressions of the modality are written.",
        "Multimodal reasoning is a process involving information expressed in the languages associated with different modalities, and is achieved with the help of a translation relation similar to the relation of translation between natural languages.",
        "Performing a multimodal reasoning process is possible if the translation relation between expressions of different modalities is available.",
        "However, for particular multimodal reasoning tasks, the translation relation between individual constants of different modalities cannot be stated beforehand and has to be worked out dynamically through a deictic inferential process, as will be argued in the rest of this paper."

        "In a system of this kind, interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2 in relation to the linguistic modality is a matter of interpreting the information expressed through natural language directly when enough information is available, and completing the interpretation process by means of translating expressions of the graphical modality into the linguistic one, and vice versa.",
        "Consider Figure 3 – developing from previous work (Pineda 1989, 1998; Klein and Pineda 1990; Santana 1999) – in which a multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalities is illustrated.",

        "Note that two sets of expressions are considered for the graphical modality: the expressions in G belong to a formal language in which the geometry of pictures is represented and reasoned about, and P contains the overt graphical symbols that can be seen and drawn but cannot be manipulated directly.",
        "The functions PL-G and pG_L stand for the translation mappings between the languages L and G, and the functions pp_G and pc_p stand for the corresponding translations between G and P. The translation function pi,--G maps well-defined objects of the graphical modality into expressions of G where the interpretation process is performed.",
        "The translation pG_p, on the other hand, maps geometrical expressions of G into pictures; for every well-defined term of G of a graphical type (e.g., dot, line, etc.)",
        "there is a graphical object or a graphical composition that can be drawn or highlighted with the application of geometrical algorithms associated to operators of G in a systematic fashion.",

        "The ordered pair (W, FL) defines the model ML for the natural language, and the ordered pair (W, Fp) defines the model Mp for the interpretation of drawings.",
        "The interpretation of expressions in G in relation to the world is defined either by the composition FL°pG_L or, alternatively, by FP°PG-P.",
        "The denotation of the word France in L, for instance, is the same as the denotation of the corresponding region of the map of Europe that denotes France, the country, since both refer to the same individual.",
        "The denotation of the symbol r1 in G that is related to the word France in L through pG_L, and to a particular region in P through pG_p, is also France, as translation is a meaning-preserving relation between expressions.",
        "The interpretation functions FL and Fp relate basic expressions, either graphical or linguistic, to the objects or relations of the world that these expressions happen to represent, and the definition of a semantic algebra for computing the denotation of composite graphical and linguistic expressions is required.",
        "An important consideration for the scheme in Figure 3 is that the symbols of P have two roles: on the one hand, they are representational objects (e.g., a region of",
        "the drawing represents a country), but on the other, they are also geometrical objects that can be talked about as geometrical entities.",
        "The geometrical region of the map representing France, for instance, is itself represented by the constant r1 in G. In this second view, geometrical entities are individual objects in the world of geometry, and as such they have a number of geometrical properties that are independent of whether we think of graphical symbols as objects in themselves or as symbols representing something else.",
        "The same duality can be stated from the point of view of the expressions of G, since the set of individual geometrical objects (i.e., P) constitutes a domain of interpretation for the language G. This is to say that expressions of G have two interpretations: they represent geometrical objects, properties, and relations directly, but they also represent the objects of the world (e.g., France, Germany, etc.)",
        "indirectly through the translation relation and interpretation of symbols in P taken as a language (i.e., the composition Fp°pG_p).",
        "The ordered pair (P, FG) defines the model MG for the geometrical interpretation of G as geometrical objects; the geometrical interpretation function FG assigns a denotation for every constant of G; the denotation of individual constants of G are the graphical symbols themselves, and the denotation of operators and function symbols of G denoting graphical properties and relations will be given by predefined geometrical algorithms commonly used in computational geometry and computer graphics – see, for instance, Shamos (1978).",
        "The semantic interpretation of composite expressions of G, on the other hand, is defined through a semantic algebra, as will be shown below in Section 2.3.2.",
        "The definition of this geometrical interpreter will allow us to perform inferences about the geometry of the drawing in a very effective fashion.",
        "Consider that to state explicitly all true and false geometrical statements about a drawing would be a very cumbersome task, as the number of statements that would have to be made even for small drawings would be very large.",

        "is asked, the answer can be found by applying the function PG_L'pr-G to the dot indicated (i.e., pG_L(pp_G(•))), whose value would be the word Saarbrikken.",
        "A similar situation arises in the interpretation of multimodal referring expressions.",
        "Consider the following example – also from Andre and Rist (1994) – in which a multimodal message is constituted by a picture of an espresso machine that has two switches, and by the textual expression the temperature control.",
        "In this scenario, the denotation of the natural language expression can be found by the human interpreter if the corresponding switch is identified in the picture through visual inspection (e.g., if the switch is highlighted).",
        "In general, multimodal coreference can be established if pL_G and pG_L are defined, as Fp can be made explicit in terms of FL and vice versa.",
        "In situations in which all theoretical elements illustrated in Figure 3 are given, questions about multimodal scenarios can be answered through the evaluation of expressions of a given modality in terms of the interpreters of the languages involved and the translation functions.",
        "However, when one is instructed to interpret a multimodal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not all information in the scheme of Figure 3 is available.",
        "In particular, the translation functions PL-G and PG-L of the graphical and linguistic individual constants mentioned in the texts and the pictures of the multimodal messages are not known, and the crucial inference of the interpretation process has as its goal to find out the definition of these functions (i.e., to establish the relations between names of L and G).",
        "It is important to emphasize that in order to find out ioL_G and pG_L, the information overtly provided in the multimodal message is usually not enough, and in order to carry out such an interpretation process it will be necessary to consider the grammatical structure of the languages involved, the definition of translations rules between languages, and also conceptual knowledge stored in memory about the interpretation domain.",
        "An additional consideration regarding the scheme in Figure 3 is related to the problem of ambiguity in the interpretation of multimodal messages.",
        "In the literature of intelligent multimodal systems, ambiguity is commonly seen from the perspective of human users.",
        "A multimodal referring expression constituted by the text the temperature control and a drawing with two switches is said to be ambiguous, for instance, if the human user is not able to tell which one is the temperature control.",
        "A well-designed presentation should avoid this kind of ambiguity by providing additional information either in a textual form (e.g., the temperature control is the switch on the left) or by a graphical focusing technique (e.g., highlighting the left switch).",
        "An important motivation in the design of intelligent presentation systems like WIP (Wahlster et al.",
        "1993) and COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993) is to generate graphical and linguistic explanations in which these kinds of ambiguities are avoided.' Note, however, that such situations are better characterized as problems of underspecification, rather than as problems of ambiguity, since the expression the temperature control has only one syntactic structure and one meaning, and the referent can be identified in a given context if enough information is available.",
        "Ambiguity in multimodal systems has also been related to the granularity of graphical pointing acts.",
        "A map, for instance, can be represented by an expression of G that translates into a graphical composition in P denoting a single individual (e.g., Europe) or by a number of expressions of G that refer to the minimal graphical partitions in P (e.g., the countries of Europe) depending on whether the focus of the interpretation process is the whole of the drawing or its constituent parts.",
        "This problem has also been addressed in a number of intelligent multimodal systems like XTRA (Wahlster 1991) and AlFresco (Stock et al.",
        "1993), but the lack of a formalized notion of graphical language (and also a better understanding of indexical expressions), has prevented a deeper analysis of this kind of ambiguity.",
        "These notions of \"ambiguity\" in multimodal systems contrast with the traditional notion of ambiguity in natural language in which an ambiguous expression has several interpretations.",
        "The formalization of graphical representations through the definition of graphical languages with well-defined syntax and semantics allows us to face the problem of ambiguity directly in terms of the relation of translation between natural and graphical languages, and the semantics of expressions of both modal",
        "ities.",
        "An interesting question is whether the graphical context offers clues that the parser can use to resolve lexical and structural ambiguity.",
        "Although we have yet to explore this issue, there are some antecedents in this regard.",
        "In Steedman's theory of incremental interpretation in dialogue, for instance, the rules of syntax, semantics, and processing are very closely linked (Steedman 1986) and local ambiguities may be resolved by taking into account their appropriateness to the context, which can be graphical.",
        "Structural ambiguity in G can be appreciated, for instance, in relation to the granularity of graphical objects, as the same drawing will have different syntactic analysis depending on whether it is interpreted as a whole or as an aggregation of parts.",
        "It is likely that the resolution of this latter kind of ambiguity is also influenced by pragmatic factors concerning the purpose of the task, the interpretation domain, and the attentional state of the interpreter, but this investigation is also pending.",
        "We do, however, address issues of ambiguity related to the resolution of spatial indexical terms and anaphoric references in an integrated fashion.",
        "In Section 3, an incremental constraint satisfaction algorithm for resolving referential terms in relation to the graphical domain is presented.",
        "This algorithm relies on spatial constraints of drawings and general knowledge about the interpretation domain, and its computation is performed during the construction of multimodal discourse representation structures (MDRSs), which are extensions of DRSs in DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993) as illustrated in Section 4.",
        "In the same way that DRT makes no provision for ambiguity resolution and alternative DRSs are constructed for different readings of a sentence, several MDRSs would have to be constructed in our approach for ambiguous multimodal messages.' However, as natural language terms in L in our simplified domain refer to graphical objects, indefinites are very unlikely to have specific readings (e.g, \"a city\" normally refers to any city) and a simple heuristic in which indefinites are within the scope of definite descriptions and proper names can be used to obtain the preferred reading of sentences such as the one in Figures 2.",
        "Nevertheless, even if only this reading is considered, and the interpreter knows that the drawing is a map and is aware of the interpretation conventions of this kind of graphical representations (i.e., countries are represented by regions, cities by dots, etc.",
        "), drawings can still be ambiguous.",
        "In Figure 2, for instance, there are four possible interpretations for the graphical symbols that are consistent with the text if no knowledge of the geography of Europe is assumed.",
        "Our algorithm is designed to resolve reference for spatial referential and anaphoric terms in the course of the multimodal discourse interpretation, and the graphical ambiguity is resolved in the course of this process, as will be shown in detail in Sections 3 and 4.",
        "To conclude this section, we believe the formalization of the syntax and semantics of graphical representations in a form compatible with the syntax and semantics of natural language, as in the scheme in Figure 3, may be a point of departure for investigating how the graphical or visual context helps to resolve natural language ambiguities at different levels of representation and processing.",

        "The use of a particular presentation strategy in a multimodal explanation (e.g., in WIP) depends crucially on whether the expressions generated on the basis of such a strategy satisfy the conditions defined to activate the expected representations in the user's mind (an intentional goal).",

        "WIP is able to tell whether the presentation would be ambiguous for the human user if additional information were not provided because it has a representation of the actual situation and a simple model of the user's beliefs.",
        "Although the main representation structure of multimodal presentation and explanation systems is defined at a rhetorical level, the use of presentation strategies relies on algorithms for the generation of graphical and linguistic referring expressions.",

        "It is interesting to note that presentations generated by WIP and other multimodal explanation systems like COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993), or TEX-PLAN (Maybury 1993), are limited to the production of definite descriptions only, even though the use of indefinite descriptions can be natural in multimodal communication.",
        "However, this restriction can be overcome with a more solid representational framework such as the one illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "Consider that basic or composite expressions of the languages G and L can be translated to basic or composite expressions of the other language, depending on the definition of the translation function.",
        "So, to refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, for instance, it would only be necessary to find an expression of G that succinctly expresses the relevant graphical properties of the desired object, and then translate it to its corresponding expression in L. The resulting natural language expression could be used directly or embedded in a larger natural language expression containing words that refer to abstract objects or properties.",
        "The descriptions obtained through this strategy explicitly employ the concrete and graphical properties of the representation, since expressions of G are",

        "This notion of a multimodal system of representation in which objects in the graphical modality are formalized through a well-defined language is similar to the notion of graphical language introduced by Mackinlay for the automatic design of graphical presentations (Mackinlay 1987), where a number of graphical languages (e.g., the languages of bar charts, area and position graphs, scatter plots, etc.)",
        "are formally specified.",
        "In Mackinlay's work, expressions of graphical languages are related to the objects of the world that they represent through an encodes relation with three arguments: the graphical constant or expression performing the representation, the object of the world that is represented through the graphical expression, and the graphical language to which the graphical expression belongs.' The formalization of P permits us to define a precise statement of expressiveness of a graphical language, as follows: \"a set of facts is expressible in a language (graphical) if the language contains a sentence that encodes every fact in the set and does not encode any additional facts\" (Mackinlay 1987, 54).",
        "The formalization additionally allows empirical studies to determine how effectively a human user can interpret expressions of a particular graphical language in relation to another in which the same set of facts is encoded.",
        "Although all graphical languages studied by Mackinlay are conventional and have a precise geomet7 Incidentally, a similar encoding relation encodes is used in the WIP system to relate the representational object to the object that it represents, but the third argument of this relation in WIP is a context space that allows use of the same presentation in different perspectives (e.g., an espresso machine may refer to an individual machine in a context space, or alternatively it can be seen as the prototype of espresso machines in a different context space).",
        "The encodes relation in WIP and in Mackinlay is similar to the translation relation between objects of P (or G) and L in our system, and we can think of a graphical language as a language encoding the information that is intended to be communicated.",
        "However, it is interesting to note that the status of the \"linguistic\" argument of the encodes relation is different in WIP and in Mackinlay's system.",
        "In the former, it is an \"internal representation\" – a psychological notion – while in the latter it stands for an object or a relation in the world itself – a semantic notion.",

        "Here, the question of whether arbitrary families of graphical objects can be formalized through a well-defined syntax is left open, and although it is possible to think of many families of drawings with very arbitrary geometries, some important efforts have been made in the characterization of design and other kinds of objects – see, for instance, shape grammars (Stiny 1975).",
        "Another related issue that is relevant for the construction of multimodal interactive systems is whether it is possible and useful to input expressions of P directly, and to obtain their syntactic structure through graphical parsing techniques (Wittenburg 1998).",
        "In summary, the purpose of formalizing P is to be able to talk about maps as a modality, where a modality, in our sense, is a code system for the symbols expressed in a medium, and a multimodal system of representation relates information expressed through different code systems in a systematic fashion.",

        "Figure 24(b) illustrates the interpretation state once the additional constraint that Germany is to the east of France has been considered.21 The interpretation of the corresponding expression introduces two additional discourse referents (n6 and n7), as the terms Germany and France in the textual part of the message should be resolved anaphorically in relation to the context previously built.",

An interesting antecedent for the definition of such constraints can be found in Faraday and Sutcliffe (1998).",

        "However, if the expression is supported by an overt gesture indicating the city of Paris, for instance, it would be deictic and its interpretation would have to be worked out with the same machinery; although in this latter situation the translation relation between graphical and linguistic referents could be asserted directly in the translation model as the gesture would render unnecessary the constraint satisfaction part of the deictic inference.",

        "In this paper, we have presented a theory of representation and interpretation for multimodal messages and a model for multimodal reference resolution.",
        "The model is based on the view that a modality is a code system on a medium that can be characterized by well-defined syntax and semantics.",
        "Multimodal interpretation is a matter of working out coreference relations between terms of different modalities.",
        "A central concern in articulating this theory is a clear characterization of how spatial deictic reference is resolved and of how spatial deictic reference relates to the resolution of anaphors in the normal flow of discourse.",
        "A key theoretical assumption we make is that graphics are interpreted deictically, which is in opposition to the view graphical representations are interpreted anaphorically.",
        "The theoretical machinery for the definition of the syntax and semantics is formally developed along the lines of Montague's semiotic program and its associated general theory of translation.",
        "We have also illustrated an algorithm for finding the translation between texts and graphics, as messages in these modalities are introduced through independent input channels, and the translation between linguistic terms and their corresponding graphical expressions must be induced dynamically.",
        "We also suggested an extension of Kamp's DRT with multimodal discourse structures (MDRS).",
        "This model defines an integrated interpretation model for multimodal messages while maintaining a clear demarcation between indexical and anaphoric inferential processes.",
        "Natural language terms, like proper names, pronouns, and descriptions can be interpreted in relation to a model; however, these linguistic terms also admit anaphoric and deictic interpretations.",
        "It is important to note that although we used a simplified extensional definition for the semantics of natural language and graphical expressions, the system was carefully",
        "Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution designed to move smoothly into the intensional domain.",
        "Consider that the extensional formulation used in the semantic definition of the graphical language can be easily extended into an intensional one by changing the types of constants, predicates, and sentences from individuals, sets of individuals, and truth values, into individual concepts, properties of individuals, and propositions, respectively.",
        "This is achieved simply by indexing the interpretation of expressions in terms of a possible world and time, and all definitions presented above could be considered relative to the current world and time.",
        "The move to the intensional domain would allow the definition of the interpretation of more comprehensive natural language segments.",
        "Intensionality is also relevant for the interpretation of graphical languages, in general, and for the definition of graphical and linguistic interactive systems, in particular.",
        "In interactive sessions with a computer graphic interface, the interaction states can be considered as possible worlds and the interpretation of graphical constants would depend on particular graphical states.",
        "If a graphical object like a dot, for instance, is moved from one position to another in an interactive transaction, we have the intuition that the object before and after the change is the same and denotes the same object of the world and yet not even its position, which one could think of as an essential property of a dot, is the same.",
        "Accordingly, in the intensional setting the semantic value of a graphical constant is not an individual but an individual concept.",
        "Consider as well that the same graphical description can have different semantic values in different interactive states; for instance, the value of the expression position of d1 will be a different ordered pair before and after dot d1 is moved.",
        "According to this, the interpretation of graphical operators at every index will be a function from sequences of graphical objects of the proper kind into graphical objects; however, unlike normal linguistic situations in which different functions at different indices are assigned to operators and predicates, the same function at every index has to be assigned to geometrical operators and predicates, as the geometry is always the same.",
        "Moving into the intensional setting is also relevant for our treatment of indexicals.",
        "In our current approach, the interpretation of a term used deictically is an individual of the world; in the intensional context, the interpretation of the same term in one particular interaction state will be the same in every state despite the fact that the description for referring to such an object in the state in which it was selected might pick up a different individual in a different state.",
        "In the future, it would be interesting to deal with a more general fragment of natural language that includes temporal expressions.",
        "In the same way that the language G provided a finite and small domain for the interpretation of linguistic spatial prepositions, a similar language T for the interpretation of temporal prepositions could be defined.",
        "Temporal predicates and operators of this language would be interpreted in terms of arithmetic functions like those presented, for instance, in Allen's temporal logic (Allen 1983).",
        "In the same way that the constraint satisfaction algorithm for the definition of the translation between graphical and linguistic terms helped to solve deictic inferences, a constraint satisfaction algorithm for resolving temporal deictic references in relation to a finite and small domain of actions and events is conceivable.",
        "The definition for such a spatial and temporal indexical model could be quite helpful for the implementation of natural language and graphics systems in which actions and events are mentioned in the course of interactive conversations."

      "text": [
        "Although a prototype system for the theory presented in this paper has not been implemented, several aspects of the theory have been implemented in relation to simpler systems.",
        "A simpler version of the strategy for multimodal interpretation of the scheme",
        " in Figure 3 was implemented in the first version of the Graflog system (Pineda 1989).",
        "Several versions of the graphical language and its geometrical interpreter have been implemented in relation to different application domains (Morales 1994; Masse 1994; Santana 1999; Garza 1995) with BinProlog and the TCL/TK programming environment.",
        "The geometrical interpreter and the strategy of evaluating a set of geometrical constraints incrementally in relation to a graphical domain was used in a later version of Graflog to solve and generate graphical explanations of geometrical constraint satisfaction problems (Pineda 1992, 1998), and also for the definition of a model (not yet fully implemented) for the production of solids from orthogonal views of polyhedra (Garza and Pineda 1998).",
        "We also implemented the scheme for enumerating functions used in the definition of translation models for a semantic theorem-proving system written in Prolog, in order to find the possible models satisfying logical theories about graphical scenarios of the Hyperproof system (Barwise and Etchemendy,1994)."
