        "Therefore, it is likely that connectives can be used to determine rhetorical relations that hold both between elementary units and between large spans of text.",
        "• The number of discourse markers in a typical text – approximately one marker for every two clauses (Redeker 1990) – is sufficiently large to enable the derivation of rich rhetorical structures for texts.' More importantly, the absence of markers correlates with a preference of readers to interpret the unmarked textual units as continuations of the topics of the units that precede them (Segal, Duchan, and Scott 1991).",
        "Hence, when there is no connective between two sentences, for example, it is likely that the second sentence elaborates on the first.",

        "Sentential and Discourse Uses of Connectives.",
        "Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which they occur, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse uses in about 80% of cases and that these results can be improved with machine learning techniques (Litman 1996) or genetic algorithms (Siegel and McKeown 1994).",
        "I have taken Hirschberg and Litman's research one step further and designed a comprehensive corpus analysis of cue phrases that enabled me to design algorithms that improved their results and coverage.",

        "Hence, it is likely that In contrast signals a CONTRAST relation in text (4) as well.",
        "Unfortunately, although we know what relation In contrast signals, we do not know which spans the CONTRAST relation holds between: does the relation hold between spans [1,2] and [3,4]; or between unit 2 and span [3,4]; or between span [1,2] and unit 3; or between units 1 and 3; or between other units and spans?",
        "The best that we can do in this case is to make an exclusively disjunctive hypothesis, i.e., to hypothesize that one and only one of these possible relations holds.",
        "However, it is still unclear what the elements of such an exclusively disjunctive hypothesis should be.",
        "In my previous work (Marcu 1996, 1997a, 1997b, 1999b, 2000), I have argued that rhetorical relations that hold between large textual spans can be explained in terms of similar relations that hold between their most important elementary units.",
        "For example, the rhetorical relation of EVIDENCE that holds between the first sentence of the first paragraph in text (1) and the last two sentences of the same paragraph can be explained in terms of a similar relation that holds between the corresponding nuclei: an EVIDENCE relation also holds between the nucleus of the first sentence, Mars experiences frigid weather conditions and each of the most important nuclei of the last two sentences Surface temperatures typically average about – 60 degrees Celsius (-76 degrees Fahrenheit) at the equator and [Surface temperatures] can dip to – 123 degrees C near the poles.",
        "Similarly, the CONTRAST relation that holds between the two spans [1,2] and [3,4] in text (4) can be explained in terms of a CONTRAST relation that holds between units 1 and 3, the most important units in spans [1,2] and [3,4], respectively.",
        "The fact that rhetorical relations that hold between large textual spans can be explained/determined in terms of rhetorical relations that hold between elementary textual units suggests that rhetorical structure trees can be constructed in a bottom-up fashion, from rhetorical relations that have been determined to hold between elementary textual units.",
        "Hence, to derive the rhetorical structure of text (4) it is sufficient to hypothesize with respect to the occurrence of the connective In contrast, the exclusively disjunctive hypothesis rhet_re/(coNTRAsT, 1,3) rhet_re/(coNTRAsT, 1,4) el rhet_re/(coNTRAsT, 2,3) e rhet_re/(coNTRAsT, 2, 4), because this hypothesis subsumes all the other possible rhetorical relations that may be signaled by the connective.' In Section 2.4, I will explain why exclusive-disjunctive hypotheses of this kind are sufficient for determining the rhetorical structure of texts.",
        "The fact that rhetorical relations that hold between large spans can be explained in terms of rhetorical relations that hold between elementary units should not lead one to conclude that a computational system should only make rhetorical hypotheses whose arguments are elementary units.",
        "For example, a text fragment may consist of three paragraphs, clearly marked by the connectives First, Second, and Third.",
        "For such",
        "Marcu Rhetorical Parsing of Unrestricted Texts a fragment, it is likely that the three paragraphs are in a LIST or SEQUENCE relation.",
        "If a computer program exploits the occurrence of these markers, it may be able to derive the high-level rhetorical structure of the text fragment without determining the important units and relations that underlie the three paragraphs.",
        "The work presented in this paper acknowledges the utility of dealing both with simple relations, i.e., rhetorical relations that hold between elementary textual units, and with extended rhetorical relations, i.e., relations that hold between large segments.",
        "Depending on the circumstances, a computational system will have to choose the types of relations it should hypothesize to determine the rhetorical structure of a text.",
        "The observation that rhetorical relations that hold between large textual spans can be explained in terms of rhetorical relations that hold between elementary textual units and the need for dealing with extended rhetorical relations amount to providing a compositionality criterion for valid rhetorical structures.",
        "This criterion posits that a rhetorical structure tree is valid only if each rhetorical relation that holds between two spans is either an extended rhetorical relation or can be explained in terms of a simple rhetorical relation.",
        "course markers are also ambiguous with respect to the rhetorical relations they signal and the importance of the textual spans they relate.",
        "For example, the occurrence of the discourse marker But at the beginning of a sentence most often signals either a mononuclear relation of ANTITHESIS or CONCESSION between a satellite, a textual span that precedes the occurrence of But, and a nucleus, a textual span that starts with But; or a multinuclear relation of CONTRAST between two nuclei: a textual span that precedes the occurrence of But and a textual span that starts with But.",
        "An exclusive disjunction is again an adequate way to formalize this hypothesis.",
        "For example, the exclusive disjunction rhet_re/(ANTITHEsis, 1, 2) e rhet_rd(coNcEssioN, 1,2) e rhet_re/(coNTRAsT, 1,2) expresses the best hypothesis that one can make on the basis of the occurrence of the marker But in text (5).",
        "As mentioned already, in Section 2.4 it will become apparent why such exclusively disjunctive hypotheses are sufficient for deriving the rhetorical structure of texts.",

        "The more complex the texts one is trying to analyze and the more ambiguous the connectives a text employs, the more likely the rhetorical relations that hold between elementary units and spans cannot be hypothesized precisely by automatic means.",
        "Most often, connectives, tense, pronoun uses, etc.",
        "only suggest that some rhetorical relations hold between some textual units; rarely can hypotheses be made with 100% confidence.",
        "When a computer program processes free texts and comes across a connective such as But, for example, unless it carries out a complete semantic analysis and understands the intentions of the writer, it won't be able to determine unambiguously what relation to use; and it won't be able to determine what units or spans are involved in the relation.",
        "What is certain, though, is that But, the hypothesis trigger in this example, can signal at most one such relation – in my empirical work (see Section 3), I have never come across a case in which a simple connective signaled more than one rhetorical relation.",
        "In general then, if But occurs in unit i of a text, we know that it can signal a rhetorical relation that holds between one unit in the interval [i – k, i – 1] and one unit in the interval [i, i + k], where k is a sufficiently large constant; or a relation between two spans [i – kl, i – 1] and [i, i + k2].",

        "A graphical representation of the disjunctive hypothesis that is triggered by the occurrence of the marker But at the beginning of unit i of a text.",
        "the simple rhetorical relations that can be hypothesized on the basis of the connective But in unit i.",
        "In this paper, I will focus on dealing only with this sort of exclusively disjunctive hypotheses, i.e., hypotheses whose disjuncts subsume text spans that overlap.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, all disjuncts span over the segment [i – 1, i].",
        "From a linguistic perspective, only such hypotheses make sense.",
        "Although one can hypothesize on the basis of the occurrence of a discourse marker in unit i that a rhetorical relation R holds either between units i – 2 and i – 1 or between units i and i 1, for example, such a hypothesis will be ill-formed.",
        "In the discourse analyses I have carried out so far, I have never come across an example that would require one to deal with exclusively disjunctive hypotheses different from that shown graphically in Figure 2."

        "• Each node of a rhetorical structure tree has associated a status (NUCLEUS or SATELLITE), a type (the rhetorical relation that holds between the text spans that the node spans over), and a set of promotion units.",
        "The set of promotion units of a textual span is determined recursively: it is given by the union of the promotion sets of the immediate subspans when the relation that holds between these subspans is paratactic, or by the promotion set of the nucleus subspan when the relation that holds between the immediate subspans is hypotactic.",
        "By convention, the type of a leaf is LEAF; and the promotion set of a leaf is a set that contains the leaf.",

        "• The rhetorical relations of a valid rhetorical structure hold only between adjacent spans.",
        "• There exists a span, which corresponds to the root node of the structure, that spans over the entire text.",
        "• The status, type, and promotion set associated with each node reflect the compositionality criterion discussed in Section 2.2: if a rhetorical relation holds between two textual spans of the tree structure of a text, either that relation is extended or it can be explained in terms of a simple relation that holds between the promotion units of the constituent subspans.",

        "They did not agree beforehand on any annotation style or protocol and were not given any specific instructions besides being asked to build trees that were consistent with the requirements put forth by Mann and Thompson.",
        "The analysts were supposed to use only the set of relations proposed by RST and the relation TEXTUAL to link the subtrees subsuming the title and body of a text.",
        "Analysts were not asked to build binary structures (similar to those derived by the rhetorical parser), although we knew that this could negatively affect the performance of our system.",
        "The performance of the rhetorical parser was estimated by applying labeled recall and precision measures, which are extensively used to study the performance of syntactic parsers.",
        "Labeled recall reflects the number of correctly labeled constituents identified by the rhetorical parser with respect to the number of labeled constituents in the corresponding manually built tree.",
        "Labeled precision reflects the number of correctly labeled constituents identified by the rhetorical parser with respect to the total number of labeled constituents identified by the parser.",
        "Labeled recall and precision figures were computed with respect to the ability of the rhetorical parser to identify elementary units, hierarchical text spans, text span nuclei and satellites, and rhetorical relations.",
        "To understand how these figures were computed, assume for example that an analyst identified six elementary units in a text and built the discourse structure in Figure 15(a) and that the program identified five elementary units and built the discourse structure in Figure 15(b).",
        "When we align the two structures, we obtain the labels in Table 7, which show that the program did not identify the breaks between units 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 in the analyst's annotation; and that it considered the unit labeled 6-7 in the analyst's annotation to be made of two units.",
        "Table 7 lists all constituents in the two structures, the associated labels at the elementary unit, span, nuclei, and rhetorical levels, and the corresponding recall and precision figures.",
        "As Table 7 shows,",
        "the program in this example identified only one of the six elementary units identified by the analyst (unit 1), for a recall of 1/6.",
        "Since the program identified a total of five units, the precision is 1/5.",
        "Similarly, recall and precision figures can be computed for span, nuclearity, and rhetorical relation assignments.",
        "This evaluation assumes that rhetorical labels are associated with the children nodes, and not with the father nodes, as in the formalization.",
        "For example, the EXAMPLE relation that holds between spans [4,5] and [6,7] in the tree in Figure 15(a), is not associated with span [4,7], but rather, with the span [6,7], which is the satellite of the relation; and by convention, the rhetorical relation of the span [4,5] is set to SPAN.",
        "The rationale for this choice is the fact that the analysts did not construct only binary trees; some of the nodes in their manually built representations had multiple children.",
        "Representing in binary form a tree such as that shown in Figure 16(a), for example, would require an additional hierarchical level on the spans, as shown in Figures 16(b) and 16(c), that was not part of the original analysis.",
        "To avoid introducing in the annotation choices that were not part of what the analysts did, I decided for the purpose of evaluation to follow the procedure outlined above.",
        "Table 8 shows average recall and precision figures that reflect the performance of the rhetorical parser on the five Scientific American texts.",
        "In addition to the recall",
        "and precision figures specific to the program, Table 8 also displays average recall and precision figures obtained for the trees built only by the analysts.",
        "These figures reflect how similar the annotations of the two analysts were and provides an upper bound for the performance of the rhetorical parser: if the recall and precision figures of the parser were the same as the figures for the analysts, the discourse trees built by the rhetorical parser would be indistinguishable from those built by a human.",
        "As the results in Table 8 show, the rhetorical parser fails to identify a fair number of elementary units (51.2% recall); but the units it identifies tend to be correct (95.9% precision).",
        "As a consequence, performance at all other levels is affected.",
        "With respect to identifying hierarchical spans, recall is about 25% lower than the average human performance; with respect to labeling the nuclear status of spans, recall is about 30% below human performance; and with respect to labeling the rhetorical relations that hold between spans, recall is about 40% below human performance.",
        "In general, the precision of the rhetorical parser comes close to the human performance level.",
        "However, since the level of granularity at which the rhetorical parser works is much coarser than that used by human judges, many sentences are assigned a much simpler structure than the structure built by humans.",
        "For example, whenever an analyst used a JOINT relation to connect two clause-like units separated by an and, the rhetorical parser failed to identify the two units; it often treated them as a single elementary unit.",
        "As a consequence, the recall figures at all levels were significantly lower than those specific to the humans.",
        "parser is to build a confusion matrix over the most frequently used relations.",
        "To enable the reader to distinguish between rhetorical and nuclearity errors, I follow the same strategy as in the case of computing labeled recall and precision figures.",
        "That is, I consider by convention that the nuclei nodes of a rhetorical representation are labeled with the relation SPAN.",
        "Table 9 shows the distributions of rhetorical relation labels used by one of the analysts and the program.",
        "The most frequently used relations were JOINT, ELABORATION, and CONTRAST.",
        "(Label SPAN denotes the nucleus of any mononuclear relation.)",
        "Overall, the 15 most frequently used relations account for more than 92% of the relations in the corpus.",
        "The distribution of relations inferred by the program is somewhat similar, with the most frequently used relations being JOINT, ELABORATION, and CONTRAST as well.",
        "The program, though, shows a stronger preference for ELABORATION relations over JOINTS.",
        "Table 10 shows a confusion matrix that reflects the ability of the rhetorical parser to derive rhetorical structure trees.",

        "Distribution of the most frequently used 15 relations.",
        "chosen by one analyst.",
        "For any relation R, a column in the confusion matrix reflects the number of relations of type R that were (in)correctly identified by the rhetorical parser with respect to the relations identified by the analyst.",
        "For example, the column labeled (d) shows that out of 18 textual spans labeled with the relation CONTRAST by the parser, 14 were labeled as CONTRASTS, one as the satellite of all ELABORATION relation, and one as the satellite of an OTHER relation by the analyst.",
        "In addition, two of the 18 spans had no corresponding span in one analyst's representation.",
        "The confusion matrix shows that the rhetorical parser does a fairly good job at recognizing rhetorical relations that are usually marked by cue phrases, i.e., CONTRAST, CONDITION, EXAMPLE, OTHERWISE, PURPOSE, CONCESSION, and CAUSE relations.",
        "The confusion matrix also shows that the simple model of cohesion that our parser employs is not adequate for distinguishing between rhetorical relations of ELABORATION and",
        "A flat (a) and a binary (b) representation of the discourse structure of a text.",
        "JOINT; the subrnatrix that subsumes the labels SPAN, JOINT, and ELABORATION shows the highest levels of confusion.",
        "Clearly, semantic similarity is not sufficient if one is to decide whether a rhetorical relation of JOINT, ELABORATION, or BACKGROUND holds between two textual segments.",
        "The rhetorical parser is unable to recognize \"purely\" intentional relations, such as EVIDENCE, which are seldomly marked.",
        "As the confusion matrix shows, the parser labels no relation as EVIDENCE; rather, it chooses instead ELABORATION, four times, JOINT, once, and a relation with a different nuclearity, once.",
        "Since the parser draws no temporal inferences, it labels most of the SEQUENCE relations as JoiNTs, which in many cases is an adequate approximation.",
        "The relatively large number of spans that have no correspondence in one analyst's representations can be explained by two factors.",
        "The first factor concerns our representation choice.",
        "Since the discourse parser builds binary trees, it also derives text spans that cannot be matched against a nonbinary representation.",
        "For example, although the tree in Figure 17(b) is a binary reformulation of the tree in Figure 17(a), the intermediate spans [1,k], [2,k], ... , [k-1,k] in Figure 17(b) cannot be matched against any span in the tree in Figure 17(a).",
        "Humans built structures such as those shown in Figure 17(a); the discourse parser did not.",
        "The second factor concerns the difficulty of the task.",
        "Some texts have very sophisticated text structures, which are difficult to infer only on the basis of cue phrase occurrences and word-based similarity measures.",

        "In most of the cases that I inspected visually on a variety of texts, the partial structures built above sentences and within paragraphs appeared to be adequate.",
        "The explanation is simple: Paragraphs that use few discourse markers tend to express the most important information at their beginning, which corresponds to the first sentence being a nucleus and subsequent sentences elaborating on it.",
        "Such paragraphs usually have discourse structures that are similar to those preferred by the rhetorical parser, which favors structures that are skewed to the right and which hypothesizes that ELABORATION relations hold between unmarked sentences.",

        "Good Discourse Structures at the Text Level, for Short Texts.",

        "Texts that consist of only a few paragraphs also tend to have structures that are skewed to the right.",

        "The recall figure with respect to identifying the hierarchical spans of this sentence is 1/3 (the parser correctly identifies only the span that subsumes the entire sentence but not the two subspans that subsume the elementary units).",

        "To evaluate this summarization program, I used two corpora: the five Scientific American texts that I have mentioned above, and a collection of 40 short newspaper articles from the TREC collection (Jing et al.",
        "1998).",
        "Both corpora were labeled for textual salience by a panel of independent judges: 13 judges labeled clause-like units as being important, somewhat important, and nonimportant in the texts of the Scientific American corpus; and 5 judges labeled sentences as worthy to be included in 10% and 20% summaries of the texts in the TREC corpus.",
        "The clauses/sentences which the human judges agreed were important were taken as the gold standard for summarization.",
