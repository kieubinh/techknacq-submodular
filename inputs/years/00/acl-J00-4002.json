        "This paper has several aims.",
        "Firstly, it outlines a formalism within which quasi-logical form–based theories of contextual interpretation of sentences can be stated in a way which is completely reversible; that is to say, theories expressed within the formalism can be used to provide interpretations for (utterances of) sentences containing contextually dependent constructs, given a context; and, given an interpretation and a context, to generate a sentence which has that interpretation in that context.",
        "Processing in both directions is done using exactly the same grammar, and the same set of contextual interpretation rules.",
        "To give an extremely simplified example, the aim is to have a way of interpreting the sentences in the left-hand column below as expressing the logical forms in the middle column, given that they are encountered in that order in an otherwise neutral context: and the reverse – given a sequence of logical forms as in the middle column, to be able to generate (among others) the sequence of sentences in the left-hand column, rather than the unnatural although literally correct version given in the right-hand column.",

        "Bill laughed too.",
        "laugh(bill) Bill laughed.",
        "We will assume that if the context is loosely specified enough to permit alternative realizations of the same content, then different versions of the same text could be generated or analysed: (1) Joe sneezed and laughed.",

        "Joe and Bill laughed.",
        "Joe sneezed.",
        "He laughed.",
        "So did Bill.",
        "Secondly, we illustrate the formalism and the general approach by developing an account of contextual interpretation based on a kind of quasi-logical form and giving an account of a fragment (in the sense of Montague [1974d) that treats several core phenomena of English contextual dependence.",
        "We also have some theoretical objectives: the particular approach illustrated here, like most computational approaches to contextual interpretation, uses an intermediate quasi-logical form representation level.",
        "Using such a level of representation incurs an obligation to say what it means (\"no notation without denotation\").",
        "We try to show how the theory presented here leads to a natural semantics for these quasi-logical forms, and indeed leads to a truth theory for contextually dependent interpretation that supports a natural consequence relation, and one appropriate for cases where interpretations are not fully specified.",
        "We relate this approach both to the classical tradition of formal linguistic semantics exemplified by Davidson (1972) and Montague (1974b) and more recent literature on the use of underspecification in semantics.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next section we give an outline of the formalism and illustrate with the small fragment of English that has been implemented within this framework.",
        "We present analyses of the contextual interpretation of pronouns, definites, ellipsis, focus, and quantifier scope.",
        "There is far more to say about each of these phenomena, of course, and the analyses here are by no means claimed to be definitive.",
        "The aim is merely to show that we can, to a first approximation, provide a reasonably fully worked out description of these phenomena in a truly bidirectional way.",
        "We then go on to compare the current approach with that of some other theories with similar aims: the \"standard\" version of quasi-logical form implemented in the Core Language Engine, as rationally reconstructed by Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and Crouch and Pulman (1994); underspecified Discourse Representation Theory (Reyle 1993); and the \"glue language\" approach of Dalrymple et al.",
        "(1996).",
        "Finally, we discuss some of the semantic and logical issues raised by the approach described here, in particular the extent to which the theory meets the desiderata for accounts of underspecification outlined by van Eijck and Jaspars (1996), and the extent to which the theory supplies a methodologically satisfactory account of truth and interpretation for sentences involving contextually dependent constructs."

        "The major components and assumptions of the approach to contextual interpretation here are as follows: 1.",
        "We assume that the output of grammatical processing of a sentence is a quasi-logical form, henceforth QLF.",
        "Of course, for anything other than a trivial grammar, a given sentence will typically yield many QLFs.",
        "We will assume that syntactic and lexical disambiguation have taken place and that the only things still needed for a complete interpretation are the resolution of constructs like pronouns, definites, ellipsis, and so on.",
        "We return later to issues concerning robustness of linguistic coverage and to the interleaving of contextual disambiguation with syntactic and semantic processing.",
        "For concreteness, we are assuming here that QLFs are built using a simple unification grammar formalism of the type described in Pulman (1996), and that a chart parser and semantic head-driven generator are",
        "used for the analysis of sentences to QLFs and vice versa.",
        "But little of this detail is essential to our main aims: a wide range of grammatical formalisms and interpreters would be compatible with the basic assumptions of the contextual interpretation mechanism, assuming only that the same grammatical description is used in both the analysis and generation direction.",
        "What is required is that QLFs are, as here, expressed in a typed higher-order logic, augmented with constructs representing the interpretation of context-dependent elements (pronouns, ellipsis, focus, etc.).",
        "These constructs correspond as directly as possible to properties of the linguistic structure that express them and are, to as small an extent as possible, dependent on the requirements of contextual resolution (unlike, say, the metavariables of standard QLFs [Alshawi and Crouch 1992], or the labels of UDRS [Reyle 1996], which are motivated entirely by the mechanisms that operate on them after grammatical processing).",
        "Syntactic properties relevant for binding constraints, parallelism, scope constraints, and so on, are not directly represented at QLF (again unlike standard QLFs) but are assumed to be available as components of the linguistic context.' The context-independent meanings of sentences, which we refer to as resolved logical forms (RLFs), are expressed in the \"ordinary\" subset of the QLF language.",
        "A fully resolved RLF can be directly evaluated for truth: it contains no QLF constructs.",
        "Since it is just an expression of \"ordinary\" logic, it could serve as a knowledge representation and reasoning language, and thus the output of some information system producing such representations could in principle feed directly into generation (modulo well-known \"equivalence of logical form\" problems).",
        "3.",
        "\"Contexts\" are here modeled by sets of sentences in the RLF subset of this language, with some kind of salience ordering on them (recency, in the implementation), about which we say nothing more.",
        "These sentences may, but need not, arise from prior linguistic processing.",
        "Contexts contain information about the form as well as the content of previous utterances, as mentioned earlier.",
        "Context sentences may also reflect features of the nonlinguistic context gained by direct observation or inference.",
        "This is a very minimal theory of context.",
        "We need to be able to reason about context, hence we need it represented in a logic.",
        "We need to be able to refer to properties of the form of linguistic utterances as well as their content, hence context must contain this information too.",
        "We obviously need some nonlinguistic information.",
        "We also need some structure to reflect the fact that not all components of the context are relevant to everything, hence salience.",
        "This is all we need for the time being, although there is clearly much more to be said.",
        "These state a contextual equivalence between an expression containing one or more QLF constructs (the left-hand side) and an expression containing at least one fewer QLF constructs (the right-hand side).",
        "QLF and RLF are therefore sometimes used to signify partially as well as fully (un)resolved LFs.",
        "An equivalence can be paraphrased as: \"In a context where these conditions hold, this QLF can be interpreted as this RLF,\" or \"In a context where these conditions hold, this RLF can be expressed as this QLF.\"",

        "Applicability is determined in two steps: first, equivalences are indexed by any QLF constructs that they involve (like he), and secondly, higher-order unification is tried between the QLF and the left-hand side of an equivalence retrieved by the indexing.",
        "The indexing step is necessary both for completeness and for efficiency: if we just used HOU, then, since it is not decidable, equivalences that did not match the QLF could lead to nontermination, or, at best, to spurious matches that would be filtered out expensively when checking the conditions.",
        "(To see how this could be so, consider that trying to higher order unify Pred(he) with any formula F of the appropriate type will succeed with Pred = Ax.F, where x does not occur in F.) Other than this, application of equivalences is entirely free and nondeterministic.",

        "We assume that it is possible to represent structural constraints like binding and scoping principles as conditions in an equivalence.",
        "To keep the presentation manageable, we abstract away from these issues, and also avoid questions of how the correct interpretation is actually chosen, where there is a choice.",

        "The starting point for the approach followed here was a dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the theory of quasi-logical form as described in Alshawi (1990, 1992), and implemented in SRI'S Core Language Engine (CLE).",
        "In the CLE-QLF approach, as rationally",
        "reconstructed by Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and Crouch and Putman (1994), the context-independent meaning of a sentence is given by one or more QLFs that are built directly from syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "Just as here, these QLFs represent the basic predicate argument structure of the sentence, and contain constructs which represent those aspects of the meaning of the sentence that are dependent on context.",
        "The effects of contextual resolution are uniformly represented via the instantiation of metavariables.",
        "This instantiation is brought about by the operation of resolution rules, which are essentially user-defined Prolog predicates finding appropriate instantiations for metavariables from the current context.",
        "Contextual resolution is therefore a process of adding information to an underspecified meaning representation until it is sufficiently specified for the task at hand.",
        "(In translation, for example, it need not be fully specified.",
        "For tasks like database query, it usually will have to be).",
        "This process is completely monotonic and therefore fulfils a necessary (though not a sufficient) condition for reversibility.",
        "Some simplified examples will give the flavor of this theory.",
        "A pronoun is represented at QLF by a term containing essentially a syntactic category, an index, a restriction predicate, and a metavariable; schematically: term(pro,<idx>,<restriction>,<metavrble>) Thus a sentence like he sneezed will, ignoring tense and aspect, be represented as follows at the QLF level; and, when the metavariable has been instantiated to the contextually preferred candidate referent, at the resolved quasi-logical form (RQLF ) level:",
        "Scoping of quantifiers is also a matter of instantiating metavariables.",
        "QLF formulas containing quantifiers are prefixed by a scoping metavariable which scoping resolution rules instantiate to a list of the indices associated with quantifiers, in an order that indicates the preferred scoping:",
        "The denotational semantics of RQLF structures involving instantiated scope and referent metavariables is given in terms of simple interpretation rules that have the effect of interpreting the quantifiers as having the scopes indicated by the lists of indices, and the pronouns as having the interpretation of the instantiation of the metavariable (in these cases at least).",
        "Alshawi and Crouch (1992) present an illustrative first-order fragment along these lines and are able to supply a coherent formal semantics for the CLF-QLFs themselves, using a technique essentially equivalent to supervaluations: a QLF is true iff all its possible RQLFs are, false iff they are all false, and undefined otherwise.",
        "There are many good things about this approach.",
        "It has proved itself amenable to a large-scale implementation of impressive coverage, generality, and relative efficiency (Alshawi 1992).",
        "It has the theoretically desirable property of monotonicity and,",
        "in practice, a large degree of reversibility.",
        "In the implementation, generation can take place from the QLF level, or from resolved QLF.",
        "(Which is the appropriate level depends partly on the application: generation from QLF is all that is needed for many types of translation, for example.",
        "Generation from resolved QLF is chiefly used for checking with a user that resolution has accurately resolved contextually dependent constructs.)",
        "Furthermore, QLF has, in principle at least, a coherent formal semantics via the supervaluation technique – these are not uninterpreted representations (although the supervaluation semantics does not lead to an appropriate consequence relation, as we shall see below).",
        "Nevertheless, there are several aspects of the theory that are not completely satisfactory Firstly, the QLFs themselves, although they are built by technically compositional semantic rules from syntactic structures, contain many constructs that are solely motivated by the requirements of the resolution process.",
        "QLFs contain, to take the most obvious example, indices and metavariables: constructs for which there is no apparent motivation in the syntax and morphology of English.",
        "Secondly, the semantic relation between underspecified QLFs and their further specified RQLF representations is given entirely in terms of subsumption: a QLF subsumes all its possible RQLFs.",
        "They differ syntactically only via the instantiation of metavariables, giving a particularly simple way of determining subsumption.",
        "But this notion of subsumption does not model the intuitive relationship between contextually dependent sentences and (relatively) contextually independent paraphrases that one might expect: the QLF for he sneezed, for example, does not subsume the RQLF of John sneezed even in a context where he can only be interpreted as John.",
        "In fact, when the CLE generates the sentence John sneezed as a check that he sneezed has been interpreted correctly, it does not do so from the resolved QLF corresponding to the latter.",
        "This RQLF has the form: sneeze(term (pro,* 23,masc, John)) But the QLF corresponding to John sneezed is: sneeze(term(name,+32,),Y.name(Y,john),Referent)) Some inference has to take place to relate the RQLF for the interpreted sentence to a QLF that unambiguously expresses its contextualized meaning.",
        "This makes the task of expressing the output of some application system in a context-dependent way quite difficult: rather than being related to an RQLF, this output has to be related to a QLF that is sufficiently instantiated for a contextually unambiguous sentence to be generated from it.",
        "The resolution mechanism is not intended to be reversible, although by redefining resolution rules, reversibility is achievable to some extent within the limitations just discussed (Hurst 1994).",
        "A third problem arises with the approach to the semantics of QLFs that this notion of the relationship between QLF and RQLF encourages one to adopt: it is that taken by Alshawi and Crouch (1992).",
        "This describes the semantics of QLFs via a supervaluation over the semantics of the RQLFs that they subsume.",
        "Although the problem does not arise for the simple fragment they illustrate there, if their approach were extended to cover a wider range of constructions, it would be found that many QLFs subsumed RQLFs that are not actually permitted by the resolution rules: for example, those that can only arise via a violation of scoping or binding constraints.",
        "The role of resolution rules (for perfectly good presentational reasons) is completely ignored by their treatment.",
        "However, it is really the case that in giving the semantics of a QLF, one is interested only in the set of RQLFs that are obtainable from it under closure of the resolution rules.",
        "Ideally, therefore, we would like a formal reconstruction of resolution",
        "rules as well.",
        "This is so, not just for reasons of formal hygiene in trying to make logical sense out of underspecified representations, but also because resolution rules and the knowledge they express are an important object of study in their own right.",
        "Anyone who has built a wide-coverage system knows that the range of context-dependent phenomena encountered in real life is a lot wider than the preoccupations of many linguists might suggest.",
        "In the CLE, for example, contextual resolution forms a larger part of the system than do syntactic and semantic processing.",
        "Unfortunately, in the CLE there is no formal theory of resolution rules, and thus no prospect of capturing their role in assigning a semantics to QLFs.",
        "A further problem, that the supervaluation semantics does not yield the right consequence relation, is discussed below.",
        "The QLF-based theory illustrated in the approach advocated here does not suffer from these problems:",
        "• QLFs contain only information for which there is a direct syntactic or morphological reflex.",
        "In particular, there are no indices or metavariables.",
        "• the relation between QLF and RLF is directly reversible.",
        "• the semantics of QLFs is completely given by the conditional equivalences that relate them to RLFs, thus avoiding the problem of the subsumption-based treatment and the associated supervaluation semantics.",

        "Why would we want to be sure that we have a coherent semantics for QLFs and a sensible consequence relation?",
        "There are several reasons for doing so.",
        "Firstly, there are overwhelming arguments that some level like QLF is essential as part of a theory of utterance interpretation, both for linguistic and computational reasons.",
        "The practical arguments for this position are well known and have been implicit in computational practice since at least Woods (1968, 1978).",
        "It is simply not feasible to interleave the processes of quantifier scope or reference and ellipsis resolution, for example, with the otherwise compositional process of meaning assembly.",
        "The space of possible interpre",
        "tations becomes unmanageably large.",
        "However, postulating such a level of representation incurs an obligation to say what it means: logical and computational hygiene require us to supply a semantic account of it.",
        "Secondly, since the processes of contextual interpretation involve a certain amount of inference to be successfully achieved, and since some of the ingredients in that inference are components of meaning of the sentence itself (such as the fact that a pronoun is masculine, or that a determiner like any is in the scope of a negative) we need to be sure that our partly specified representations have enough of a semantics that we can carry out this reasoning in a logically respectable way.",
        "In fact some types of linguistic processing presuppose that meanings are not fully resolved.",
        "Consider the following exchange:",
        "(46) A: She's here!",
        "B: Who is?",
        "The VP ellipsis in Ws response has to be resolved with respect to an antecedent sentence that cannot be fully resolved: indeed, 13's question would be pointless if it was.",
        "Observations like these compel the conclusion that partially resolved LFs need to have enough of a semantics to support this kind of inference, while still being subject to further linguistic processing.",
        "Thirdly, there are many practical natural language processing applications that can be carried out without needing (or being able) to produce a fully contextualized interpretation of a sentence.",
        "Translation is an obvious example: while there will always be some cases for which full interpretation is required for a correct translation to be possible, in general, translation on the basis of purely linguistic properties can often be perfectly adequate.",
        "A less obvious example is information extraction: since it is not possible at the current state of the art to find complete grammatical analyses for every sentence, let alone full contextual interpretations, information extraction proceeds by reasoning from partial or underspecified representations that are in most logical respects the same kind of animal as the unresolved QLFs we have been talking about.",
        "Information extraction systems typically carry out such reasoning in a way that is, in Jerry Hobbs' phrase, unhindered by theory.",
        "Developing a calculus for reasoning with QLFs is too large a task to be undertaken here.",
        "But the general outlines are reasonably clear, and we can adapt some of the UDRS (Reyle 1995) work to our own framework.",
        "Reyle points out that many of the inferences involving underspecified representations that we would like to capture rely on the assumption that whatever context disambiguates the premise also disambiguates the conclusion, even if we do not know what that context or disambiguation is.",
        "His example is: If the students get £10 then they buy books.",
        "The students get .£10.",
        "They buy books.",
        "Our treatment of the interpretation of QLFs makes it a tautology that if one resolved form implies another, then the corresponding QLFs also do, given a fixed context.",
        "The other common patterns of inference that we want to capture are those in which some (unambiguous) conclusion will follow from an unresolved form, whichever res",
        "olution of the unresolved form is correct.",
        "Examples of these are things like: Every student went to a lecture.",
        "Mary is a student.",
        "Mary went to a lecture.",
        "Two hundred companies lost more than $2 million last year.",

        "A teacher was dismissed.",
        "The first argument is valid whichever scoping of the first premise is taken, and it is possible that most people would accept the argument as valid without even noticing the ambiguity.",
        "The second argument is valid whether the premise is construed in a collective or a distributive way.",
        "The third argument is valid whichever scoping of the relative clause is correct.",
        "We can begin to capture such inferences by using proof rules for QLFs (partly modeled after those for UDRS in Reyle 11995]) such as these:",
        "CONJ and QUANT need considerable refinement in order to cover more than the simplest cases, but they will give the correct results for the latter two examples.",

        "We have presented what is probably the first fully bidirectional formalism for the interpretation and generation of quasi-logical form representations and illustrated its application with a fragment of English grammar that contains (admittedly simple) instances of some of the most important types of context-dependent construct.",
        "This fragment has been fully implemented and works as advertised.",
        "We have tried to show that the interpretation of QLFs implicit in our treatment is a logically coherent one, supplying a kind of contextual truth definition for unresolved QLF constructs.",
        "We have also argued that this truth definition supports a notion of logical consequence that meets all the obvious desiderata for such a relation and have sketched how a calculus for reasoning directly with wholly or partially unresolved QLFs could be developed, again in a logically coherent way.",
        "We conclude with a brief discussion of a series of issues that arise in thinking how to extend and apply the system described here.",
        "Robustness.",
        "The work described here is an instance of what might be called \"classical\" NLP: a (hopefully) neat bit of theory, a nice clean logical formulation, and a small-scale implementation.",
        "This kind of thing is currently desperately unfashionable on the",
        "grounds that such methods cannot scale up to real-world applications.",
        "(If you want to get ahead, get a corpus.)",
        "This is not the place to argue over whether this view is the correct one, but it is worth pointing out that the current theory is, at least in one direction, consistent with the kind of large-scale statistical processing that is viewed as the appropriate alternative.",
        "It was stated earlier that the grammatical formalism used was not an essential component of the theory.",
        "Thus any alternative robust parsing system could be plugged in instead.",
        "What is required is that QLFs be stated in a typed higher-order logic.",
        "The QLFs we have been dealing with correspond to complete and correct grammatical analyses of sentences: in the real world, as we know, such things are not usually available.",
        "But in fact for the current approach, they are not needed: a partial or fragmentary analysis can be represented in QLF either by introducing a quantifier over a relation that is assumed to hold between the components (thus presupposing that there was a coherent message expressed by the partially analyzed sentence) or by introducing Skolem-like predicate constants to achieve the same effect.",
        "(See Pinkal [1995] for a similar suggestion.)",
        "The conditional equivalences will apply to such representations directly, leaving the quantified relation or the Skolern constants in the resolved form.",
        "Of course, the resulting system will not be fully reversible, but it would be capable in principle of carrying out contextual disambiguation as part of a robust text-processing system.",
        "Disambiguation.",
        "We have been assuming that the \"correct\" QLF has been chosen before applying our conditional equivalences.",
        "However, this is an unrealistic assumption in the fully general case, because it is quite conceivable that lexical disambiguation could require some contextual disambiguation first.",
        "Likewise, many PP attachment decisions have to be made on contextual grounds.",
        "There are several stategies that might be pursued.",
        "One is to adopt Pinkal's \"radical underspecification\" approach (Pinkal 1995) and use underspecified representations for all types of ambiguity, even syntactic ambiguity.",
        "The more conservative approach is to try to integrate existing statistical disambiguation schemes for QLFs, either individually or in a \"packed\" structure (Alshawi and Carter 1994), with the resolution process as described here.",
        "Alternatively, I believe it is worth exploring the approach to disambiguation described in Pulman (2000), which would mesh nicely with the theory presented here.",
        "Efficiency.",
        "Extending coverage of linguistic constructs, and trying to achieve robustness or integrate with disambiguation schemes each pose the further problem of the efficiency of the HOU-based resolution process itself.",
        "While efficiency is acceptable for the short, simple sentences illustrated earlier, the computational properties of HOU mean that processing times increase in a highly nonlinear way when larger QLFs are encountered.",
        "There are several avenues worth exploring to solve this problem.",
        "While the equivalences are stated in a direction-neutral mariner, there is scope in an implementation for compiling them in different ways for the analysis and synthesis directions (recall that the equivalences decompose to a conjunction of higher-order Horn clauses).",
        "Once you know which direction you are going in, most of the unifications actually reduce to matchings (since one side of the equation is fully instantiated), which may allow for various optimizations to the unification algorithm itself.",
        "Prehofer (1994) describes some tractable subcases of higher-order unification.",
        "Another strategy is to change the control regime by which the equivalences apply.",
        "The regime assumed here, and that implemented, is entirely nondeterministic.",
        "Equiv",
        "alences apply to whole QLFs, in any order, whenever they can.",
        "This means that many equivalences are tried which are later filtered out because their associated conditions cannot be met.",
        "This is both expensive and an unrealistic model of language processing.",
        "The other strategy is to make the resolution process incremental, rather than operating on whole QLFs at a time.",
        "To some extent, the linguistic facts force this option on us anyway, of course, because for many types of elliptical or anaphoric devices the appropriate context is an earlier part of the same sentence.",
        "It ought to be a relatively straightforward matter to devise a control strategy to resolve QLFs essentially a component at a time, perhaps guided by the original syntactic structure.",
        "This would bound the scope of higher order unify and keep it manageable, as well as having an intuitively satisfactory \"dynamic\" aspect to the resolution process.",
        "(The strategy used above is incremental and dynamic in that only one construct at a time is resolved, and each resolution changes the context, but this does not necessarily always correspond to a left-to-right traversal of the original sentence).",
        "There are some interesting interactions with the incremental interpretation scheme proposed in Pulman (1986) to be explored here.",
        "Contextual Resolution Primitives.",
        "Currently the content of the conditions in conditional equivalences is rather unconstrained: any Prolog-definable predicate could be used.",
        "My hope is that in developing descriptions of a wider range of context-dependent phenomena, a set of conditions that recur (such as \"parallel\") can be isolated and defined in a way that covers their use in resolving different types of contextual dependency.",
        "Eventually one might hope that all the equivalences necessary would call on just a restricted range of such contextual predicates.",
        "These predicates would then in effect constitute the primitives of the linguistic theory of contextual resolution, factoring out all of the inferential processes that are not specifically linguistic.",
        "In moving towards such a theory, the requirement of reversibility is a hard one, but I believe it places a useful and productive methodological constraint on us, as well as yielding a significant practical payoff."
