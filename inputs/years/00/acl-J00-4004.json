        "Siegel and McKeown Improving Aspectual Classification incorporated a subset of only five indicators each.",
        "In particular, manner adverb, which ranked highest by logistic regression, is not incorporated in the example function tree induced by GP.",
        "This may be because this indicator only applies to a small number of verbs, as shown in Table 13, and because an if-rule such as that captured by logistic regression is difficult to encode with a function tree with no conditional primitives.",
        "â€¢ Learning methods discovered that some indicators are particularly useful for both classification tasks.",
        "For example, the same two indicators were weighted most heavily by logistic regression for both tasks: duration in-PP and manner adverb.",
        "â€¢ However, in general, learning methods emphasized different linguistic indicators for different classification tasks.",
        "For example, decision tree induction used frequency as the main discriminator to classify clauses according to stativity, while the perfect indicator was the main discriminator for classification according to completedness.",
        "Comparing the ability of learning methods to combine linguistic indicators is difficult, since they rank differently depending on the classification task and evaluation criteria.",
        "For example, the relative accuracies of the three supervised learning procedures rank in opposite orders when comparing the results for stativity to the results for completedness.",
        "The unsupervised grouping of verbs provides an additional method for aspectual classification according to stativity.",
        "Co-occurrence distributions between the verb and direct object inform the aspectual classification of verbs.",
        "This provides information beyond the 14 linguistic indicators that can also be derived automatically.",
        "However, due to the sparsity intrinsic to pairs of open-class categories such as verb-object pairs, this approach was only evaluated over a small set of frequent verbs."
