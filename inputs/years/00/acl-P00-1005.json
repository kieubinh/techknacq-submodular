        "A Transfer-Based Machine Translation method generally has four steps (Kim, 1994); morphological analysis of source language, syntactic analysis of source language, structure transfer to the target language, and sentence generation of the target language.",
        "In structure transfer step, transfer patterns used to be greatly lexicalized in order to raise the accuracy of translation.",
        "Pattern-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) performs both syntactic analysis and structure transfer simultaneously using this lexicalized patterns (Takeda, 1996).",
        "PBMT can shorten the translation time and raise the accuracy of syntactic analysis by using the lexicalized patterns.",
        "At first, since all patterns were short phrase-length patterns, many syntactic ambiguities occurred in pattern matching.",
        "As a result, patterns became longer to sentence-length to reduce ambiguities.",
        "But, sentence-length patterns cause pattern sparseness problem, because the same number of sentence-length patterns can cover less sentences than the same number of phrase-length patterns.",
        "To overcome this problem, Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted example-based approach.",
        "However, example-based approach has some problems.",
        "One of the problems is that two different verbs of target language take two semantically similar nouns as objects respectively although a verb of source language takes the nouns as its objects.",
        "For example, a Korean verb `ta-da' with objects `bus(bus)' and `mal(horse)' is translated into English verbs `take' and `ride' respectively.",
        "Many researches were done to solve them.",
        "They used syntactic collocation (Kim et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1999), semantic constraint by thesaurus (Moon et al., 1998), semantic features (Palmer et al., 1999) and statistical information (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994).",
        "But when syntactic collocation is used, each example for a verb has the same effect to select the proper word sense of the verb.",
        "Consequently, it is difficult to obtain the representative examples and to describe senses which have domains of different size.",
        "In addition, when only semantic constraint by thesaurus is used, it is difficult to obtain good translated words because of the insufficient thesaurus problem.",
        "As a result, we use a hybrid method of both exact example matching technique with syntactic collocation and semantic constraint by thesaurus.",
        "We use phrase-length patterns to solve pattern sparseness problem and propose two level selection method of translation pattern to reduce the ambiguities of pattern matching."
