        "They operate by decomposing the given representations into (arbitrarily large) fragments and recomposing those pieces to analyze new utterances.",
        "A probability model is used to choose from the collection of different fragments of different sizes those that make up the most appropriate analysis of an utterance.",
        "DOP models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art parsing performance on benchmarks such as the Wall Street Journal corpus (see Bod 2000a).",
        "The original DOP model in Bod (1993) was based on utterance analyses represented as surface trees, and is equivalent to a Stochastic Tree-Substitution Grammar.",
        "But the model has also been applied to several other grammatical frameworks, e.g. Tree-Insertion Grammar (Hoogweg 2000), Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Neumann 1998), Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bod & Kaplan 1998; Cormons 1999), Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Neumann & Flickinger 1999), and Montague Grammar (Bonnema et al.",
        "1997; Bod 1999).",
        "Most probability models for DOP use the relative frequency estimator to estimate fragment probabilities, although Bod (2000b) trains fragment probabilities by a maximum likelihood reestimation procedure belonging to the class of expectation-maximization algorithms.",
        "The DOP model has also been tested as a model for human sentence processing (Bod 2000d).",
        "This paper presents ongoing work on DOP models for Lexical-Functional Grammar representations, known as LFG-DOP (Bod & Kaplan 1998).",
        "We develop a parser which uses fragments from LFG-annotated sentences to parse new sentences, and we derive some experimental properties of LFG-DOP on two LFG-annotated corpora: the Verbmobil and Homecentre corpus.",
        "The experiments show that the DOP hypothesis, which states that there is an increase in parse accuracy if larger fragments are taken into account (Bod 1998), is confirmed for LFG-DOP.",
        "We report on an improved search technique for estimating the most probable analysis.",
        "While a Monte Carlo search converges provably to the most probable parse, a Viterbi n best search performs as well as Monte Carlo while its processing time is two orders of magnitude faster.",
