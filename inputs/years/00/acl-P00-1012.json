        "The question of robustness is a perennial problem for parsing systems.",

        "In natural language generation, on the other hand, robustness is not an issue in the same way.",
        "While a tactical generator must be able to deal with a wide range of semantic inputs, it only needs to produce grammatical strings, and the grammar writer can select in advance which construction types will be considered grammatical.",
        "However, it is important that a generator not produce strings which are strictly speaking grammatical but for some reason unusual.",
        "This is a particular problem for dialog systems which use the same grammar for both parsing and generation.",
        "The looseness required for robust parsing is in direct opposition to the tightness needed for high quality generation.",
        "One area where this tension shows itself clearly is in the order of prenominal modifiers in English.",
        "In principle, prenominal adjectives can, depending on context, occur in almost any order: the large red American car ?",
        "?the American red large car *car American red the large Some orders are more marked than others, but none are strictly speaking ungrammatical.",
        "So, the grammar should not put any strong constraints on adjective order.",
        "For a generation system, however, it is important that sequences of adjectives be produced in the ‘correct’ order.",
        "Any other order will at best sound odd and at worst convey an unintended meaning.",
        "Unfortunately, while there are rules of thumb for ordering adjectives, none lend themselves to a computational implementation.",
        "For example, adjectives denoting size do tend to precede adjectives denoting color.",
        "However, these rules under-specify the relative order for many pairs of adjectives and are often difficult to apply in practice.",

        "To test the effectiveness of this strategy, we took as a dataset the first one million sentences of the written portion of the British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995).1 We held out a randomly selected 10% of this dataset and constructed a back-off bigram model from the remaining 90% using the CMU-Cambridge statistical language modeling toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997).",

        "To order the pair {a, b}, count how many times the ordered sequences (a, b) and (b, a) appear in the training data and output the pair in the order which occurred more often.",
        "This method has the advantage of being conceptually very simple, easy to implement, and highly accurate for pairs of adjectives which actually appear in the training data.",
        "Applying this method to the adjectives sequences taken from the BNC yields better than 98% accuracy for pairs that occurred in the training data.",
        "However, since as we have seen, the majority of pairs occur only once, the overall accuracy of this method is 59.72%, only slightly better than random guessing.",
        "Fortunately, another strength of this method is that it is easy to identify those pairs for which it is likely to give the right result.",
        "This means that one can fall back on another less accurate but more general method for pairs which did not occur in the training data.",
        "In particular, if we randomly assign an order to unseen pairs, we can cut the error rate in half and raise the overall accuracy to 78.28%.",
        "It should be noted that the direct evidence method as employed here is slightly different from Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou’s: we simply compare raw token counts and take the larger value, while they applied a significance test to estimate the probability that a difference between counts arose strictly by chance.",
        "Like one finds in a trade-off between precision and recall, the use of a significance test slightly improved the accuracy of the method for those pairs which it had an opinion about, but also increased the number of pairs which had to be randomly assigned an order.",
        "As a result, the net impact of using a significance test for the BNC data was a very slight decrease in the overall prediction accuracy.",
        "The direct evidence method is straightforward to implement and gives impressive results for applications that involve a small number of frequent adjectives which occur in all relevant combinations in the training data.",

        "Therefore, in the face of this evidence we can assign this pair the order (large, green), which not coincidently is the correct English word order.",
        "The difficulty with applying the transitive closure method to any large dataset is that there often will be evidence for both orders of any given pair.",

        "Memory-based (also known as lazy, nearest neighbor, instance-based, or case-based) approaches to classification work by storing all of the instances in the training data, along with their classes.",
        "To classify a new instance, the store of previously seen instances is searched to find those instances which most resemble the new instance with respect to some similarity metric.",
        "The new instance is then assigned a class based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors in the space of previously seen instances.",
        "To make the comparison between the direct evidence method and memory-based learning clearer, we can frame the problem of adjective ordering as a classification problem.",
        "Given an unordered pair {a, b}, we can assign it some canonical order to get an instance ab.",
        "Then, if a precedes b more often than b precedes a in the training data, we assign the instance ab to the class a � b.",
        "Otherwise, we assign it to the class b � a.",
        "Seen as a solution to a classification problem, the direct evidence method then is an application of memory-based learning where the chosen similarity metric is strict identity.",
        "As with the interpretation of the direct evidence method explored in the previous section, this view both reveals a reason why the method is not very effective and also indicates a direction which can be taken to improve it.",
        "By requiring the new instance to be identical to a previously seen instance in order to classify it, the direct evidence method is unable to generalize from seen pairs to unseen pairs.",
        "Therefore, to improve the method, we need a more appropriate similarity metric that allows the classifier to get information from previously seen pairs which are relevant to but not identical to new unseen pairs.",
        "Following the conventional linguistic wisdom (Quirk et al., 1985, e.g.), this similarity metric should pick out adjectives which belong to the same semantic class.",
        "Unfortunately, for many adjectives this information is difficult or impossible to come by.",
        "Machine readable dictionaries and lexical databases such as WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) do provide some information about semantic classes.",
        "However, the semantic classification in a lexical database may not make exactly the distinctions required for predicting adjective order.",
        "More seriously, available lexical databases are by necessity limited to a relatively small number of words, of which a relatively small fraction are adjectives.",
        "In practice, the available sources of semantic information only provide semantic classifications for fairly common adjectives, and these are precisely the adjectives which are found frequently in the training data and so for which semantic information is least necessary.",
        "While we do not reliably have access to the meaning of an adjective, we do always have access to its form.",
        "And, fortunately, for many of the cases in which the direct evidence method fails, finding a previously seen pair of adjectives with a similar form has the effect of finding a pair with a similar meaning.",
        "For example, suppose we want to order the adjective pair {21 -year-old, Armenian}.",
        "If this pair appears in the training data, then the previous occurrences of this pair will be used to predict the order and the method reduces to direct evidence.",
        "If, on the other hand, that particular pair did not appear in the training data, we can base the classification on previously seen pairs with a similar form.",
        "In this way, we may find pairs like { 73-year-old, Colombian} and {44 -year-old,Norwegian}, which have more or less the same distribution as the target pair.",
        "To test the effectiveness of a form-based similarity metric, we encoded each adjective pair ab as a vector of 16 features (the last 8 characters of a and the last 8 characters of b) and a class a � b or b � a. Constructing the instance base and testing the classification was performed using the TiMBL 3.0 (Daelemans et al., 2000) memory-based learning system.",
        "Instances to be classified were compared to previously seen instances by counting the number of feature values that the two instances had in common.",
        "In computing the similarity score, features were weighted by their information gain, an information theoretic measure of the relevance of a feature for determining the correct classification (Quinlan, 1986; Daelemans and van den Bosch, 1992).",
        "This weighting reduces the sensitivity of memory based learning to the presence of irrelevant features.",
        "Given the probability pi of finding each class i in the instance base D, we can compute the entropy H(D), a measure of the amount of uncertainty in D: H(D) =−∑pilog2pi pi In the case of the adjective ordering data, there are two classes a � b and b � a, each of which occurs with a probability of roughly 0.5, so the entropy of the instance base is close to 1 bit.",
        "We can also compute the entropy of a feature f which takes values V as the weighted sum of the entropy of each of the values V:",
        "Here H(Df=vi) is the entropy of subset of the instance base which has value vi for feature f. The information gain of a feature then is simply the difference between the total entropy of the instance base and the entropy of a single feature:",
        "The information gain G(D, f) is the reduction in uncertainty in D we expect to achieve by learning the value of the feature f. In other words, knowing the value of a feature with a higher G gets us closer on average to knowing the class of an instance than knowing the value of a feature with a lower G does.",
        "The similarity Δ between two instances then is the number of feature values they have in common, weighted by the information gain:",
        "Classification was based on the five training instances most similar to the instance to be classified, and produced an overall prediction accuracy of 89.34% for the BNC data."
