        "are pushed having the subject my dog, the object the ball and the time modifier Today, and the ball having the location modifier on (the floor.",
        "The resulting annotation is my dog −subj→ pushed on −mod-loc→ the ball",
        "etc.",
        "GRs are the objects of study in relational grammar (Perlmutter, 1983).",
        "In the SPARKLE project (Carroll et al., 1997), GRs form the top layer of a three layer syntax scheme.",
        "Many systems (e.g., the KERNEL system (Palmer et al., 1993)) use GRs as an intermediate form when determining the semantics of syntactically parsed text.",
        "GRs are often stored in structures similar to the F-structures of lexical-functional grammar (Kaplan, 1994).",
        "A complication is that different sets of GRs are useful for different purposes.",
        "For example, Ferro et al.",
        "(1999) is interested in semantic interpretation, and needs to differentiate between time, location and other modifiers.",
        "The SPARKLE project (Carroll et al., 1997), on the other hand, does not differentiate between these types of modifiers.",
        "As has been mentioned by John Carroll (personal communication), combining modifier types together is fine for information retrieval.",
        "Also, having less differentiation of the modifiers can make it easier to find them (Ferro et al., 1999).",
        "Furthermore, unless the desired set of GRs matches the set already annotated in some large training corpus,l one will have to either manually write rules to find the GRs, as done in Ait-Mokhtar and Chanod (1997), or annotate a new training corpus for the desired set.",
        "Manually writing rules is expensive, as is annotating a large corpus.",
        "Often, one may only have the resources to produce a small annotated training set, and many of the less common features of the set's",
        "domain may not appear at all in that set.",
        "In contrast are existing systems that perform well (probably due to a large annotated training set or a set of carefully hand-crafted rules) on related (but different) annotation standards.",
        "Such systems will cover many more domain features, but because the annotation standards are slightly different, some of those features will be annotated in a different way than in the small training and test set.",
        "A way to try to combine the different advantages of these small training data sets and existing systems which produce related annotations is to use a sequence of two systems.",
        "We first use an existing annotation system which can handle many of the less common features, i.e., those which do not appear in the small training set.",
        "We then train a second system with that same small training set to take the output of the first system and correct for the differences in annotations.",
        "This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation.",
        "Hwa (1999) describes a somewhat similar approach for finding parse brackets which combines a fully annotated related training data set and a large but incompletely annotated final training data set.",
        "Both these works deal with just one (word boundary) or two (start and end parse bracket) annotation label types and the same label types are used in both the existing annotation system/training set and the final (small) training set.",
        "In comparison, our work handles many annotation label types, and the translation from the types used in the existing annotation system to the types in the small training set tends to be both more complicated and most easily determined by empirical means.",
        "Also, the type of baseline score being improved upon is different.",
        "Our work adds an existing system to improve the rules learned, while Palmer (1997) adds rules to improve an existing system's performance.",
        "We use this related system/small training set combination to improve the performance of the transformation-based error-driven learner described in Ferro et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "So far, this learner has started with a blank initial labeling of the GRs.",
        "This paper describes experiments where we replace this blank initial labeling with the output from an existing GR finder that is good at a somewhat different set of GR annotations.",
        "With each of the two existing GR finders that we use, we obtained improved results, with the improvement being more noticeable when the training set is smaller.",
        "We also find that the existing GR finders are quite uneven on how they improve the results.",
        "They each tend to concentrate on improving the recovery of a few kinds of relations, leaving most of the other kinds alone.",
        "We use this tendency to further boost the learner's performance by using a merger of these existing GR finders' output as the initial labeling."

        "(1999) system uses the annotation subj.",
        "We create the mapping by examining the training set to be given to the Ferro et al.",
        "(1999) system.",
        "For each type of relation ei output by the existing system when given the training set text, we look at what relation types (which tk's) co-occur with ei in the training set.",
        "We look at the tk's with the highest number of co-occurrences with that ei.",
        "If that tk is unique (no ties for the highest number of co-occurrences) and translating ei to that tk generates at least as many correct annotations in the training set as false alarms, then make that translation.",
        "Otherwise, translate ei to no relation.",
        "This latter translation is not uncommon.",
        "For example, in one run of our experiments, 9% of the relation instances in the training set were so translated, in another run, 46% of the instances were so translated.",
        "Some relations in the Carroll et al.",
        "(1999) system are between three or four elements.",
        "These relations are each first translated into a set of two element sub-relations before the examination process above is performed.",
        "Even before applying the rules, the translations find many of the desired annotations.",
        "However, the rules can considerably improve what is found.",
        "For example, in two of our early experiments, the translations by themselves produced F-scores (explained below) of about 40% to 50% After the learned rules were applied, those F-scores increased to about 70%.",
        "An alternative to performing translations is to use the untranslated initial annotations as an additional type of input to the rule system.",
        "This alternative, which we have yet to try, has the advantage of fitting into the transformation-based error-driven paradigm (Brill and Resnik, 1994) more cleanly than having a translation stage.",
