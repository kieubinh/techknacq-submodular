        "Previous work on nominal expression generation has mainly focused on the use of nominal expressions to achieve a speaker's goal to identify an object in the discourse context (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Passonneau, 1995).",
        "While other work suggests that it should be possible for a nominal expression to contribute to the satisfaction of additional",
        "goals (Appelt, 1985; Pollack, 1991; Stone and Webber, 1998), there is no systematic work describing what these goals might be and how speakers can use nominal expressions to achieve them.",
        "For example, consider the dialogue contribution in (1) in a context in which the color of the table is not necessary to IDENTIFY the discourse entity under discussion, but where the color of the item could be inferred to be MOTIVATION for the proposal.'",
        "(1) Let's use my table.",
        "It is red.",
        "A plausible hypothesis is that the alternative utterance in (2) could also support the MOTIVATION inference, and that the nominal expression my red table could thus simultaneously achieve the two goals of identifying the object under discussion and supporting the MOTIVATION inference.",
        "(2) Let's use my red table.",
        "We hypothesized that in addition to the conversational inference of MOTIVATION that a speaker might also attempt to achieve other task-relevant inferences via the generation of nominal expressions.",
        "In order to test this hypothesis further, we first specified a number of specific communicative goals that we believe can be addressed by nominal expressions in task-oriented dialogues.",
        "We then implemented two models of nominal expression generation.",
        "The first model was the INCREMENTAL MODEL of Dale and Reiter (1995), which implements a strategy for satisfying the identification goal.",
        "'For example, a possible context is one in which the speaker only has one table, and the speaker and hearer are trying for one color in a room, and have already agreed upon other red furniture.",
        "The second model we call the intentional influences model; this model of nominal expression generation attempts to simultaneously achieve the identification goal and to cue other task-related inferences with a single nominal expression.",
        "We then evaluated these two models using 13 of the dialogues from the COCONUT corpus of task-oriented dialogues (Di Eugenio et al., 1998).",
        "This subset of dialogues contains 166 non-pronominal discourse anaphoric expressions which we call REDESCRIPTIONS (e.g. my table and my red table in (1) and (2)).",
        "Our results show that the intentional influences model fits the re-descriptions in the corpus as well as previous accounts which focus solely on the identification goal.",
        "To test the validity of the set of inferences we considered in the intentional influences model, we also compared it to a model that addresses the identification goal but also includes additional mutually known attributes at random.",
        "We found that the inference set we considered was significantly better than random.",
        "Section 2 describes the COCONUT corpus, the task that the conversants were attempting to achieve, the conversational inferences relevant to the task, and our hypotheses about the way these conversational inferences could provide additional influences on the speaker's generation of nominal expressions.",
        "Section 3 explains how we tested our hypotheses and section 4 presents our results."

        "The COCONUT corpus consists of 24 computer-mediated dialogues in which two people collaborate on a simple design task, buying furniture for two rooms of a house.",
        "The participants' main goal is to negotiate the purchases; the items of highest priority are a sofa for the living room and a table and four chairs for the dining room.",
        "The participants also have specific secondary goals which further constrain the problem solving task.",
        "Participants are instructed to try to meet as many of these goals as possible, and are motivated to do so by associating points with satisfied goals.",
        "The secondary goals are: 1) use one color attribute value for all items within a room, 2) buy as much furniture as you can, 3) spend all your money.",
        "The participants are equals and must agree on the final plan for furnishing the house.",
        "We hypothesized that many of the task-related inferences that the participants must make in this domain to (1) efficiently come to an agreement, and (2) do well on the task, could potentially be cued by the nominal expressions describing the items of furniture used to solve the task.2",
        "Persuasion Hypothesis: The first task-related inference that we consider is the mo-TIVATION inference exemplified in examples (1) and (2).",
        "Previous research suggests that discourse relations such as motivation can influence the content and form of utterances (Mann and Thompson, 1987; McKeown, 1985; Moser and Moore, 1995).",
        "It seems plausible that the speaker can cue these same inferences via nominal redescriptions.",
        "For example, in (3)3 one can infer from O's last utterance and the redescription mine for 150 that his motivation for proposing his rug is its better price.",
        "(3) U: i have a blue rug for 250. that would leave us with 50 or any other options you may have for us.",

        "We reasoned that if our hypotheses were valid then a selection strategy that incorporates them should match the selections made by humans at least as well as an identification-only selection strategy.",
        "We anticipated that the degree of match could be similar since there may be many allowable ways to express a description for identification purposes and the selections intended to cue the inferences could intersect some of these allowable ways.",

        "An agreement must have been reached for an annotated action without the action being readdressed between the agreement and the Summarization.",

        "This definition reflects commitment patterns described in (Di Eugenio et al.,",
        "The Persuasion context exists when a proposal is to be made and alternate solutions exist and there is a contrast between the colors or prices that make the proposed item clearly a better choice.",
        "Given the analysis of the agreement process in (Di Eugenio et al., 2000), we identify proposals by looking for either a propose utterance, or an unconditional commitment utterance where the previous state for an annotated action is an unendorsed option or a partner decidable option.",
        "The alternatives are approximated by accumulating a list of the items evoked for each annotated action up until a propose or unconditional commitment occurs.",
        "Once we have identified proposals and alternative solutions, next we check for contrasts to the alternative solutions and the partial solution.",
        "For color we compare the color of the proposed item to those items already selected for the room and the alternate items.",
        "If the proposed item matches the color of items already selected for the room while none of the alternates do, then a Persuasion context exists.",
        "For prices there are two possibilities that depend on whether or not the end of the problem solving effort is nearing.",
        "An item may be a better choice 1) when the price of the proposed item is greater than that of each alternate (i.e. it may be helping to spend out the budget) or 2) when the price of the proposed item is less than that of each alternate (i.e. the cheaper item may be preferred since it leaves some money for other purchases) .",

        "After doing an analysis of variance (Mat, 1998) on the results of experiments where we varied the selection strategy, we used multiple pairwise comparisons (MCA) (Hsu, 1996) 6 to locate where significant performance differences between strategies existed.?",

        "We found that Summarization had a clear positive influence while Verification had a clear negative one.",
        "For Summarization there is a significant difference in performance (F = 25.71,p < .0000004) and the performance comparison shown in Figure 1 indicates that it is better to include the summarization hypothesis.",

        "To test this idea, the RINF strategy randomly decides whether to select a random number of attributes.",

        "As shown by the MCA confidence intervals in Figure 3, we found that IINF matched human descriptions significantly better than RINF whereas INC did not.",
        "IINF, while statistically similar to INC, also had a trend towards better matches when compared to INC. Table 1 shows the relative contributions of the hypotheses included in IINF and the contribution of the identification goal within IINF.",
        "The contribution made by the identification goal includes both the cases in which identification was the only predicted goal (i.e. none of the contexts indicated in our four hypotheses applied for a particular description) and the cases in which additional attributes had to be added to ensure unique identifiability after the initial selections made in accordance with out hypotheses.",
        "Although the contributions made by the identification goal are smaller than one might expect, this does not mean that the identification goal was invalid for some redescriptions.",
        "Instead it indicates that the identification goal had been addressed already by some of the other applicable goals and reflects a type of potential economy that can be achieved when multiple goals influence one expression.",
        "5 Conclusion Our results indicate that we have identified a set of additional goals that can influence attribute selection for redescriptions.",
        "As we expected, allowing multiple goals to influence redescriptions did reflect allowable, alternative ways of identifying objects.",
        "In particular, we saw that the descriptions generated as a result of multiple goals and the descriptions generated to satisfy just the identification goal match equally well with what humans generate.",
        "So far we have only partially addressed our original question about the relationship between multiple goals and nominal expressions.",
        "Among other things, we still need to ascertain the degree to which this relationship actually economizes the speaker's contribution and makes for more effective communication.",
        "In addition, we need to separate out the goals represented in the IINF selection strategy to see which cases are critical for ensuring an inference is made.",
        "However, to test these goals individually we need to collect more instances of redescriptions."
