        "1998).",
        "Some empirical work has been done to evaluate models for generating descriptions of objects and processes from a knowledge base (Lester and Porter March 1997), text summaries of quantitative data (Robin and McKeown 1996), descriptions of plans (Young to appear) and concise causal arguments (McConachy, Korb et al.",
        "1998).",
        "However, little attention has been paid to the evaluation of systems generating evaluative arguments, communicative acts that attempt to affect the addressee’s attitudes (i.e. evaluative tendencies typically phrased in terms of like and dislike or favor and disfavor).",
        "The ability to generate evaluative arguments is critical in an increasing number of online systems that serve as personal assistants, advisors, or shopping assistants1.",
        "For instance, a shopping assistant may need to compare two similar products and argue why its current user should like one more than the other.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first describe a computational framework for generating evaluative arguments at different levels of conciseness.",
        "Then, we present an evaluation framework in which the effectiveness of evaluative arguments can be measured with real users.",
        "Next, we describe the design of an experiment we ran within the framework to verify the influence of argument conciseness on argument effectiveness.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of the experiment’s results."

        "Often an argument cannot mention all the available evidence, usually for the sake of brevity.",
        "According to argumentation theory, the selection of what evidence to mention in an argument should be based on a measure of the evidence strength of support (or opposition) to the main claim of the argument (Mayberry and Golden 1996).",
        "Furthermore, argumentation theory suggests that for evaluative arguments the measure of evidence strength should be based on a model of the intended reader’s values and preferences.",
        "Following argumentation theory, we have designed an argumentative strategy for generating evaluative arguments that are properly arranged and concise (Carenini and Moore 2000).",
        "In our strategy, we assume that the reader’s values and preferences are represented as an additive multiattribute value function (AMVF), a conceptualization based on multiattribute utility theory (MAUT)(Clemen 1996).",
        "This allows us to adopt and extend a measure of evidence strength proposed in previous work on explaining decision theoretic advice based on an AMVF (Klein1994).",

        "A value tree is a decomposition of the value of an entity into a hierarchy of aspects of the entity2, in which the leaves correspond to the entity primitive attributes (see Figure 1 for a simple value tree in the real estate domain).",
        "The arcs of the tree are weighted to represent the importance of the value of an objective in contributing to the value of its parent in the tree (e.g., in Figure 1 location is more than twice as important as size in determining the value of a house).",
        "Note that the sum of the weights at each level is equal to 1.",
        "A component value function for an attribute expresses the preferability of each attribute value as a number in the [0,1] interval.",
        "For instance, in Figure 1 neighborhood n2 has preferability 0.3, and a distance-from-park of 1 mile has preferability (1 - (1/5 * 1))=0.8).",
        "2 In decision theory these aspects are called objectives.",
        "For consistency with previous work, we will follow this terminology in the remainder of the paper.",
