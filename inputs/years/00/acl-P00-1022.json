        "In this paper, we focus specifically on the resolution of a linguistic problem for Spanish texts, from the computational point of view: zero-pronouns in the “subject” grammatical position.",
        "Therefore, the aim of this paper is not to present a new theory regarding zero-pronouns, but to show that other algorithms, which have been previously applied to the computational resolution of other kinds of pronoun, can also be applied to resolve zero-pronouns.",
        "The resolution of these pronouns is implemented in the computational system called Slot Unification Parser for Anaphora resolution (SUPAR).",
        "This system, which was presented in Ferrández et al.",
        "(1999), resolves anaphora in both English and Spanish texts.",
        "It is a modular system and currently it is being used for Machine Translation and Question Answering, in which this kind of pronoun is very important to solve due to its high frequency in Spanish texts as this paper will show.",
        "We are focussing on zero-pronouns in Spanish texts, although they also appear in other languages, such as Japanese, Italian and Chinese.",
        "In English texts, this sort of pronoun occurs far less frequently, as the use of subject pronouns is generally compulsory in the language.",
        "While in other languages, zero-pronouns may appear in either the subject´s or the object´s grammatical position, (e.g. Japanese), in Spanish texts, zero-pronouns only appear in the position of the subject.",
        "In the following section, we present a summary of the present state-of-the-art for zero-pronouns resolution.",
        "This is followed by a description of the process for the detection and resolution of zero-pronouns.",
        "Finally, we present the results we have obtained with our approach."

        "Zero-pronouns have already been studied in other languages, such as Japanese, (e.g. Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996)).",
        "They have not yet been studied in Spanish texts, however.",
        "Among the work done for their resolution in different languages, nevertheless, there are several points that are common for Spanish.",
        "The first point is that they must first be located in the text, and then resolved.",
        "Another common point among, they all employ different kinds of knowledge (e.g. morphologic or syntactic) for their resolution.",
        "Some of these works are based on the Centering Theory (e.g. Okumura and Tamura (1996)).",
        "Other works, however, distinguish between restrictions and preferences (e.g. Lappin and Leass (1994)).",
        "Restrictions tend to be absolute and, therefore, discard any possible antecedents, whereas preferences tend to be relative and require the use of additional criteria, i.e. heuristics that are not always satisfied by all anaphors.",
        "Our anaphora resolution approach belongs to the second group.",
        "In computational processing, semantic and domain information is computationally inefficient when compared to other kinds of knowledge.",
        "Consequently, current anaphora resolution methods rely mainly on restrictions and preference heuristics, which employ information originating from morpho-syntactic or shallow semantic analysis, (see Mitkov (1998) for example).",
        "Such approaches, nevertheless, perform notably well.",
        "Lappin and Leass (1994) describe an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that achieves a high rate of correct analyses (85%).",
        "Their approach, however, operates almost exclusively on syntactic information.",
        "More recently, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) propose an algorithm for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one developed by Lappin and Leass (1994).",
        "It works from a POS tagger output and achieves an accuracy rate of 75%."

        "In order to detect zero-pronouns, the sentences should be divided into clauses since the subject could only appear between the clause constituents.",
        "After that, a noun-phrase (NP) or a pronoun that agrees in person and number with the clause verb is sought, unless the verb is imperative or impersonal.",
        "As we are also working on unrestricted texts to which partial parsing is applied, zero-pronouns must also be detected when we do not dispose of full syntactic information.",
        "In Ferrández et al.",
        "(1998), a partial parsing strategy that provides all the necessary information for resolving anaphora is presented.",
        "That study shows that only the following constituents were necessary for anaphora resolution: coordinated prepositional and noun phrases, pronouns, conjunctions and verbs, regardless of the order in which they appear in the text.",
        "H1 Let us assume that the beginning of a new clause has been found when a verb is parsed and a free conjunction is subsequently parsed.",
        "When partial parsing is carried out, one problem that arises is to detect the different clauses of a sentence.",

        "With regard to the first problem, the heuristic H1 is applied to identify a new clause.",
        "In this particular case, a free conjunction does not imply conjunctions2 that join coordinated noun and prepositional phrases.",
        "It refers, here, to conjunctions that are parsed in our partial parsing scheme.",
        "For instance, in sentence (1), the following sequence of constituents is parsed: np(John and Jane), verb(were), freeWord3(late), pp(for work), conj(because), pron(they), verb(over-slept ) Since the free conjunction porque (because) has been parsed after the verb llegaron (were), the new clause with a new verb durmieron (over-slept) can be detected.",
        "With reference to the problem about detecting the omission of the subject from each clause with partial parsing, it is solved by searching through the clause constituents that appear before the verb.",
        "In sentence (1), we can verify that the first verb, llegaron (were), does not have its subject omitted since there appears a np(John and Jane).",

        "Sometimes in Spanish, gender information of the pronoun can be obtained when the verb is copulative.",

        "We can therefore obtain information about its gender from the object, guapa (beautiful in its feminine form) which automatically assigns it to the feminine gender so the omitted pronoun would have to be she rather than he.",

        "Therefore, a recall9 rate of 100% is accomplished.",

        "This lower success rate is justified, however, for several reasons.",
        "One important reason is the non-detection of impersonal verbs by the POS tagger.",

        "Two other reasons for the low success rate achieved with verbs whose subjects were not omitted are the lack of semantic information and the inaccuracy of the grammar used.",

        "This explanation is confirmed by the relatively small number of anaphors that are found in that corpus, as compared to the Lexesp corpus.",
        "We have not considered comparing our results with those of other published works, since, (as we have already explained in the Background section), ours is the first study that has been done specifically for Spanish texts, and the designing of the detection stage depends mainly on the structure of the language in question.",

        "The different accuracy results are also shown in Figure 4: A success rate of 75% was attained for the 228 zero-pronouns.",
        "By “successful resolutions” we mean that the solutions offered by our system agree with the solutions offered by two human experts.",
        "For each zero-pronoun there is, on average, 355 candidates before the restrictions are applied, and 11 candidates after restrictions.",
        "Furthermore, we repeated the experiment without applying restrictions and the success rate was significantly reduced.",
        "Since the results provided by other works have been obtained on different languages, texts and sorts of knowledge (e.g. Hobbs and Lappin full parse the text), direct comparisons are not possible.",
        "Therefore, in order to accomplish this comparison, we have implemented some of these approaches in SUPAR.",
        "Although some of these approaches were not proposed for zero-pronouns, we have implemented them since as our approach they could also be applied to solve this kind of pronoun.",
        "For example, with the baseline presented by Hobbs (1977) an accuracy of 49.1% was obtained, whereas, with our system, we achieved 75% accuracy.",

        "Furthermore, the way to explore the syntactic tree with Hobbs’ algorithm is not the best one for the Spanish language since it is nearly a free-word-order language.",
        "Our proposal has also been compared with the typical baseline of morphological agreement and proximity preference, (i.e., the antecedent 11 In Tetreault (1999), for example, it is compared with an adaptation of the Centering Theory by Grosz et al.",

        "Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented, and an accuracy of 60% was attained.",
        "One of the improvements afforded by our proposal is that statistical information from the text is included with the rest of information (syntactic, morphologic, etc.).",
        "Dagan and Itai (1990), for example, developed a statistical approach for pronominal anaphora, but the information they used was simply the patterns obtained from the previous analysis of the text.",
        "To be able to compare our approach to that of Dagan and Itai, and to be able to evaluate the importance of this kind of information, our method was applied with statistical information12 only.",

        "The results obtained were lower than when all the preferences are applied jointly: 50.8%.",

        "This reduction (from 84% to 75%) is due mainly to the lack of gender information in zero-pronouns.",
        "Mitkov (1998) obtains a success rate of 89.7% for pronominal references, working with English technical manuals.",

        "Anyway, if the order of application of the preferences14 is varied to each different text, an 80% overall accuracy rate is attained.",
