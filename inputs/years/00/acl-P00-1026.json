        "Canonisation of words for indexing is an important and difficult problem for Arabic IR.",
        "Arabic is a highly inflectional language with 85% of words derived from trilateral roots (Al-Fedaghi and Al-Anzi 1989).",
        "Stems are derived from roots through the application of a set of fixed patterns.",
        "Addition of affixes to stems yields words.",
        "Words sharing a root are semantically related and root indexing is reported to outperform stem and word indexing on both recall and precision (Hmeidi et al. 1997).",
        "However, Arabic morphology is excruciatingly complex (the Appendix attempts a brief introduction), and root identification on a scale useful for IR remains problematic.",
        "Research on Arabic IR tends to treat automatic indexing and stemming separately.",
        "Al-Shalabi and Evans (1998) and El-Sadany and Hashish (1989) developed stemming algorithms.",
        "Hmeidi et al. (1997) developed an information retrieval system with an index, but does not explain the underlying stemming algorithm.",
        "In Al-Kharashi and Evans (1994), stemming is done manually and the IR index is built by manual insertion of roots, stems and words.",
        "Typically, Arabic stemming algorithms operate by “trial and error”.",
        "Affixes are stripped away, and stems “undone”, according to patterns and rules, and with reference to dictionaries.",
        "Root candidates are checked against a root lexicon.",
        "If no match is found, affixes and patterns are readjusted and the new candidate is checked.",
        "The process is repeated until a root is found.",
        "Morpho-syntactic parsers offer a possible alternative to stemming algorithms.",
        "Al-Shalabi and Evans (1994), and Ubu-Salem et al. (1999) develop independent analysers.",
        "Some work builds on established formalisms such a DATR (Al-Najem 1998), or KIMMO.",
        "This latter strand produced extensive deep analyses.",
        "Kiraz (1994) extended the architecture with multilevel tape, to deal with the typical interruption of root letter sequences caused by broken plural and weak root letter change.",
        "Beesley (1996) describes the reimplementation of earlier work as a single finite state transducer between surface and lexical (root and tag) strings.",
        "This was refined (Beesley 1998) to the current on-line system capable of analysing over 70 million words.",
        "So far, these approaches have limited scope for deployment in IR.",
        "Even if substantial, their morpho-syntactic coverage remains limited and processing efficiency implications are often unclear.",
        "In addition, modern written Arabic presents a unique range of orthographic problems.",
        "Short vowels are not normally written (but may be).",
        "Different regional spelling conventions may appear together in a single text and show interference with spelling errors.",
        "These systems, however, assume text to be in perfect (some even vowelised) form, forcing the need for editing prior to processing.",
        "Finally, the success of these algorithms depends critically on root, stem, pattern or affix dictionary quality, and no sizeable and reliable electronic dictionaries exist.",
        "Beesley (1998) is the exception with a reported 4930 roots encoded with associated patterns, and an additional affix and non-root stem lexicon1.",
        "Absence of large and reliable electronic lexical resources means dictionaries would have to be updated as new words appear in the text, creating a maintenance overhead.",
        "Overall, it remains uncertain whether these approaches can be deployed and scaled up cost-effectively to provide the coverage required for full scale IR on unsanitised text.",
        "Our objective is to circumvent morpho-syntactic analysis of Arabic words, by using clustering as a technique for grouping words sharing a root.",
        "In practise, since Arabic words derived from the same root are semantically related, root based clusters can substitute root dictionaries for indexing in IR and furnish alternative search terms.",
        "Clustering works without dictionaries, and the approach removes dictionary overheads completely.",
        "Clusters can be implemented as a dimension of the index, growing dynamically with text, and without specific maintenance.",
        "They will accommodate effortlessly a mixture of regional spelling conventions and even some spelling errors."

        "To illustrate the complexity, masculine plurals take a -wn or -yn suffix, as in mhnds (engineer), mhndswn.",
        "Female plurals add the at suffix, or change word final h to -at, as in mdrsh (teacher), mdrsat.",
        "Broken plurals affect root characters, as in mal (fund from root mwl), amwal, or wSL (link from root wSL), ‘aySaL.",
        "The examples are rife with long vowels (weak letters?).",
        "They illustrate the degree of interference between broken plural patterns and other ways of segmenting words.",
        "Regional spelling conventions are common: eg.",
        "three versions of word initial alif occur.",
        "The most prominent orthographic problem is the behaviour of hamza, (’), a sign written over a carrier letter and sounding a lenis glottal stop (not to be confused with ayn).",
        "Hamza is not always pronounced.",
        "Like any other consonant, it can take a vowel, long or short.",
        "In word initial position it is always carried by alif, but may be written above or below, or omitted.",
        "Mid-word it is often carried by one of the long vowels, depending on rules whose complexity often gives rise to spelling errors.",
        "At the end of words, it may be carried or written independently.",
        "Hamza is used both as a root consonant and an affix, and is subject to the same problems as non-weak letter consonants, compounded by unpredictable orthography: identical words may have differently positioned hamzas and would be considered as different strings."
