        "This paper develops a declarative treatment of prosodic constituents within the framework of constraint-based phonology, as developed for example in (Bird, 1995; Mastroianni and Carpenter, 1994).",
        "On such an approach, phonological representations are encoded with typed feature terms.",
        "In addition to the representational power of complex feature values, the inheritance hierarchy of types provides a flexible mechanism for classifying linguistic structures, and for expressing generalizations by means of type inference.",
        "To date, little work within constraint-based phonology has addressed prosodic structure above the level of the foot.",
        "In my treatment, I will adopt the following assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "Phonology is induced in parallel with syntactic structure, rather than being mapped from pre-built parse trees.",
        "2.",
        "Individual lexical items do not impose constraints on their neighbour’s phonology.",
        "The first of these assumptions ensures that phonology is compositional, in the sense that the only information available when assembling the phonology of a complex constituent is the phonology of that constituents daughters.",
        "The second assumption is one that is standardly adopted in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), in the sense that heads can be subcategorized with respect to the syntactic and semantic properties of their arguments (i.e., their arguments’ synsem values), but not with respect to their arguments’ phonological properties.",
        "Although I am not convinced that this restriction is correct, it is worthwhile to explore what kinds of phonological analyses are compatible with it.",
        "Most of the data used in this paper was drawn from the SOLE spoken corpus (Hitzeman et al., 1998).1 The corpus was based on recordings of one speaker reading approximately 40 short descriptive texts concerning jewelry."

      "text": [
        "Metrical trees were introduced by Liberman (1977) as a basis for formulating stress-assignment rules in both words and phrases.",
        "Syntactic constituents are assigned relative prosodic weight according to the following rule:",
        "(1) NSR: In a configuration [C A B], if C is a phrasal category, B is strong.",
        "Prominence is taken to be a relational notion: a constituent labelled ‘s’ is stronger than its sister.",
        "Consequently, if B in (1) is strong, then A must be weak.",
        "In the case of a tree like (2), Liberman and Prince’s (1) yields a binary-branching structure of the kind illustrated in (3) (where the root of the tree is unlabeled): fasten a cloak",
        "fasten a cloak For any given constituent analysed by a metrical tree t, the location of its main stress can be found by tracing a path from the root of t to a terminal element α such that all nodes on that path are labelled ‘s’.",
        "Thus the main stress in (3) is located on the element cloak.",
        "In general, the most prominent element, defined in this way, is called the Designated Terminal Element (DTE) (Liberman and Prince, 1977).",
        "Note that (1) is the metrical version of Chomsky and Halle’s (1968) Nuclear Stress Rule (NSR), and encodes the same claim, namely that in the default case, main stress falls on the last constituent in a given phrase.",
        "Of course, it has often been argued that the notion of ‘default prominence’ is flawed, since it supposes that the acceptability of utterances can be judged in a null context.",
        "Nevertheless, there is an alternative conception: the predictions of the NSR correctly describe the prominence patterns when the whole proposition expressed by the clause in question receives broad focus (Ladd, 1996).",
        "This is the view that I will adopt.",
        "Although I will concentrate in the rest of the paper on the broad focus pattern of intonation, the approach I develop is intended to link up eventually with pragmatic information about the location of narrow focus.",
        "In the formulation above, (1) only applies to binary-branching constituents, and the question arises how non-binary branching constituent structures (e.g., for VPs headed by ditranstive verbs) should be treated.",
        "One option (Beckman, 1986; Pierrehumbert and Beckman, 1988; Nespor and Vogel, 1986) would be to drop the restriction that metrical trees are binary, allowing structures such as Fig 1.",
        "Since the nested structure which results from binary branching appears to be irrelevant to phonetic interpretation, I will use nary metrical trees in the following analysis.",
        "In this paper, I will not make use of the Prosodic Hierarchy (Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Nespor and Vogel, 1986; Selkirk, 1981; Selkirk, 1984).",
        "Most of the phenomena that I wish to deal with lie in the blurry region (Shattuck-Hufnagel and Turk, 1996) between the Phonological Word and the Intonational Phrase (IP), and I will just refer to ‘prosodic constituents’ without committing myself to a specific set of labels.",
        "I will also not adopt the Strict Layer Hypothesis (Selkirk, 1984) which holds that elements of a given prosodic category (such as Intonational Phrase) must be exhaustively analysed into a sequence of elements of the next lower category (such as Phonological Phrase).",
        "However, it is important to note that every IP will be a prosodic constituent, in my sense.",
        "Moreover, my lower-level prosodic constituents could be identified with the ϕ-phrases of (Selkirk, 1981; Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Nespor and Vogel, 1986; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), which are grouped together to make IPs."

        "This means that the prosodic type of word forms will be maximal in the hierarchy.",
        "The only complex prosodic objects will be metrical trees.",
        "The minimum requirements for these are that we have, first, a way of representing nested prosodic domains, and second, a way of marking the strong element (Designated Terminal Element; DTE) in a given domain.",
        "Before elaborating the prosodic signature further, I need to briefly address the prosodic status of monosyllabic function words in English.",
        "Although these are sometimes classified as clitics, Zwicky (1982) proposes the term Leaners.",
        "These “form a rhythmic unit with the neighbouring material, are normally unstressed with respect to this material, and do not bear the intonational peak of the unit.",
        "English articles, coordinating conjunctions, complementizers, relative markers, and subject and object pronouns are all leaners in this sense” (Zwicky, 1982, p5).",
        "Zwicky takes pains to differentiate between Leaners and clitics; the former combine with neighbours to form Phonological Phrases (with juncture characterized by external sandhi), whereas clitics combine with their hosts to form Phonological Words (where juncture is characterized by internal sandhi).",
        "Since Leaners cannot bear intonational peaks, they cannot act as the DTE of a metrical tree.",
        "Consequently, the value of the attribute DTE in a metrical tree must be the type of all prosodic objects which are not Leaners.",
        "I call this type full, and it subsumes both Prosodic Words (of type p-wrd) and metrical trees (of type mtr).",
        "Moreover, since Leaners form a closer juncture with their neighbours than Prosodic Words do, we distinguish two kinds of metrical tree.",
        "In a tree of type full-mtr, all the daughters are of type full, whereas in a tree of type lnr-mtr, only the DTE is of type full.",
        "In terms of the attribute-value logic, we therefore postulate a type mtr of metrical tree which introduces the feature DOM (prosodic domain) whose value is a list of prosodic elements, and a feature DTE whose value is a full prosodic object:",
        "Fig 2 displays the prosodic signature for the grammar.",
        "The types lnr-mtr andfull-mtr specialise the appropriateness conditions on mtr, as discussed above.",
        "Notice that in the constraint for objects of type lnr-mtr, is the operation of appending two lists.",
        "Since elements of type pros can be word-forms or metrical trees, the DOM value in a mtr can, in principle, be a list whose elements range from simple word-forms to lists of any level of embedding.",
        "One way of interpreting this is to say that DOM values need not obey the Strict Layer Hypothesis (briefly mentioned in Section 2.1 above).",
