        "We require syntactic dependency to be projective, and capture non-projective syntactic phenomena in language with constraints defined with reference to this projective skeleton (Lai and Huang, 1998b; Lai and Huang, 1998a; Lai and Huang, 1999a; Lai and Huang, 1999b).",

        "we also require the relationship between a governor and all its dependents to be immediate.",
        "There are no intermediate phrasal nodes as in some other projective-dependency-based parsing approaches (Hellwig, 1986; Coving-ton, 1990; Courtin and Genthial, 1998; Bourdon et al., 1995; Nagao, 1993).",
        "A similar approach has been adopted in some recent works on Chinese (Huang et al., 1992; Yuan and Huang, 1992; Zhou and Huang, 1994).",
        "As a start, we manually give parse structure annotation to a small Chinese legal text corpus.",

        "We have also found it useful to identify units smaller than the word like char'acter's and dictionary entries.",
