        "An important distinction in document summarization is between generic summaries, which capture the central ideas of the document in much the same way that the abstract of this paper was designed to distill its salient points, and query-relevant summaries, which reflect the relevance of a document to a user-specified query.",
        "This paper discusses query-relevant summarization, sometimes also called “user-focused summarization” (Mani and Bloedorn, 1998).",
        "Query-relevant summaries are especially important in the “needle(s) in a haystack” document retrieval problem: a user has an information need expressed as a query (What countries export smoked salmon?",
        "), and a retrieval system must locate within a large collection of documents those documents most likely to fulfill this need.",
        "Many interactive retrieval systems – web search engines like Altavista, for instance – present the user with a small set of candidate relevant documents, each summarized; the user must then perform a kind of triage to identify likely relevant documents from this set.",
        "The web page summaries presented by most search engines are generic, not query-relevant, and thus provide very little guidance to the user in assessing relevance.",
        "Query-relevant summarization (QRS) aims to provide a more effective characterization of a document by accounting for the user’s information need when generating a summary.",
        "and then (b) produce a short characterization T(d, q) of each document’s relevance to q.",
        "The purpose of T(d, q) is to assist the user in finding documents that merit a more detailed inspection.",
        "As with almost all previous work on summarization, this paper focuses on the task of extractive summarization: selecting as summaries text spans – either complete sentences or paragraphs – from the original document."

Of course, what constitutes a good summary in any setting is subjective: any two people performing the same summarization task will likely disagree on which part of the document to extract.",
        "We could, in principle, ask a large number of people to perform the same task.",

        "The learning process involves maximum-likelihood estimation of probabilistic language models and the statistical technique of shrinkage (Stein, 1955).",

        "Synonymy has received much attention within the document retrieval community recently, and researchers have applied a variety of heuristic and statistical techniques – including pseudo-relevance feedback and local context analysis (Efthimiadis and Biron, 1994; Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "Some recent work in statistical IR has extended the basic language modelling approaches to account for word synonymy (Berger and Lafferty, 1999).",
        "This paper has proposed the use of two novel datasets for summarization: the frequently-asked questions (FAQs) from Usenet archives and question/answer pairs from the call centers of retail companies.",
        "Clearly this data isn’t a perfect fit for the task of building a QRS system: after all, answers are not summaries.",
        "However, we believe that the FAQs represent a reasonable source of query-related document condensations.",
        "Furthermore, using FAQs allows us to assess the effectiveness of applying standard statistical learning machinery – maximum-likelihood estimation, the EM algorithm, and so on – to the QRS problem.",
        "More importantly, it allows us to evaluate our results in a rigorous, non-heuristic way.",
        "Although this work is meant as an opening salvo in the battle to conquer summarization with quantitative, statistical weapons, we expect in the future to enlist linguistic, semantic, and other non-statistical tools which have shown promise in condensing text."
