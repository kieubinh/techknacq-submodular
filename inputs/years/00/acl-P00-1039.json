        "This paper presents an algorithm for text summarization using the thematic hierarchy of a long text, especially for use by readers who want to skim an electronic book of several dozens of pages on a computer display.",
        "For those who want an outline to quickly understand important parts of a long text, a one-page summary is more useful than a quarter-size summary, such as that generated by a typical automatic text summarizer.",
        "Moreover, a one-page summary helps users reading a long text online because the whole summary can appear at one time on the screen of a computer display.",
        "To make such a highly compressed summary, topics of appropriate grading must be extracted according to the size of the summary to be output, and selected topics must be condensed as much as possible.",
        "The proposed algorithm decomposes a text into an appropriate number of textual units by their subtopics, and then generates short extracts for each unit.",
        "For example, if a thirty-sentence summary is required to contain as many topics as possible, the proposed algorithm decomposes a source text into approximately ten textual units, and then generates a summary composed of two or three-sentence extracts of these units.",
        "The proposed algorithm consists of three stages.",
        "In the first stage, it detects the thematic hierarchy of a source text to decompose a source text into an appropriate number of textual units of approximately the same size.",
        "In the second stage, it adjusts each boundary between these textual units to identify a boundary sentence, indicating where a topic corresponding to a textual unit probably starts.",
        "It then selects a lead sentence that probably indicates the contents of subsequent parts in the same textual unit.",
        "In the last stage, it generates a structured summary of these sentences, thereby providing an outline of the thematic hierarchy of the source text.",
        "The remainder of this paper includes the following: an explanation of problems in one-page summarization that the proposed algorithm is intended to solve; brief explanations of a previously published algorithm for thematic hierarchy detection (Nakao, 1999) and a problem that must be solved to successfully realize one-page summarization; a description and evaluation of the algorithm for boundary sentence identification; a brief explanation of an algorithm for structured summary construction; and some points of discussion on one-page summarization for further research.",
        "2 Problems in one-page summarization of a long text This section examines problems in one-page summarization.",
        "The proposed algorithm is intended to solve three such problems.",
        "The first problem is related to text decomposition.",
        "Newspaper editorials or technical papers can be decomposed based on their rhetorical structures.",
        "However, a long aggregated text, such as a long technical survey report, cannot be decomposed in the same way, because large textual units, such as those longer than one section, are usually constructed with only weak and vague relationships.",
        "Likewise, their arrangement may seem almost at random if analyzed according to their logical or rhetorical relationships.",
        "Thus, a method for detecting such large textual units is required.",
        "Since a large textual unit often corresponds to a logical document element, such as a part or section, rendering features of logical elements can have an important role in detecting such a unit.",
        "For example, a section header is distinguishable because it often consists of a decimal number followed by capitalized words.",
        "However, a method for detecting a large textual unit by rendering features is not expected to have wide range of applicability.",
        "In other words, since the process for rendering features of logical elements varies according to document type, heuristic rules for detection must be prepared for every document type.",
        "That is a problem.",
        "Moreover, the logical structure of a text does not always correspond to its thematic hierarchy, especially if a section consists of an overview clause followed by other clauses that can be divided into several groups by their subtopics.",
        "Since then, based on Hearst's work (1994), an algorithm for detecting the thematic hierarchy of a text using only lexical cohesion (Haliday and Hasan, 1976) measured by term repetitions was developed (Nakao, 1999).",
        "In comparison with some alternatives (Salton et al., 1996; Yaari, 1998), one of the features of the algorithm is that it can decompose a text into thematic textual units of approximately the same size, ranging from units just smaller than the entire text to units of about one paragraph.",
        "In this paper, a summarization algorithm based on this feature is proposed.",
        "The second problem is related to the textual coherence of a one-page summary itself.",
        "A three-sentence extract of a large text, which the proposed algorithm is designed to generate for an appropriate grading topic, tend to form a collection of unrelated sentences if it is generated by simple extraction of important sentences.",
        "Furthermore, the summary should provides new information to a reader, so an introduction is necessary to help a reader understand it.",
        "Figure 4 shows a summary example of a technical survey report consisting of one hundred thousand characters.",
        "It was generated by extracting sentences with multiple significant terms as determined by the likelihood ratio test of goodness-of-fit for term frequency distribution.",
        "It seems to have sentences with some important concepts (keywords), but they do not relate much to one another.",
        "Moreover, inferring the contexts in which they appear is difficult.",
        "To prevent this problem, the proposed algorithm is designed to extract sentences from only the lead part of every topic.",
        "The third problem is related to the readability of a summary.",
        "A one-page summary is much shorter than a very long text, such as a one-hundred-page book, but is too long to read easily without some breaks indicating segues of topics.",
        "Even for an entire expository text, for which a method for displaying the thematic hierarchy with generated headers was proposed to assist a reader to explore the content (Yaari, 1998), a good summary is required to help a user understand quickly.",
        "To improve readability, the proposed algorithm divides every one-page summary into several parts, each of which consists of a heading-like sentence followed by some paragraphs."

        "The output of this stage is a set of lists consisting of thematic boundary candidate sections (TBCS).",
        "The lists correspond individually to every layer of the hierarchy and are composed of TBCSs that separate the source text into thematic textual units of approximately the same size.",
        "First, the algorithm calculates a cohesion score at fixed-width intervals in a source text.",
        "According to Hearst's work (1994), a cohesion score is calculated based on the lexical similarity of two adjacent fixed-width windows (which are eight times larger than the interval width) set at a specific point by the following formula:",

        "The algorithm then detects thematic boundaries according to the minimal points of four-item moving average (arithmetic mean of four consecutive scores) of the cohesion score series.",
        "After that, it selects the textual area contributing the most to every minimal value and identifies it as a TBCS.",

        "Since the textual area just before the point at which EC plotted is always in the left window when one of the averaged cohesion scores is calculated, EC indicates the strength of forward (left-to-right) cohesion at a point.",

        "by the aforementioned procedure using varying window widths (the ordinates).",
        "Each horizontal sequence of rectangles depicts a list of TBCSs detected using a specific window width.",
        "To narrow the width of candidate sections, the algorithm then unifies a TBCS with another TBCS in the layer immediate below.",
        "It continued the process until TBCSs in all layers, from the top to the bottom, are unified.",
