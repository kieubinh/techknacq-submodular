        "Information extraction research has been influenced tremendously by the series of Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-5, MUC-6, MUC-7), organized by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) (http://www.muc.saic.com/proceedings/proceedi ngs_index.html).",

        "The set of slots defines the various entities, aspects and roles relevant to a prescribed task or topic of interest.",
        "Information that has been extracted can be used for populating a database of facts about entities or events, for automatic summarization, for information mining, and for acquiring knowledge to use in a knowledge-based system.",

        "However, few of them have focused on extracting cause-effect information from texts.",

        "When there was an ambiguity whether a causal relation was expressed in the text, the systems used a domain model to check whether such a causal relation between the events was possible.",
        "Kontos & Sidiropoulou (1991) and Kaplan & Berry-Rogghe (1991) used linguistic patterns to identify causal relations in scientific texts, but the grammar, lexicon, and patterns for identifying causal relations were hand-coded and developed just to handle the sample texts used in the studies.",
        "Knowledge-based inferences were also used.",
        "The authors pointed out that substantial domain knowledge was needed for the system to identify causal relations in the sample texts accurately.",
        "More recently, Garcia (1997) developed a computer program to extract cause-effect information from French technical texts without using domain knowledge.",
        "He focused on causative verbs and reported a precision rate of 85%.",
        "Khoo, Kornfilt, Oddy & Myaeng (1998) developed an automatic method for extracting cause-effect information from Wall Street Journal texts using linguistic clues and pattern matching.",
        "Their system was able to extract about 68% of the causal relations with an error rate of about 36%.",
        "The emphasis of the current study is on extracting cause-effect information that is explicitly expressed in the text without knowledge-based inferencing.",

        "The first is the obvious reason that to extract complete cause-effect information, pronouns and references have to be resolved and replaced with the information that they refer to.",
        "The second reason is that quite often a causal relation between two events is expressed more than once in a medical abstract, each time providing new information about the causal situation.",
        "The extraction system thus needs to be able to recognize that the different causal expressions refer to the same causal situation, and merge the information extracted from the different sentences.",
        "The second aspect of discourse processing being investigated is what we refer to as hypothesis confirmation.",
        "Sometimes, a causal relation is hypothesized by the author at the beginning of the abstract.",
        "This hypothesis may be confirmed or disconfirmed by another sentence later in the abstract.",
        "The information extraction system thus has to be able to link the initial hypothetical cause-effect expression with the confirmation or disconfirmation expression later in the abstract.",
        "Finally, we hope eventually to develop a system that not only extracts cause-effect information from medical abstracts accurately, but also synthesizes new knowledge by chaining the extracted causal relations.",
        "In a series of studies, Swanson (1986) has demonstrated that logical connections between the published literature of two medical research areas can provide new and useful hypotheses.",
