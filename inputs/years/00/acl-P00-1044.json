        "The named entity (NE) task is one of the subtasks of information extraction (IE), which were defined in the 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6)(1995) to improve modularity and portability of IE systems.",
        "The main objective of the NE task is to identify some specific noun phrases in the target documents.",
        "The evaluations of the systems for the NE tasks have been performed in MUCs, there are 7 entity classes defined to identify, such as ORGANIZATION, PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, TIME, MONEY and PERCENT.",
        "The type of the articles is restricted for the final goal, information extraction.",
        "The target events are executive succession in MUC-6, and space vehicle or rocket launching in MUC-7 (1998), while the classes of NE were the same in both conferences.",
        "IREX (1999) was the workshop for the evaluation of information retrieval (IR) and NE task held in Japan.",
        "The documents used in these tasks are Japanese newspaper articles.",
        "The NE task in IREX is basically based on that in MUCs, and ARTIFACT class is newly defined, which contains the name of products, laws, prizes.",
        "In the IREX NE tasks, we have a dry run and a formal run evaluation.",
        "There are two tasks in the formal run.",
        "One task is called in this paper a \"general\" task.",
        "In the general task, the type of documents is not specified, therefore NE systems need to deal with all the types of newspaper articles, similar to that in the dry run.",
        "We call the other task a \"restricted\" task.",
        "In the restricted task, articles are restricted to the ones which describe arrest events by the police.",
        "The MUCs and the IREX workshop have evaluated the performances of the IE systems, and the tendency of system performances show partially the difficulty of the IE tasks.",
        "However, the evaluation of the systems do not clearly show in detail why the task is difficult or what kind of information should utilized in the IE task.",

        "al (1997) created a semantic network from test corpora in MUCs, and set the level of the events based on the created network to analyze the performances of the IE systems.",

        "al (1997) investigated the test corpora at Multilingual Entity task (1996) and estimated the lower bound of the performance of NE task in six different languages.",
        "In this paper, we propose some indices to evaluate the difficulty of the named entity task by looking at a test corpus, based on expressions inside and outside the entities.",
        "The basic notion to evaluate the difficulty is the variety of expression.",
        "To identify named entities properly, a certain amount of knowledge is necessary.",
        "We make the hypothesis that the greater the variety of expression is, the more effort to create knowledge would be required.",
