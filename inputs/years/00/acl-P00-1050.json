      "heading": "1.2 Problem Definition",
      "text": [
        "In the most previous studies, the \"alignment\" was usually defined by \"aligning word (or text, phrase, section, etc.)",
        "to its translation\" (Gale, 1991; Shin & Choi, 1996).",
        "It seems that the concept of alignment is so obvious that no one has concerned for the problem, \"what is the translation of an original word\".",
        "In this paper, we would like to clarify the definition as follows: \"Alignment\" is to find out the translated version of the given source language.",
        "\"Word/phrase alignment\", therefore, is to find out, from the aligned pairs of sentences, two words/phrases with the highest semantic similarities and the highest syntactic similarities.",
        "Based on this definition given above, we can easily point out that alignment problem is essentially the problem of bilingual word sense and syntactic similarity.",
        "Traditional statistical approaches have been testified to be effective in the resolution of alignment problem: statistical information reflects word similarity in some stages.",
        "But this approach gets good result mainly in the alignment of between the languages that belong to the same language family (Brown, 1993; Dagan, 1994; Dan, 1997), and shows limitation in coverage even after training with extremely large bilingual corpus (Ker, 1997).",
        "To the languages that do not belong to the same language family, statistical approaches have shown limited coverage and low precision, even after the employment of additional information (Shin and Choi, 1996; Turcato, 1998).",
        "This result is not surprising because statistical approach is just an indirect way to obtain the word similarity.",
        "Then, what is the more direct information in getting bilingual word similarity?",
        "In monolingual processing, some resources such as dictionary, thesaurus and WordNet have been used customarily.",
        "Alignment needs bilingual information, so we attempt to use bilingual dictionary instead of the monolingual dictionary.",
        "Thesaurus and WordNet have almost never been used in bilingual alignment except Ker (1997) because they normally contain only monolingual information, but Ker shows us a sound approach to make use of monolingual thesaurus in bilingual alignment.",
        "Though there are many differences between some Asian language pairs like Chinese and Korean (or Japanese and Chinese, or Japanese and Korean), but we know that there are also many similarities between them.",
        "And so, as the result, we believe that linguistic knowledge will be more close to the bilingual word sense or syntactic similarity than some statistical information or only word position in sentence.",
        "2 Linguistic comparison between Chinese and Korean Korean language belongs to Altai language family while Chinese language belongs to Sino-Tibetan, so it is not surprising that there are many differences between them.",
        "To get useful information for the word alignment, we will focus mainly on their common points more than their differences.",
        "We will compare the linguistic properties of Chinese and Korean from the three viewpoints - character, lexicon, and syntax."

      "text": [
        "Differently from the language pairs such as French-English or some Europe language pairs, Chinese-Korean characters look very different from each other, because Chinese characters are ideograph while Korean characters are phonogram.",
        "But actually, because Korean characters are phonogram, and there is historical relation between Chinese and Korean, almost all of the Chinese characters can be converted to one or several Korean characters, these Korean characters express the pronunciation of the Chinese characters in Korean (e.g., for '' in Chinese, which pronunciation is 'Ming', it can be unically converted to Korean character � pronounced by 'Myung).",
        "We have constructed a Chinese-Korean Character Transfer Table (CKCT Table) to reflect the correspondence relation between them.",

        "We can try to find the lexical similarities between Chinese and Korean languages from three aspects: word formation, part-of-speech (POS) and lexical internal structure.",
        "About 60% of the Korean colloquial words are derived from Chinese words (Chinese-Korean words) (Choi, 1989).",
        "Normally, these Korean words have similar forms with the related Chinese words when transferring the Chinese words to their Korean pronunciation.",
        "(e.g.,\"[C]",
        "where [C], [CK] and [K] stand for Chinese word, Korean pronuncation of Chinese, and its corresponding Korean word, respectively.",
        "It seems that word formation similarity between Chinese and Korean gives good word alignment.",
        "But because of the long history of Chinese character use in Korea, the word formation and their concept are quite different.",
        "For example, zhailu (MR) in Chinese stands for \"excerpt\" in English, which is expressed by balcwi (4A) in Korean, but bacui ( 4A ) in contemporary Chinese normally stands for \"supereminence\" in English.",
        "Besides this, there is noise when using word formation similarity in alignment, for example, \" oa z' (ceungsil)\" (means \"blue thread\") contains a similar word formation with \"ELL z' (gyosil)\" ( ft 1� ; \"classroom\") while their meanings are very different from each other.",
        "Such noise will be more serious for the \"short\" words that are composed of only one or two characters.",
        "For example, \"sir' in Korean is mapped into many different Chinese characters like \"X }c, �\" in corresponding Chinese pronunciation \"shi\".",
        "Similarity of the lexical formation is on the prolongation of the character similarity.",
        "Similarity of lexical formation exists between other language pairs also, and this property has already been used in the other previous works (Church, 1993).",
        "POS similarity indicates the regularity between the POS of the source word and its translation.",
        "For example, if a word is a pronoun in source language, then it is highly probable that the translation of the word also belongs to a pronoun.",
        "POS similarity attracted much attention by computational linguistic researchers long before, and has been made use in several previous alignment systems (Dagan, 1994; Shin and Choi, 1996).",
        "There is POS similarity between Chinese and Korean also.",
        "Our experiment shows that about 77.1% Chinese nouns are mapped to Korean noun (common noun), while only less than 8% of them are translated to Korean verb.",
        "But it is not always so optimistic, for example, only 34.4% of Chinese verbs are translated into Korean verb, while 35.1% of them are translated to Korean noun.",
        "It is the reason why we try to use more kinds of linguistic knowledge in our alignment study.",
        "Different from other language words, Chinese words have internal structure.",
        "For example, the verb \" T W (xiayu) (rain)\" is composed of two words, one is verb \"T(xia)(fall,drop ... )\" and the other one is noun \" fff (yu)(rain)\", therefore, the internal structure of the word \" T (xiayu)(rain)\" is \"verb+noun\".",
        "We call it \"phrasal word\" because there is a phrasal structure inside of word.",
        "We found that in most cases of l:n (where n is the number of corresponding words) correspondence, Chinese words have some specific POS and internal structures.",
        "Chinese phrasal words and their corresponding Korean phrases hold similar syntactic structure.",
        "We name it \"lexical internal structure similarity\".",
        "For example, consider a fragment \"it rains\": [C] xia+yu (T Pff)p [K] bi/ga+o/da (H 1) [ 2 CE) verb+noun q noun/SUBJ+verb/ending ([E] come down+rain4* rain+come down) The lexical structure transfer rules (e.g., \"[C] verb+noun q [K]noun/CASE +verb/ending\") can be constructed semi-automatically."
