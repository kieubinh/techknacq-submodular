        "Furthermore, by at least one measure, these software systems evaluate student essays with the same degree of accuracy as human experts.",
        "That is, computer-generated scores tend to match human expert scores as frequently as two human scores match each other (Burstein et al., 1998).",

        "We focus on Centering Theory's Rough-Shift transition which is the least well studied among the four transition types.",
        "In particular, we examine whether the discourse coherence found in an essay, as defined by a measure of relative proportion of Rough-Shift transitions, might be a significant contributor to the accuracy of computer-generated essay scores.",
        "Our positive finding validates the role of the Rough-Shift transition and suggests a route for exploring Centering Theory's practical applicability to writing evaluation and instruction.",
        "2 The e-rater essay scoring system One goal of automatic essay scoring systems such as e-rater is to represent the criteria that human experts use to evaluate essays.",
