        "The task of evaluating student's writing ability has traditionally been a laborintensive human endeavor.",

        "Furthermore, by at least one measure, these software systems evaluate student essays with the same degree of accuracy as human experts.",
        "That is, computer-generated scores tend to match human expert scores as frequently as two human scores match each other (Burstein et al., 1998).",

        "We focus on Centering Theory's Rough-Shift transition which is the least well studied among the four transition types.",
        "In particular, we examine whether the discourse coherence found in an essay, as defined by a measure of relative proportion of Rough-Shift transitions, might be a significant contributor to the accuracy of computer-generated essay scores.",
        "Our positive finding validates the role of the Rough-Shift transition and suggests a route for exploring Centering Theory's practical applicability to writing evaluation and instruction.",
        "2 The e-rater essay scoring system One goal of automatic essay scoring systems such as e-rater is to represent the criteria that human experts use to evaluate essays.",
        "The writing features that e-rater evaluates were specifically chosen to reflect scoring criteria for the essay portion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMATT.",
        "These criteria are articulated in GMAT test preparation materials at http://www.gmat.org.",

        "Logical organization and clear transitions are represented by features that quantify cue words in certain syntactic constructions.",

        "E-rater also includes features that quantify the appropriateness of the vocabulary content of an essay.",

        "Table 2 strongly indicates that student essays were not incoherent in terms of the processing load imposed on the reader to resolve anaphoric references.",
