        "Human compiled bilingual dictionaries do not cover every term translation, especially when it comes to technical domains.",
        "Moreover, we can no longer afford to waste human time and effort building manually these ever changing and incomplete databases or design language specific applications to solve this problem.",
        "The need for an automatic language independent task for equivalents extraction becomes clear in multilingual regions like Hong Kong, Macao, Quebec, the European Union, where texts must be translated daily into eleven languages, or even in the U.S.A. where Spanish and English speaking communities are intermingled.",
        "Parallel texts (texts that are mutual translations) are valuable sources of information for bilingual lexicography.",
        "However, they are not of much use unless a computational system may find which piece of text in one language corresponds to which piece of text in the other language.",
        "In order to achieve this, they must be aligned first, i.e. the various pieces of text must be put into correspondence.",
        "This makes the translations extraction task easier and more reliable.",
        "Alignment is usually done by finding correspondence points – sequences of characters with the same form in both texts (homographs, e.g. numbers, proper names, punctuation marks), similar forms (cognates, like Region and Região in English and Portuguese, respectively) or even previously known translations.",
        "Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown (1997) present an alignment algorithm that uses term translations as correspondence points between English and Chinese.",
        "Melamed (1999) aligns texts using correspondence points taken either from orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al., 1992) or from a seed translation lexicon.",
        "However, although the heuristics both approaches use to filter noisy points may be intuitively quite acceptable, they are not theoretically supported by Statistics.",
        "The former approach considers a candidate correspondence point reliable as long as, among some other constraints, “[...] it is not too far away from the diagonal [...]” (Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown, 1997, p.72) of a rectangle whose sides sizes are proportional to the lengths of the texts in each language (henceforth, ‘the golden translation diagonal’).",
        "The latter approach uses other filtering parameters: maximum point ambiguity level, point dispersion and angle deviation (Melamed, 1999, pp.",
        "115–116).",

        "(2000a) propose a method to filter candidate correspondence points generated from homograph words which occur only once in parallel texts (hapaxes) using linear regressions and statistically supported noise filtering methodologies.",
        "The method avoids heuristic filters and they claim high precision alignments.",
        "In this paper, we will extend this work by defining a linear regression line with all points generated from homographs with equal frequencies in parallel texts.",
        "We will filter out those points which lie outside statistically defined confidence bands (Thomas Wonnacott and Ronald Wonnacott, 1990).",

        "However, these algorithms tended to break down when sentence boundaries were not clearly marked.",
        "Full stops do not always mark sentence boundaries, they may not even exist due to OCR noise and languages may not share the same punctuation policies.",

        "During the alignment, some were discarded because they lied outside an empirically estimated bounded search space, required for time and space reasons.",

        "Words with similar distributions became the candidate correspondence points.",
        "Two sentences were aligned if the number of correspondence points associating them was greater than an empirically defined threshold: “[ ... ] more than some minimum number of times [ ... ]” (Martin Kay and Martin Röscheisen, 1993, p.128).",

        "(1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words.",
        "Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown (1994) dropped the requirement for sentence boundaries on a case-study for English-Chinese.",
        "Instead, they used vectors that stored distances between consecutive occurrences of a word (DK-vec’s).",
        "Candidate correspondence points were identified from words with similar distance vectors and noisy points were filtered using some heuristics.",
        "Later, in Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown (1997), the algorithm used extracted terms to compile a list of reliable pairs of translations.",
        "Those pairs whose distribution similarity was above a threshold became candidate correspondence points (called potential anchor points).",
        "These points were further constrained not to be “too far away” from the ‘translation diagonal’.",
        "Michel Simard and Pierre Plamondon (1998) aligned sentences using isolated cognates as candidate correspondence points, i.e. cognates that were not mistaken for others within a text window.",
        "Some were filtered out if they either lied outside an empirically defined search space, named a corridor, or were “not in line” with their neighbours.",
        "Melamed (1999) also filtered candidate correspondence points obtained from orthographic cognates.",
        "A maximum point ambiguity level filters points outside a search space, a maximum point dispersion filters points too distant from a line formed by candidate correspondence points and a maximum angle deviation filters points that tend to slope this line too much.",
        "Whether the filtering of candidate correspondence points is done prior to alignment or during it, we all want to find reliable correspondence points.",
