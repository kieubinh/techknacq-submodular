        "There is an increasing need of having available general, accurate and broad coverage multilingual lexical/semantic resources for developing NL applications.",
        "Thus, a very active field inside NL during the last years has been the fast development of generic language resources.",
        "Several attempts have been performed to connect already existing ontologies.",
        "In (Ageno et al., 1994), a Spanish/English bilingual dictionary is used to (semi)automatically link Spanish and English taxonomies extracted from DGILE (Alvan, 1987) and LDOCE (Procter, 1987).",
        "Similarly, a simple automatic approach for linking Spanish taxonomies extracted from DGILE to WordNet (Miller et al., 1991) synsets is proposed in (Rigau et al., 1995).",
        "The work reported in (Knight and Luk, 1994) focuses on the construction of Sensus, a large knowledge base for supporting the Pangloss machine translation system.",
        "In (Okumura and Hovy, 1994) (semi)automatic methods for associating a Japanese lexicon to an English ontology using a bilingual dictionary are described.",
        "Several experiments aligning EDR and WordNet ontologies are described in (Utiyama and Hasida, 1997).",
        "Several lexical resources and techniques are combined in (Atserias et al., 1997) to map Spanish words from a bilingual dictionary to WordNet, and in (Farreres et al., 1998) the use of the taxonomic structure derived from a monolingual MRD is proposed as an aid to this mapping process.",
        "The use of relaxation labeling algorithm to attach substantial fragments of the Spanish taxonomy derived from DGILE (Rigau et al., 1998) to the English WordNet using a bilingual dictionary for connecting both hierarchies, has been reported in (Daude et al., 1999).",
        "In this paper we use the same technique to snap WN1.5 to WN1.6.",
        "The aim of the experiment is twofold: First, show that the method is general enough to link any pair of ontologies.",
        "Second, evaluate our taxonomy linking procedure, by comparing our results with other WN1.5 to WN1.6 existing mappings.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe the used technique (the relaxation labeling algorithm) and its application to hierarchy mapping.",
        "In section 3 we describe the constraints used in the relaxation process, and finally, after presenting some experiments and results, we offer some conclusions and outline further lines of research.",
        "2 Application of Relaxation Labeling to NLP Relaxation labeling (RL) is a generic name for a family of iterative algorithms which perform function optimization, based on local information.",
        "See (Torras, 1989) for a summary.",
        "Its most remarkable feature is that it can deal with any kind of constraints, thus, the model can be improved by adding any constraints available, and the algorithm is independent of the complexity of the model.",
        "That is, we can use more sophisticated constraints without changing the algorithm.",
        "The algorithm has been applied to Pos tagging (Marquez and Padro, 1997), shallow parsing (Voutilainen and Padro, 1997) and to word sense disambiguation (Padro, 1998).",
        "Although other function optimization algorithms could have been used (e.g. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.",
        "), we found RL to be suitable to our purposes, given its ability to use models based on context constraints, and the existence of previous work on applying it to NLP tasks.",
        "Detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found in (Torras, 1989), while its application to NLP tasks, advantages and drawbacks are addressed in (Padro, 1998)."

        "The Relaxation Labeling algorithm deals with a set of variables (which may represent words, synsets, etc.",
        "), each of which may take one among several different labels (Pos tags, senses, MRD entries, etc.).",
        "There is also a set of constraints which state compatibility or incompatibility of a combination of pairs variable–label.",
        "The aim of the algorithm is to find a weight assignment for each possible label for each variable, such that (a) the weights for the labels of the same variable add up to one, and (b) the weight assignment satisfies –to the maximum possible extent– the set of constraints.",
        "Summarizing, the algorithm performs constraint satisfaction to solve a consistent labeling problem.",
        "The followed steps are:",
        "1.",
        "Start with a random weight assignment.",
        "2.",
        "Compute the support value for each label of each variable.",
        "Support is computed according to the constraint set and to the current weights for labels belonging to context variables.",
        "3.",
        "Increase the weights of the labels more compatible with the context (larger support) and decrease those of the less compatible labels (smaller support).",
        "Weights are changed proportionally to the support received from the context.",
        "4.",
        "If a stopping convergence criterion is satisfied, stop, otherwise go to step 2.",
        "We use the criterion of stopping when there are no more changes, although more sophisticated heuristic procedures may also be used to stop relaxation processes (Ek-lundh and Rosenfeld, 1978; Richards et al., 1981).",
        "The cost of the algorithm is proportional to the product of the number of variables by the number of constraints.",
        "2.2 Application to taxonomy mapping As described in previous sections, the problem we are dealing with is to map two taxonomies.",
        "In this particular case, we are interested in snapping WN1.5 to WN1.6, that is, assign each synset of the former to at least one synset of the later.",
        "The modeling of the problem is the following:",
        "• Each WN1.5 synset is a variable for the relaxation algorithm.",
        "We will refer to it as source synset and to WN1.5 as source taxonomy.",
        "• The possible labels for that variable are all the WN1.6 synsets which contain a word belonging to the source synset.",
        "We will refer to them as target synsets and to WN1.6 as target taxonomy.",
        "• The algorithm will need constraints stating whether a WN1.6 synset is a suitable",
        "assignment for a WN1.5 synset.",
        "As described in section 3, these constraints will rely on the taxonomy structure.",
        "3 The Constraints Constraints are used by the relaxation labeling algorithm to increase or decrease the weight for a variable label.",
        "In our case, constraints increase the weights for the connections between a source synset and a target synset.",
        "Increasing the weight for a connection implies decreasing the weights for all the other possible connections for the same source synset.",
        "To increase the weight for a connection, constraints look for already connected nodes that have the same relationships in both taxonomies.",
        "Although there is a wide range of relationships between WordNet synsets which can be used to build constraints, we have focused on the hyper hyponym relationships.",
        "That is, we increase the weight for a connection when the involved nodes have hyper-nyms/hyponyms also connected.",
        "We consider hyper hyponym relationships either directly or indirectly (i.e. ancestors or descendants) depending on the kind of constraint used.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of possible connections between two taxonomies.",
        "Connection C4 will have its weight increased due to C5, C6 and CI, while connections C2 and C3 will have their weights decreased.",
        "We distinguish different kinds of constraints, depending on whether we consider hyponyms, hypernyms or both, on whether we consider those relationships direct or indirect, and on in which of both taxonomies we do so.",
        "Each constraint may be used alone or combined with others.",
        "Below we describe all kinds of constraint used.",
        "They are labeled with a three–character code (xYz), which must be read as follows: The first character (x) indicates how the hyper/hyponym relationship is considered in the source taxonomy: only for immediate nodes (i) or for any (A) ancestor descendant.",
        "The second character (Y) codes the same information for the target taxonomy side.",
        "The third character indicates whether the constraints requires the existence of a connected hyper-nym (E), hyponym (o), or both (B).",
        "HE constraint: The simplest constraint is to check whether the connected nodes have respective direct hypernyms also connected.",
        "HE stands for immediate source(i), immediate target (i) hypernym (E.) This constraint will increase the weights for those connections in which the immediate hypernym of the source node is connected with the immediate hypernym of the target node.",
        "no constraint: This constraint increases the weight for that connections in which an immediate hyponym of the source node is connected to an immediate hyponym of the target node.",

        "II constraints.",
        "If we use constraints IIE, IIO and IIB at the same time, weights will be modified for words matching any of the constraints.",
        "That is, we are additively combining constraints.",
        "In the case where two of theirs apply, their effects will be added.",
        "If they have opposite effects, they will cancel each other.",

        "The arrows indicate an immediate hyper-nymy relationship.",
        "The nodes on the left hand side correspond to the source taxonomy and the nodes on the right to the target hierarchy.",
        "The dotted line is the connection which weight will be increased due to the existence of the connection indicated with a continuous line.",
        "AIE constraint: This constraint increases the weight for the connections in which an ancestor of the source node is connected to the immediate hypernym of the target node.",
        "AIO constraint: This constraint increases the weight for the connections in which a descendant of the source node is connected to an immediate hyponym of the target node.",
        "AIM constraint: This constraint increases the weight for the connections in which an ancestor of the source node is connected to the immediate hypernym of the target node and a descendant of the source node is connected to an immediate hyponym of the target node.",

        "If we use constraints AIE, Aio and AM simultaneously, we apply either a hypernym constraint, either a hyponym constraint or either both of them.",
