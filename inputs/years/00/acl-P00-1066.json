        "The treatment of lexical ambiguity is one of the main problems in lexical semantics and in the modeling of natural language understanding.",
        "Pustejovsky's framework of the \"Generative Lexicon\" made a contribution to the discussion by employing the concept of type coercion, thus replacing the enumeration of readings by the systematic context-dependent generation of suitable interpretations, in the case of systematic polysemies (Pustejovsky, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995).",
        "Also, Pustejovsky pointed to a frequent and important phenomenon in lexical semantics, which at first sight looks as another case of polysemy, but is significantly different in nature.",

        "(2) Mary burned the book.",
        "(3) The book is amusing.",
        "(4) Mary understands the book.",
        "(5) The book is beautiful.",
        "(6) Mary likes the book.",
        "(7) Mary read the book.",
        "Examples (1)-(4) suggest an inherent ambiguity of the common noun book: blue, on the shelf, and burn subcategorize for a physical object, while amusing and understand require an informational object as argument.",
        "(5) and (6) are in fact ambiguous: The statements may refer either to the shape or the content of the book.",
        "However, a thorough analysis of the situation shows that there is a third reading where the beauty of the book as well as Mary's positive attitude are due to the harmony between physical shape and informational content.",
        "The action of reading, finally, is not carried out on a physical object alone, nor on a pure informational object as argument, but requires an object which is essentially a combination of the two.",
        "This indicates a semantic relation which is conjunctive or additive in character, rather than a disjunction between readings as in the ambiguity case.",
        "In addition to the more philosophical argument, the assumption of a basically different semantic relation is supported by observations from semantic composition.",
        "If the physical/informational distinction in the semantics of book were just an ambiguity, (8) and (9) would not be consistently interpretable, since the sortal requirements of the noun modifier (amusing and on the shelf, resp.)",
        "are incompatible with the selection restrictions of the verbs burn and understand, respectively.",
        "(8) Mary burned an amusing book.",
        "(9) Mary understands the book on the shelf.",
        "Pustejovsky concludes that ontologically complex objects must be taken into account to describe lexical semantics properly, and he represents them as \"dotted pairs\" made up form two (or more) ontologically simple objects, and being semantically categorized as \"dotted types\", e.g., TP • ff in the case of book.",
        "He convincingly argues that complex types are omnipresent in the lexicon, the physical/informational object distinction being just a special case of a wide range of dotted types, including container/content (bottle), aperture/panel (door) building/ institution (library).",
        "The part of the Generative Lexicon concept which was not concerned with ontologically complex objects, i.e., type coercion and co-composition mechanisms using so-called qualia information, has triggered a line of intensive and fruitful research in lexical semantics, which led to progress in representation formalisms and tools for the computational lexicon (see e.g. (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Dolling, 1995; Busa and Bouillon, forthcoming; Egg, 1999)).",
        "In contrast, a problem with Pustejovsky's proposal about the complex objects is that the dotted-pair notation has been formally and semantically not clear enough to form a starting point for meaning representation and processing.",
        "In this paper, we present a formally sound semantic reconstruction of complex objects, using a higher-order feature logic based on Ohori's record A-calculus (1995) which has been originally developed for functional and object-oriented programming.",
        "We do not claim that our reconstruction provides a full theory of the of the peculiar kind of ontological objects, but it appears to be useful as a basis for representing lexical entries for these objects and modeling the composition process in which they are involved.",
        "We will not only show that the basic examples above can be treated, but also that our treatment provides a straightforward solution to some puzzles concerning the behavior of dotted pairs in quantificational, cardinality and identity statements.",

        "(14) The book on your bookshelf is the one",
        "I saw in the library.",
        "In (10), the quantification is about physical objects, whereas in (11), it concerns the books qua informational unit.",
        "(12) is ambiguous between a number-of-copies and a number-of-titles reading.",
        "The respective readings in (10) and (11) appear to be triggered by the sortal requirements of the verbal predicate, as the ambiguity in (12) is due to the lack of a selection restriction.",
        "However, (13) - uttered towards a customer in a book store - has a natural reading where the quantification relates to the information level and the predicate is about physical objects.",
        "Finally, (14) has a reading where a relation of non-physical identity is ascribed to objects which are both referred to by physical properties.",
        "2 The Record-A-Calculus J\"In order to reduce the complexity of the calculus, we will first introduce a feature A-calculus J\" and then extend it to Jc\" – Jc, is an extension of the simply typed A-calculus by feature structures (which we will call records).",

        "The meaning of this judgment is that term A has type a E T relative to the (global) type assumptions in the signature E and the (local) type assumptions F (the context) for the variables.",
        "As usual, we say that a term A is of type a (and often simply write Aa to indicate this), iff F �-E A: a is derivable by these rules.",
        "We will call a type a record",
        "type (with features e2), iff it is of the form gf1: al, ... , f,,,: a,,,}}.",
        "Similarly, we call an Jc-term A a record, iff it has a record type.",
        "Note that record selection operator \".\" can only be applied to records.",
        "In a slight abuse of notation, we will also use it on record types and have Aa .",
        "f: a. f. It is well-known that type inference with these rules is decidable (as a consequence we will sometimes refrain from explicitly marking types in our examples), that well-typed terms have unique types, and that the calculus admits subject reduction, i.e that the set of well-typed terms is closed under well-typed substitutions.",
        "The calculus ,c' is equipped with an (operational) equality theory, given by the rules in Figure 3 (extended to congruence relations on Jc-terms in the usual way).",
        "The first two are just the well-known,Qrl equality rules from A-calculus (we assume alphabetic renaming of bound variables wherever necessary).",
        "The second two rules specify the semantics of the record dereferencing operation \".\" .",
        "Here we know that these rules form a canonical (i.e. terminating and confluent), and type-safe (reduction does not change the type) reduction system, and that we therefore have unique ,grip-normal forms.",
        "The semantics of T'� is a straightforward extention of that of the simply typed A-calculus: records are interpreted as partial functions from features to objects, and dereferencing is only application of these functions.",
        "With this semantics it is easy to show that the evaluation mapping is well-typed (2�(Aa) E Da) and that the equalities in Figure 3 are sound (i.e. if A =�,nP B, then",

        "Up to now, we have a calculus for so-called closed records that exactly prescribe the features of a record.",
        "The semantics given above also licenses a slightly different interpretation: a record type p = gf1: a,,,, ... , f,,,: a,,,}} is descriptive, i.e. an Jc-term of type p would only be required to have at least the features f1, ... f,,,, but may actually have more.",
        "This makes it necessary to introduce a subtyping relation <, since a record f f f= A J will now have the types ff f: a}} and {{}}.",
        "Of course we have f f f: a}} <_ {{}}, since the latter is less restrictive.",
        "The higher-order feature logic Jc < we will use for the linguistic analysis in section 3 is given as ,c' extended by the rules in Figure 4.",
        "The first rule specifies that record",
        "types that prescribe more features are more specific, and thus describe a smaller set of objects.",
        "The second rule is a standard weakening rule for the subtype relation.",
        "We need the reflexivity rule for base types in order to keep the last rule, which induces the subtype relation on function types from that of its domain and range types simple.",
        "It states that function spaces can be enlarged by enlarging the range type or by making the domain smaller (intuitively, every function can be restricted to a smaller domain).",
        "We say that < is covariant (preserving the direction) in the range and contravariant in the domain type (inverting the direction).",
        "For Jc<, we have the same meta-logical results as for J” (the type-preservations, subject reduction, normal forms, soundness,... ) except for the unique type property, which cannot hold by construction.",
        "Instead we have the principal type property, i.e. every Jc<term has a unique minimal type.",
        "To fortify our intuition about J\"<, let us take a look at the following example: It should be possible to apply a function F of type gf1: a}} – � , to a record with features fit, 6, since F only expects fit.",
        "The type derivation in Figure 5 shows that Fgf'1 = Aar, f'2 = A2is indeed well-typed.",
        "In the first block, we use the rules from Figure 4 (in particular contravariance) to establish a subtype relation that is used in the second block to weaken the type of F, so that it (in the third block) can be applied to the argument record that has one feature more than the feature f1 required by F's type."
