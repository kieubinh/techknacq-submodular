        "Statistical language modelling (SLM) has been successfully applied to many domains such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), information retrieval (Miller et al., 1999), and spoken language understanding (Zue, 1995).",
        "In particular, n-gram language model (LM) has been demonstrated to be highly effective for these domains.",
        "N-gram LM estimates the probability of a word given previous words,",
        "In applying an SLM, it is usually the case that more training data will improve a language model.",
        "However, as training data size increases, LM size increases, which can lead to models that are too large for practical use.",
        "To deal with the problem, count cutoff (Jelinek, 1990) is widely used to prune language models.",
        "The cutoff method deletes from the LM those n-grams that occur infrequently in the training data.",
        "The cutoff method assumes that if an n-gram is infrequent in training data, it is also infrequent in testing data.",
        "But in the real world, training data rarely matches testing data perfectly.",
        "Therefore, the count cutoff method is not perfect.",
        "In this paper, we propose a distribution-based cutoff method.",
        "This approach estimates if an n-gram is “likely to be infrequent in testing data”.",
        "To determine this likelihood, we divide the training data into partitions, and use a cross-validation-like approach.",
        "Experiments show that this method performed 7-9% (word perplexity reduction) better than conventional cutoff methods.",
        "In section 2, we discuss prior SLM research, including backoff bigram LM, perplexity, and related works on LM pruning methods.",
        "In section 3, we propose a new criterion for LM pruning based on n-gram distribution, and discuss in detail how to estimate the distribution.",
        "In section 4, we compare our method with count cutoff, and present experimental results in perplexity.",
        "Finally, we present our conclusions in section 5."

        "One of the most successful forms of SLM is the n-gram LM.",
        "N-gram LM estimates the probability of a word given the n-1 previous words, P(wn|w1, ...,wn-1).",
        "In practice, n is usually set to 2 (bigram), or 3 (trigram).",
        "For simplicity, we restrict our discussion to bigram, P(wn|wn-1), which assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the identity of the immediately preceding word.",
        "But our approach extends to any n-gram.",
        "Perplexity is the most common metric for evaluating a bigram LM.",
        "It is defined as,",

        "The perplexity can be roughly interpreted as the geometric mean of the branching factor of the document when presented to the language model.",
        "Clearly, lower perplexities are better.",
        "One of the key issues in language modelling is the problem of data sparseness.",
        "To deal with the problem, (Katz, 1987) proposed a backoff scheme, which is widely used in bigram language modelling.",
        "Backoff scheme estimates the probability of an unseen bigram by utilizing unigram estimates.",
        "It is of the form:",

        "Due to the memory limitation in realistic applications, only a finite set of word pairs have conditional probabilities P(wn |wn-1) explicitly represented in the model, especially when the model is trained on a large corpus.",
        "The remaining word pairs are assigned a probability by back-off (i.e. unigram estimates).",
        "The goal of bigram pruning is to remove uncommon explicit bigram estimates P(wn |wn-1) from the model to reduce the number of parameters, while minimizing the performance loss.",
        "The most common way to eliminate unused count is by means of count cutoffs (Jelinek, 1990).",
        "A cutoff is chosen, say 2, and all probabilities stored in the model with 2 or fewer counts are removed.",
        "This method assumes that there is not much difference between a bigram occurring once, twice, or not at all.",
        "Just by excluding those bigrams with a small count from a model, a significant saving in memory can be achieved.",
        "In a typical training corpus, roughly 65% of unique bigram sequences occur only once.",
        "Recently, several improvements over count cutoffs have been proposed.",
        "(Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) proposed a different pruning scheme for backoff models, where bigrams are ranked by a weighted difference of the log probability estimate before and after pruning.",

        "(Stolcke, 1998) proposed a criterion for pruning based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned model.",
        "The relative entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training data perplexity.",
        "All bigrams that change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model.",
        "Stolcke also concluded that, for practical purpose, the method in (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) is a very good approximation to this method.",
        "All previous cutoff methods described above use a similar criterion for pruning, that is, the difference (or information loss) between the original estimate and the backoff estimate.",
        "After ranking, all bigrams with difference small enough will be pruned, since they contain no more information."

        "As described in the previous section, previous cutoff methods assume that training data covers testing data.",
        "Bigrams that are infrequent in training data are also assumed to be infrequent in testing data, and will be cutoff.",
        "But in the real world, no matter how large the training data, it is still always very sparse compared to all data in the world.",
        "Furthermore, training data will be biased by its mixture of domain, time, or style, etc.",
        "For example, if we use newspaper in training, a name like “Lewinsky” may have high frequency in certain years but not others; if we use Gone with the Wind in training, “Scarlett O’Hara” will have disproportionately high probability and will not be cutoff.",
        "We propose another approach to pruning.",
        "We aim to keep bigrams that are more likely to occur in a new document.",

        "In bigram distribution models, we wish to model the probability that a word pair (wi-1 ,wi) occurs in a new document.",
        "The probability can be expressed as the measure of the generality of a bigram.",
        "Thus, in what follows, it is denoted by Pgen(wi-1,wi).",
        "The higher the Pgen(wi-1,wi) is, for one particular document, the less informative the bigram is, but for all documents, the more general the bigram is.",
        "We now consider several methods for term distribution modelling, which are widely used in Information Retrieval, and extend them to bigram distribution modelling.",
        "These methods include models based on the Poisson distribution (Mood et al., 1974), inverse document frequency (Salton and Michael, 1983), and Katz’s K mixture (Katz, 1996).",
        "The standard probabilistic model for the distribution of a certain type of event over units of a fixed size (such as periods of time or volumes of liquid) is the Poisson distribution, which is defined as follows:",
        "In the most common model of the Poisson distribution in IR, the parameter .1i>0 is the average number of occurrences of wi per",

        "In our case, the event we are interested in is the occurrence of a particular word pair (wi-1,wi) and the fixed unit is the document.",
        "We can use the Poisson distribution to estimate an answer to the question: what is the probability that a word pair occurs in a document.",
        "Therefore, we get",
        "IDF is a widely used measure of specificity (Salton and Michael, 1983).",
        "It is the reverse of generality.",
        "Therefore we can also derive generality from IDF.",
        "IDF is defined as follows:",

        "Therefore, we use the following form instead,",
        "where a is a weighting factor tuned to maximize the performance.",
        "As stated in (Manning and Schütze, 1999), the Poisson estimates are good for non-content words, but not for content words.",
        "Several improvements over Poisson have been proposed.",
        "These include two-Poisson Model (Harter, 1975) and Katz’s K mixture model (Katz, 1996).",
        "The K mixture is the better.",
        "It is also a simpler distribution that fits empirical distributions of content words as well as non-content words.",
        "Therefore, we try to use K mixture for bigram distribution modelling.",
        "According to (Katz, 1996), K mixture model estimates the probability that word wi appears k times in a document as follows:",
        "where i5k,0=1 iff k=0 and dk,0=0 otherwise.",
        "a and fQ are parameters that can be fit using the observed mean A and the observed inverse document frequency IDF as follow:",
        "where K is dependent on the size of the subunit, the larger the subunit, the larger the value (in our experiments, we set K from 1 to 3), and Pi(k) is the probability of word pair (wi-1,wi) occurs k times in a document.",
        "Pi(k) is estimated by equation (8), where a , andfQ are estimated by equations (9) to (12).",
        "Accordingly, cf is the total number of occurrence of a word pair (wi-1,wi) in the collection, df is the number of documents that contain (wi-1,wi), and N is the total number of documents.",
