        "For the past two decades computational linguistics (CL) has progressed substantially in Vietnam, mainly in these basic aspects: data acquisition from the keyboard, encoding, and restitution through an output device for Vietnamese diacritic characters, updates on the fonts in Microsoft DOS/Windows, standardization for Vietnamese (James Do, Ngo Thanh Nhan), automatic translation of English documents into Vietnamese and vice versa (Phan Thi Tuoi, Dinh Dien), recognition of handwriting (Hoang Kiem, Nguyen Van Khuong), speech processing (Nguyen Thanh Phuc, Quach Tuan Ngoc), building bilingual dictionaries such as English-Vietnamese and V-E, French-Vietnamese and VF dictionaries (Lac Viet), archives of old Sino-Vietnamese documents (Ngo Trung Viet, Cong Tam), etc.",
        "Some of these works have been presented in Informatics and IT workshops organized in Vietnam.",
        "These efforts are modest and do not yet show our full potential.",
        "There are many reasons for this weakness.",
        "The major reasons that the different efforts are quite isolated and there is not enough coordination.",
        "Some coordinated workshops held from time to time would be very helpful.",

        "DaNang University we are building a lexical database based on TELEX code for accomplishing the following tasks:",
        "- Converting Vietnamese texts from any font to any other font.",

        "- Looking up words up in the monolingual and / or multilingual dictionary.",
        "- Building specialized monolingual dictionaries.",
        "At present, we are taking part in the GETA, CLIPS, IMAG, France, in the FEV project: for a multilingual dictionary: French-Vietnamese via English.",
        "In fact, inputting Vietnamese texts still encounters many problems, not yet solved properly.",
        "The most common mistakes in detecting and correcting spelling errors are: - wrong intonation or misspelling, - not following spelling specialization, not using syllables systematically in the same texts, etc.",
        "Winword, a commercial text processor, is not able to detect and correct spelling mistakes.",
        "The program designed by Ngo Thanh Nhan (without an associated spelling dictionary) and other software packages for Vietnamese still do not offer adequate solutions.",
        "We propose here a general solution for building the so-called Vietools for detecting and correcting spelling errors.",
        "Vietools is designed for office application such as Winword, Excel, Acess, PowerPoint, etc.",
        "in Microsoft Windows.",

        "Altogether, there are 27 initial consonants, and 1160 rhyme patterns (including 6 tones).",
        "Based on Vietnamese syllable structure, the spelling database is built in a tabular form.",
        "Each element of the table helps to check the correction of a syllable based on the column position of initial consonants and the row position of rhyme patterns, for example, the syllable lamf (work) in the TELEX form, is composed of the initial consonant l and rhyme pattern am with by low falling tone (or grave accent) f. Each element of the table can be understood as:",
        "- syllables used in Vietnamese.",
        "- elements between tone sign positions (on o: oja or on a: oaj), pronunciation or dialect with spelling (z is equivalent to d or gi, y is equivalent to i ... ) and borrowings such as karaoke, photocopy, fax... - Sino-Vietnamese word: coongj (addition) → congj, quoocs (country) → nuwowcs... - being unable to form syllables: quts, quoon, coan , cuee...",
        "Techniques have been developed to recognize the compound words from two syllables, such as baor damr or damr baor (guarantee), chung chung (vague), etc., from three syllables, such as howpj tacs xax (cooperative), etc., from four syllables, such as coong awn vieecj lamf (work, job), etc."
