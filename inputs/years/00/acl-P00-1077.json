        "In the anusaaraka systems, the load between the human reader and the machine is divided as follows: language-based analysis of the text is carried out by the machine, and knowledge-based analysis or interpretation is left to the reader.",
        "The machine uses a dictionary and grammar rules, to produce the output.",
        "Most importantly, it does not use world knowledge to interpret (or disambiguate), as it is an error prone task and involves guessing or inferring based on knowledge other than the text.",
        "Anusaaraka aims for perfect \"information preservation\".",
        "We relax the requirement that the output be grammatical.",
        "In fact, anusaaraka output follows the grammar of the source language (where the grammar rules differ, and cannot be applied with 100 percent confidence).",
        "This requires that the reader undergo a short training to read and understand the output.",
        "Among Indian languages, which share vocabulary, grammar, pragmatics, etc.",
        "the task (and the training) is easier.",
        "For example, words in a language are ambiguous, but if the two languages are close, one is likely to find a one to one correspondence between words such that the meaning is carried across from the source language to target language.",
        "For example, for 80 percent of the Kannada words in the anusaaraka dictionary of 30,000 root words, there is a single equivalend Hindi word which covers the senses of the original Kannada word.",
        "Similarly, wherever the two languages differ in grammatical constructions, either an existing construction in the target language which expresses the same meaning is used, or a new construction is invented (or an old construction used with some special notation).",
        "For example, adjectival participial phrases in the south Indian languages are mapped to relative clauses in Hindi with the ’*’ notation (Bharati, 2000).",
        "Similarly, existing words in the target language may be given wider or narrower meaning (Narayana, 1994).",

        "Depending on the type of news, it uses an appropriate dictionary.",
        "For example, the word ’party’ is usually a ’politicalentity’ and not a ’social event’, in political news.",
        "The text categorisation component uses word-vectors and is easily trainable from pre-categorized news corpus.",
        "The parser tries to identify chunks (such as noun phrases, verb groups) but does not attempt to join them together.",
        "It requires considerable human assistance in analysing the input.",
        "Another novel component of the system is that given a complex English sentence, it breaks it up into simpler sentences, which are then analysed and used to generate Hindi.",
