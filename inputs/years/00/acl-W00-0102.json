        "We propose a method for dealing with semantic complexities occurring in information retrieval systems on the basis of linguistic observations.",
        "Our method follows from an analysis indicating that long runs of content words appear in a stopped document cluster, and our observation that these long runs predominately originate from the prepositional phrase and subject complement positions and as such, may be useful predictors of semantic coherence.",
        "From this linguistic basis, we test three statistical hypotheses over a small collection of documents from different genre.",
        "By coordinating thesaurus semantic categories (SEMCATs) of the long run words to the semantic categories of paragraphs, we conclude that for paragraphs containing both long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT weight of long runs of content words is a strong predictor of the semantic coherence of the paragraph.",
        "Introduction One of the fundamental deficiencies of current information retrieval methods is that the words searchers use to construct terms often are not the same as those by which the searched information has been indexed.",
        "There are two components to this problem, synonymy and polysemy (Deerwester et.",
        "al., 1990).",
        "By definition of polysemy, a document containing the search terms or indexed with the search terms is not necessarily relevant.",
        "Polysemy contributes heavily to poor precision.",
        "Attempts to deal with the synonymy problem have relied on intellectual or automatic term expansion, or the construction of a thesaurus.",
        "Also the ambiguity of natural language causes semantic complexities that result in poor precision.",
        "Since queries are mostly formulated as words or phrases in a language, and the expressions of a language are ambiguous in many cases, the system must have ways to disambiguate the query.",
        "In order to resolve semantic complexities in information retrieval systems, we designed a method to incorporate semantic information into current IR systems.",
        "Our method ( 1 ) adopts widely used Semantic Information or Categories, (2) calculates Semantic Weight based on probability, and (3) (for the purpose of verifying the method) performs partial text retrieval based upon Semantic Weight or Coherence to overcome cognitive overload of the human agent.",
        "We make two basic assumptions: 1.",
        "Matching search terms to semantic categories should improve retrieval precision.",
        "2.",
        "Long runs of content words have a linguistic basis for Semantic Weight and can also be verified statistically.",
        "1A Brief Overview of Previous Approaches There have been several attempts to deal with complexity using semantic information.",
        "These methods are hampered by the lack of dictionaries containing proper semantic categories for classifying text.",
        "Semantic methods designed by Boyd et.",
        "al.",
        "(1994) and Wendlandt et.",
        "al.",
        "(1991) demonstrate only simple examples and are restricted to small numbers of words.",
        "In order to overcome this",
        "deficiency, we propose to incorporate the structural information of the thesaurus, semantic categories (SEMCATs).",
        "However, we must also incorporate semantic categories into current IR systems in a compatible manner.",
        "The problem we deal with is partial text retrieval when all the terms of the traditional vector equations are not known.",
        "This is the case when retrieval is associated with a near real time filter, or when the size or number of documents in a corpus is unknown.",
        "In such cases we can retrieve only partial text, a paragraph or page.",
        "But since there is no document wide or corpus wide statistics, it is difficult to judge whether or not the text fragment is relevant.",
        "The method we employ in this paper identifies semantic \"hot spots\" in partial text.",
        "These \"hot spots\" are loci of semantic coherence in a paragraph of text.",
        "Such paragraphs are likely to convey the central ideas of the document, We also deal with the computational aspects of partial text retrieval.",
        "We use a simple stop/stem method to expose long runs of context words that are evaluated relative to the search terms.",
        "Our goal is not to retrieve a highly relevant sentence, but rather to retrieve a portion of text that is semantically coherent with respect to the search terms.",
        "This locale can be returned to the searcher for evaluation and if it is relevant, the search terms can be refined.",
        "This approach is compatible with Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for partial text retrieval when the terms of the vector space are not known.",
        "LSI is based on a vector space information retrieval method that has demonstrated improved performance over the traditional vector space techniques.",
        "So when incorporating semantic information, it is necessary to adopt existing mathematical methods including probabilistic methods and statistical methods."

        "These runs can be weighted for density in a stopped document and vector processed.",
        "We observed that these long content word runs generally originate from the prepositional phrase and subject complement positions, providing a linguistic basis for a dense neighbourhood of long runs of content words signalling a semantic locus of the writing.",
        "We suppose that these neighbourhoods may contain main ideas of the text.",
        "In order to verify this, we designed a methodology to incorporate semantic features into information retrieval and examined long runs of content words as a semantic predictor.",
        "We examined all the long runs of the Jang (1997) collection and discovered most of them originate from the prepositional phrase and subject complement positions.",
        "According to Halliday (1985), a preposition is explained as a minor verb.",
        "It functions as a minor Predicator having a nominal group as its complement.",
        "Thus the internal structure of 'across the lake' is like that of 'crossing the lake', with a non-finite verb as Predicator (thus our choice of 3 words as a long run).",
        "When we interpret the preposition as a \"minor Predicator\" and \"minor Process\", we are interpreting the prepositional phrase as a kind of minor clause.",
        "That is, prepositional phrases function as a clause and their role is predication.",
        "Traditionally, predication is what a statement says about its subject.",
        "A named predication corresponds to an externally defined function, namely what the speaker intends to say his or her subject, i.e. their referent.",
        "If long runs largely appear in predication positions, it would suggest that the speaker is saying something important and the longer runs of content words would signal a locus of the speaker's intention.",
        "Extending from the statistical analysis of Jang (1997) and our observations of those long runs in the collection, we give a basic assumption of OUT study: Long runs of content words contain significant semantic information that a speaker wants to express and focus, and thus are semantic indicators or loci or main ideas.",
        "In this paper, we examine the SEMCAT values of long and short runs, extracted from a random document of the collection in Tang (1997), to determine if the SEMCAT weights of long runs of content words are semantic predictors."
