        "This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al. 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) -- a semantic database for German similar to WordNet.",
        "The introduction of such classes can reduce the amount of lexical semantic processing, because the number of disambiguation decisions can be restricted more clearly to those cases that involve real ambiguity (homonymy).",
        "Different than with homonyms, systematically polysemous words need not always be disambiguated, because such words have several related senses that are shared in a systematic way by a group of similar words.",
        "In many applications then, for instance in document categorization and other areas of information retrieval, it may be sufficient to know if a given word belongs to this group rather than to know which of its (related) senses exactly to pick.",
        "In other words, it will suffice to assign a more coarse grained sense that leaves several related senses underspecified, but which can be further specified on demandl.",
        "The approach for finding systematic polysemous classes is based on that of (Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), but takes into account some shortcomings as pointed out in (Krymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998).",
        "Whereas the original approach identified a small set of top-level synsets for grouping together lexical items, I As pointed out in (Wilks 99), earlier work in AI on Polaroid Words' (Hirst 87) and 'Word Experts' (Small 81) advocated a similar, incremental approach to sense representation and interpretation.",
        "In line with this, the CoreLex approach discussed here provides a large scale inventory of systematically polysemous lexical items with underspecified representations that can be incrementally refined.",
        "the new approach compares lexical items according to all of their synsets on all hierarchy levels.",
        "In addition, the new approach is both more flexible and precise by using a clustering algorithm for comparing meaning distributions between lexical items.",
        "Whereas the original approach took into account only identical distributions (with additional human intervention to further group together sufficiently similar classes), the clustering approach allows for completely automatic comparisons, relative to certain thresholds, that identify partial overlaps in meaning distributions."

        "In lexical semantics, a distinction can be made between senses that are of a contrastive and those that are of a complementary nature (Weinreich 1964).",
        "Contrastive senses are unrelated to each other as with the two meanings of \"bank\".",
        "However, such clear-cut (contrastive) meaning distinctions are rather the exception than the rule.",
        "Often, words have a number of (complementary) senses that are somehow related to each other in systematic ways (Pustejovsky 1995).",
        "For instance, a word like \"mouth\" has several senses that are all somehow related (after Cruse 1986): John opened his mouth.",

        "Related senses are, however, only systematic (or regular) if more than one example in a language can be found as formulated in (Apresjan 1973): Polysemy of the word A with the meanings ai and of is called regular if in the given language, there exists at least one other word B with the meanings bi k, which are semantically distinguished from each other in exactly the same way as ai and of and if ai and bi, ai and b1 are nonsynonymous.",
        "With this definition, we can construct classes of systematically polysemous words as shown in the CoreLex approach (Buitelaar 1998a) (Buitelaar 1998b).",
        "This method takes WordNet sense assignments and compares their distribution by reducing them to a set of basic types.",
        "For instance, WordNet assigns to the noun \"book\" the following senses:",
        "1. publication 2. product, production 3. fact 4. dramatic_composition, dramatic_work 5. record 6. section, subdivision 7. journal",
        "At the top of the WordNet hierarchy these seven senses can be reduced to two basic types: the content that is being communicated and the medium of communication.",
        "We can arrive at systematically polysemous classes by investigating which other words share these same senses and are thus polysemous in the same way.",
        "For instance, the seven different senses that WordNet assigns to \"book\" can be reduced to two basic types: artifact and communication.",
        "We do this for each noun and then group them into classes according to their combination of basic types.",
        "Finally, by human introspection several classes were grouped together, because their members seemed sufficiently similar.",
        "Among the resulting classes are a number that are to be expected given the literature on systematic polysemy.",
        "For instance, the classes animal 1 food and plant / natural product have been discussed widely.",
        "Other classes are less",
        "expected, but seem quite intuitive.",
        "The class artifact I attribute / substance for instance includes a number of nouns (\"chalk, charcoal, daub, fiber, fibre, tincture\") that refer to an object that is at the same time an artifact made of some substance and that is also an attribute."
