      "text": [
        "In recent years, several on-line broad-coverage semantic lexicons became available, including LDOCE (Procter, 1978), WordNet (Miller, 1990) and HECTOR (Kilgarriff, 1998a).",
        "These lexicons have been used as a domain-independent semantic resource as well as an evaluation criteria in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "However, those lexicons are rather complex.",
        "For instance, WordNet (version 1.6) contains a total of over 120,000 words and 170,000 word senses, which are grouped into around 100,000 synsets (synonym sets).",
        "In addition to the size, word entries in those lexicon are often polyse-mous.",
        "For instance, 20% of the words in Word-net have more than one sense, and the average number of senses of those polysemous words is around 3.",
        "Also, the distinction between word senses tends to be ambiguous and arbitrary.",
        "For example, the following 6 senses are listed in WordNet for the noun \"door\":",
        "1. door - a swinging or sliding barrier 2. door - the space in a wall 3. door - anything providing a means of access (or escape) 4. door - a swinging or sliding barrier that will close off access into a car 5. door - a house that is entered via a door 6. door - a room that is entered via a door",
        "Because of the high degree of ambiguity, using such complex semantic lexicons brings some serious problems to the performance of NLP systems.",
        "The first, obvious problem is the computational intractability: increased processing time needed to disambiguate multiple possibilities will necessarily slow down the system.",
        "Another problem, which has been receiving attention in the past few years, is the inaccuracy: when there is more than one sense applicable in a given context, different systems (or human individuals) may select different senses as the correct sense, Indeed, recent studies in WSD show that, when sense definitions are fine-grained, similar senses become indistinguishable to human annotators and often cause disagreement on the correct tag (Ng et al., 1999; Veronis, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1998b).",
        "Also in IR and IE tasks, difference in the correct sense assignment will surely degrade recall and precision of the systems.",
        "Thus, it is apparent that, in order for a lexicon to be useful as an evaluation criteria for NLP systems, it must represent word senses at the level of granularity that captures human intuition.",
        "In Lexical Semantics, several approaches have been proposed which organize a lexicon based on systematic polysemy:' a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable",
        "ways (e.g.",
        "ANIMAL and MEAT meanings of the word \"chicken\" ).2 In particular, (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998) identified systematic relations that exist between abstract semantic concepts in the WordNet noun hierarchy, and defined a set of underspecified semantic classes that represent the relations.",
        "Then he extracted all polysemous nouns in WordNet according to those underspecified classes and built a lexicon called CORELEX.",
        "For example, a CORELEX class AQU (which represents a relation between ARTIFACT and QUANTITY) contains words such as \"bottle\", \"bucket\" and \"spoon\".",
        "Using the abstract semantic classes and organizing a lexicon based on systematic polysemy addresses the two problems mentioned above in the following ways.",
        "For the first problem, using the abstract classes can reduce the size of the lexicon by combining several related senses into one sense; thus computation becomes more efficient.",
        "For the second problem, systematic polysemy does reflect our general intuitions on word meanings.",
        "Although the distinction between systematic vs. non-systematic relations (or related vs. unrelated meanings) is sometimes unclear, systematicity of the related senses among words is quite intuitive and has been well studied in Lexical Semantics (for example, (Apresjan, 1973; Cruse, 1986; Nunberg, 1995; Copes-take and Briscoe, 1995)).",
        "However, there is one critical issue still to be addressed: the level of granularity at which the abstract classes are defined.",
        "The problem is that, when the granularity of the abstract classes is too coarse, systematic relations defined at that level may not hold uniformly at more fine-grained levels (Vossen et al., 1999).",
        "For instance, the CORELEX class AQU mentioned above also contains a word \"dose\".3 Here, the relation between the senses of \"dose\" is different from that of \"bottle\", \"bucket\" and \"spoon\", which can be labeled as CONTAINER-CONTAINERFUL relation.",
        "We argue that human intuitions can distinguish meanings 2 Note that systematic polysemy should be contrasted with homonymy which refers to words which have more than one unrelated sense (e.g. FINANCIAL – INSTITUTION and SLOPING_LAND meanings of the word \"bank\").",
        "'Senses of \"dose\" in WordNet are: (1) a measured portion of medicine taken at any one time, and (2) the quantity of an active agent (substance or radiation) taken in or absorbed at any one time.",
        "at this level, where differences between the systematic relations are rather clear, and therefore lexicons that encode word senses at this level of granularity have advantages over fine-grained as well as coarse-grained lexicons in various NLP tasks.",
        "Another issue we like to address is the ways for extracting systematic polysemy.",
        "Most often, this procedure is done manually.",
        "For example, the current version of WordNet (1.6) encodes the similarity between word senses (or synsets) by a relation called cousin.",
        "But those cousin relations were identified manually by the WordNet lexicographers.",
        "A similar effort was also made in the EuroWordnet project (Vossen et al., 1999).",
        "However, manually inspecting a large, complex lexicon is very time-consuming and often prone to inconsistencies.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method which automatically extracts systematic polysemy from a hierarchically organized semantic lexicon (WordNet).",
        "Our method uses a modification of a tree generalization technique used in (Li and Abe, 1998), and generates a tree-cut, which is a list of clusters that partition a tree.",
        "Then, we compare the systematic relations extracted by our automatic method to the WordNet cousins.",
        "Preliminary results show that our method discovered most of the WordNet cousins as well as some more interesting relations.",
        "2 Tree Generalization using Tree-cut and MDL",
        "Before we present our method, we first give a brief summary of the tree-cut technique which we adopted from (Li and Abe, 1998).",

        "It is a list of internal/leaf nodes in the tree, and each node represents a set of all leaf nodes in a subtree rooted by the node.",
        "Such set is also considered as a cluster.4 Clusters in a tree-cut exhaustively cover all leaf nodes of the tree, and they are mutually disjoint.",
        "For example, for a thesaurus tree in Figure 1, there are 5 tree-cuts: [airplane, helicopter, ball, kite, puzzle], [AIRCRAFT, ball, kite, puzzle], [airplane, helicopter, TOY], [AIRCRAFT, TOY] and (ARTIFACT].",
        "Thus, a tree-cut corresponds to one of the levels of abstraction in the tree.",
        "Using a thesaurus tree and the idea of tree-cut, the problem of acquiring generalized case frame patters (for a fixed verb) from a corpus is to select the best tree-cut that accounts for both observed and unobserved case frame instances.",
        "In (Li and Abe, 1998), this generalization problem is viewed as a problem of selecting the best model for a tree-cut that estimates the true probability distribution, given a sample corpus data.",
        "Formally, a tree-cut model M is a pair consisting of a tree-cut F and a probability parameter vector () of the same length,",

        "For the problem of case frame generalization, the MDL principle fits very well in that it captures the trade-off between the simplicity of a model, which is measured by the number of clusters in a tree-cut, and the goodness of fit to the data, which is measured by the estimation accuracy of the probability distribution.",

        "However, we must be careful in adopting Li and Abe's technique directly: since the problem which their technique was applied to is fundamentally different from ours, some procedures used in their problem may not have any interpretation in our problem.",

        "First, we eliminate multiple inheritance by separating shared subtrees.",
        "Second, we bring down every internal node to a leaf level by creating a new duplicate node and adding it as a child of the old node (thus making the old node an internal node).",
        "After trees are transformed, our method extracts systematic polysemy by the following three steps.",
        "In the first step, all leaf nodes of the two trees are marked with either 1 or 0 (1 if a node/word appears in both trees, or 0 otherwise).",
        "In the second step, the generalization technique is applied to each tree, and two tree-cuts are obtained.",
        "To search for the best tree-cut, instead of computing the description length for all possible tree-cuts in a tree, a greedy dynamic programming algorithm is used.",
        "This algorithm, called Find-MDL in (Li and Abe, 1998), finds the best tree-cut for a tree by recursively finding the best tree-cuts for all of its subtrees and merging them from bottom up.",
        "This algorithm is quite efficient, since it is basically a depth-first search with minor overhead for computing the description length.",
        "Finally in the third step, clusters from the two tree-cuts are matched up, and the pairs which have substantial overlap are selected as systematic polysemy.",
        "Figure 4 shows parts of the final tree-cuts for ARTIFACT and MEASURE obtained by our method.?",
        "In both trees, most of the clusters in the tree-cuts are from nodes at depth 1 (counting the root as depth 0).",
        "That is because the tree-cut technique used in our method is sensitive to the structure of the tree.",
        "More specifically, the MDL principle inherently penalizes a complex tree-cut by assigning a long parameter length.",
        "Therefore, unless the entropy of the feature distribution is large enough to make the data length overshadow the parameter length, simpler tree-cuts partitioned at abstract levels are preferred.",
        "This situation tends to happen often when the tree is bushy and the total feature frequency is low.",
        "This was precisely the case with ARTIFACT and MEASURE, where both",
        "trees were quite bushy, and only 4% and 14% of the words were polysemous in the two categories respectively.",
        "4 Evaluation To test our method, we chose 5 combinations from WordNet noun Top categories (which we call top relation classes), and extracted cluster pairs which have more than 3 overlapping words.",

        "Words which are common in the two clusters include \"yard\", \"foot\" and \"knot\" (see the previous Figure 4).",
        "Here, the concept INSTRUMENTALITY is very general (at depth 1), and it also contains many (polysemous) words.",
        "So, matching this cluster with another abstract cluster is likely to yield a pair which has just enough overlapping words but whose relation is not systematic.",
        "In the case of [INSTRUMENTALITY, LINEAR_UNIT], the situation is even worse, because the concept of LINEAR_UNIT in MEASURE represents a collection of terms that were chosen arbitrarily in the his",
