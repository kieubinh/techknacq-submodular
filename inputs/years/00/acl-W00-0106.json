        "In addition, there are \"easy\" facts which may be found in a single sentence (example: the name of a city) as well as \"difficult\" facts which are spread across several sentences (example: the reason for a particular event).",
        "For a computer system to be able to process text documents in applications like information extraction (IE), question answering, and reading comprehension, it has to have the ability to extract facts from text.",
        "Obviously, the performance of the system will depend upon the type of fact it has to extract: explicit or implicit, easy or difficult, etc.",
        "(by no means is this list complete).",
        "In addition, the performance of such systems varies greatly depending on various additional factors including known vocabulary, sentence length, the amount of training, quality of parsing, etc.",
        "Despite the great variations in the performances of such systems, it has been hypothesized that there are facts that are simply harder to extract than others (Hirschman, 1992).",
        "In this section we describe a method for estimating the complexity of extracting a fact from text.",
        "The proposed model was initially used to analyze the information extraction task (Bagga and Bierrnann, 1997).",
        "In addition to verifying Hirschman's hypothesis, the model also provided us with a framework for analyzing and understanding the performance of several IE systems (Bagga and Biermann, 1998).",
        "We have also proposed using this model to analyze the complexity of the QA task which is related to both the IE, and the reading comprehension tasks (Bagga et al., 1999).",
        "The remainder of this section describes the model in detail, and provides a sample application of the model to an IE task.",
