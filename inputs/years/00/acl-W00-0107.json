        "Quantification of task difficulty has been applied to many areas in artificial intelligence, including information retrieval (Bagga, 1997) (Bagga and Biermann, 1997), machine learning (Niyogi, 1996), parsing and grammatical formalisms(G. Edward Barton et al., 1987), and language learning in general (Ristad, 1993).",
        "In addition to providing a way of comparing systems, these measures quantify task complexity before a system is built.",
        "The goal of this paper is to measure the complexity of domains for dialog processing.",
        "With a standard measure of complexity, domains can be compared and analyzed without having to build the dialog system first.",
        "This measure would be an indication of the cost, amount of code, accuracy, reliability, and execution time of the finished dialog system specified by the domain.",
        "The hope is to have a single number or pair of numbers that correlates strongly with these standard measures.",
        "Specifically, if domain D1 has complexity Ci and domain D2 has complexity C2 where C2 > C1, then we would expect D2 to have a greater cost of software, more lines of code, less accuracy, less reliability, and longer execution time.",
        "Section 2 will describe the difference in semantic and syntactic complexity and explain why we consider each separately.",
        "In section 3 we define the terms in the complexity analysis, which is explained in section 4.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 discuss how to compute information measures that are needed in the complexity analysis, and in sections 7 and 8 we present future work and conclude."

        "This will include all the objects in the domain, the attributes of those objects to which one might refer, and the relationships between the objects that the user can express.",
        "Syntactic complexity refers to the variety of ways that the user will be allowed to refer to an object, attribute, or relationship.",
        "For example, a domain could include only two boys but if the user is allowed to refer to them in many ways (e.g., \"Bob\", \"Jim\", \"he\", \"they\", \"the two boys next to the water cooler at the back of the room\"), then the domain is semantically simple but syntactically complex.",
        "Likewise a domain with 100 objects that are each referred to only as Objectl, Object2, etc... is semantically complex but syntactically simple.",
        "Semantic and syntactic complexities form a trade-off when it comes to building a language processor for a domain.",
        "To build a reliable and accurate processor, the domain must be sufficiently restrained.",
        "The more syntactic variety allowed the user, the fewer objects allowed in the domain.",
