        "As part of this mapping, the reference of the various f-structure elements is resolved resulting in the addition of information to certain existing IL objects (coreference) or in the creation of new IL objects which are added to the domain of discourse (initial reference).",
        "For this effort, we adopt Text Meaning Representation for our IL and rely on the ONTOS ontology (Mahesh & Nirenburg, 1995) as a general knowledge base.",
        "Since the central barrier to developing such a system today is the incompleteness of the knowledge base, we outline a strategy starting with the implementation of a series of form-based resolution algorithms that are applied directly to the referring expressions of the input text.",
        "These are initially supplemented by a knowledge-based resolution procedure which, as the knowledge base grows and the adequacy of the f-structure and IL-representation increases, takes on more and more of the processing load."

        "They include string match algorithms for proper noun phrases (PNs) and common noun phrases (NPs) (e.g., Bagga & Baldwin, 1998) and syntactically constrained morphological matching for pronominals and deictic NPs (Lappin & Leass, 1994).",
        "In some cases, they include constraints related to clause structure or larger textual units (e.g., Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995).",
        "They do not generally consider implicit references or, in the case of Spanish (e.g., Ferrandez et al., 1998), references to contextually clear possessors using determiners rather than possessive adjectives.",
        "All such approaches are supplemented, if not entirely determined, by heuristics which, more recently, have been induced statistically from corpora (e.g., Hirschman et al., 1998, Popescu-Belis, 1998).",
        "The only approaches of which the authors are aware that attempted to account for implicit referents or implicit references are those developed within AI over two decades ago (e.g., Hobbs, 1979, or DeJong, 1979).",
        "This approach suggested here differs radically in that reference resolution is triggered by elements of interlingual (IL) representation rather than surface text expressions.",
        "The referents in the domain of discourse consist of elements of IL representation as well.",
        "Thus, implicit references and implicit referents are accounted for and, at the same time, empty references are ignored.",

        "It should be noted that all these elements are, in fact, coreferent with implicit temporal and spatial references of various finite verbs that are used to report certain events or states of affairs.",
        "Perhaps the most contentious of the pronominal elements to be discussed here are the definite articles of noun phrases which can be contextually interpreted as having the force of possessive adjectives.",

        "Semantic information is established on the basis of the expression's form and context.",
        "For instance, in looking for a possible referent for la rentabilidad sabre las yentas (its profit over sales ratio) above, it is first necessary to establish that the potential referent must be some measurement of financial performance which has increased during some particular period of time for some particular company.",
        "At the time a reference for la rentabilidad sobre las yentas is sought, there are some 98 existing referents (53 objects, 34 events, 11 implicit objects).",
        "The more recent of these include \"641.5 million Swiss Francs\", \"Roche Group's net profit\", \"Roche Group's pharmaceutical division\", \"41% of Roche Group's total sales\", \"8.69 billion Swiss Francs\", \"Roche Group's total sales\", \"1988\" and so on.",
        "Of these, only \"Roche Group's net profit\" and \"Roche Group's total sales\" are possible measurements of a company's financial performance.",
        "However, both these measurements should be ontologically distinct from a company's profit over sales as well as from each other.",
        "Thus, they fail to satisfy the semantic requirements of a potential referent for the expression.",
        "In the end, no semantically appropriate referent will be found among the pool of existing referents and so a new referent is introduced to the pool.",
        "If an existing referent meets the informational constraints on potential referent of the expression being processed, the expression is assumed to refer to that referent.",
        "If no existing referent satisfies those constraints, the expression is assumed to refer to something new and a new referent is added to the pool of referents."

        "As mentioned, there were 45 events or states-of-affairs referred to in the sample Spanish text which introduce an additional 30 implied referents (5 times, 22 places and 3 actors).",
        "These events, and the implicit referents they introduce, need to be identified for successfully carrying out the coreference task.",
        "They may act as referents that are later referred to in the text or they may serve to assist in constraining or establishing coreference between later expressions and other existing referents.",
        "For instance, of the 22 implied locations, 6 are later referred to in the text and, of the 5 implied times, 3 are later referred to.",
        "Clearly, there is no obvious form-based resolution procedure for such elements, since they have no explicit form.",
        "Thus, in order to resolve these implicitly introduced referents, the basic procedure is to treat them as pronominals.",
        "That is, every event or state-of-affairs in the TMR has an implicit \"at that time\" and \"at that place\" associated with it which has to be resolved as part of the reference task.",
        "Beyond the fact that the potential referents must times and locations respectively, any further constraints will have to be derived from what is known about the event and about its relative (temporal or local) status with respect to the other events which have previously been mentioned.",
        "A primary source of information for dealing with such issues will be scripts (Schank & Ableson, 1977).",
        "Similarly, the identification of implied actors will be dependent on the ontological (not lexical) definitions of the class of event or state-of-affairs referred to and any additional information that may be extracted from the particular events or states-of-affairs that have been previously mentioned.",
        "Given the informational constraints gathered, the procedure is then to inspect referents of like type (time, location, actor type) in reverse order of mention until one is found which is compatible with those additional informational constraints."

        "The advantages of the interlingual approach to reference resolution include the following: • only expressions related to actual referents are processed for coreference (i.e., no pleonastic pronouns, no clitic pronouns, no relative pronouns, etc.",
        "),",
        "• implicit as well as explicit referents are processes for coreference, • knowledge-based inferencing (both ontological and epistemic) is available for resolving (many) problematical cases, • ontologically connected actors, say, the different participants in a sequence of events making up a script, can be used to establish coreference, • texts in different languages can be processed in the same way, • all form-based procedures either are or can be implemented in any case.",
        "The central disadvantages are:",
        "• some surface text level ordering information is lost in the TMR, • discourse-structural information may be lost in the TMR, - • the need for a large and sophisticated knowledge sources, • the need for sound and appropriately-directed inferencing..",
        "As a result of the loss of ordering information, strict recency-based resolution procedures cannot be implemented.",
        "The referents in the domain are not ordered in terms of when they",
        "were introduced.",
        "The processing of the different arguments in f-structure does not necessarily correspond to the surface sequence of their mention.",
        "This \"defect\" could possibly be overcome by simply indexing each new the TMR object with the prior index plus one (assuming the indexes are integers).",
        "The tacit assumption is that, at the level of the clause, first the predicate is processed and then the arguments are processed in left to right order as they appear in f-structure.",
        "As for the lack of information about the discourse structure, it may be the case that this is a defect of the TMR representation system.",
        "That is to say, it is not unreasonable to assume that the larger organisational aspects of a text, the topics, their order of presentation, the structure of the argumentation, etc., should in fact be captured in any adequate representation of the text.",
        "It has been, however, the goal of TMR to focus on capturing the information content exclusively and not on how the information is presented."
