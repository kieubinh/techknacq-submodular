        "); • to determine the prepartory actions that must be completed before the instruction is carried out, (for example, in order for an agent to open the door, the door has to be reachable and that may involve a locomotion process); • to decompose the action into smaller units (put the glass on the table, involves getting the glass, planning a route to the table, etc.)",
        "The output of the planner for the input instruction is a complete description of the actions involved, including participants, preparatory specifications, termination conditions, manner, duration, etc.",

        "In order to capture generalizations about motion actions, we have a generalized PAR schema for motion, and our hierarchy includes different types of motion actions such as inherently directed motion and manner of motion actions that inherit from the more general schema, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Directed motion actions, such as enter and exit, don't bring with them the manner by which the action is carried out but they have a inherent termination condition.",
        "For example, 'enter a room' may be done by walking, crawling or flying depending on the agents' ca",
        "pabilities, but it should end when the agent is in the room.",
        "In contrast, manner of motion verbs express the action explicitly and don't have an intrinsic termination condition.",

        "In (3), we see the English sentence expressing the 'enter' idea in the preposition into whereas the Spanish sentence expresses it in the main verb entrar (to enter).",
        "La botella entrci flotando a la cueva (the bottle entered floating the cave) The PAR schemas don't distinguish the representation for these sentences, because there is a single schema which includes both the manner and the path without specifying how they are realiized linguistically.",
        "Mappings from the lexical items to the schemes or to constraints in the schemas can be seen in Figure 5.5 Independent of which is the source language, the PAR schema selected is motion, the activity field, which determines how the action is performed (in this case, by floating), is filled by float (the main verb in English, or the adjunct in Spanish).",
        "The termination condition, which says that action ends when the agent is in the object, is added from the preposition in English and is part of the semantics of the main verb to enter in Spanish.",

        "The problem of whether or not a prepositional phrase constitutes an argument to a verb or an adjunct (described by Palmer et al.)",
        "does not constitute a problem in our representation, since all the information is recovered in the same template for the action to be animated.",
        "The PAR approach is much more similar to the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) approach, (Jackendoff, 1972; Jackendoff, 1990), used as an interlingua representation (Dorr, 1993).",
        "Based on the assumption that motion and manner of motion are conflated in a matrix verb like swim, the use of LCS allows separation of the concepts of motion, direction, and manner of motion in the sentence John swam across the lake.",

        "represented separately in the interlingua representation, as GO, PATH and MANNER, respectively.",
        "Our approach allows for a similar representation and the end result is the same, namely that the event of swimming across the lake is characterized by separate semantic components, which can be expressed by the main schema and by the activity field.",
        "In addition, our representation also incorporates details about the action such as applicability conditions, preparatory specifications, termination conditions, and adverbial modifiers.",

        "We have discussed a parameterized representation of actions grounded by the needs of animation of instructions in a simulated environment.",
        "In order to support the animation of these instructions, our representation makes explicit many details that are often underspecified in the language, such as start and end states and changes in the environment that happen as a result of the action.",
        "Sometimes the start and end state information provides critical information for accurate translation but it is not always necessary.",
        "Machine translation can often simply preserve ambiguities in the translation without resolving them.",
        "In our application we cannot afford this luxury.",
        "An interesting question to pursue for future work will be whether or not we can determine which PAR slots are not needed for machine translation purposes.",
        "Generalizations based on action classes provide the basis for an interlingua approach that captures the semantics of actions without committing to any language-dependent specification.",
        "This framework offers a strong foundation for handling the range of phenomena presented by the machine translation task.",
        "The structure of our PAR schemas incorporate into a single template the kind of divergence presented in verb-framed and satellite-framed languages.",
        "Although not shown in this paper, this representation can also capture idioms and non-compositional constructions since the animations of actions – and therefore the PARS that control them – must be equivalent for the same actions described in different languages.",
        "Currently, we are also investigating the possibility of building these action representations from a class-based verb lexicon which has explicit syntactic and semantic information (Kipper et al., 2000)."
