        "Unfortunately, the majority of MT systems do not deal with anaphora resolution and their successful operation usually does not go beyond the sentence level.",
        "In this paper, we present a complete approach that allows pronoun resolution and generation into the target language.",
        "Our approach works on unrestricted texts unlike other systems, like the KANT interlingua system (Leavitt et al.",
        "(1994)), that are designed for well-defined domains.",
        "Although full parsing of these texts could be applied, we have used partial parsing of the texts due to the unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar.",
        "This is a main difference with the majority of the interlingua systems such as the DLT system based on a modification of Esperanto (Witkam (1983)), the Rosetta system which is experimenting with Montague semantics as the basis for an interlingua (Appelo and Landsbergen (1986)), the KANT system, etc.",
        "as they use full parsing of the text.",
        "After the parsing and solving pronominal anaphora, an interlingua representation of the whole text is obtained.",

        "(1997), Castellon et al.",
        "(1998), the DLT system, etc).",
        "From this interlingua representation, the generation of anaphora (including intersentential anaphora), the detection of coreference chains of the whole text and the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English have been carried out, issues that are hardly considered by other systems.",
        "Furthermore, this approach can be used for other different applications, e.g. Information Retrieval, Summarization, etc.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In section 1, the complete approach that includes Analysis, Interlingua and Generation modules will be described.",
        "These modules will be explained in detail in the next three sections.",

        "With this training, we have extracted the degree of importance of the preferences that are used in the anaphora resolution module of the system.",
        "Furthermore, we have been able to check and correct the techniques used in the detection and generation of zero-pronouns into English.",
        "After that, we have carried out a blind evaluation on unrestricted texts using the set of preferences and the generation techniques learned during the training phase.",
        "In this case, partial parsing of the text with no semantic information has been used.",
        "With regard to unrestricted texts, our system has been run on two different Spanish corpora: a) a fragment of the Spanish version of The Blue Book corpus (15,571 words), which contains the handbook of the International Telecommunications Union CCITT, and b) a fragment of the Lexesp corpus (9,746 words), which contains ten Spanish texts from different genres and authors.",

        "To evaluate the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into English three tasks have been accomplished: a) the evaluation of the detection of zero-pronouns, b) the evaluation of anaphora resolution and c) the evaluation of generation.",
        "a) Evaluating the detection of zero-pronouns.",
        "To do this, verbs have been classified into two categories: 1) verbs whose subjects have been omitted, and 2) verbs whose subjects have not.",
        "We have obtained a success rates of 88% on 1,599 classified verbs, with no significant differences seen between the corpora.",
        "We should also remark that a success rate of 98% has been obtained in the detection of verbs whose subjects were omitted, whereas only 80% was achieved for verbs whose subjects were not.",
        "This lower success rate is 7 This corpus contains sentences with zero-pronouns made by different researchers of our Research Group.",
        "8 By \"success rate\", we mean the number of verbs successfully classified, divided by the total number of verbs in the text.",

        "One important reason is the non-detection of impersonal verbs by the POS tagger.",
        "Two other reasons are .",
        "the lack of semantic information and the inaccuracy of the grammar used.",
        "It is important to note that 46% of the verbs in these corpora have their subjects omitted.",
        "It shows quite clearly the importance of this phenomenon in Spanish.",
        "b) Evaluating anaphora resolution.",
        "In this task, the evaluation of zero-pronoun resolution is accomplished.",
        "Of the 1,599 verbs classified in these two corpora, 734 of them have zero-pronouns.",
        "Only 228 of them9, however, are in third person and will be anaphorically resolved.",
        "A success rate of 75% was attained for the 228 zero-pronouns.",
        "By \"successful resolutions\" we mean that the solutions offered by our system agree with the solutions offered by two human experts.",
        "c) Evaluating zero-pronoun generation.",
        "The generation of the 228 Spanish zero-pronouns into English has been evaluated.",
        "The following results in the generation have been obtained: a success rate of 70% in Lexesp and a success rate of 89% in The Blue Book.",
        "In general (both corpora) a success rate of 75% has been achieved.",
        "The errors are mainly produced by fails in anaphora resolution and fails in the generation of pronouns he/she/it (some heuristicsio, which have failed sometimes, have been applied due to the used corpora do not include semantic information).",
        "In the second experiment, we have evaluated the generation of Spanish personal pronouns with subject role into the English ones.",
        "A fragment of the English version of The Blue Book corpus (70,319 words) containing 165 9 The remaining pronouns are not in third person or they are cataphoric (the antecedent appears after the anaphor) or exophoric (the antecedent does not appear, linguistically, in the text).",
        "10 For instance: \"all the pronouns in third person and singular whose antecedents are proper nouns have been translated into he (antecedent with masculine gender) or she (antecedent with feminine gender); otherwise they have been translated into it'.",

        "A success rate of 85.41% has been achieved.",

        "With reference to the choice of the gender of the antecedent's Head, an electronic dictionary has been used in order to translate the original English word into the Spanish one, and subsequently, the gender is extracted from the Spanish word.",
        "Several problems have occurred when using this electronic dictionary: 1) the word to be translated does not appear in the dictionary, and.",
        "therefore, a heuristic is applied to assign the gender 2) the correct sense of the English word is not chosen, and therefore, the gender could be assigned incorrectly."
