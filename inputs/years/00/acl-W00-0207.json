        "The generation system has also been used in Cross-Language information retrieval research (Levow et al., 2000).",
        "One of the big challenges in Natural Language processing efforts is to be able to make use of existing resources, a big difficulty being the sometimes large differences in syntax, semantics, and ontnlo-gies of such resources.",

        "Such representations are becoming fairly popular, yet there are widely different views about what these languages should be composed of, varying from purely conceptual knowledge-representations, having little to do with the structure of language, to very syntactic representations, maintaining most of the idiosyncrasies of the source languages.",

        "Within each of these types, there are a number of conceptual primitives of that type, which are the basic building blocks of LCS structures.",
        "There are two general classes of primitives: closed class or structural primitive (e.g., CAUSE, GO, BE, TO) and CONSTANTS, corresponding to the primitives for open lexical classes (e.g., reduce+ed, textile+, slash+ingly).I.",
        "Examples of fields include Locational, Possessional, Identif icat ional.",

        "The semantic structure of a verb is the same for all members of a verb class (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995) whereas the content is specific to the verb itself.",
        "So, all the verbs in the \"Cut Verbs - Change of State\" class have the same semantic structure but vary in their semantic content (for example, chip, cut, saw, scrape, slash and scratch).",

        "This is constructed \"composed\" from several RLCSes corresponding to individual words.",
        "In the composition process, which starts with a parse tree of the input sentence, all the obligatory positions in the root and subordinate RLCS corresponding to lexical items are filled with other RLCSes from appropriately placed items in the parse tree.",

        "Since this generation system was developed in tandem with the most recent LCS composition system, and LCS-language and specific lexicon extensions, a premium was put on the ability for experimentation along a number of parameters and rapid adjustment on the basis of intermediate inputs and results to the generation system.",
        "This goal encouraged a modular design, and made lisp a convenient language for implementation.",
        "We were also able to successfully integrate components from the Nitrogen Generation System (Langkilde and Knight, 1998a; Langkilde and Knight, 1998b).",
