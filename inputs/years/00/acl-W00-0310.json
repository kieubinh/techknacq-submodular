        "Conversational systems that use speech as the input and output modality are often realized by architectures that decouple speech processing components from language processing components.",

        "Melodic movements in intermediate and intonational phrases are in turn expressed by three kinds of tonal elements.",
        "These include six pitch accents: a low pitch excursion (L*), a high pitch excursion (IV), or a combination of both low and high excursions (1,*+H, L+H*, H*+L, ii-FL*); two phrase accents: a high (H-) or low (L-) tonal target that guides the interpolation of the melodic contour from final pitch accent to intermediate phrase ending; and two boundary tones: a high (1-1%) or low (L%) tonal target that guides interpolation from phrase accent to intonational phrase ending."

        "For example, the Direction Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a discourse structure for generated directions.",
        "The discourse structure determined accentuation, with deaccenting of discourse-old entities realized (by lexically identical morphs) in the current or previous discourse segment.",

        "The BRIDGE project on speech.",
        "generation (Zacharski et al., 1992) identified four main factors affecting accentability: linear order, lexical category, semantic weight and givenness.",
        "In related work (Monaghan, 1994), word accentability was quantitatively scored by hand-crafted rules based on information status, semantic focus and word class.",

        "Instead, the representation of dialogue meaning in experimental architectures, such as MIMIC's, is compositional to some degree, and we take advantage of this fact to implement a compositional theory of intonational meaning in a new concept-to-speech system, MIMIC-CTS."
