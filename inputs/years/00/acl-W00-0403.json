        "However, all world agencies would be actively reporting on the major events that were to happen in Pakistan in the following days: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced that in Gen. Musharrafs absence, the Defense Minister had been sacked and replaced by General Zia Addin.",
        "Large numbers of messages from various sources started to inundate the newswire: about the army's occupation of the capital, the Prime Minister's ouster and his subsequent placement under house arrest, Gen. Musharrafs return to his country, his ascendancy to power, and the imposition of military control over Pakistan.",
        "The paragraph above summarizes a large amount of news from different sources.",
        "While it was not automatically generated, one can imagine the use of such automatically generated summaries.",

        "We will present an extension of our own research on TDT [Radev et al., 1999] to cover summarization of multi-document clusters.",
        "Our entry in the official TDT evaluation, called CIDR [tadev et al., 1999], uses modified TF*IDF to produce clusters of news articles on the same event.",
        "We developed a new technique for multi-document summarization (or MDS), called centroid-based summarization (CBS) which uses as input the centroids of the clusters produced by CIDR to identify which sentences are central to the topic of the cluster, rather than the individual articles.",
        "We have implemented CBS in a system, named MEAD.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: the development of a centroid-based multi-document summarizer, the use of cluster-based sentence utility (CBSU) and cross-sentence informational subsumption (CSIS) for evaluation of single and multi-document summaries, two user studies that support our findings, and an evaluation of MEAD.",
        "An event cluster, produced by a TDT system, consists of chronologically ordered news articles from multiple sources, which describe an event as it develops over time.",
        "Event clusters range from2 to 10 documents from which MEAD produces summaries in the form of sentence extracts.",
        "A key feature of MEAD is its use of cluster centroids, which consist of words which are central not only to one article in a cluster, but to all the articles.",
        "MEAD is significantly different from previous work on multi-document summarization [Radev & McKeown, 1998; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; McKeown et al., 1999],",
        "which use techniques such as graph matching, maximal marginal relevance, or language generation.",
        "Finally, evaluation of multi-document summaries is a difficult problem.",
        "There is not yet a widely accepted evaluation scheme.",
        "We propose a utility-based evaluation scheme, which can be used to evaluate both single-document and multi-document summaries."
