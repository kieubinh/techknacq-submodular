        "The goal of summarization for such \"indicative\" use is to serve fast and accurate judgement.",
        "We have developed the concept of the \"at-a-glance\" summary, and its realization in the Japanese language - \"phrase-representation summariza-tioh\" - to achieve this goal (Ueda, et al.",
        "2000).",
        "We have conducted an evaluation experiment to verify the effectiveness of this summarization method.",
        "There are two strategies for evaluating summarization systems: intrinsic and extrinsic (Jing, et al.",
        "1998).",
        "Intrinsic methods measure a system's quality mainly by comparing the system's output with an \"ideal\" summary.",
        "Extrinsic methods measure a system's performance in a particular task.",
        "The aim of the phrase-representation summarization method is fast and accurate judgement in selecting documents in information retrieval.",
        "Thus, we adopted a task-based method to evaluate whether the goal was achieved.",
        "Task-based evaluation has recently drawn the attention in the summarization field, because the assumption ' that there is only one \"ideal\" summary is considered to be incorrect, and some experiments on information retrieval were reported (Jing, et al.",
        "1998) (Mani, et al.",
        "1998) (Mochizu-ki and Okunura 1999).",
        "However, there is no standard evaluation method, and we consider that there are some shortcomings in the existing methods.",
        "Thus, we have developed an improved evaluation method and carried out a relatively large experiment.",
        "In this paper, we first give an overview of the phrase-representation summarization method.",
        "We then consider the evaluation method and show the result of an experiment based on the improved method to demonstrate the effectiveness of phrase-representation summarization."
