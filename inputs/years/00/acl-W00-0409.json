      "text": [
        "The rapid growth of electronic documents has created a great demand for a navigation tool to traverse a large corpus.",
        "Information retrieval (IR) technologies allow us to access the documents presumably matching our interests.",
        "However, a traditional hit list-based architecture, which returns linearly organized single document summaries, no longer suffices, given the size of a typical hit list (e.g. submitting the query \"summarization workshop\" to a search engine Altavista (http : / /altavista corn) gave us more than ten million hits).",
        "To allow a more comprehensive and screen space-efficient presentation of query results, we propose in this paper a technology for summarizing collections of multiple documents.",
        "In our work, we focus on identifying themes, representative of a document, and possibly running across documents.",
        "Even if we are unable to 'embody' a theme in coherently generated prose, we start with the assumption that a mapping exists between a theme and a tightly connected (and therefore intuitively interpretable) set of coherent linguistic objects, which would act as a 'prompting' device when presented to the user in an appropriate context.",
        "As will become clear in the rest of the paper, we refer to such themes as topics.",
        "Our view of multi-document summarization combines three premises: coherent topics can be identified reliably; highly representative topics, running across subsets of the document collection, can function as multi-document summary surrogates; and effective end-use of such topics should be facilitated by a visualization environment which clarifies the relationship between topics and documents.",
        "The work specifically addresses the following considerations.",
        "• Multiple general topics We regard the ability to respond to multiple topics in a document collection – in contrast to a prevailing trend in multi-document summarization, seeking to present the single, possibly pre-determined, topic (see below) – to be crucial to applications such as summarization of query results.",
        "In this work we choose not to narrow the topic detection process by the given query, since in IR it is a well-known concern that user-specified queries do not necessarily convey the user's real interests thoroughly.",
        "Thus, we need to deal with multiple general topics.",
        "• Textual and graphical presentation Since",
        "our multi-document summaries will, by definition, incorporate multiple topics, the question arises of optimal representation of the relationships among the topics, the linguistic objects comprising each topic, and the documents associated with (possibly more than one) topic.",
        "In particular, for IR, we want to show the relationships between topics and documents so that a user can access documents in the context of the topics.",
        "A topic by itself can clearly be represented largely by a set of text objects.",
        "However, we need also to present arbitrary number of such topics as part of the same summary.",
        "We believe that, for adequate representation of",
        "the resulting many-to-many relationships (which is crucial for the end-user fully understanding the summary), additional graphical components are needed in the interface.",
        "To our knowledge, the existing studies of multi-document summarization do not place emphasis on these considerations.",
        "Radev and McKeown (1998) have shown a methodology for 'briefing' news articles reporting the same event.",
        "Barzilay et al.",
        "(1999) have proposed a method for summarizing \"news articles presenting different descriptions of • the same event\".",
        "These studies focus on a single topic in a document collection.",
        "Mani and Bloedorn (1999) have addressed summarizing of similarities, and differences among related documents with respect to a specified query or profile.",
        "In their study, several presentation strategies are suggested.",
        "Although they mention a graphical strategy, such as plotting documents sharing more terms closer together, no implementation is reported.",
        "There are a number of different studies that address graphical presentation of multi-document (or document corpus visualization) – The VIBE System (Olsen et al., 1993; Korfhage and Olsen, 1995), Galaxy (Rennison, 1994), SPIRE Themescapes (Wise et al., 1995), LyberWorld (Hemmje et al., 1994), and applications of self-organizing map utilizing neural network technique (Kohonen, 1997; Lin, 1993; Lagus et al., 1996).",
        "In general, these studies consider documents as objects in a model space (document space, typically high-dimensional) and provide 2-D or 3-D representation of this document space.",
        "Their focus is on detecting and presenting structural relationships among documents in a corpus.",
        "s. From our viewpoint, these two fields of research address two different perspectives on the multi-document analysis problem: multi-document summarization efforts largely deliver their results in textual form, while document corpus visualization research, which focuses on means for graphical representation of a document space, does not perform any summarization work.",
        "While we believe that both textual and graphical representations are essential in the context of IR, the technologies from the two fields, in general, cannot be easily combined because of methodological differences (such as differences in modeling the document set, calculating similarity measures, and choosing linguistic objects in terms of which a summary would be constructed).",
        "Motivated by these observations, we propose one uniform framework that provides both textual and graphical representations of a document collection.",
        "In this framework, topics underlying a document collection are identified, and described by means of linguistic objects in the collection.",
        "Relationships, typically many-to-many, among documents and topics are graphically presented, together with the topic descriptions, by means of a graphical user interface specifically designed for this purpose.",
        "We focus on relatively small document collections (e.g. 100 or so top-ranked documents), observing that in a realistic environment users will not look much beyond such a cut-off point.",
        "Our approach maps linguistic objects onto a multidimensional space (called semantic space).",
        "As we will see below, the mapping is defined in a way that allows for topics with certain properties to be derived and for linguistic objects at any granularity to be compared as semantic concepts.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section describes the multidimensional space for the document collection.",
        "Section 3 demonstrates our prototype system and illustrates the interplay between textual and graphical aspects of the multi-document summary.",
        "Section 4 highlights the implementation of the prototype system.",
        "We will conclude in Section 5."

      "text": [
        "Semantic space is derived on the basis of analyzing relationships among linguistic objects – such as terms, sentences, and documents – in the entire collection.",
        "A term can be simply a 'content word', in the traditional IR sense, or it can also be construed as a phrasal unit, further representative of a concept in the document domain.",
        "In our implementation, we do, in fact, take that broader definition of terms, to incorporate all types of non-stop lexical items as well as phrasal units such as named entities, technical terminology, and other multi-word constructions (see Section 4 below).",
        "We map linguistic objects (such as terms, sentences, and documents) to vectors in a multidimensional space.",
        "We construct this space so that the vectors for the objects behaving statistically similarly (and therefore presumed to be semantically similar) point in similar directions.",
        "The vectors are called document vectors, sentence vectors, and term vectors, according to the original linguistic",
        "objects they are derived from; however, all vectors hold the same status in the sense that they represent some concepts.",
        "In this work, we call this multidimensional space semantic space (Ando, 2000) to distinguish it from a traditional vector space (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "In essence, in our semantic space, the terms related to each other are mapped to the vectors having similar directions, while a traditional vector space model treats all terms as independent from each other.",
        "Our motivation for using semantic space is at least twofold.",
        "First, we believe that we need the high representational power of a multidimensional space since natural language objects are intrinsically complicated, as Deerwester et al.",
        "(1990) argued.",
        "Secondly, our definition of semantic space allows us to measure similarities among concepts and linguistic units at any granularity.",
        "Single-word terms, multi-word terms, sentences, .and topics – all can be equally treated as objects representing some concept(s) when they are mapped to vectors in this space.",
        "From the viewpoint of a summarization task, this is an advantage over a traditional vector space in which terms are assumed to be independent of one another.",
        "To detect topics underlying the document collection, we create a set of vectors in the semantic space so that every document vector is represented by (or close to) at least one vector (called topic vector).",
        ":In other words, we provide viewpoints in the semantic space so that every document can be viewed somewhat closely from some viewpoint.",
        "Given such vector representations for topics, we can quantitatively measure the degree of associations between topics and linguistic objects by using a standard cosine similarity measure between topic vectors and linguistic object vectors.",
        "The linguistic objects with the.",
        "strongest association would represent the topic most appropriately.",
        "The algorithm we use for semantic space construction (see Figure 5 in Section 4) is closely related to singular value decomposition (SVD) used in Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "As in SVD, this algorithm finds statistical relationships between documents and terms by computing eigenvectors, and it performs dimensional reduction that results in a better statistical modeling.",
        "The advantages of the semantic space we described above are shared with similar approaches (such as SVD-based and Riemannian SVD-based (Jiang and Berry, 1998)).",
        "The algorithm we adopt, however, differs from others in that it achieves a high precision of similarity measurement among all the documents by capturing information more evenly from every document while, with other approaches, the documents whose statistical behaviors are different from the others tend to be less well represented.",
        "This algorithm fits well in our framework since we want to find topics by referring the similarities of all pairs of documents (shown later), and also we want to assume all the documents are equal.",
        "Full details of the semantic space construction algorithm may be found in (Ando, 2000), including evaluation results compared with SVD."

        "Within such a philosophy for multi-document summarization, subcomponents of the analysis technology can be modularly swapped in and replaced, without contradicting the overall approach.",
        "The algorithms and subsystems comprising the document collection analysis component have been implemented and are fully operational.",

        "Other future work will focus on determining the effects of analyzing linguistic objects to different level of granularity on the overall results.",
        "Questions to consider here, for instance, would be: what is the optimal definition of a term for this application; does it make sense to include larger phrasal units in the semantic space; Or do operations over sentences, such as sentence merging or reduction, offer alternative ways of visualizing topical content.",
        "It is therefore worthwhile investigating whether combining automatic summarization with intelligent multimedia presentation techniques can make the briefing generation amenable to full automation.",

        "These arguments, along with background evidence, are packaged together as briefings to high-level decision-makers.",
        "In leveraging automatic methods along the lines suggested above to generate briefings, our approach needs to allow the analyst to take on as pinch of the briefing authoring as she wants to (e.g., it may take time for her to adapt to or trust the machine, or she may want the machine to present just part of the briefing).",
        "The analyst's organisation usually will instantiate one of several templates dictating the high-level structure of a briefing; for example, a briefing may always have to begin with an executive summary.",
        "The summarization methods also need to be relatively domain-independent, given that the subject matter of crises are somewhat unpredictable; an analyst in a crisis situation is likely to be inundated with large numbers of crisis-related news and intelligence reports from many different sources.",
        "This means that we cannot require that a domain knowledge base be available to help the briefing generation process.",
        "Given these task requirements, we have adopted an approach that is flexible about accommodating different degrees of author involvement, that is relatively neutral about the rhetorical theory underlying the briefing structure (since a template may be provided by others), and that is domain-independent.",
        "In our approach, the author creates the briefing outline, which is then fleshed out further by the system based on information in the outline.",
        "The system fills out some content by invoking specified summarizers; it also makes decisions, when ' needed, about output media type; it introduces narrative elements to improve the coherence of the briefing; and finally, it assembles the final presentation, making decisions about spatial layout in the process.",
        "A briefing is represented as a tree.",
        "The structure of the tree represents the rhetorical structure of the briefing.",
        "Each node has a label, which offers a brief textual description of the node.",
        "Each leaf node has an associated goal, which, when realized, provides content for that node.",
        "There are two kinds of goals: content-level goals and narrative-level goals.",
        "Content-level goals are also of two kinds: retrieve goals, which retrieve existing media objects of a particular type (text, audio, image, audio, video) satisfying some description, and create goals, which create new media objects of these types using programs (called summarization filters).",
        "Narrative-level goals introduce descriptions of content at other nodes: they include captions and running text for media objects, and segues, which are rhetorical moves describing a transition to a node.",
        "Ordering relations reflecting temporal and spatial layout are defined on nodes in the tree.",

        "The Content Creator is thus responsible for both content selection and creation, in terms of tree structure and node content.",
        "Then, a Content Executor executes all the create and retrieve goals.",
        "This is a very simple step, resulting in the generation of all the media objects in the presentation, except for the audio files for speech to be synthesized.",
        "Thus, this step results in realization of the content at the leaves of the tree.",
        "Finally, the Presentation Generator takes the tree which is output from Content Execution, along with its temporal ordering constraints, and generates the spatial layout of the presentation.",
        "If no spatial layout constraints are specified (the default is to not specify these), the system allocates space using a simple method based on the temporal layout for nodes which have spatial manifestations.",
        "Speech synthesis is also carried out here.",
        "Once the tree is augmented with spatial layout constraints, it is translated by the Presentation Generator into SMIL2 (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) (SMIL 99), a W3C-developed extension of HTML that can be played by standard multimedia players (such as Real3 and Grins4.",

        "The idea of assembling complex language processing programs out of simpler ones is",
        "hardly new; however, by employing current industry standards to specify the interaction between the components, we simultaneously increase the robustness of the system, ensure the reusability of individual components and create a more fully plug-and-play capability.",
        "Among the core technology standards that support this plug-and-play component assembly capability are (a) Java interfaces, used to specify functions that all summarization components must implement in order to be used in the system, (b) the JavaBeans standard, which allows the parameters and methods of individual components to be inspected by the system and revealed to the users (c) the XML markup standard, which we have adopted as an inter-component communication language.",
        "Using these technologies, legacy or third-party summarizers are incorporated into .the system by \"wrapping\" them so as to meet the interface specification of the system.",
        "These technologies also make possible a graphical environment to assemble and configure complex summarization filters from individual summarization components.",
        "Among the most important wins over the traditional \"piping\" approach to filter assembly is the ability to impose build-time restrictions on the component assembly, disallowing \"illegal\" compositions, e.g. component X cannot provide input to component Y unless X's output type corresponds to Y's input type.",
        "Build-time restrictions such as these play a clear role in increasing the overall robustness of the runtime summarization system.",
        "Another build-time win lies in the ability of JavaBeans to be serialized, i.e., written to disk in such a way as to preserve the state of its parameters settings, ensuring that every component in the system can be configured and run at different times independently of whether the component provides a parameter file facility.",
        "Establishing the standard functions required of a summarization filter is challenging on several fronts.",
        "One class of functions required by the interface is necessary to handle the technicalities of exchanging information between otherwise discrete components.",
        "This set includes functions for discovering a component's input and output types, for handling messages, exceptions and events passed between components and for interpreting XML based on one or more system-wide document type definitions (DTDs).",
        "The other, more interesting set of functions gets to the core of summarization functionality.",
        "Selecting these functions involves identifying parameters likely to be broadly applicable across most or all summarizers and finding ways to group them and/or to generalize them.",
        "This is desirable in order to reduce the burden on the end user of understanding the subtle differences between the .",
        "various settings in the summarizers available to her.",
        "An example of the difficulty inherent in, this endeavor is provided by the compression (summary length divided by source length) vs. reduction (1's complement of compression) vs. target length paradigm.",
        "Different summarizers will implement one or more of these.",
        "The wrapper maps from the high-level interface function, where the application/user can specify either compression or target length, but not both, to the individual summarizer's representation.",
        "Thus, a user doesn't need to know which representation(s) a particular summarizer uses for reduction/compression.",
        "A vanilla summarization Bean includes the following functionality, which every summarizer must be able to provide methods for: source: documents to be summarized (this can be a single document, or a collection) reduction-rate: either summary size/source size, or target length audience: user-focused or generic (user-focused requires the specification of a bag of terms, which can be of different types) output-type: specific data formats (specified by DTDs) The above are parameters which we expect all summarizers to support.",
        "More specialized summarizer beans can be constructed to reflect groupings of summarizers.",
        "Among other parameters are output-fluency, which specifies whether a textual summary is to be made up of passages (sentences, paras, blocks), named entities, lists of words, phrases, or topics, etc.",
        "Given that definitions of summarization in more",
        "theoretical terms have not been entirely satisfactory (Mani 2000), it is worth noting that the above vanilla Bean provides an operational definition of what a summarizer is.",

        "For example, Figure 2 illustrates a complex filter created by using a GUI to compose together a named entity extractor, a date extractor, a component which discovers significant associations between the two and writes the result to a table, and a visualizer which plots the results as a graph.",
