        "Document production is an important function in many organizations.",
        "In addition to instruction manuals, reports, courseware, system documentation, etc., briefings are a very common type of document product, often used in slide form as a visual accompaniment to a talk.",
        "Since so much time is spent by so many people in producing briefings, often under serious time constraints, any method to reduce the amount of time spent on briefing production could yield great gains in productivity.",
        "Briefings involve a high degree of condensation of information (e.g., no more than a few points, perhaps butleted, per slide), and they typically contain multimedia information.",
        "Many briefings have a stereotypical structure, dictated in part by the business rules of the organisation.",
        "For example, a commander may present a daily or weekly brief to her superiors, which is more in the nature of a routine update of activities since the last briefing; or she may provide an action brief, which is triggered by a particular situation, and which consists of a situation update followed by arguments recommending a particular course of action.",
        "Further, the process of constructing a briefing may involve certain stereotypical activities, including culling information from particular sources, such as messages, news, web pages, previous briefings, etc.",
        "Thus, while part of the briefing content may be created anew by the briefing author', other parts of the briefing may be constructed from existing information sources.",
        "However, information in those sources need not necessarily be in the same form as needed by the briefing.",
        "All these characteristics of briefings make them attractive as an application of automatic summarization, which is aimed at producing a condensed, task-tailored representation of salient content in information sources.",
        "Often, the background information being used in a slide is quite considerable; the author needs to identify what's salient, presenting it in a succinct manner so as to fit on the slide, perhaps creating a graphic or other multimedia clip to do so.",
        "Automatic summarization, by definition, has a clear role to play here.",
        "A briefing usually involves a sequence of slides; as the summary becomes longer, it needs to form a coherent narrative, built around the prescribed structure.",
        "Finally, a briefing must strive, to the extent possible, to be persuasive and vivid, so that the point gets across.",
        "This in turn presents a further challenge for summarization: the ability to generate smoothly narrated, coherent summaries.",
        "I The noun \"author\" is used throughout the paper to designate a human author.",
        "It is therefore worthwhile investigating whether combining automatic summarization with intelligent multimedia presentation techniques can make the briefing generation amenable to full automation.",
        "In other words, the author should be able to use a computer program to generate an initial briefing, which she can then edit and revise as needed.",
        "The briefing can then be presented by the author if desired, or else directly by the computer (particularly useful if the briefing is being sent to someone else).",
        "The starting point for this process would be a high-level outline of the briefing on the part of the author.",
        "The outline would include references to particular information sources that had to be , summarized in particular ways.",
        "If a program were able to take such outlines and generate briefings which didn't require extensive post-editing to massage into a state deemed acceptable for the task at hand, the program could be regarded as a worthwhile time saving tool."

      "text": [
        "Our work forms part of a larger DARPA-funded project aimed at improving analysis and decision-making in crisis situations by providing tools that allow analysts to collaborate to develop structured arguments in support of particular conclusions and to help predict likely future scenarios.",
        "These arguments, along with background evidence, are packaged together as briefings to high-level decision-makers.",
        "In leveraging automatic methods along the lines suggested above to generate briefings, our approach needs to allow the analyst to take on as much of the briefing authoring as she wants to (e.g., it may take time for her to adapt to or trust the machine, or she may want the machine to present just part of the briefing).",
        "The analyst's organisation usually will instantiate one of several templates dictating the high-level structure of a briefing; for example, a briefing may always have to begin with an executive summary.",
        "The summarization methods also need to be relatively domain-independent, given that the subject matter of crises are somewhat unpredictable; an analyst in a crisis situation is likely to be inundated with large numbers of crisis-related news and intelligence reports from many different sources.",
        "This means that we cannot require that a domain knowledge base be available to help the briefing generation process.",
        "Given these task requirements, we have adopted an approach that is flexible about accommodating different degrees of author involvement, that is relatively neutral about the rhetorical theory underlying the briefing structure (since a template may be provided by others), and that is domain-independent.",
        "In our approach, the author creates the briefing outline, which is then fleshed out further by the system based on information in the outline.",
        "The system fills out some content by invoking specified summarizers; it also makes decisions, when needed, about output media type; it introduces narrative elements to improve the coherence of the briefing; and finally, it assembles the final presentation, making decisions about spatial layout in the process.",
        "A briefing is represented as a tree.",
        "The structure of the tree represents the rhetorical structure of the briefing.",
        "Each node has a label, which offers a brief textual description of the node.",
        "Each leaf node has an associated goal, which, when realized, provides content for that node.",
        "There are two kinds of goals: content-level goals and narrative-level goals.",
        "Content-level goals are also of two kinds: retrieve goals, which retrieve existing media objects of a particular type (text, audio, image, audio, video) satisfying some description, and create goals, which create new media objects of these types using programs (called summarization filters).",
        "Narrative-level goals introduce descriptions of content at other nodes: they include captions and running text for media objects, and segues, which are rhetorical moves describing a transition to a node.",
        "Ordering relations reflecting temporal and spatial layout are defined on nodes in the tree.",
        "Two coarse-grained relations, seq for precedence, and par for simultaneity, are used to specify a temporal ordering on the nodes in the tree.",
        "As an example, temporal constraints for a (tiny) tree of 9 nodes may be expressed as:",
        "The tree representation, along with the temporal constraints, can be rendered in text as XML; we refer to the XML representation as a script.",
        "The overall architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The user creates the briefing outline in the form of a script, by using a GUI.",
        "The briefing generator takes the script as input.",
        "The Script Validator applies an XML parser to the script, to check for syntactic correctness.",
        "It then builds a tree representation for the script, which represents the briefing outline, with temporal constraints attached to the leaves of the tree.",
        "Next, a Content Creator takes the input tree and expands it by introducing narrative-level goals including segues to content nodes, and running text and captions describing media objects at content nodes.",
        "Running text and short captions are generated from meta-information associated with media objects, by using shallow text generation methods (canned text).",
        "The end result of content selection (which has an XML representation called a ground script) is that the complete tree has been fully specified, with all the create and retrieve goals fully specified, with all the output media types decided.",
        "The Content Creator is thus responsible for both content selection and creation, in terms of tree structure and node content.",
        "Then, a Content Executor executes all the create and retrieve goals.",
        "This is a very simple step, resulting in the generation of all the media objects in the presentation, except for the audio files for speech to be synthesized.",
        "Thus, this step results in realization of the content at the leaves of the tree.",
        "Finally, the Presentation Generator takes the tree which is output from Content Execution, along with its temporal ordering constraints, and generates the spatial layout of the presentation.",
        "If no spatial layout constraints are specified (the default is to not specify these), the system allocates space using a simple method based on the temporal layout for nodes which have spatial manifestations.",
        "Speech synthesis is also carried out here.",
        "Once the tree is augmented with spatial layout constraints, it is translated by the Presentation Generator into SMIL2 (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) (SMIL 99), a W3C-developed extension of HTML that can be played by standard multimedia players (such as Real3 and Grins4.",
        "This step thus presents the realized content, synthesizing it into a multimedia presentation laid out spatially and temporally.",
        "This particular architecture, driven by the above project requirements, does not use planning as an overall problem-solving strategy, as planning requires domain knowledge.",
        "It therefore differs from traditional intelligent multimedia presentation planners, e.g., (Wahlster et al.",
        "93).",
        "Nevertheless, the system does make a number of intelligent decisions in organizing and coordinating presentation decisions.",
        "These are discussed next, after which we turn to the main point of the paper, namely the leveraging of summarization in automatic briefing generation."

        "The author of a briefing may choose to flesh out as little of the tree as desired, with the caveat that the temporal ordering relations for non-narrative nodes need to be provided by her.",
        "When a media object is generated at a node by a create goal, the running text and captions are generated by the system.",
        "The motivation for this is obvious: when a summarization filter (which is a program under our control) is generating a media object, we can often provide sufficient meta-information about that object to generate a short caption and some running text.",
        "By default, all segues and spatial layout relations are also specified by the system, so the author does not have to know about these unless she wants to.",
        "Finally, the decision as to when to produce audio, when not specified by the author, is left to the system.",
        "When summarization filters are used (for create goals), the media type of the output is specified as a parameter to the filter.",
        "This media type may be converted to some other type by the system, e.g., text to speech conversion using Festival (Taylor et al.",
        "98).",
        "By default, all narrative nodes attempt to realize their goals as a speech media type, using rules based on text length and truncatability to less than 250 bytes to decide when to use text-to-speech.",
        "The truncation algorithm is based on dropping syntactic constituents, using a method similar to (Mani et al.",
        "99).",
        "Captions are always realized, in addition, as text (i.e., they have a text realization and a possible audio realization).",
        "Spatial layout is decided in the Presentation Generator, after all the individual media objects are created along with their temporal constraints by the Content Executor.",
        "The layout algorithm walks through the temporal ordering in sequence, allocating a segment to each set of objects that is designated to occur simultaneously (grouped by par in the temporal constraints).",
        "Each segment can have up to 4 frames, in each of which a media object is displayed (thus, no more than 4 media objects can be displayed at the same time).",
        "Since media objects declared to be simultaneous (using par) in the temporal constraints will go together in a separate segment, the temporal constraints determine what elements are grouped together in a segment.",
        "The layout within a segment handles two special cases.",
        "Captions are placed directly underneath their associated media object.",
        "Running text, when realized as text, is placed beside the media object being described, so that they are paired together visually.",
        "Thus, coherence of a segment is influenced mainly by the temporal constraints (which have been fleshed out by the Content Creator to include narrative nodes), with further handling of special cases.",
        "Of course, an individual summarization filter may choose to coordinate component multimedia objects in particular ways in the course of generating a composite multimedia object.",
        "Details such as duration and onset of particular frames are specified in the translation to SMIL.",
        "Duration is determined by the number of frames present in a segment, unless there is an audio media object in the segment (this media object may have a spatial representation, e.g., as an audio icon, or it may not).",
        "If an audio media object occurs in a frame, the duration of all media objects in that frame is equal to the length of all the audio files in the segment.",

        "As mentioned above, create goals are satisfied by summarization filters, which create new media objects summarizing information sources.",
        "These programs are called summarization filters because in the course of condensing information, they take input information and turn it into some more abstract and useful representation, filtering out unimportant information.",
        "Such filters provide a novel way of carrying out content selection and creation for automated presentation generation.",
        "Our approach relies on component-based software composition, i.e., assembly of software units that have contractually specified interfaces that can be independently deployed and reused.",
        "The idea of assembling complex language processing programs out of simpler ones is",
        "hardly new; however, by employing current industry standards to specify the interaction between the components, we simultaneously increase the robustness of the system, ensure the reusability of individual components and create a more fully plug-and-play capability.",
        "Among the core technology standards that support this plug-and-play component assembly capability are (a) Java interfaces, used to specify functions that all summarization components must implement in order to be used in the system, (b) the JavaBeans standard, which allows the parameters and methods of individual components to be inspected by the system and revealed to the users (c) the XML markup standard, which we have adopted as an inter-component communication language.",
        "Using these technologies, legacy or third-party summarizers are incorporated into the system by \"wrapping\" them so as to meet the interface specification of the system.",
        "These technologies also make possible a graphical environment to assemble and configure complex summarization filters from individual summarization components.",
        "Among the most important wins over the traditional \"piping\" approach to filter assembly is the ability to impose build-time restrictions on the component assembly, disallowing \"illegal\" compositions, e.g. component X cannot provide input to component Y unless X's output type corresponds to Y's input type.",
        "Build-time restrictions such as these play a clear role in increasing the overall robustness of the runtime • summarization system.",
        "Another build-time win lies in the ability of JavaBeans to be serialized, i.e., written to disk in such a way as to preserve the state of its parameters settings, ensuring that every component in the system can be configured and run at different times independently of whether the component provides a parameter file facility.",
        "Establishing the standard functions required of a summarization filter is challenging on several fronts.",
        "One class of functions required by the interface is necessary to handle the technicalities of exchanging information between otherwise discrete components.",
        "This set includes functions for discovering a component's input and output types, for handling messages, exceptions and events passed between components and for interpreting XML based on one or more system-wide document type definitions (DTDs).",
        "The other, more interesting set of functions gets to the core of summarization functionality.",
        "Selecting these functions involves identifying parameters likely to be broadly applicable across most or all summarizers and finding ways to group them and/or to generalize them.",
        "This is desirable in order to reduce the burden on the end user of understanding the subtle differences between the various settings in the summarizers available to her.",
        ", An' example of the difficulty inherent in this endeavor is provided by the compression (summary length divided by source length) vs. reduction (I's complement of compression) vs. target length paradigm.",
        "Different summarizers will implement one or more of these.",
        "The wrapper maps from the high-level interface function, where the application/user can specify either compression or target length, but not both, to the individual summarizer's representation.",
        "Thus, a user doesn't need to know which representation(s) a particular summarizer uses for reduction/compression.",
        "A vanilla summarization Bean includes the following functionality, which every summarizer must be able to provide methods for: source: documents to be summarized (this can be a single document, or a collection) reduction-rate: either summary size/source size, or target length audience: user-focused or generic (user-focused requires the specification of a bag of terms, which can be of different types) output-type: specific data formats (specified by DTDs) The above are parameters which we expect all summarizers to support.",
        "More specialized summarizer beans can be constructed to reflect groupings of summarizers.",
        "Among other parameters are output-fluency, which specifies whether a textual summary is to be made up of passages (sentences, paras, blocks), named entities, lists of words, phrases, or topics, etc.",
        "Given that definitions of summarization in more",
        "theoretical terms have not been entirely satisfactory (Mani 2000), it is worth noting that the above vanilla Bean provides an operational definition of what a summarizer is.",
        "In addition to its practical utility in the ability to assimilate, combine and reuse components in different combinations, and to do so within a GUI, this approach is interesting because it allows powerful summarization functions to be created by composing together simpler tools.",
        "(Note that this is different from automatically finding the best combination, which our system does not address).",
        "For example, Figure 2 illustrates a complex filter created by using a GUI to compose together a named entity extractor, a date extractor, a component which discovers significant associations between the two and writes the result to a table, and a visualizer which plots the results as a graph.",
        "The resulting summarizer takes in a large collection of documents, and produces as a summary a graph (a jpeg) of salient named entity mentions over time.",
