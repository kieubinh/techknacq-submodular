        "The importance of machine translation (MT) in the stream of text-handling processes has become readily apparent in many current production settings as well as in research programs such as the Translingual Information Detection, Extraction, and Summarization (TIDES) program.",
        "The MT Proficiency Scale project has developed a means of baselining the inherent \"tolerance\" that a text-handling task has for raw MT output, and thus how good the output must be in order to be of use to that task.",
        "This method allows for a prediction of how useful a particular system can be in a text-handling process stream, whether in integrated, MT-embedded processes, or less integrated user-intensive processes."

        "Issues of evaluation have been preeminent in MT since its beginning, yet there are no measures or metrics which are universally accepted as standard or adequate.",
        "This is in part because, at present, different evaluation methods are required to measure different attributes of MT, depending on what a particular stakeholder needs to know (e.g., Arnold 1993).",
        "A venture capitalist who wants to invest in an MT start-up needs to know a different set of attributes about the system than does a developer who needs to see if the most recent software changes improved (or degraded) the system.",
        "Users need to know another set of metrics, namely those associated with whether the MT system in situ improves or degrades the other tasks in their overall process.",
        "Task-based evaluation of this sort is of particular value because of the recently envisioned role of MT as an embedded part of production processes rather than a standalone translator's tool.",
        "In this context, MT can be measured in terms of its effect on the \"downstream\" tasks, i.e., the tasks that a user or system performs on the output of the MT.",
        "The assertion that usefulness could be gauged by tasks to which output might be applied has been used for systems and for processes (JEIDA 1992, Albisser 1993), and also particular theoretical approaches (Church and Hovy 1991).",
        "However, the potential for rapidly adaptable systems for which MT could be expected to run without human intervention, and to interact flexibly with automated extraction, summarization, filtering, and document detection calls for an evaluation.",
        "method that measures usefulness across several different downstream tasks.",
        "The U.S. government MT Functional Proficiency Scale project has conducted methodology research that has resulted in a ranking of text-handling tasks by their tolerance to MT output.",
        "When an MT system's output is mapped onto this scale, the set of tasks for which the output is useful, or not useful, can be predicted.",
        "The method used to develop the scale can also be used to map a particular system onto the scale.",
        "Development of the scale required the identification of the text-handling tasks members of a user community perform, and then the development of exercises to test output from several MT systems (Japanese-to-English).",
        "The level of ease users can perform these exercises on the corpus reflects the tolerance that the tasks have for MT output of varying quality.",
        "The following sections detail the identification of text-handling tasks, the evaluation corpus, exercise development, â€¢ and inference of the proficiency scale from the apparent tolerance of the downstream text-handling tasks."

        "A subset of these translations was used for the MT Functional Proficiency Scale project.",
        "The 100 3Q94 Japanese source texts were translated into six English output versions, four from commercial and research MT systems (Systran (SY), Pivot (P), Lingstat (L), and Pangloss (PN)), and two from professional expert translations (E) used as baseline and control for the 3Q94 evaluations.",

        "Since the texts to be seen by the users were general news texts, it was unlikely they would be relevant to the users' usual domains of interest (White and Taylor, 1998 and Taylor and White, 1998).",
        "This issue was handled by selecting texts related to domains that were thought to be similar, but broader, than those typically handled by users (White and Taylor, 1998 and Taylor and White, 1998).",
        "Additionally, the simple elicitation of a judgment (to a question such as \"can you do your job with this text\") is possibly biased by a predisposition to cooperate (Taylor and White 1998).",
        "Therefore, it was necessary to develop two complementary sets of exercises: the snap judgment exercise and the task-specific exercises.",
