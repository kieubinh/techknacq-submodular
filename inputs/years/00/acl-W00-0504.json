        "Work on large-vocabulary retrieval from recorded speech is more recent, with some initial work reported in 1995 using subword indexing [Wechsler and Schauble, 1995], followed by the first TREC2 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR)",

        "In TDT, stories are assessed for relevance to an event, while in TREC stories are assessed for relevance to an explicitly stated information need that is often subject rather than event-oriented.",

      "text": [
        "In order to retrieve Mandarin audio documents, we should consider a number of linguistic characteristics of the Chinese language: The Chinese language has many dialects.",
        "Different dialects are characterized by their differences in the phonetics, vocabularies and syntax.",
        "Mandarin, also known as Putonghua (\"the common language\"), is the most widely used dialect.",
        "Another major dialect is Cantonese, predominant in Hong Kong, Macau, South China and many overseas Chinese communities.",
        "Chinese is a syllable-based language, where each syllable carries a lexical tone.",
        "Mandarin has about 400 base syllables and four lexical tones, plus a \"light\" tone for reduced syllables.",
        "There are about 1,200 distinct, tonal syllables for Mandarin.",
        "Certain syllable-tone",
        "combinations are non-existent in the language.",
        "The acoustic correlates of the lexical tone include the syllable's fundamental frequency (pitch contour) and duration.",
        "However, these acoustic features are also highly dependent on prosodic variations of spoken utterances.",
        "The structure of Mandarin (base) syllables is (CG)V(X), where (CG) the syllable onset – C the initial consonant, G is the optional medial glide, V is the nuclear vowel, and X is the coda (which may be a glide, alveolar nasal or velar nasal).",
        "Syllable onsets and codas are optional.",
        "Generally C is known as the syllable initial, and the rest (GVX) syllable final.4 Mandarin has approximately 21 initials and 39 finals.5 In its written form, Chinese is a sequence of characters.",
        "A word may contain one or more characters.",
        "Each character is pronounced as a tonal syllable.",
        "The character-syllable mapping is degenerate.",
        "On one hand, a given character may have multiple syllable pronunciations – for example, the character 41- may be pronounced as /hang2/,6 /hang4/, or /xing2/.",
        "On the other hand, a given tonal syllable may correspond to multiple characters.",
        "Consider the two-syllable pronunciation /fu4 shu4/, which corresponds to a two-character word.",
        "Possible homophones include 1,0„ (meaning \"rich\"), .",
        "A, (\"negative number\"), AA, (\"complex number\" or \"plural\"), IA (\"repeat\").7 Aside from homographs and homophones, another source of ambiguity in the Chinese language is the defmition of a Chinese word.",
        "The word has no delimiters, and the distinction between a word and a phrase is often vague.",
        "The lexical structure of the Chinese word is very different compared to English.",
        "Inflectional forms are minimal, while morphology and word derivations abide by a different set of rules.",
        "A word may inherit the syntax and semantics of (some of) its compositional characters, for",
        "example,8 *r_ means red (a noun or an adjective), e. means color (a noun), and tea.",
        "together means \"the color red\"(a noun) or simply \"red\" (an adjective).",
        "Alternatively, a word may take on totally different characteristics of its own, e.g. rt.. means east (a noun or an adjective), gl means west (a noun or an adjective), and itiri together means thing (a noun).",
        "Yet another case is where the compositional characters of a word do not form independent lexical entries in isolation, e.g. #4 means fancy (a verb), but its characters do not occur individually.",
        "Possible ways of deriving new words from characters are legion.",
        "The problem of identifying the words string in a character sequence is known as the segmentation / tokenization problem.",
        "Consider the syllable string: /zhe4 yi 1 wan3 hui4 ru2 chang2 ju3 xing2/ The corresponding character string has three possible segmentations – all are correct, but each involves a distinct set of words:"

        "While we make use of sub-word transcription to smooth out-of-vocabulary(00V) problems in speech recognition as described above, and to alleviate the 00V problem for translation as we discuss in the next section, accurate translation generally relies on the additional information available at the word and phrase levels.",
        "Since the \"bag of words\" information retrieval techniques do not incorporate any meaningful degree of language understanding to assess similarity between queries and documents, a word-for-word (or, more generally, term-for-term) embedded translation approach can achieve a useful level of effectiveness for many translingual retrieval applications [Oard and Diekema, 1998].",
        "We have developed such a technique for the TDT-3 topic tracking evaluation [Levow and Oard, 2000].",
        "For that work we extracted an enriched bilingual Mandarin-English term list by combining two term lists: (i) A list assembled by the Linguistic Data Consortium from freely available on-line resources; and (ii) entries from the CETA file (sometimes referred to as \"Optilex\").",
        "This is a Chinese to English translation resource that was manually compiled by a team of linguists from more than 250 text sources, including special and general-purpose print dictionaries, and other text sources such as newspapers.",

        "We have also used the same resources to construct an initial English to Chinese bilingual term list that we plan to refine before the Workshop.",
        "Three significant challenges faced by term-to-term translation systems are term selection in the source language, the source language coverage of the bilingual term list, and translation selection in the target language when more than one alternative translation is known.",
        "Word segmentation is a natural by-product of large vocabulary Mandarin speech recognition, and white space provides word boundaries for the English queries.",
        "We thus plan to choose words as our basic term set, perhaps augmenting this with the multiword expressions found in the bilingual term list.",
        "Achieving adequate source language coverage is challenging in news retrieval applications of the type modelled by TDT, because proper names and technical terms that may not be present in general-purpose lexical resources often provide important retrieval cues.",
        "Parallel (translation equivalent) corpora have proven to be a useful source of translation",
        "equivalent terms, but obtaining appropriate domain-specific parallel corpora in electronic form may not be practical in some applications.",
        "We therefore plan to investigate the use of comparable corpora to learn translation equivalents, based on techniques in [Fung, 1998].",
        "Subword translation, described below, provides a complementary way of handling terms for which translation equivalents cannot be reliably extracted from the available comparable corpora.",
        "One way of dealing with multiple translations is to weight the alternative translations using either a statistical translation model trained on parallel or comparable corpora to estimate translation probability conditioned on the source language term.",
        "When such resources are not sufficiently informative, it is generally possible to back off to an unconditioned preference statistic based on usage frequency of each possible translation in a representative monolingual corpus in the target language.",

        "We have applied simple versions of this approach with good results [Levow and Oard, 2000].",
        "We have recently observed that a simpler technique introduced by [Pirkola, 1998] can produce excellent results.",
        "The key idea is to use the structure of the lexicon, in which several target language terms can represent a single source language term, to induce structure in the translated query that the retrieval system can automatically exploit.",
        "In essence, the translated query becomes a bag of bags of terms, where each smaller bag corresponds to the set of possible translations for one source-language term.",
        "We plan to implement this structured query translation approach using the Inquery [Callan, 1992] \"synonym\" operator in the same manner as [Pirkola, 1998], and to the potential to extend the technique to accommodate alternative recognition hypothesis and subword units as well."
