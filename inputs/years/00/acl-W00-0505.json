        "In this paper, we report on a small study undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of combining portable information extraction with MT in order to support translingual information access.",
        "The goal of our proposed system is to better enable analysts to perform information filtering tasks on foreign language documents.",
        "This effort was funded by a SBIR Phase I award from the U.S. Army Research Lab, and will be pursued further under the DARPA TIDES initiative.",
        "Information extraction (IE) systems are designed to extract specific types of information from natural language texts.",
        "In order to achieve acceptable accuracy, IE systems need to be tuned for a given topic domain.",
        "Since this domain tuning can be labor intensive, recent IE research has focused on developing learning algorithms for training IE system components (cf. Cardie, 1997, for a survey).",
        "To date, however, little work has been done on 1E systems for languages other than English (though cf. MUC-5, 1994, and MUC-7, 1998, for Japanese IE systems); and, to our knowledge, none of the available techniques for the core task of learning information extraction patterns have been extended or evaluated for multilingual information extraction (though again cf. MUC-7, 1998, where the use of learning techniques for the IE subtasks of named entity recognition and coreference resolution are described).",
        "Given this situation, the primary objective of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using portable – i.e., easily trainable – IE technology on Korean documents, focusing on techniques for learning information extraction patterns.",
        "Secondary objectives of the study were to elaborate the analyst scenario and system design."

        "Hong requested that Komura cork to normalize Japan's relations with North Korea, rather than cutting channels of dialogue between the two countries.",
        "Komura said that If North Korea continues Its missile testing, the Japanese government will definitely stop making contributions to KEDO.",

        "In Figure 1, the selected event is of type meeting (understood broadly).",
        "• The analyst fills in the available slots of the",
        "selected scenario template in order to restrict the search to the information considered to be relevant.",
        "In Figure 1, the values specified in the scenario template indicate that the information to find is about meetings having as location South Korea and as issue North Korea and missiles.",
        "The analyst also",
        "specifies what information s/he wants to be reported when information matching the query is found.",
        "In Figure 1, the selected boxes under the Report column indicate that all information found satisfying the query should be reported except for the meeting participants.'",
        "• Once the analyst submits the query for evaluation, the system searches the input documents for information matching the query.",
        "As a result, a hypertext document is generated describing the information matching the query as well as the source of this information.",
        "Note that the query contains English keywords that are automatically translated into Korean prior to matching.",
        "The extracted information is presented in English after being translated from Korean.",
        "In Figure 1, the generated hypertext response indicates two documents in the input set that matched the query totally or in part.",
        "Each summary in the response includes just the translations of the extracted information that the analyst requested to be reported.",
        "• For each document extract matching the analyst query, the analyst can obtain a complete machine translation of the Korean",
        "document where the match was found, and where the matched information is highlighted.",
        "Working with a human translator, the analyst can also verify the accuracy of the reported information by accessing the documents in their original language."

        "The MT component (cf. Lavoie et al., 2000) translates the extracted Korean phrases or sentences into corresponding English ones.",

        "In our feasibility study, the majority of the effort went towards developing the PIE component, described in the next section.",

        "In contrast, we only implemented initial versions of the User Interface, Ranker and Presentation Generator components, in order to demonstrate the system concept; that is, these initial versions were only intended to work with our training/test corpus, and will require considerable further development prior to reaching operational status.",
        "For the MT component, we used an early version of the lexical transfer–based system currently under development in an ongoing SBIR Phase II project (cf. Nasr et al., 1997; Palmer et al., 1998; Lavoie et al., 2000), though with a limited lexicon specifically for translating the slot fillers in our training/test corpus."

        "It turned out that for our corpus, we could collapse some of these patterns, though some new ones were also needed.",
        "In the end we used just nine generic patterns.",
        "Important issues that arose in adapting the approach were (1) greater flexibility in word order and heavier reliance on morphological cues in Korean, and (2) the predominance of light verbs (verbs with little semantic content of their own) and aspectual verbs in the chosen domain.",

        "In order to acquire extraction patterns that made appropriate use of such collocations, we decided to go beyond the AutoSlog approach and explicitly group trigger words (such as `hoyuy') into classes, and to likewise group any collocations, such as those involving light verbs or aspectual verbs.",
        "To find collocations for the trigger words, we reviewed a Korean lexical co-occurrence base which was constructed from a corpus of 40 million words (Yoon et al., 1997).",
