        "TRANSTYPE is a project set up to explore an appealing solution to the problem of using Interactive Machine Translation (IMT) as a tool for professional or other highly-skilled translators.",
        "IMT first appeared as part of Kay's MIND system (Kay, 1973), where the user's role was to help the computer analyze the source text by answering questions about word sense, ellipsis, phrasal attachments, etc.",
        "Most later work on IMT, eg (Blanchon, 1991; Brown and Nirenburg, 1990; Maruyama and Watanabe, 1990; Whitelock et al., 1986), has followed in this vein, concentrating on improving the question/answer process by having less questions, more friendly ones, etc.",
        "Despite progress in these endeavors, systems of this sort are generally unsuitable as tools for skilled translators because the user serves only as an advisor, with the MT components keeping overall control over the translation process.",
        "TRANSTYPE originated from the conviction that a better approach to IMT for competent translators would be to shift the focus of interaction from the meaning of the source text to the form of the target text.",
        "This woutd relieve the translator of the burden of having to provide explicit analyses of the source text and allow him to translate naturally, assisted by the machine whenever possible.",
        "In this approach, a translation emerges from a series of alternating contributions by human and machine.",
        "The machine's contributions are basically proposals for parts of the target text, while the translator's can take many forms, including pieces of target text, corrections to a previous machine contribution, hints about the nature of the desired translation, etc.",
        "In all cases, the translator remains directly in control of the process: the machine must respect the constraints implicit in his contributions, and he or she is free to accept, modify, or completely ignore its proposals.",
        "So TRANSTYPE is a specialized text editor with an embedded Machine translation engine as one of its components.",
        "In this project we had to address the following problems: how to interact with the user and how to find appropriate multi-word units for suggestions that can be computed in real time."

        "Our interactive translation system is illustrated in figure 1 for an English to French translation.",
        "It works as follows: a translator selects a sentence and begins typing its translation.",
        "After each character typed by the translator, the system displays a proposed completion, which may either be accepted using a special key or rejected by continuing to type.",
        "This interface is simple and its performance may be measured by the proportion of characters or keystrokes saved in typing a translation.",
        "Note that, throughout this process, the translator remains in control, and the machine must continually adapt its suggestions to the translator's input.",

        "The evaluator is a function p(tle, s) which assigns to each target-text unit t an estimate of its probability given a source text s and the tokens t' which precede t in the current translation of s. Our approach to modeling this distribution is based to a large extent on that of the IBM group (Brown et al., 1993), but it differs in one significant aspect: whereas the IBM model involves a \"noisy channel\" decomposition, we use a linear combination of separate predictions from a language model p(titi) and a translation model p(t1s).",
        "Although the noisy channel technique is powerful, it has the disadvantage that p(sle, t) is more expensive to compute than p(tis) when using IBM-style translation models.",
        "Since speed is crucial for our application, we chose to forego it in the work described here.",
        "Our linear combination model is fully described in (Langlais and Foster, 2000) but can be seen as follows:",
        "where A(0(e,․)) E [0, 1] are context-dependent interpolation coefficients.",
        "e(t', s) stands for any function which maps t' ,s into a set of equivalence classes.",
        "Intuitively, A(O(t', s)) should be high when s is more informative than t' and low otherwise.",
        "For example, the translation model could have a higher weight at the start of sentence but the contribution of the language model can become more important in the middle or the end of the sentence.",
        "We experimented with various simple linear combinations of four different French language models: a cache model, similar to the cache component in Kuhn's model (Kuhn and Mori, 1990); a unigram model; a triclass model (Der-ouault and Merialdo, 1986); and an interpolated trigram (Jelinek, 1990).",
        "We opted for the trigram, which gave significantly better results than the other three models.",
        "The trigram was trained on the Hansard corpus (about 50 million words), with 75% of the corpus used for relative-frequency parameter estimates, and 25% used to reestimate interpolation coefficients.",
        "Our translation model is based on the linear interpolation given in equation 2 which combines predictions of two translation models – M, and Mu – both based on an IBM-like model 2 (see equation 3).",
        "M, was trained on single words and Mu was trained on both words and units.",

        "c(s) represents the new sequence of tokens obtained after grouping the tokens of s into units.",
        "Both models are based on IBM translation model 2 (Brown et al., 1993) which has the property that it generates tokens independently.",
        "The total probability of the ith target-text token ti is just the average of the probabilities with which it is generated by each source text token s3; this is a weighted average that takes the distance from the generating token into account:",

        "This formula follows the convention of (Brown et al., 1993) in letting so designate the null state.",
        "We modified IBM model 2 to account for invariant entities such as English forms that almost invariably translate into French either verbatim or after having undergone a predictable transformation e.g. numbers or dates.",

        "Under these optimistic conditions, we have shown that TransType allows for the production of a translation typing less than a third of its characters.",
        "In order to better grasp the usefulness of TRANSTYPE, we also performed a more practical evaluation by asking ten translators to use the prototype for about one hour to translate isolated sentences.",
        "We first asked them to translate without any help from TRANSTYPE and then we compared their typing speed with TRANSTYPE suggestions turned on.",
        "Overall, translators liked the concept and found it very useful; they all liked the suggestions although it seemed to induce a literal style of translation.",
        "We also asked them if they thought that TRANSTYPE improved their typing speed and the majority of them said so; unfortunately the figures showed that none of them did so ...",
        "The typing rates are nevertheless quite good, given that the users were new to this environment and this style of looking at suggestions while translating.",
        "But interestingly this practical evaluation confirmed our theoretical evaluation that a-translation can be produced with TRANSTYPE by typing less than 40% of the characters of a translation.",
        "Results of this evaluation and comparisons with our theoretical figures are further described in (Foster et al., 2000).",
        "This experiment made us realize that this concept of real-time suggestions depends very much on the usability of the prototype; we had first developed a much simpler editor but its limitations were such that the translators found it unusable.",
        "So we are convinced that the user-interface aspects of this prototype should be thoroughly studied.",
        "But the TRANSTYPE approach would be much more useful if it was combined with other text editing tasks related to translation: for example TRANSTYPE could format the translation in the same way as the source text, this would be especially useful for titles and tables; it would also be possible to localize automatically specific entities such as dates, numbers and amounts of money.",
        "It would also be possible to check that some translations given by the user are correct with respect with some normative usage of words or terminological coherence; these facilities are already part of TRANSCHECK, another computer aided translation tool prototype developed in our laboratory (Jutras, 2000)."
