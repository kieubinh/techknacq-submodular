        "These tests are frequently a key component of language competency exams, such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) in the United States.",
        "In this paper, we focus on some of the future challenges of developing fully-automated techniques for audio comprehension, in which the system developed processes the exam passages (and possibly questions) from the original audio source.",
        "Audio comprehension provides an excellent example of an understanding-based evaluation paradigm for speech systems, in which the emphasis is not solely on \"getting all the words right\" but rather on using speech recognition technology to automatically accomplish a task with a human benchmark: answering questions about a natural language story.",
        "The traditional paradigm for spoken language processing tasks, such as audio comprehension, has consisted largely of applying an existing text-based system to the hypothesis words output by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, ignoring the fact that information is lost due to recognition errors when moving from text to speech and the possibility that it can be regained in part via word confidence prediction.",
        "We believe that successful approaches to audio comprehension will tackle the speech problem directly, by avoiding the use of features that are characteristic of written text and by explicitly addressing the problem of speech recognition errors through the use of smoothing techniques and word confidence information.",
        "Preliminary research in fully-automated techniques for reading comprehension, such as the Deep Read system developed by Hirschman et al.",
        "(1999), has included many standard NLP components, such as part-of-speech tagging, coreference/pronoun resolution, proper name finding, and morphological analysis (stemming).",
        "While the techniques that are being developed for reading comprehension provide a starting point, these techniques cannot be effectively applied to audio comprehension exams directly, because of the nature of differences between written and spoken language data.",
        "In this paper we address three specific challenges in developing audio comprehension system:",
        "• Fundamental differences between text-based data and spoken language data (Section 2) • Identifying proper names in \"noisy\" data (Sections 3) • Dealing with out-of-vocabulary words (Sections 4)",

        "On one level, there are im",
        "portant orthographic differences, since spoken language transcriptions lack many features present in written language.",
        "In addition, there is an inherent uncertainty in spoken language transcriptions, which almost always contain word errors.",
        "The degree of uncertainty is variable, since the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art speech recognizers can range from very low (1-5%) to very high (40- 50%), depending on the domain (e.g., digit recognition vs. travel dialog vs. broadcast news vs. telephone conversations).",

        "How long have German authorities been seeking Mr. Reineck?",

      "text": [
        "One of the primary factors that distinguishes text-based language processing tasks, such as reading comprehension, from spoken-language processing tasks, such as audio comprehension, is the uncertainty inherent in the word sequence output by the speech recognizer.",
        "The sequence of output words is rarely the same as the actual spoken word sequence, due to word substitution, insertion, and deletion errors.",
        "This uncertainty is clear in the third version of the sentence in Figure 1; of the eleven spoken words, three (27.3%) of the corresponding ASR output words are incorrect (SINKING, IS, ARRIVING).",
        "Audio comprehension systems that process this \"noisy\" third version as if it contained the actual spoken words could not possibly answer any of the sample questions above correctly, since the most important words (MISTER REINECK) are not present in the output.",
        "Hirschman et al.",
        "(1999} report initial results in developing a reading comprehension system using a \"bag of words\" approach, in which the sentences in a passage that are deemed most likely to contain the answer are those with the maximum lexical overlap with the question, without regard for word order within the sentence.",
        "Recognition word errors would obviously adversely affect such an approach applied to audio comprehension; in cases where the words in the answer to the question were misrecog-nized, the system would be incapable of answering",
        "correctly.",
        "In the case of spoken questions, an additional layer of uncertainty is present since the recognizer may output different hypothesis words for the same word in a question and in a spoken passage; for example, \"Reineck\" was also misrecognized elsewhere in the same news story as \"RIGHT AT, \" \"RYAN AND,\" \"RYAN EIGHT,\" \"REINER,\" and \"RUNNING AND.\" One of the possible ways to address this lexical overlap problem is to expand the set of candidate words: rather than restricting processing to the single best recognizer hypothesis sequence, we can allow the top N hypothesis sequences (known as the \"N-best list\").",
        "In the example of Figure 1, if (SEEKING, MISTER, and REINECK) are alternative hypotheses for the incorrect (SINKING, IS, and ARRIVING) somewhere in the N-best list, the bag of words approach would at least have a chance of answering the question correctly.",
        "While the bag of words approach is a simple technique providing an initial baseline result, \"deeper\" understanding of reading (and audio) comprehension passages will require modeling of the sequential nature of the language.",
        "Statistical language modeling, an essential component of most state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, seeks to estimate the probability of the sequence of L spoken words, P(wi...wL).",
        "The language modeling within the ASR system contributes to the output word sequence, but the actual recognizer output is usually not the original sequence w1.-wL , but instead a sequence of M words hl...hM, where M may not necessarily be the same as L and where P(hi.••hm) P(wi – wL)• Systems processing ASR output data must therefore effectively model the difference between the actual sequence and the hypothesized sequence hi ...hm.",
        "One way to account for word errors in the ASR output sequence h1...hm is by integrating word-level confidence scores into the model of the word sequence.",
        "This word-level confidence score, which is a number between 0 and 1 produced by many current automatic speech recognition systems, is an estimate of the posterior probability that the word output by an ASR system is actually correct.",
        "As such, it provides us with important information about the output transcription that can assist error detection.",
        "The third version of the sentence in Figure 1 also includes the word confidence scores that were produced with the output word sequence.",
        "In this particular example, the word confidence scores are an excellent indication of the presence of word errors, since the three word errors (SINKING, IS, and ARRIVING) also have the three lowest confidence scores (.14, .09, and .21).",

        "Previous work has found that the absence of capitalization and punctuation information in speech transcriptions results in a 2-3% decrease in name finding per-formance(Miller et al., 1999), and this degradation is greater in the presence of word errors.",
        "The decline in NE performance for text-based systems applied directly to errorful speech data is roughly linear with increase in WER, although the NE performance degrades more slowly than the WER, i.e. each recognition error does not result in an NE error.",

        "to be recognized is represented as a separate state in a finite-state machine.",

        "This model incorporates non-overlapping features about the words, such as punctuation and capitalization, in a bigram back-off to handle infrequent or unobserved words.",
        "Specifically, each word is deterministically assigned one of 14 non-overlapping features (such as two-digit-number, contains-digit-and-period, capitalized-word, and all-capital-letters), and the back-off distribution depends on the assigned feature.",
        "The approach has resulted in high performance on many text-based tasks, including English and Spanish newswire texts.",
        "Despite the fact that the original model relied heavily on text-based features such as punctuation and capitalization in the language model back-off, it gives good results on speech data without modifying anything but the training material (Miller et al., 1999).",
        "A closely related statistical approach to named entity tagging specifically targeted at speech data was developed at Sheffield by Gotoh and Renals (2000).",
        "In their model, named entity tags are treated as categories associated with words, effectively expanding the vocabulary, e.g. a word that might be both a person and a place name would be represented with two different lexical items.",
        "An n-gram language model is trained on these augmented words, using a single model for joint word/tag dependence on the history rather than the two components used in the Bikel model and thus representing the class-to-class transitions implicitly rather than explicitly.",
        "A key difference between the approaches is in the back-off mechanism, which resembles a class grammar for the Sheffield system.",
        "In addition, the Sheffield approach uses a causal decoding algorithm, unlike the Viterbi algorithm which delays decisions until an entire sentence has been observed, though this is not a restriction of the model.",
        "The extended-vocabulary n-gram approach has the advantage that it is well-suited to using directly in the ASR search process.",
        "Palmer, Ostendorf, and Burger (1999; 2000) use a model similar to other probabilistic name finding models, with several important differences in the model topology and the language modeling technique used.",
        "A key difference in their approach is that infrequent data is handled using the class-based smoothing technique described in (Iyer and Ostendorf, 1997) that, unlike the orthographic-feature-dependent back-off, allows for ambiguity of word classes.",
        "They describe methods for incorporating information from place and name word lists, as well as simple part-of-speech labels, and thus account for the fact that some words can be used in multiple classes.",
        "Their results for high error rates (28.2) are slightly better than the simple back-off, suggesting that the POS smoothing technique is more robust to ASR errors.",
