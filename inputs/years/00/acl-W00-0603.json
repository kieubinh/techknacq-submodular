        "These tests are especially challenging because they can discuss virtually any topic.",

        "Rule #2 rewards sentences that immediately precede a best WordMatch sentence, and Rule #3 rewards sentences that immediately follow a best WordMatch sentence.",

        "We also used the answer keys created by the DeepRead developers (Hirschman et al., 1999).",
        "The HumSent answers are sentences that a human judged to be the best answer for each question.",
        "The AutSent answers are generated automatically by determining which sentence contains the highest percentage of words in the published answer key, excluding stop-words.",
        "We focused on obtaining the best possible HumSent score because we believed that humans were more reliable than the automatic word-counting routine.",
        "Table 1 shows Quarc's results for each type of question as well as its overall results.",
        "Quarc achieved 40% HumSent accuracy overall, but the accuracy varied substantially across question types.",
        "Quarc performed the best on WHEN questions, achieving 55% accuracy, and performed the worst on WHAT and WHY questions, reaching only 28% accuracy.",
        "Quarc's rules use a variety of knowledge sources, so we ran a set of experiments to evaluate the contribution of each type of knowledge.",
        "Figure 8 shows the results of these experiments, based on the HumSent answer keys.",
        "First, we evaluated the performance of Quarc's WordMatch function all by itself, giving equal weight to verbs and non-verbs.",
        "The WordMatch function alone, shown as Word on the graph, produced 27% accuracy.",
        "When we gave verbs twice as much weight as non-verbs (+ Verb), overall accuracy improved to 28%.",
        "Interestingly, giv",
        "ing extra weight to verbs improved the WHO and WHAT questions, but hurt the WHEN and WHERE questions.",
        "These results suggest that verbs should be weighted more heavily only for certain question types, even though we Next, we wanted to see how much effect the semantic classes had on performance, so we added the rules that use semantic classes.",
        "Only the WHO, WHEN, and WHAT question types had such rules, and performance improved on those question types (+Sem).",
        "We then added the dateline rules for the WHEN and WHERE questions, and added the WHY rules that reward the sentences immediately preceding and following the best WordMatch sentence (rules #1-3 in Figure 6).",
        "Figure 8 shows that these additions (+Why/Dateline) also improved results for all three question types.",
        "Finally, we added the remaining rules that look for specific words and phrases.",
        "The final version of Quarc achieved 40% HumSent accuracy, which compares, favorably with Deep-Read's results (36% HumSent accuracy).",
        "Furthermore, DeepRead's best results used hand-tagged named entity recognition and hand-tagged coreference resolution.",
        "Quarc did not rely on any hand-tagging and did not perform any coreference reslution.",
        "We also ran an experiment to evaluate the quality of Quarc's tie-breaking procedure, which was described at the end of Section 3.",
        "When more than one sentence is tied with the best score, Quarc selects the sentence that appears earliest in the story, except for WHY questions when Quarc chooses the sentence appearing latest in the story.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of removing this tie-breaking procedure, so that Quarc is allowed to output all sentences that received the top score.",
        "These results represent an upper bound on performance if Quarc had a perfect tie-breaking mechanism.",
        "Table 2 shows that Quarc's performance on WHAT, WHEN, and WHY questions improved by several percentage points, but performance on WHO and WHERE questions was basically the same.",
        "Overall, Quarc was able to identify 46% of the correct sentences by generating 1.75 hypotheses per question on average.",
        "These results suggest that a better tie-breaking procedure could substantially improve Quarc's performance by choosing between the top two or three candidates more intelligently."

        "These simple rules are probably not adequate to handle other types of question-answering tasks, but this exercise gave us some insights into the problem.",
        "First, semantic classes were extremely useful for WHO, WHEN, and WHERE questions because they look for descriptions of people, dates, and locations.",
        "Second, WHY questions are concerned with causal information, and we discovered several keywords that were useful for identifying intentions, explanations, and justifications.",
        "A better understanding of causal relationships and discourse structure would undoubtedly be very helpful.",
