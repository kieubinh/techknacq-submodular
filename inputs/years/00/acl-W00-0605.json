        "To analyze the noise source of features, given that SemType was hypothesized to be essential for answer candidate discrimination, we exam-fined those SemType values that occurred most frequently and calculated statistics on how often the values occurred in story sentences that are answers versus non-answers to the questions.",

        "For when questions, person appears dominant among NP SemType values; however, time features appear to be second most dominant since 19.30% of the answer sentences have time as their NP SemType, and 26.32% have at-time as their PP SemType.",
