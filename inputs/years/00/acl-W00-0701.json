        "While the major statistics based methods used in NLP are typically developed with a",
        "Bayesian view in mind, the Bayesian principle cannot directly explain the success and robustness of these methods, since their probabilistic assumptions typically do not hold in the data.",
        "Instead, we provide this explanation using a single, distribution free inductive principle related to the pac model of learning.",
        "We describe the unified learning framework and show that, in addition to explaining the success and robustness of the statistics based methods, it also applies to other machine learning methods, such as rule based and memory based methods.",
        "An important component of the view developed is the observation that most methods use the same simple knowledge representation.",
        "This is a linear representation over a new feature space – a transformation of the original instance space to a higher dimensional and more expressive space.",
        "Methods vary mostly algorithmicly, in ways they derive weights for features in this space.",

        "Generative probability models provide a principled way to the study of statistical classification in complex domains such as NL.",
        "It is common to assume a generative model for such data, estimate its parameters from training data and then use Bayes rule to obtain a classifier for this model.",
        "In the context of NL most classifiers are derived from probabilistic language models which estimate the probability of a sentence s using Bayes rule, and then decompose this probability into a product of conditional",
        "probabilities according to the generative model.",
        "where k is the relevant history when predicting wi, and s is any sequence of tokens, words, part-of-speech (pos) tags or other terms.",
        "This general scheme has been used to derive classifiers for a variety of natural language applications including speech applications (Rab89), pos tagging (Kup92; Sch95), word-sense ambiguation (GCY93) and context-sensitive spelling correction (Go195).",
        "While the use of Bayes rule is harmless, most of the work in statistical language modeling and ambiguity resolution is devoted to estimating terms of the form Pr(wlh).",
        "The generative models used to estimate these terms typically make Markov or other independence assumptions.",
        "It is evident from studying language data that these assumptions are often patently false and that there are significant global dependencies both within and across sentences.",
        "For example, when using (Hidden) Markov Model (HMM) as a generative model for pos tagging, estimating the probability of a sequence of tags involves assuming that the pos tag ti of the word wi is independent of other words in the sentence, given the preceding tag ti_i.",
        "It is not surprising therefore that this results in a poor estimate of the probability density function.",
        "However, classifiers built based on these false assumptions nevertheless seem to behave quite robustly in many cases.",
        "A different, distribution free inductive principle that is related to the pac model of learning is the basis for the account developed here.",
        "In an instance of the agnostic variant of pac learning (Va184; Hau92; KSS94), a learner is given data elements (x, 1) that are sampled according to some fixed but arbitrary distribution D on X x {0,1}.",
        "X is the instance space and 1 E {0, 1} is the label'.",
        "D may simply reflect the distribution of the data as it occurs \"in nature\" (including contradictions) without assuming that the labels are generated according to some \"rule\".",
        "Given a sample, the goal of the learning algorithm is to eventually output a hypothesis h from some hypothesis class N that closely approximates the data.",
        "The",
        "true error of the hypothesis h is defined to",
        "goal of the (agnostic) pac learner is to compute, for any distribution D, with high probability (> 1 - 5), a hypothesis h E 1-1 with true error no larger than e + infhoierrorD(h).",
        "In practice, one cannot compute the true error errorD(h).",
        "Instead, the input to the learning algorithm is a sample S = {(x', /1}711 of m labeled examples and the learner tries to find a hypothesis h with a small empirical error errors(h) = I {x E Slh(x) 1} and hopes that it behaves well on future examples.",
        "The hope that a classifier learned from a training set will perform well on previously unseen examples is based on the basic inductive principle underlying learning theory (Va184; Vap95) which, stated informally, guarantees that if the training and the test data are sampled from the same distribution, good performance on large enough training sample guarantees good performance on the test data (i.e., good \"true\" error).",
        "Moreover, the quality of the generalization is inversely proportional to the expressivity of the class N. Equivalently, for a fixed sample size I Si, the quantified version of this principle (e.g. (Hau92)) indicates how much can one count on a hypothesis selected according to its performance on S. Finally, notice the underlying assumption that the training and test data are sampled from the same distribution; this framework addresses this issue.",
        "(See (GR99).)",
        "In our discussion functions learned over the instance space X are not defined directly over the raw instances but rather over a transformation of it to a feature space.",
        "A feature is an indicator function x : X {0, 1} which defines a subset of the instance space - all those elements in X which are mapped to 1 by X. X denotes a class of such functions and can be viewed as a transformation of the instance space; each example (xl, x,) E X is mapped to an example (xi, .",
