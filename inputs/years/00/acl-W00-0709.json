        "The maximum entropy technique of statistical modeling using random fields has proved to be an effective way of dealing with a variety of linguistic phenomena, in particular where modeling of attribute-valued grammars (AVG's) is concerned (Abney, 1997).",
        "This is largely because its capacity for considering overlapping information sources allows the most to be made of situations where data is sparse.",
        "Nevertheless, it is important that the statistical features employed be appropriate to the job.",
        "If the information contributed by the features is too specific to the training data, overfitting becomes a problem (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999; Osborne, 2000).",
        "In this event, a peak in model performance will be reached early on, and continued training yields progressive deterioration in performance.",
        "From a theoretical standpoint, overfitting indicates that the model distribution is unrepresentative of the actual probabilities.",
        "In practice, it makes the performance of the model dependent upon early stopping of training.",
        "The point at which this must be done is not always reliably predictable.",
        "This paper describes an approach to feature selection for maximum entropy models which reduces the effects of overfitting.",
        "Candidate features are built up from basic grammatical elements found in the corpus.",
        "This \"compositional\" quality of the features is exploited for the purpose of overfitting reduction by means of feature merging.",
        "In this process, features which are similar to each other, save for certain elements, are merged; i.e, their disjunction is considered as a feature in itself, thus reducing the number of features in the model.",
        "The motivation behind this methodology is similar to that behind that of Kohavi and John (1997), but rather than seeking a proper subset of the candidate feature set, the merging procedure attempts to compress the feature set, diminishing both noise and redundancy.",
        "The method differs from a simple feature cutoff, such as that described in Ratnaparkhi (1998), in that the feature cutoff eliminates statistical features directly, whereas the merging procedure attempts to generalize them.",
        "The method employed here also derives inspiration from the notion of Bayesian model merging introduced by Stolcke and Omohundro (1994).",
        "Section 2 describes parse selection and discusses the \"compositional\" statistical features employed in a maximum entropy approach to the task.",
        "Section 3 introduces the notion of feature merging and discusses its relationship with overfitting reduction.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 describe the experimental models built and the results of merging on their performance.",
        "Finally, section 6 sums up briefly and indicates some further directions for inquiry on the subject."

        "The task of parse selection involves selecting the best possible parse for a sentence from a set of possible parses produced by an AVG.",
        "In the present approach, parses are ranked according to their goodness by a statistical model built using the maximum entropy technique, which involves building a distribution over events which is the most uniform possible, given constraints derived from training data.",
        "Events are composed of features, the fundamental statistical units whose distribution is modeled.",
        "The model is characterized by constraints upon the distributions of features, derived from the fea-tures' empirical frequencies.",
        "An untrained (thus unconstrained) max ent model is by definition characterized by the uniform distribution.",
        "The constraints which characterize the model are expressed as weights on individual features.",
        "Training the model involves deriving the best weights from the training data by means of an algorithm such as Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) (Della Pietra et al., 1995).",
        "IIS assigns weights to features which reflect their distribution and significance.",
        "With each iteration, these weights reflect the empirical distribution of the features in the training data with increasing accuracy.",
        "In ideal circumstances, where the distribution of features in the training data accurately represents the true probability of the features, the performance of the model should increase asymptotically with each iteration of training until it eventually converges.",
        "If the training data is corrupt, or noisy, or if it contains features which are too sparsely distributed to accurately represent their probability, then overfitting arises."

      "text": [
        "The statistical features used for parse selection should contain information pertinent to sentence structure, as it is the information encoded in these features which will be brought to bear in prefering one parse over another.",
        "Information regarding constituent heads, POS tags, and lexical information is pertinent, as is information on constituent ordering and other grammatical information present in the data.",
        "Most or all of these factors are considered in some form or another by current state-of-the-art statistical parsers such as those of Charniak (1997), Magerman (1995) and Collins (1996).",
        "In the present approach, each feature in the feature set corresponds to a depth-one tree structure in the data, i.e. a mother node and all of its daughters.",
        "Within this general structure various schemata may be used to derive actual features, where the information about each node employed in the feature is determined by which schema is used.",
        "For example, one schema might call for POS information from all nodes and lexical information only from head nodes.",
        "Another might call for lexical information only from nodes which also contain the POS tag for prepositions.",
        "The term compositional is used in this context to describe features built up according to some such schema from basic linguistic elements such as these.",
        "Thus each compositional feature is an ordered sequence of elements, where the order reflects the position in the tree of the elements.",
        "Instantiations of these schemata in the data are used as the statistical features.",
        "The first step is to run a given schema over the data, collecting a set of features.",
        "The next step is to characterize all events in the data in terms of those features.",
        "This general structure for features allows considerable versatility; models of widely varying quality may be constructed.",
        "This structure for statistical features might be compared with the Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) of Bod (1998) in that it considers subtrees of parses as the structural units from which statistical information is taken.",
        "The present approach differs sharply from DOP in that its trees are limited to a depth of one node below the mother and, more importantly, in the fact that the maximum entropy framework allows modeling without the independence assumptions made in DOP.",
        "Since maximum entropy allows for overlapping information sources, features derived using different schemata (that is, collecting different pieces of node-specific information) may be collected from the same subtrees, and used simultaneously in a single model."

        "Even if the events are not noisy or inaccurate in actual fact, they may still contribute to overfitting if their features occur too infrequently in the data to give accurate frequencies.",
        "The merging procedure seeks to address overfitting at the level of the features themselves and remain true to the spirit of the maximum entropy approach, which seeks to represent what is unknown about the data with uniformity of the distribution, rather than by making adjustments on the model distribution itself, such as the Gaussian prior of Osborne (2000).",
        "Each feature, as described above, is made up of discrete elements, which may include such objects as lexical items, POS tags, and grammatical attribute information, depending on the schema being used.",
        "The rarity of the feature in the data is largely – although not entirely – determined by the rarity of elements within it.",
        "In the present merging scheme, a set of elements is collected whose empirical frequencies are below some predetermined cutoff point.",
        "Note that the use of the term \"cutoff\" here refers to the empirical frequency of elements of features rather than of features themselves, as in Ratnaparkhi (1998).",
        "All features containing elements in this set will be altered such that the cutoff element is replaced by a uniform disjunctive element, effectively merging all similarly structured features into one, with the disparate elements replaced by the disjunctive element.",
