        "A common machine-learning solution to classification problems is rule induction (Clark and Niblett, 1989; Quinlan, 1993; Cohen, 1995).",
        "The goal of rule induction is generally to induce a set of rules from data, that captures all generalisable knowledge within that data, and that is as small as possible at the same time.",
        "Classification in rule-induction classifiers is based on the firing of rules on a new instance, triggered by matching feature values to the left-hand side of the rule.",
        "Rules can be of various normal forms, and can furthermore be ordered.",
        "The appropriate content and ordering of rules can be hard to find, and at the heart of most rule induction systems are strong search algorithms that attempt to minimise search through the space of possible rule sets and orderings.",
        "Although rules appear quite different from instances as used in memory-based or instance-based learning (Aha et al., 1991; Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daelemans et al., 1997b) there is a continuum between them.",
        "Rules can be seen as generalised instances; they represent the set of training instances with the same class that match on the conditions on the left-hand side of the rule.",
        "Therefore, classification strategies from memory-based learning can naturally be applied to rules.",
        "For example, (Domingos, 1996) describes the RISE system, in which rules are (carefully) generalised from instances, and in which the k-NN classification rule searches for nearest neighbours within these rules when classifying new instances.",
        "Often, the sets of instances covered by rules overlap.",
        "In other words, seen from the instance perspective, a single instance can match more than one rule.",
        "Consider the schematic example displayed in Figure 1.",
        "Three instances with three multivalued features match individually with one or two of the four rules; for example, the first instance matches with rule 1 (if fl = A then c = Z) and with rule 3 (if f2 = C then c= Z).",
        "Pursuing this reasoning, it is possible to index instances by the rules that apply to them.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the first instance can be indexed by the \"active\" rule identification numbers 1 and 3.",
        "When the left-hand sides of rules are seen as complex features (in which the presence of some combination of feature values is queried) that are strong predictors of a single class, indexing instances by the rules that apply to them is essentially the same as representing instances by a set of complex features.",
        "Note that when a rule matches an instance, this does not guarantee that the class of the instance is identical to the rule's predicted class – many rules will classify with some amount of",
        "ing of multivalued instances via matching rules to rule-indexed instances, characterised by the numbers of the rules that match them.",
        "f 1, f 2, and f3 represent the three features.",
        "c represents the class label.",
        "error.",
        "In Figure 1, the third memory instance matches rules 3 and 4 which both predict a Z, while the instance itself has class X.",
        "Now when instances are represented this way, they can be used in k-NN classification.",
        "Each complex feature then becomes a binary feature, that can also be assigned some weight (e.g., gain-ratio feature weights, chi-square, or equal weights (Daelemans et al., 2000)); when a memory instance and a new test instance share complex features, their similarity becomes the sum of the weights of the matching features.",
        "In Figure 1, a new instance (bottom) matches rules 2 and 4, thereby (partially) matching the second and third memory instances.",
        "If, for example, rule 4 would have a higher overall weight than rule 2, the third memory instance would become the nearest neighbor.",
        "The k-NN rule then says that the class of the nearest neighbour transfers to the new instance, which would mean that class X would be copied – which is a different class than those predicted either by rule 2 or 4.",
        "This is a marked difference with classification in RIPPER, where the class is assigned directly to the new instance by the rule that fires first.",
        "It can be expected that many classifications in this approach would be identical to those made by RIPPER, but it is possible that the k-NN approach has some consistent advantage in the cases where classification diverges.",
        "In this paper we investigate some effects of recoding instances by complex features induced by an external rule-induction algorithm, and show that the approach is promising for language learning tasks.",
        "We find that the method works equally well or better than RIPPER on various language learning and other benchmark datasets.",
        "However, the method does not necessarily perform better than default memory-based learning.",
        "Only when the rule-indexing features are added to the original multivalued features, improvements are observed."

        "A new memory-based learning variant RBM, which stands for Rule-Based Memory, implements the ideas described in the previous section using the following procedure: given a training set and a test set of a certain classification task, (1) apply RIPPER (Cohen, 1995) to the training set, and collect the set of induced rules; (2) recode the instances in the training and test set according to these rules; (3) apply the basic memory-based learning algorithm IB1-IG to the recoded training set, and k-NNclassify the recoded test set.",
        "We describe each of these steps briefly here.",
        "RIPPER (Cohen, 1995) is a fast rule induction algorithm that splits the training set in two.",
        "On the basis of one part it induces rules in a straightforward way, with potential overfitting.",
        "When the induced rules classify instances in the other part of the split training set below some classification accuracy threshold, they are not stored.",
        "Rules are induced per class, in a certain class ordering.",
        "By default, the ordering is from low-frequency classes to high frequency classes, leaving the most frequent class as the default rule, which is generally beneficial for the total description length of the rule set.",
        "In our experiments, we let RIPPER order the rules from high-frequent to low-frequent, the idea being that this method would yield more complex features.",
        "Then, the rule set was taken as the basis for recoding both the training and test set, as schematically visualised in Figure 1.",

        "Representing instances by complex features that have been induced by a rule induction algorithm appears, in view of the measured accuracies, a viable alternative approach to using rules, as compared to standard rule induction.",
        "This result is in line with results reported by Domingos on the RISE algorithm (Domingos, 1995; Domingos, 1996).",
        "A marked difference is that in RISE, the rules are the instances in k-NN classification (and due to the careful generalisation strategy of RISE, they can be very instance-specific), while in RBM, the rules are the features by which the original instances are indexed.",
        "When a nearest neighbor is found to a query instance in RBM, it is because the two instances share one or more matching rules.",
        "The actual classification that is transferred from the memory instance to the new instance is just the classification that this memory item is stored with - it may well be another class than any of its matching rules predict.",
        "Second, the method is a potentially helpful extension to memory-based learning of language processing tasks.",
        "When nothing is known about the characteristics of a language processing data set, it is advisable to add the induced complex features to the original features, and do k-NN classification on the combination; it is not advisable to base classification only on the induced complex features.",
        "On its own, the method basically inherits a part of the detrimental \"forgetting exceptions is harmful\" effect from its rule-induction source (this effect is stronger when",
        "a data set is more disjunct (Daelemans et al., 1999)).",
        "Although RBM performs equal to or better than RIPPER, it often does not regain the level of IB1-IG.",
        "High disjunctivity appears to be a typical feature of language tasks (Van den Bosch, 1999b); other non-language tasks generally display less disjunctivity, which opens the possibility that the RBM approach may work well for some of these tasks.",
        "We performed pilot tests on three machine learning benchmark classification tasks (taken from the UCI benchmark repository (Blake and Merz, 1998)) with symbolic, multivalued features.",
        "Table 5 displays the results of these experiments.",
        "Although the data set selection is small, the results of RBM and especially of IB1-IG+RBM are promising; the latter algorithm is consistently better than IB1-IG.",
        "More research and comparisons are needed to arrive at a broader picture.",
        "An immediate point of further research lies in the external rule induction algorithm.",
        "First, RIPPER has options that have not been used here, but that may be relevant for the current issue, e.g. RIPPER'S ability to represent sets of values at left-hand side conditions, and its flexibility in producing larger or smaller numbers of rules.",
        "Second, other rule induction algorithms exist that may play RIPPER'S role, such as C4 .5RULES (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "More generally, further research should focus on the scaling properties of the approach (including the scaling of the external rule-induction algorithm), should investigate more and larger language data sets, and should seek comparisons with other existing methods that claim to handle complex features efficiently (Brill, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Roth, 1998; Brants, 2000)."
