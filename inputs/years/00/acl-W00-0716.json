        "Several automatic prediction methods have already been tried for this, including decision trees (Ross, 1995), neural networks (Traber, 1992), and HMMs (Jensen et al., 1994).",
        "The original aspect of our prediction approach is a tree structure representation of sentences, and the use of tree similarity measurements to achieve the prosody prediction.",
        "We think that reasoning on a whole structure rather than on local features of a sentence should better reflect the many relations influencing the prosody.",
        "This approach is an attempt to achieve such a goal.",
        "The data used in this work is a part of the Boston University Radio (WBUR) News Corpus (Ostendorf et al., 1995).",
        "The prosodic information consists of ToBI labeling of accents and breaks (Silverman et al., 1992).",
        "The syntactic and part-of-speech informations were obtained from the part of the corpus processed in the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We firstly describe the tree structures defined for this work, then present the tree metrics that we are using, and finally discuss how they are manipulated to achieve the prosody prediction."

        "The lower part represents the phonological phrases into which the whole sentence is divided by the binary structure, and uses the same representation levels as in the syntactic structure.",
        "The only difference comes from a simplification performed by joining the words into phonological words (composed of one content word noun, adjective, verb or adverb â€“ and of the surrounding function words).",
        "Each phonological phrase is labeled with a syntactic category (the main one), and no break is supposed to occur inside.",

        "The syntactic and part-of-speech labels have the same meaning as in Figure 1.",
        "B1, B2 and B3 are the break-related nodes.",
        "Unlike the syntactic structure, a first step of prediction is done in the performance structure with the break values.",
        "This prosody information is known for the sentences in the corpus, but has to be predicted for new ones (to put our system in a full synthesis context where no prosodic value is available).",
        "The currently used method (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990) provides rules to infer a default phrasing for a sentence.",

        "Concerning our problem, and given three known tree structures T1, T2, T3 and a new one T', an analogical proportion would be expressed as: T1 is to T2 as T3 is to Ti if and only if the set of operations transforming T1 into T2 is equivalent to the one transforming T3 into T', accordingly to a specific tree metric.",

        "From these two notions, the analogical inference would be therefore defined as:",

        "fer for each 3-tuple of known structures, and to store its result in a set of possible outputs if the transfer succeeds.",
        "This analogical inference as described above may be a long task in the retrieval of every 3 tuple of known structures since a tree transformation can be defined between any pair of them.",

        "operations would be very complex and uneasy to employ.",

        "The transformation between 14 and T3 should be one of the simplest (accordingly to the operations cost; see section 3.3), and then the search would be limited to the retrieval of a pair (71,T2) sharing an equivalent transformation.",
        "However, this is still time-consuming, and we are trying to define a general way to limit the search in such a tree structure space, for example based on tree indexing for efficiency (Daelemans et al., 1997)."
