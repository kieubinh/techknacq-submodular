        "Text categorization (TC) is the classification of documents with respect to a set of one or more preexisting categories.",
        "In the case of UCE, the task is to classify email messages or newsgroups articles as UCE or not (that is, legitimate).",
        "The general model of TC makes use of a set of pre-classified documents to classify new ones, according to the text content (i.e. words) of the documents (Sebastiani, 1999).",

        "For example, one individual could manually build a filter that classifies as \"spam\" messages containing the phrase \"win big money\", or with an unusual (big) number of capital letters or non-alphanumeric characters.",
        "These rules are examples of simple but powerful heuristics that could be used to complement a word-based automatic TC system for UCE filtering.",
        "• Second, all UCE filtering errors are not of equal importance.",
        "Individuals usually prefer conservative filters that tend to classify UCE as legitimate, because missing a legitimate message is more harmful than the opposite.",
        "A cost model is imperative to avoid the risk of missing legitimate email.",
        "Many learning algorithms have been applied to the problem of TC (Yang, 1999), but much less with the problem of UCE filtering in mind.",

        "These three last works do not consider any set of heuristics for UCE filtering.",
        "So, an extensive evaluation of learning algorithms combining words and heuristics",

        "Sahami and others (Sahami et al., 1998) have proposed a set of heuristic features to complement the word Bayesian model in their work, including: a set of around 35 hand-crafted key phrases (like \"free money\"); some non text features (like the domain of the sender, or whether the message comes from a distribution list or not); and features concerning the non-alphanumeric characters in the messages.",

        "The results of our experiments show that the best performing algorithms are C4.5 and PART.",
        "However, for the cost value of 999, both algorithms degrade to the trivial rejector: they prefer to classify every message as legitimate in order to avoid highly penalized errors.",
        "With these results, neither of these algorithms seems useful for autonomous classification of UCE as stated by Androutsopoulos, since this cost ratio represents a scenario in which UCE messages are deleted without notifying the user of the UCE filter.",
        "Nevertheless, PART-WH shows competitive performance for a cost ratio of 9.",
        "Its numbers are comparable to those shown in a commercial study by the top performing Brightmail filtering system (Mariano, 2000), which reaches a UCE recall of 0.73, and a precision close to 1.0, and it is manually updated.",
        "Naive Bayes has not shown high variability with respect to costs.",
        "This is probably due to the sampling method, which only slightly affects to the estimation of probabilities (done by approximation to a normal distribution).",
        "In (Sahami et al., 1998; Androutsopoulos et al., 2000), the method followed is the variation of the probability threshold, which leads to a high variation of results.",
        "In future experiments, we plan to apply the uniform method MetaCost (Domingos, 1999) to the algorithms tested in this work, for getting more comparable results.",
        "With respect to the use of heuristics, we can see that this information alone is not competitive, but it can improve classification based on words.",
        "The improvement shown in our experiments is modest, due to the heuristics used.",
        "We are not able to add other heuristics in this case because the Spambase collection comes in a preprocessed fashion.",
        "For future experiments, we will use the collection from (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000), which is in raw form.",
        "This fact will enable us to search for more powerful heuristics."
