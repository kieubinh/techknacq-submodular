        "this is a fundamental task with applications in natural language (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Munoz et al., 1999; Cardie and Pierce, 1998).",
        "The identification mechanism works by using classifiers that process the input string and recognize in the input string local signals which",
        "each input symbol is either in a phrase or outside it.",

        "Local signals can indicate that an input symbol o is inside or outside a phrase (JO modeling) or they can indicate that an input symbol o opens or closes a phrase (the OC modeling) or some combination of the two.",
        "In any case, the local signals can be combined to determine the phrases in the input string.",
        "This process, however, needs to satisfy some constraints for the resulting set of phrases to be legitimate.",
        "Several types of constraints, such as length and order can be formalized and incorporated into the mechanisms studied here.",
        "For simplicity, we focus only on the most basic and common constraint - we assume that phrases do not overlap.",
        "The goal is thus two-fold: to learn classifiers that recognize the local signals and to combine these in a ways that respects the constraints."
