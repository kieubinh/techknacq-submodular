        "Nowadays, most medical information is stored in textual documents', but such large amount of data may remain useless if retrieving the relevant information in a reasonable time becomes impossible.",
        "Although some large-scale information retrieval (IR) evaluations, made on unrestricted corpora (Hersh and al., 1998), and on medical texts (Hersh, 1998), are quite critical towards linguistic engineering, we believe that natural language processing is the best solution to face two major problems of text retrieval engines: expansion of the query and lexical disambiguation.",
        "Disambiguation can be separated between MS (morpho-syntactic, i.e. the part-of-speech (PUS) and some other features) and WS (word-sense) disambiguation.",
        "Although we aim at developing a common architecture for processing both the MS and the WS disambiguation (Ruch and al., 1999), this paper focuses on the MS tagging.",

        "Before starting to develop our own MS tagger, some preliminary studies on general available systems were conducted; if these studies go far beyong the scope of this paper, we would like to report on the main conclusions.",
        "Both statistical taggers (HMM) and constraint-based systems were assessed.",
        "Two guidelines were framing the study: performances and minimal commitment.",
        "We call minimal commitment2 the property of a system, which does not attempt to solve ambiguities when it is not likely to solve it well!",
        "Such property seems important for IR purposes, where we might prefer noise rather than silence in the recall process.",
        "However, it must remain optional, as some other tasks (such as the NP extraction, or the phrase chunking (Abney, 1991)) may need a full disambiguation."
