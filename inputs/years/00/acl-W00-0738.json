        "The focused access to knowledge resources like intranet documents plays a vital role in knowledge management and supports in general the shifting towards a Semantic Web.",
        "Keyword searching results in a lot of irrelevant information as a term can have different meanings in distinct contents, e.g. \"Zurich\" as the name of a town and as the name of an insurance company.",
