        "A major advantage of inductive logic programming is the ability to incorporate domain knowledge (background knowledge) into the inductive process.",
        "In ILP domain knowledge is usually encoded by (i) a set of definite clauses declaring rules and facts which are true (or assumed to be true) in the domain and (ii) extra-logical constraints on the hypothesis space.",
        "The ILP approach thus allows a very direct and flexible method of expressing domain knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we report on continuation of the work described in (Cussens and Pulman, 2000), which attempts to maximise the effectiveness of linguistic knowledge when inducing a grammar.",
        "We take an existing grammatical formalism (derived from the FraCaS Project (1996)) and extend it with inductive capabilities, rather than shoehorning a grammar learning problem into a form suitable for some particular ILP algorithm.",
        "This has major practical benefits, since the required linguistic knowledge can be encoded in a linguistically natural manner.",
        "As in all real applications of ILP most effort is required in 'getting the background knowledge right'.",
        "Being able to express this knowledge in a representation specifically developed to enable linguists to write down a grammar makes this step easier and quicker.",
        "The paper is organised in a manner analogous to that of our algorithm.",
        "In Section 2, we describe how to generate naive grammar rules directly from the chart produced during a failed parse.",
        "The essentials of this approach have already been described in (Cussens and Pulman, 2000), but we briefly describe it here for completeness and also because we have altered its implementation.",
        "Section 3 describes the most important step of the algorithm â€“ the representation and use of linguistic constraints at an early stage in the inductive process.",
        "Section 4 describes the two generalisation operators currently used in the search by way of an example.",
        "Section 5 describes two further experiments very briefly.",
        "Most of the various components of our method have been investigated previously either in the ILP or the computational linguistics literature: in Section 6 we discuss this related work.",
        "In Section 7, we assess the current work and point to future work.",
        "2 Generating naive rules The first step in our algorithm can be described as inductive chart parsing.",
        "The details of integrating induction into chart parsing have been described in (Cussens and Pulman, 2000), here we give just a brief account.",
        "This first step of the algorithm is the only one that has been retained from this previous work.",
        "The basic idea is that, after a failed parse, we use abduction to find needed edges: which, if they existed, would allow a complete parse of the sentence.",
        "These are produced in a top-down manner starting with the initial need for a sigma edge spanning the entire sentence.",
        "If a need matches the mother of a grammar rule and edges for all the daughters bar one are in the chart, then the missing daughter edge is generated as a new need.",
        "The process of generating naive rules is very simple, and we will explain it by way of an example.",
        "Suppose the vp_vp_mod grammar rule, shown in Fig 1, has been artificially removed from a grammar.",
        "The absence of this rule means",
        "that, for example, the sentence All big companies wrote a report quickly can not be parsed, since we can not get the needed VP wrote a report quickly from the found VP wrote a report and the found MOD quickly.",
        "The corresponding needed and actual (complete) edges are given in Fig 2.",
        "A naive rule is constructed by putting a",
        "needed edge on its LHS and other edges on the RHS which in this case gives us the naive rule in Fig 3.",
        "In (Cussens and Pulman, 2000) only actual edges were allowed on the RHS of a naive rule, since this ensures that the naive rule suffices to allow a parse.",
        "Recently, we have added an option which allows needed edges to appear on the RHS, thus generating more naive rules.",
        "This amounts to conjecturing that the needed edges should actually be there, but are missing from the set of actual edges because some other grammar rule is missing: thus preventing the parser from producing them.",
        "Since all naive rules are subsequently constrained and evaluated on the data, and then not added to the grammar unless the user allows them, such bold conjectures can be retracted later on.",
        "From",
        "an ILP perspective, the construction of naive rules involves repeated applications of inverse resolution (Muggleton and Buntine, 1988) until we produce a clause which meets extra-logical constraints on vertex connectivity.",
        "Abbreviating, we produce vp(3,7) vp(3,6) and then vp(3,7) vp(3,6),mod(6,7).",
        "This is then followed by variabilising the vertices to give",
        "actly the same procedure can be implemented by building a 'bottom-clause' using the Progol algorithm.",
        "We previously used P-Progol (now called Aleph) to construct naive rules in this way, but have since found it more convenient to write our own code to do this."

        "There are three components to this type of analysis.",
        "Firstly, one rule must introduce the `moved' constituent.",
        "This rule also sets up an expectation for a gap of the same type as the moved constituent elsewhere in the sentence.",
        "This expectation is coded as a set of features, or in our case, a single tuple-valued feature with `GapIn' and 'GapOut' values.",

        "Example rules of all three types are as follows:",
        "(i) s: [gap=(G,G)] -> np: [type=wh,agr=A,gap=(ng,ng)] s: [gap=(np: [type=wh,agr=A, gap=(ng,ng)] ,ng)] (ii) vp:[gap(In,Out)] -> v: [] np: [gap=(In,Next)] pp: [gap=(Nxt,Out)] (iii) np: [gap=(np: [type=T,agr=A, gap=(ng,ng)] ,ng),type=T,agr=A] -> epsilon",

        "Constituents which cannot contain a gap associated with a moved element outside the constituent identify the In and Out values of the gap feature, and so a usual NP rule might be of the form: np: [gap(G,G)] -> det: [...] n: [...] In a sentence containing no gaps the value of In and Out will be ng everywhere.",
        "Naive rules will not necessarily fall into one of the three categories above, because the categories that make up their components will have been instantiated in various possibly incomplete ways.",
        "Thus in Fig 3 the gaps values in the mother are (ng,ng), and those in the daughters are separately threaded (A,A) and (B,B).",

        "They use an LR parser, whose states and actions are augmented so as to try to recover from situations that in a standard LR parser would result in an error.",
        "The usual actions of shift, reduce, and accept are augmented by hypothesised shift: shift a new item on to the stack even if no such action is specified in that state hypothesised unary reduce: reduce a symbol Y as if there was a rule X Y, where the value of X is not yet determined.",
        "hypothesised binary reduce: reduce a symbols Y Z as if there was a rule X Y Z, where the value of X is not yet determined.",
        "The value of the X symbol is determined by the next possibilities for reduction.",
        "After stage 4 we could reduce with 1 but this would not lead to an accepting state.",
        "Instead we perform a hypothesised shift at stage 5 followed by a hypothesised binary reduce with X VP Adv in stage 6.",
        "Next we reduce with rule 1 which instantiates X to VP and we have a complete parse provided we hypothesise the rule VP â€“ > VP Adv.",
        "Two more hypothesised actions are used to account for gap threading: hypothesised move: put the current symbol on a separate movement stack (i.e. hypothesise that this constituent has been fronted) hypothesised fill: move the top of the movement stack to to top of the main stack These actions have costs associated with them and a control regime so that the 'cheapest' analysis will always be preferred.",
        "An analysis which uses none of the new actions will be cost-free.",
        "Unary reduction is more expensive than binary reduction because the consequent unary rules may lead to cycles, and such rules are often redundant.",
        "These actions hypothesise only the context free backbone of the rules.",
        "Feature principles analogous to those we described above are used, along with hand editing, to get the final form of the hypothesised rule.",
        "Presumably the information hypothesised by the move and fill operations as to be translated somehow into the gap threading notation which is also used by their formalism.",
        "No details are given of the results of this system, nor any empirical evaluation.",
        "This work shares many of the goals of the approach we describe, in particular the use of explicit encoding of background knowledge of feature principles.",
        "The main difference is that the technique they describe only hypothesises the context free backbone of the necessary rules, whereas in our approach the feature structures are also hypothesised simultaneously.",
        "Asker et al.",
        "(1992) also describe a method for inducing new lexical entries when extending",
        "coverage of a unification grammar to a new domain, a task which is also related to our work in that they are using a full unification formalism and using partial analyses to constrain hypotheses.",
        "Firstly, they use 'explanation based gener-alisation' to learn a set of sentence templates for those sentences in the new corpus that can be successfully analysed.",
        "This process essentially takes commonly occurring trees and 'flattens' them, abstracting over the content words in them.",
        "Secondly they use these templates to analyse those sentences from the new corpus which contain unknown words, treating the entries implied by the templates for these words as provisionally correct.",
        "Finally these inferred entries are checked against a set of hand-coded `paradigm' entries, and when all the entries corresponding to a paradigm have been found, a new canonical lexical entry for this word is created from the paradigm.",
        "Again, no results are evaluation are given, but it is clear that this method is likely to yield similar results to our own for inference of lexical entries."

        "We find our preliminary results encouraging because (i) we usually get close to missing rules, (ii) the rules are fairly linguistically sophisticated, for example, involving gap threading and (iii) the burden on the user is light--by ordering induced rules by their coverage, the user sees the best rules first, and does not have to bother inspecting the mass of highly specialised rules produced.",
