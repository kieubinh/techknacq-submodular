        "Information retrieval (IR) systems aim at providing a user who asks a query to a database of documents with the most relevant texts.",
        "The quality of these systems is usually measured with the help of two criteria: the recall rate, which corresponds to the proportion of relevant answers that have been given by the system compared to the total number of relevant answers in the database, and the precision rate, which denotes the proportion of relevant answers that are present among the given answers.",
        "In these IR systems, texts and queries are usually represented by indexes, that is, a collection of some of the words that they contain.",
        "The quality of the systems therefore highly depends on the type of indexing language that has been chosen.",
        "Two kinds of indexes exist: simple indexes, which correspond to simple nouns (N), verbs (V) and/or adjectives (A) that occur in a text or a query2, and complex indexes, which correspond to the compounds (for example, NN compounds) present in the document or",
        "the question.",
        "The solutions that are given for a user query are the texts whose indexes better match the query index.",
        "In order to obtain the hightest performances, IR systems usually offer some possibilities to expand both query and text indexes.",
        "Traditional index expansion concerns morphosyntactic similarities; for example, the same index words in plural and singular forms can be matched.",
        "Some other systems deal with a kind of semantic similarities: if they possess a linguistic knowledge database, they can, for example, expand a nominal index by following synonymy or hyperonymy links.",
        "These systems are however usually limited to intra-categorial expansion, especially N-to-N one.",
        "Here we deal with a new kind of expansion that has been proven particularly useful (Grefenstette, 1997; Fabre and Sebillot, 1999) for document database questioning.",
        "It concerns N-V links and aims at allowing matching between nominal and verbal formulations that are semantically close.",
        "For example, our objective is to permit a matching between a query index disk store and the text formulation to sell disks, related by the typical function of a store.",
        "N-V index expansion however has to be controlled in order to ensure that the same concept is involved in the two formulations.",
        "We have chosen Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon (GL) framework (Pustejovsky, 1995; Bouillon and Busa, 2000) to define what a relevant N-V link is, that is, what is a N-V pair in which the N and the V are related by a semantic link which is close, and which can therefore be used to expand indexes.",
        "In GL formalism, lexical entries consist in structured sets of predicates that define a word.",
        "In one of the components of this lexical model, called the qualia structure, words are described in terms of semantic roles.",
        "The telic role indicates the purpose or function of an item (for example, cut for knife), the agentive role its creation mode (build for house), the constitutive role its constitutive parts (handle for handcup) and the formal role its semantic category (contain (information) for book).",
        "The qualia structure of a noun is mainly made up of verbal associations, encoding relational information.",
        "We assert that these N-V links are especially relevant for index expansion in IR systems (Fabre and Sebillot, 1999), and what we call a relevant N-V pair afterwards in the paper is a pair composed of a N and a V which are related by one of the four semantic relations defined in the qualia structure in GL.",
        "GL is however currently just a formalism; no generative lexicons exist that are precise enough for every domain and every application (for eg.",
        "IR), and the cost of a manual construction of a lexicon based on GL principles is prohibitive.",
        "Moreover the real N-V links that are the key-point of this formalism cannot be defined a priori and have to be acquired from corpora of the studied domain.",
        "The aim of this paper is therefore to present a machine learning method, developed in the Inductive Logic Programming framework, that enables us to automatically extract from a corpus N-V pairs whose elements are linked by one of the semantic relations defined in the qualia structure in GL, and to distinguish them, in terms of surrounding categorial (Part-of-Speech, POS) context from N-V pairs also present in sentences of the corpus but not relevant.",

        "As stated in the introduction, our work makes two strong claims: firstly N-V associations defined in GL are relevant for IR and secondly this information can be acquired from a corpus on the basis of surrounding POS context.",
        "These presuppositions have to be motivated before explaining the learning method: 1.",
        "The aim of GL is to define underspecified lexical representations that will acquire their specifications in context.",
        "For example, the qualia structure of book indicates that its default function is read and that it is created by the act of writing.",
        "But this information has to be enriched in context in order to characterize how words are used in specific domains.",
        "For example, the qualia structure of book will also have to indicate that the book can be shelved or indexed if this information is necessary to interpret texts from information science domain.",
        "GL",
        "is therefore a theory of words in context.",
        "It can also be seen as a way to structure information in corpora and, in that sense, the relations it defines are therefore privileged information for IR.",
        "In this perspective, GL has been preferred to existing lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) for two main reasons: lexical relations that we want to exhibit - namely N-V links - are unavailable in WordNet, which focuses on paradigmatic lexical relations; WordNet is a domain-independent, static resource, which can not be used as such to describe lexical associations in specific texts, considering the great variability of semantic associations from one domain to another.",
        "2.",
        "In GL, the qualia structures are not arbitrary repository of information.",
        "They contain the information necessary to explain the syntactic behaviour of the item.",
        "We would therefore expect that there are strong connections between some specific syntactic phenomena and some specific qualia relations.",
        "For example, the middle construction seems to be only possible if a telic relation holds between the N and V (Bas-sac and Bouillon, 2000) (for example: ?",
        "?this book writes well vs this book reads well).",
        "Similarly, imperative constructions (e.g. open the door, follow the links) or adjectival sentences (a book difficult to write/read) may also indicate a qualia relation.",
        "These are some of the constructions that we want to identify primilarly in corpora by the learning method."

        "Trying to infer lexical semantic information from corpora is not new: lots of works have already been conducted on this subject, especially in the statistical learning domain (see (Grefenstette, 1994b), for e.g., or (Habert et al., 1997) and (Pichon and Sebillot, 1997) for surveys of this field).",
        "Following Harris's framework (Harris et al., 1989), such research tries to extract both syntagmatic and paradigmatic information, respectively studying the words that appear in the same window-based or syntactic contexts as a considered lexical unit (first order word affinities (Grefenstette, 1994a)), or the words that generate the same contexts as the key word (second order word affinities).",
        "For example, (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) and (Faure and Nedellec, 1999) try to automatically learn verbal argument structures and selectional restrictions; (Agarwal, 1995) and (Bouaud et al., 1997) build semantic classes; (Hearst, 1992) and (Morin, 1997) focus on particular lexical relations, like hyperonymy.",
        "Some of these works are concerned with automatically obtaining more complete lexical semantic representations ((Grefenstette, 1994b; Pichon and Saillot, 1999).",
        "Among these studies, (Pustejovsky et al., 1993) presents a research whose aim is to acquire GL nominal qualia structures from a corpus; this work is however quite different from ours because it supposes that the qualia structure contents are initialized and are only refined with the help of the corpus by using the type coercion' mechanism.",
        "In order to automatically acquire N-V pairs whose elements are linked by one of the semantic relations defined in the qualia structure in GL, we have decided to use a machine learning method.",
        "This section is devoted to the explanation of this choice and to the description of the method that we have developed.",

        "Among different machine learning techniques, we have chosen the Inductive Logic Programming framework (ILP) (Muggleton and De-Raedt, 1994) to learn from a textual corpus N-V pairs that are related in terms of one of the relations defined in the qualia structure in GL.",
        "Programs that are infered from a set of facts and a background knowledge are here logic programs, that is, sets of Horn clauses.",
        "In the ILP framework, the main idea is to obtain a set of generalized clauses that is sufficiently generic to cover the majority of the positive examples (E+), and sufficiently specific to rightly correspond to the concept we want to learn and to cover no (or a few - some noise can be allowed) negative example(s) (E–).",
        "For our experiment, 3A semantic operation that converts an argument to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error.",
        "we furnish a set of N-V pairs related by one of the qualia relations within a POS context (E+), and a set of N-V pairs that are not semantically linked (E – ), and the method infers general rules (clauses) that explain these E. This particular explanatory characteristic of ILP has motivated our choice: ILP does not just provide a predictor (this N-V pair is relevant, this one is not) but also a databased theory.",
        "Contrary to some statistical methods, it does not just give raw results but explains the concept that is learnt4.",
        "We use Progol (Muggleton, 1995) for our project, Muggleton's ILP implementation that has already been proven well suited to deal with a big amount of data in multiple domains, and to lead to results comparable to other ILP implementations (Roberts et al., 1998).",
        "In this section we briefly describe the corpus on which our experiment has been conducted.",

        "The results are quite promising, especially if we compare them to those obtain by Chi-square correlation (cf. table 2).",
        "This comparison is interesting because Chi-square is the first step of our selection of N-V couples in the corpus (cf. subsection 3.2)."

        "The Inductive Logic Programming learning method that we have proposed in order to define what is a N-V pair whose elements are 17(screw, nut, door, indicator signal, plug, cowl, cap).",
        "bound by one of the qualia relations in Puste-jovsky's Generative Lexicon formalism leads to very promising results: 83.05% of relevant pairs (after one occurrence) are detected for seven significant nouns; these results have to be compared with the 64% results of Chi-square.",
        "It is worth noticing that beyond this simple comparison with one of the possible pure statistics based method18, the interest of using ILP learning is its explanatory characteristic; and it is this characteristic that have motivated our choice: contrary to statistical methods, our ILP method does not just extract statistically correlated pairs but it permits to automatically learn rules that distinguish relevant pairs from others.",
        "The fact that noise has to be used in Progol to obtain these results however means that something is missing in our E+ to fully define the concept \"qualia pair\" versus \"not qualia pair\"; some E– have to be covered to define it better.",
        "A piece of information, maybe syntactic and/or semantic is missing in our E+ to fully characterize it.",
        "This fact can be easily illustrated by the following example: 'Verbinf det N' structures are generally relevant (ouvrir la porte19, etc.",
        "), except when the N indicates a collection of objects (nettoyer l'ensemble du reservoir20) or a part of an object (vider le fond du reservoir21).",
        "A simple POS-tagging of the sentences offers no difference between them.",
        "We are currently working on a semantic tagging of the Matra CCR corpus in order to improve the results.",
        "Another future work concerns the automatic distinction between the various qualia roles during learning.",
        "The last phase of the project will deal with the real use of the N-V pairs obtained by the machine learning method within one information retrieval system and the evaluation of the improvement of its performances."
