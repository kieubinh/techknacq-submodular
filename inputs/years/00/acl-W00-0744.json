        "In the second verb group the gap words are o to konferenci (about the conference).",

        "Such a group is obviously compound of auxiliary and full-meaning verbs, e.g. budu se umgvat where budu is auxiliary verb (like will in English), se is the reflexive pronoun and umgvat means to wash. As word-by-word tagging of verb groups is confusing, it is useful to find and assign a new tag to the whole group.",
        "This tag should contain information about the beginning and the end of the group and about the particular components of the verb group.",
        "It must also contain information about relevant grammatical categories that characterise the verb group as a whole.",
