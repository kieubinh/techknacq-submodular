        "We examine three different types of sense clustering criteria with an Information Retrieval application in mind: methods based on the wordnet structure (such as generalization, cousins, sisters...); co-occurrence of senses obtained from Semcor; and equivalent translations of senses in other languages via the EuroWordNet InterLingual Index (ILI).",
        "We conclude that a) different NLP applications demand not only different sense granularities but different (possibly overlapped) sense clusterings.",
        "b) co-occurrence of senses in Semcor provide strong evidence for Information Retrieval clusters, unlike methods based on wordnet structure and systematic polysemy.",
        "c) parallel polysemy in three or more languages via the ILI, besides providing sense clusters for MT and CLIR, is strongly correlated with co-occurring senses in Semcor, and thus can be useful for Information Retrieval as well."

        "WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), as most large-coverage electronic dictionaries and semantic networks, are not designed for a specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) application.",
        "It is commonly assumed that sense distinctions in these lexical databases are too fine-grained for a majority of applications.",
        "In particular, we have used EuroWordNet in a Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR) application (Verdejo et al., 2000) and a number of CLTR experiments (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Vossen et al., 1999), confirming that it is crucial to apply certain sense clusters to Wordnet (WN) and EuroWordNet (EWN) to take real advantage of them in Information Retrieval applications.",
        "Potentially, a semantic network such as WN/EWN can help distinguishing different word senses for retrieval, enhancing precision, and identifying synonymic or conceptually related terms, enhancing recall.",
        "But not all sense distinctions in a lexical database are meaningful for Information Retrieval.",
        "For instance, the following sense distinctions are superfluous in an information retrieval application, as the different senses do not lead to different topics or different kinds of documents: Behaviour",
        "1.",
        "Manner of acting or conducting oneself 2.",
        "(psychology) the aggregate of the responses or reaction or movements made by an organism in any situation 3.",
        "Behavioural attributes",
        "But sense clustering have been generally associated with identifying Systematic Polysemy rules, taking into account lexicographic arguments rather than potential applications.",
        "In (Peters et al., 1998; Peters and Peters, 2000) the EuroWordNet structure, together with systematic polysemy, is used to group senses (sisters, auto-hyponymy, cousins, twins).",
        "This work is linked to the finding of systematic polysemy classes in (Buitelaar, 1998; Buitelaar, 2000; Tomuro, 1998) and others.",
        "While identifying systematic polysemy might be a key issue for and adequate lexico-semantic spec",
        "ification, systematic relatedness does not always mean sense proximity.",
        "In particular, such rules do not necessarily predict a similar behavior of the clustered senses in an NLP application.",
        "For instance, the animal/food systematic polysemy does not lead to good sense clusters neither for Machine Translation between English and Spanish, nor for Information Retrieval .",
        "In Spanish it is common to give different names to an animal in a zoological sense or in a food sense.",
        "For instance, it is necessary to distinguish animal/food senses of fish in order to translate into pez or pescado, depending on the context.",
        "And for Information Retrieval, the animal sense will appear in documents about, say, zoology, while the food sense will appear in documents about cooking.",
        "Therefore, while the animal/food rule is useful for lexical representation and prediction of sense extensions in English, it cannot be used to cluster senses in MT or M. In (Vossen et al., 1999) we performed a concept-based ER experiment where using the ILI with clusters was slightly worse than using the ILI without the clusters.",
        "While clustering the EWN Interlingual Index records on the basis of systematic polysemy proved useful to provide better inter-languages connectivity in the EWN database, this result supports the idea that systematic polysemy, per se, is not an indication of potential IR clusters.",
        "However, we do not claim that all systematic polysemy patterns are useless for IR.",
        "It is probably reasonable to classify different systematic polysemy rules according to whether they produce IR clusters or not.",
        "Some, already identified, patterns of regular polysemy, such as container/quantity or music/dance (Peters and Peters, 2000) yield adequate IR, clusters.",
        "Other patterns, such as animal/food, plant/food, animal/skin, language/people tend to produce clusters that are not valid for JR.",
        "This classification of polysemy patterns is, to our opinion, strongly related with the black and white dot operators introduced in (Buitelaar, 1998).",
        "The black operator was reserved for polysemy patterns including sets of senses that may co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. book as written work or as physical object), and white operator is reserved for polysemy patterns for senses that never co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. window as physical object or as computer frame).",
        "Unfortunately, the distinction between black and white operators classes has not been applied yet to our knowledge - to the set of polysemous classes defined in Buitelaar's thesis.",
        "But, in many cases, even useful polysemy rules fail to extract pairs of systematically related senses in WN/EWN, because the hypernym branches that they pertain to do not obey none of the described systematic polysemy classes/types.",

        "Nevertheless, sack 8, whose hypernym is \"enclosed space\", cannot be retained in the same way that the former pair of senses, in spite of identical semantic relationship.",
        "Systematic polysemy cannot predict, as well, a potential IR cluster with senses 3 and 5 (both meaning types of clothing and thus likely to appear in similar contexts).",
        "Senses 3 and 5 indicate, also, that clustering might also depend on the application domain: they can be clustered in a generic search, but they should be distinguished if the search is performed in a clothing domain.",

        "One of our goals within the EuroWordNet and ITEM projects was to provide sense clusterings for WordNet (and, in general,for the EuroWordNet InterLingual Index, (Gonzalo et al., 1999) that leave only the sense distinctions in wordnets that indicate different (semantic) indexing units for Information Retrieval.",
        "Our first lexicographic examination of WordNet sense distinctions and clusterings following criteria based on the wordnet hierarchy did not produce clear criteria to classify senses semi-automatically according to this IR requirement.",
        "As we mentioned before, the clusters applied on the EWN InterLingual Index which relied solely on hierarchical information in Wordnet, produced a slight decrease of retrieval performance in an experiment using ILI records as indexing units.",
        "Thus, we decided to stick to our only clear-cut criterion: cluster senses if they are likely to co-occur in the same document.",
        "The fact that the same sense combination occurs in several semantically tagged documents should provide strong evidence for clustering.",
        "Fortunately, we had the Semcor corpus of semantically-tagged documents to start with.",
        "For example, the first two senses of \"breath\" co-occur in several Semcor documents: Breath",
        "1.",
        "(the air that is inhaled or exhaled in respiration) 2.",
        "(the act of exhaling)",
        "This co-occurrence indicates that this sense distinction will not help to discriminate different document contexts.",
        "While in this particular example there is a clear relation between senses (sense 1 is involved in the action specified in sense 2), it seems extremely difficult to find general clustering techniques based on WordNet hierarchy to capture all potential IR.",
        "clusters.",
        "We have scanned Semcor in search of sets of (two or more) senses that co-occur frequently enough.",
        "In practice, we started with a threshold of at least 2 documents (out of 171) with the co-occurring senses in a similar distribution.",
        "We did not use the original Semcor files, but the IR-Semcor partition (Gonzalo et al., 1998) that splits multi-text documents into coherent retrieval chunks.",
        "We completed this list of candidates to cluster with pairs of senses that only co-occur once but belong to any \"cousin\" combination (Peters et al., 1998).",
        "Finally, we obtained 507 sets of sense combinations (producing above 650 sense pairs) for which Semcor provides positive evidence for clustering.",
        "A manual verification of 50 of such clusters showed that above 70% of them were useful.",
        "We also noticed that raising the threshold (the number of documents in which the senses co-occur), the error rate decreases quickly.",
        "Then we worked with this set of positive IR clusters, trying to identify a set of common features that could be used to cluster the rest of WN/EWN senses.",
        "However, it seems extremely difficult to find any single criterion, common to all clusters.",
        "For instance, if we consider a) number of variants in common between the synsets corresponding to the candidate senses; b) number of words in common between the glosses; and c) common hypernyms, we find that any combination of values for these three features is likely to be found among the set of clusters inferred from Semcor.",

        "a) number of variants in common: 1 out of 6 b) (content) words in common between glosses: no c) common hypernyms: no",
        "The next logical step is to use this positive evidence, combined with negative co-occurrence evidence, in training some machine learning system that can successfully capture the regularities hidden to our manual inspection.",
        "In principle, a binary classification task would be easy to capture by decision trees or similar techniques.",
        "Therefore, we have also extracted from Semcor combinations of senses that appear frequently enough in Semcor, but never appear together in the same document.",
        "The threshold was set in, at least, 8 occurrences of each sense in Semcor, resulting in more than 500 negative clusters.",
        "A manual verification of 50 of these negative clusters showed that about 80% of them were acceptable for Information Retrieval as senses that should be distinguished.",
        "Together with the positive evidence, we have more than 1100 training cases for a binary classifier.",
        "Our plan is to apply this classifier to the whole EWN InterLingual Index, and then perform precision/recall tests in the environment described in (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Gonzalo et al., 1999)."

        "We conclude that a) different NLP applications demand not only different sense granularities but different (possibly overlapped) sense clusterings.",
        "b) co-occurrence of senses in Semcor provide strong evidence for Information Retrieval clusters, unlike methods based on wordnet structure and systematic polysemy.",
        "c) parallel polysemy in two or more languages via the ILI, besides providing sense clusters for MT and CLIR, is correlated with coocurring senses in Semcor, and thus can be useful to obtain IR clusters as well.",
        "Both approaches to IR clusters for WN/EWN (evidence from Semcor and from the ILI) seem very promising.",
        "The positive and negative evidence from Semcor (above 500 clusters each) can possibly be used in a Machine Learning approach to find additional clusters for the remaining sense distinctions without enough evidence from Semcor.",
        "The parallel polysemy criteria, over EWN, is highly productive (more than one candidate per word in our experiments), although a more diverse set of languages would probably produce a higher rate of valid clusters."
