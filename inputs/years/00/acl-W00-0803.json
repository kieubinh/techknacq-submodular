        "After the opening of the Cross Language Information Retrieval (CUR) track in the TREC-6 conference (TREC-1998), several reports have been published on cross language information retrieval in European languages, and sometimes, European languages along with one of the Asian languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese or Korean).",
        "However, no report is found in cross language IR that focuses on the Asian languages exclusively.",
        "In 1999, Pergamon published a special issue of the journal, Information Processing and Management focusing on Information Retrieval with Asian Languages (Pergamon-1999).",
        "Among the eight papers included in that special issue, only one paper addressed CLIR (Kim et al., 1999).",
        "Kim et al.",
        "reported on multiple Asian language information retrieval (English, Japanese and Korean CUR) using multilingual dictionaries and machine translation techniques (to translate both queries and documents).",
        "In TREC, intensive research efforts are made for the European languages, for example, English, German, French, Spanish, etc.",
        "Historically, these languages share many similar linguistic properties.",
        "However, exclusive focus on Asian languages, for example, Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) - which also share significantly similar linguistic properties, has not been given.",
        "Enormous amount of CJK information is currently on the Internet.",
        "The combined growth rate of the CJK electronic information is also predicted to be growing at a faster rate.",
        "Cross language IR focusing on these Asian languages is therefore inevitable.",

        "Several approaches are investigated in CJK text indexing to address monolingual information retrieval (MLIR) - for example, (1) indexing single ideographic character, (2) indexing n-gram' ideographic characters and (3) indexing words or phrases after segmentation and morphological analysis.",
        "Monolingual information retrieval (MLIR) of CJK languages is further complicated with the fact that CJK texts do not contain word delimiters (e.g., a blank space after each word in English) to separate words.",
        "From the un-delimited sequence of characters, words must be extracted first (this process is known as segmentation).",
        "For inflectional ideographic language like Japanese, morphological analysis must also be performed.",
        "Sentences are segmented int> words with the help of a dictionary and using some machine learning techniques.",
        "Morphological analysis also needs intensive linguistic knowledge and computer processing.",
        "Segmentation and morphological analysis are tedious tasks and the accuracy of the automatic segmentation and morphological analysis drastically vary in different domains.",
        "The word based indexing of CJK texts is therefore computationally expensive.",
        "Segmentation and morphological analysis related issues of both Chinese and Japanese are intensively addressed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996; Matsumoto et al., 1997 and many others).",
        "The n-gram (n >1) character based indexing is computationally expensive as well.",
        "The number of indexing terms (n-grams) increases drastically as n increases.",
        "Moreover, not all the n-grams are semantically meaningful 'words; therefore, smoothing and filtering heuristics must be employed to extract linguistioally meaningful n-grams for effective retrieval of information.",
        "See Nie et al.",
        "(1996, 1998, 1999), Chen et al.",
        "(1997), Fujii et al.",
        "(1993), Kim et al.1:1999) for details.",
        "In contrast, indexing single characters is straightforward and less demanding in terms of both space and time.",
        "In single character indexing, there is no need to (1) maintain a",
        "multilingual dictionary or thesaurus of words, (2) to extract word and morphemes, and (3) to employ machine learning and smoothing to prune the less important n-grams or ambiguity resolution in word segmentation (Kwok, 1997; Ogawa et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1999; etc.).",
        "Moreover, a CUR system, based on Han character semantics, incurs no translation overhead for both queries and documents.",
        "In a single character based CLIR approach for CJK languages, some of the CLIR related problems discussed in (Grefenstette, 1998) can also be circumvented.",
        "Comparison of experimental results in monolingual IR using single character indexing, n-gram character indexing and (segmented) word indexing in Chinese information retrieval is reported in Nie et al.",
        "(1996, 1998, 1999) and Kwok (1997).",
        "For the case of monolingual information retrieval (MLIR) task, in comparison to the single character based indexing approach, n-gram based and word based approaches obtained better retrieval at the cost of the extra time and space complexity.",
        "Similar comparison and conclusion for Japanese and Korean MLIR are made in Fujii et al.",
        "(1993) and Lee et al.",
        "(1999), respectively.",
        "Cross language information retrieval (CLIR, Oard and Dorr, 1996) refers to the retrieval when the query and the document collection are in different languages.",
        "Unlike MLIR, in cross language information retrieval, a great deal of efforts is allocated in maintaining the multilingual dictionary and thesaurus, and translating the queries and documents, and so on.",
        "There are other approaches to CLIR where techniques like latent semantic indexing (LSI) are used to automatically establish associations between queries and documents independent of language differences (Rehder et al., 1998).",
        "Due to the special nature (ideographic, un-delimited, etc.)",
        "of the CJK languages, the cross language information retrieval of these languages is extremely complicated.",
        "Probably, this is the reason why only a few reports are available so far in Cross Asian Language Information Retrieval (CALIR).",
        "Tan and Nagao (1995) used correlated Han characters to align Japanese-Chinese bilingual texts.",
        "According to them, the occurrence of common Han characters (in Japanese and Chinese language texts) sometimes is so prevalent that even a monolingual reader could perform a partial alignment of the bilingual texts.",
        "One of the authors of this paper is not a native speaker of Chinese or Japanese but has the intermediate level proficiency in both languages now.",
        "However, before learning Japanese, based on the familiar Han characters (their visual similarity and therefore, the semantic relation) appeared in the Japanese texts, the author could roughly comprehend the theme of the articles written in Japanese.",
        "This is due to the fact that unlike Latin alphabets, Han characters capture significant semantic information in them.",
        "Since document retrieval is inherently a task of semantic distinction between queries and documents, Han character based CUR approach can therefore be justified.",
        "It is worthy to mention here that the pronunciation of the Han characters varies significantly across the CJK languages, but the visual appearance of the Han characters in written texts (across CJK language) retains certain level of similarity.",
        "As discussed above, we can make use of the non-trivial semantic information encoded within the ideographic characters to find associations between queries and documents across the languages and perform cross language information retrieval.",
        "By doing so, we can avoid complicated segmentation or morphological analysis process.",
        "At the same time, multilingual dictionary and thesaurus lookup, and query-documents translations can also be circumvented.",
        "In our research, we index single Han characters (common and/or semantically related) appeared in both Japanese and Chinese texts to model a new simplistic CLLR for Japanese and Chinese cross language information retrieval.",

        "2 Encoding scenarios of CJK languages Character encoding schemes of CJK languages have several variations (e.g., Chinese: GB and BIG-5, etc.",
        "; Japanese: JIS, EUC, etc.)3.",
        "The number of Han characters encoded under a particular encoding scheme also varies.",
        "However, due to the continuous acceptance and popularity of the Unicode (Unicode-2000) by the computer industry, we have a way to investigate these languages comprehensively.",
        "The Common CJK Ideograph section of the Unicode encoding scheme includes all characters encoded in each individual language and encoding scheme.",
        "Unicode version 3.0 assigned codes to 27,484 Han characters, a superset of characters encoded in other popular standards.",
        "However, Unicode encoding is not a linguistically based encoding scheme; it is rather an initiative to cope with the variants of different local standards.",
        "A critical analysis of Unicode and a proposal of Multicode can be found in Mudawwar (1997).",
        "Unicode standard avoids duplicate encoding of the same character; for example, the character 'a' is encoded only once although it is being used in several western languages.",
        "However, for ideographic characters, such efforts failed to a certain extent due to the variation of typeface used under different situations and cultures.",
        "The characters in Figure 1, although they represent the same word (sword in English), is given a unique code under Unicode encoding scheme to satisfy the round3 A typical Internet search engine (like Yahoo) sometimes asks users to specify not only the language but also the encoding scheme (e.g., simplified (GB) or traditional Chinese (BIG-5)) for a single language search.",
        "trip criteria'', that is, to allow round-trip conversion between the source: standard (in this case, JIS) and the Unicode.",
        "The 27,484 Han characters encoded in Unicode, therefore, includes semantic redundancy in both single-language and multiple-language perspectives.",
        "In the unified CJK ideograph section, Unicode maintains redundancy to accommodate typographical or cultural corrpatibility because the design goal of Unicode i s mainly to attain compatibility with the existing corporate and national encoding standards.",
        "fp a Han character based CLIR approach, such redundancy and multiplicity must be identified and resolved to achieve semantic uniformity and association.",
        "Such multiplicity resolution tasks, with compare to maintaining multilingual (word) dictionaries, are less painstaking.",
        "In our Han character based CLIR, we use a table lookup trapping approach to resolve semantic ambiguities of the Han characters and associate the semantically related ideographs within and across CJK languages, as a preprocessing task."
