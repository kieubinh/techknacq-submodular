        "The identification of the language style characterising the constituent parts of a corpus is very important to several applications.",
        "For example, in information retrieval applications, where large corpora of texts need to be searched efficiently, it is useful to have information about the language style used in each text, to improve the accuracy of the search (Karlgren, 1999).",
        "In fact, the criteria regarding language style may differ for each search and therefore – due to the large number of texts – there is a requirement to perform style categorisation in an automated manner.",
        "Such systems normally use statistical methods to evaluate the properties of given texts.",
        "The complexity of the studied properties varies.",
        "Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequency-of-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999) applies statistical methods primarily on structural and part-of-speech information.",

        "They report that the accuracy thus obtained is higher than when applying the same statistical measures to the original text.",
        "On the other hand, Biber (1995) uses Multidimensional Analysis coupled with a large number of linguistic features to distinguish among registers.",
        "The underlying idea is that, rather than being distinguished on the basis of a set of linguistic features, registers are distinguished on the basis of combinations of weighted linguistic features, the so-called \"dimensions\".",
        "This article reports on the discrimination of texts in written Modern Greek.",
        "The ongoing research described here has followed two distinct directions.",
        "First, we have tried to distinguish among registers of written Modern Greek.",
        "In a second phase, our research has focused on distinguishing among individual styles within one register and, more specifically, among speakers of the Greek Parliament.",
        "To achieve that, structural, morphological and part-of-speech information is employed.",
        "Initially (in section 2) emphasis is placed on distinguishing among the different registers used.",
        "In section 3, the task of author identification is tested with selected statistical methods.",
        "In both sections, we describe the set of linguistic features measured, we argue for the statistical method employed and we comment on the results.",

        "To distinguish among registers, we successfully exploited a particular feature of Modern Greek, namely the contrast between Katharevousa and Demotiki.",
        "These are variations of Modern Greek which correspond (if only roughly) to formal and informal speaking.",
        "Katharevousa was the official language of the Greek State until 1979 when it was replaced by Demotiki.",
        "By that time, Demotiki was the established language of literature while, in times, it had been the language of elementary education.",
        "Compared to Demotiki, Katharevousa bears an important resemblance to Ancient Greek manifested explicitly on the morphological level and the use of the lexicon.",
        "At a second step, we dropped the Katharevousa-Demotiki approach and relied on part-of-speech information, which is often exploited in text categorisation experiments (for instance, see Biber et al.",

        "Our results strongly suggest that registers of written Modern Greek can be discriminated accurately on the basis of the contrast Katharevousa / Demotiki manifested with morphological variation.",
        "Languages with a different history may not be suited to such a categorisation method.",
        "This is evident in Biber's work (1995) for the English language, where a variety of grammatical and macro-structural linguistic features but no morphological variation features were employed.",
        "It seems then that corpora of languages which are characterised by the phenomenon of diglossia, may be successfully categorisable on the basis of morphological information (or other reflexes of diglossia).",
        "Such a discrimination method may give results as satisfactory as approaches which are closer to the Biber (1995) spirit and rely on PoS and structural measures (see Tables 1 and 2).",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show that the accuracy of clustering reaches approximately 99% while the seeded clustering approach had a high degree of accuracy, reaching 100% when using 5 clusters.",
        "For the 27-element vector with both morphological and PoS information, perfect clustering has been achieved even with 4 clusters.",
        "On the other hand, a successful clustering (albeit with a lower level of accuracy) is achieved using only structural and PoS information.",
        "It should be noted that the lexical variables used, that is the negation particles, did not contribute at all (Markantonatou et al., 2000).",
        "Furthermore, the system performed almost as well with and without macro-structure features, the difference in accuracy being less than 5%.",
        "The parliament texts can be claimed to form a register whose patterns are closely positioned in the pattern space.",
        "Of the three registers, the literature one presented the highest degree of variance, with more than one sub-clusters existing as well as outlier elements.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that the parliament proceedings, contrary to literature, undergo intensive editing by a small group of specialised public servants."

        "This may be explained by the fact that these texts undergo intensive editing towards a well-established sub-language.",
        "This editing homogenises the morphological profile of the texts but, of course, does not go as far as homogenising the lexical preferences of the various speakers.",
        "That is why, contrary to the register-clustering experiments, lexical variables expressing the particular contrast seem to play a role in discriminating between speakers and why the use of Katharevousa-oriented negative particles, which was not important in register discrimination, seems to be of some importance in style discrimination.",
        "The observation that negative words play a role in style identification is in agreement with the observations of Labbe (1983) on the French political speech.",
