        "Because of their cost, however, it is essential that their acquisition and annotation be designed in order to maximize their reusability as much as possible.",
        "The main assumption behind the design of the ADAM corpus is that actual reusability of corpora crucially depends on the strategic choices concerning the architectural design of the corpus, i.e. the way in which annotation",
        "is organized and structured, and the way in which this is represented in a given physical formate.",
        "Corpus reusability is traditionally seen as mainly a by-product of either corpus representativeness and degree of standardization of annotation schemes.",
        "We claim that two other requirements should be taken into account when designing and building an annotated corpus that aims at reusability, namely modularity of annotation, and use of annotation meta-schemes.",

      "text": [
        "The ADAM approach is mainly driven by the need of meeting the requirements of potential users of annotated corpora, with a particular emphasis on corpora reusability.",
        "An annotated corpus is reusable as far as it complies with several requirements, such as corpus representativeness and use of standardized annotation schemes (see some widely renowned standardization efforts such as EAGLES, MATE, DRI, ATLAS, etc.).",
        "The physical format or mark-up language for corpus encoding is another crucial issue, as it will be argued in section 3.4.",
        "In addition to this, we claim that an annotated corpus is useful beyond the immediate particular application aims only to the extent to which it is designed so as to meet two other important needs.",
        "A fundamental requirement appears to revolve around the way annotation is organized, structured and represented in a corpus.",
        "In short, it is essential that the annotation, i.e. the linguistic information added to the data, should be easily and quickly modifiable at a moderately low cost by subsequent users of the corpus.",
        "We can think of at least two possible scenarios, referring to two orthogonal dimensions of customization operations.",
        "First, it might be the case that a user wishes to reuse a corpus which is annotated for several types of linguistic information, but lacks of a particular annotation type; the potential user could nevertheless be interested in the existing annotations, and would like to supplement them with a new one.",
        "On the other hand, it might be the case that a user is interested in some annotation only (e.g., pos-tagging or syntactic structure) and s/he might want to leave aside other annotation types.",
        "Reusability of an annotated corpus can thus be thought of as a function of the extent to which new levels of linguistic information can be added, or uninteresting ones can be removed.",
        "This is what we call the vertical dimension of customization in annotated corpora.",
        "Second, for each level of linguistic analysis, an annotated corpus is likely to be reused depending on the extent to which existing annotation can be changed, so as to accommodate different annotation practices.",
        "It is often the case that a corpus which is annotated with a given annotation scheme \"hard-wires\" the annotation so as it is impossible to replace the annotation without reverting to the raw text and rebuilding the annotation from scratch, which is enormously expensive.",
        "This is what we call the horizontal dimension of customization of an annoted corpus.",
        "The extent to which an annotated corpus can be compliant with these two requirements clearly depends on the architectural choices made at the design level: if, for instance, all types of annotation are flattened onto a single representation level, it is clear that the customizing operations above become hardly feasible.",
        "We claim that the vertical and horizontal customization requirements can be easily achieved on the one hand by appealing to the two related notions of modularity of annotation and use of annotation meta-schemes, and on the other by exploiting a physical format of encoding that fully supports them.",
        "In the next three sections we illustrate the two concepts as well as the way they are implemented in the ADAM Corpus."

        "In an annotated corpus, several different types of annotation or linguistic information may be present in relation to the same input data.",
        "These types of information can be thought of as independent, yet related, levels or dimensions of linguistic description .",
        "We thus can think of a level of prosodic analysis, another of pos-tagging, another of semantic analysis, etc.",
        "By annotation modularity we mean that the different layers of an10 notation are to be kept independent one of another.",
        "In the ADAM Corpus we provide five layers of annotation: prosodic, morpho-syntactic (pos tagging), syntactic, conceptual-semantic, and pragmatic.",
        "Each dialogue in the corpus is annotated at the above five levels of analysis; synchronization among the different analyses and between these and the speech signal is ensured by the different annotations (stored as separate files) making reference to the same input file.",
        "This file, containing the transcription of the dialogue, is in turn linked to the audio file in PCM (a-low or u-low) format.",
        "As it will be argued in section 3.3, support for this structure is provided by the use of XML as mark-up language.",
        "By adopting this structure, annotation layers are linguistically heterogeneous and mutually orthogonal, so that changing one of them affects others only to a limited extent; layers are nevertheless indirectly related through a) their hinging on a common reference file (the \"raw\" text represented by the transcription file); b) the indirect correlation of the linguistic information they convey.",
        "This vertical modularity of the ADAM approach has interesting consequences for the purposes of reusability.",
        "A potential user of the ADAM Corpus is left free to select, among the proposed levels of annotation, those which best reflect his/her theoretical and practical interests.",
        "(S)he can also feel the need for adding a new layer of information, not contemplated in today's ADAM realization.",
        "By the way, level modularity is also of theoretical interest, since most annotation schemes we know differ mainly in the way pieces of linguistic information categorized, rather than in the intrinsic nature of these levels.",
        "Moreover, level modularity seems to have a useful impact on our theoretical understanding of the linguistic phenomena at stake, since it is capable of expressing correlations between layers, and ultimately between dimensions of linguistic analysis."

        "However, it should be emphasized how the ADAM specifications do not merely amount to another set of ready-made, off-the-shelf annotation schemes.",
        "Rather, we would like to focus the attention on what we call an annotation meta-scheme, and on the implications of this choice.",
        "According to our view, an annotation meta-scheme is a general descriptive framework in which different annotation schemes can be accommodated.",
        "In many cases the same unit of linguistic information can be annotated in different, arguably mutually incompatible ways, which are nonetheless all compatible with the recommended vertical modularity described above: so it is better to provide the potential user with the possibility of adopting any arbitrary annotation scheme without being forced to rebuild the annotation from scratch or to forcefully comply with some other annotation scheme, no matter how standardized.",
        "To do so, it is necessary to have a representation format for the annotation that is general enough for competing schemes to be mutually substitutable.",
        "In ADAM we achieve this aim by building a general scheme where those features that are common to several competing schemes become slots or descriptive element tags to be associated with linguistic elements; the values of these attributes can be any arbitrary set of tags.",
        "Let's consider, for instance, the case of pragmatic annotation.",
        "The main difference between annotation schemes for this level of analysis lies in the particular types of dialogue act chosen rather than in the notion of dialogue act itself, which appears to be uncontroversial.",
        "If, however, we adopt a scheme where the basic descriptive element of any arbitrarily long set of words is the general tag <dialogue act>, further described by an attribute type, different schemes can be applied",
        "to the same corpus without totally discarding the existing annotation: a substitution in the set of values will be enough.",
