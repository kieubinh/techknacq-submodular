        "Conversational grunts, such as uh-huh, un-hn, mm, and oh are ubiquitous in spoken English.",
        "In our conversation data, these grunts occur an average of once every 5 seconds in American English conversation.",
        "In a sample of 79 conversations from a larger corpus, Switchboard, um was the 6th most frequent item (after I, and, the, you, and a), and the four items uh, uh-huh, um and um-hum accounted for 4% of the total.",
        "These sounds are not only frequent, they are important in language use.",
        "To mention just one example, people learning English as a second language are handicapped in informal interactions if they cannot produce and recognize these sounds.",
        "1I would like to thank Takeki Kamiyama for phonetic label cross-checking, all those who let me record their conversations, and the anonymous referees; and also the Japanese Ministry of Education, the Sound Technology Promotion Foundation, the Nakayama Foundation, the Inamori Foundation, the International Communications Foundation and the Okawa Foundation for support.",
        "Just to be clear about definitions, in this paper trunts2' means sounds which are 'not words', where a prototypical \"word\" is a sound having 1. a clear meaning, 2. the ability to participate in syntactic constructions, and 3. a phonotactically normal pronunciation.",
        "For example, uh-huh is a grunt since it has no referential meaning, has no syntactic affinities, and has salient breathiness.",
        "In this paper 'conversational' refers to sounds which occur in conversation and are at least in part directed at the interlocutor, rather than being purely self-directed3.",
        "Both of these definitions have flaws, but they provide a fairly objective criterion for delimiting the set of items which any transcription scheme should be able to handle.",
        "The phenomena circumscribed by this definition are a subset of \"vocal segregates\" (Trager, 1958) and of \"interjections\": the difference is that it limits attention to sounds occurring in conversations.",
        "This definition also roughly delimits the subset of \"discourse markers\" or \"discourse particles\" which occur in informal spoken discourse.",
        "As the phonetics and meanings of conversational grunts are currently not well understood, we have begun a project aiming to elucidate, model, and eventually exploit them.",
        "The current paper is a report on an approach 2 It may seem that the negative connotations of the word 'grunt' make it inappropriate for use as a technical term, but the phenomenon itself is often stigmatized, and so the term is appropriate in that sense too.",
        "3Two rules of thumb were adopted to help in cases which were difficult to judge: consider laughter as not conversational, and consider as conversational everything else that might possibly be playing some communicative role, even if it isn't clear what that role might be.",
        "to the preliminary problem of how to transcribe these sounds.",
        "A generally usable, standardized transcription scheme would be of great value.",
        "Immediate applications include screenplay writing and court recording.",
        "It would also facilitate the systematic corpus-based study of the meanings and functions of these sounds4.",
        "There are also prospects for applications in systems.",
        "One could imagine a dialog transcription system that produces output with the grunts represented in enough detail to show whether a listener is being enthusiastic, reluctant, non-committal, bored, etc., as these states are often indicated by grunts rather than by words.",
        "One could imagine spoken dialog systems which prompt and confirm concisely with such grunts, instead of full words or phrases.",
        "And one could imagine spoken dialog systems which adjust their output based on barge-in feedback from the user such as uh-huh meaning \"go on, don't talk so slow\", uh-hum meaning \"stop, I need to think\", and ah meaning \"I have something to say\".",
        "Section 2 surveys previous approaches to grunt transcription, Section 3 proposes a slightly new scheme, Section 4 discusses its adequacy, and Section 5 points out some open issues."

        "One tradition in labeling grunts is to use a completely general scheme.",
        "The central inspiration here is the fact that grunts are unlike words, in that they contain sounds which are never seen in the lexical items of the language.",
        "As such, they can fall outside the coverage of even the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is only designed to handle those sounds 'This is not to say that there can be a strict ordering of activities here: on the contrary, it is not possible to fix a transcription standard without at least a tacit theory of the meanings and functions of the items being transcribed.",
        "Some thoughts on this appear elsewhere (Ward, 2000).",
        "which occur contrastively in some words in some language.",
        "Thus there have been proposals for richer, more complete transcription schemes, capable of handling just about any communicative noise that people have been observed to produce, including moans, cries and belches (Trager, 1958; Poyatos, 1975).",
        "One disadvantage of these notations is that they are not usable without training.",
        "A second disadvantage is that their generality is excessive for everyday use.",
        "As seen below, the vast majority of conversational grunts are drawn from a much smaller inventory of sounds.",
        "A third disadvantage is that they provide more accuracy than is needed.",
        "For example, in English there appear to be no grunts in which the difference between an alveolar nasal, a velar nasal, or nasalization of a vowel conveys a difference in meaning, and so these do not need to be distinguished in transcription."

        "An alternative approach is seen in some schemes used for labeling corpora for purposes of training and evaluating speech recognizers.",
        "A quote from the most recent Switchboard labeling standard (Hamaker et al., 1998) gives the flavor: 20.",
        "Hesitation Sounds: Use \"uh\" or \"ah\" for hesitations consisting of a vowel sound, and \"urn\" or \"hm\" for hesitations with a nasal sound, depending upon which transcription the actual sound is closest to.",
        "Use \"huh\" for aspirated version of the hesitation as in \"huh?",
        "<other speaker responds> urn ok, I see your point.\" 21: yes/no sounds: Use \"uh-huh\" or \"um-hum\" (yes) and \"huh-uh\" or \"hum-um\" (no) for anything remotely resembling these sounds of assent or denial\" Another scheme (Lander, 1996) lists several \"miscellaneous words\", including:",
        "\"nuh uh\" (no), \"mm hmm\" (yes), \"hnun mmm\" (no), \"nun mm\" (no), \"uh huh\" (yes), \"huh uh\" (no), \"uh uh\" (no) The inspiration behind these schemes seems to be the idea that grunts are just like words.",
        "This leads to two assumptions, both of which are questionable.",
        "First, there is the assumption that each grunt has some fixed meaning and some fixed functional role (filler, back-channel, etc).",
        "However, many specific grunt sounds can be found in more than one functional role, as seen in Table 1.",
        "Second, there is the assumption that the set of conversational grunts is small.",
        "However the number of observed grunts is not small, as seen in Table 2, and the set of possible grunts is probably not even finite: for example, it would not be surprising at all to hear the sound hum-ha-han in conversation, or hum-ha-an, or hum-ha-un, and so on, and so on.",
        "(However, not every possible sound seems likely to be a conversational grunt; for example ziflug would seem a surprising novelty, and would be downright weird in any of the functional positions typical for grunts.)",
        "One concrete problem with these schemes is that they are not designed to allow phonetically accurate representations of grunts5.",
        "In particular, they make the task of the labeler a rather strange one.",
        "Given a grunt, first he must examine the context to determine whether it is a back-channel or a filler, then determine whether it sounds affirmative or negative, and only then can he consider what the actual sound is, and his options are limited to picking one of the labels in the func-tional/semantic category.",
        "The relation between the letters of the label and the phonetics of the grunt becomes somewhat arbitrary.",
        "This would be more tolerable if there was a clear tendency for each grunt to occur in only one functional position, but this is not the case, as noted above.",
        "The use of the affirma-tive/negative distinction as a primary classificatory feature is also also open to question.",
        "In our corpus, only 1% of the grunts were negative in meaning, and these were all in contexts where a negative answer was expected or likely, so this distinction is a strange choice for a top-level dividing principle.",
        "Moreover, negative grunts are, in fact, characterized by two-syllables with a sharp syllable boundary, often a glottal stop, and/or a sharp down-step in pitch, and/or a lack of breathiness, but these features are reflected only tenuously in the spellings listed as possible for negative grunts in these schemes."

        "The third tradition in transcribing grunts is to allow labelers to just spell them in the 'usual' way, as one might see them written in the comics or in a detective novel.",
        "The inspiration behind this is that native speakers generally have had a lot of exposure to orthographic representations of grunts, and can be trusted to do the right thing.",
        "One problem with this tradition is that the mapping from letter sequences to the actual sounds is not clear.",
        "For example, a conversation transcription given as a textbook example of good practice includes \"u\" and \"uh\", and \"oh\" and \"oo\" (Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1999), without footnoting.",
        "Presumably the \"oo\" means /u/, but it could also possibly mean a version of \"oh\" with strong lip rounding, or a longer form of \"oh\", or perhaps a shorter form (if the labeler was trying to avoid confusion with the archaic vocative \"o\").",
        "English orthography is phonetically ambiguous and not standardized for grunts.",
        "A second problem with this tradition is that creaky voice (vocal fry), although pragmatically significant, is generally not represented (although many practitioners are surprisingly diligent at noting occurrences of breathiness)."
