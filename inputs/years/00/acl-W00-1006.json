        "Coherence relations represent rich semantic linkage (like Cause' or Evaluation) between text segments of varying size.",
        "However, what the minimum size of text segments to relate should be, is still left open to debate.",
        "As common approaches argue that coherence relations relate events or situations (e.g. (Hobbs et al., 1993; Asher, 1993)) and that such events are usually introduced 'Coherence relations in this paper are basically taken from taken Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) will appear emphasized and Capitalized.",
        "through the means of verbs, it has become standard practice to consider clauses to be the appropriate size for elementary discourse units.",
        "It has, however, also been observed (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995; Grote et al., 1997) that sometimes phrases may serve as very condensed forms to express elaborate contents.",
        "Recently, (Schauer and Hahn, 2000) provided a more detailed analysis when prepositional phrases (PPs) may serve as elementary discourse units.",
        "Cursorily viewed, the claims of another recent study stand in contrast to the idea of intra-clausal discourse units: (Schauer, 2000) examined the interplay of coreferential expressions and discourse structure and concluded that referential relations are a good indicator of the discourse structural configurations in case the units examined are entire sentences.",
        "This poses the question whether not entire sentences are the appropriate grain size for elementary discourse units.",
        "I will argue that these results - i.e. the different levels of granularity for discourse units - are not incompatible with each other.",
        "The approach used in (Schauer and Hahn, 2000) to derive the coherence relation governing a prepositional phrase neatly carries over to the computation of coherence relations signaled by sentence-internal cue-phrases.",
        "This then allows an integration with the algorithm using referential relations that was proposed in (Schauer, 2000)."

        "However, this is still not sufficient to account for deriving the discourse structure of texts in general: cue-phrases are by no means always present and even if there is a cue-phrase, detecting the correct attachment point of a new unit is usually not straightforward.",
        "As (one step towards) a solution, referential relations between nominal expressions were suggested.",
        "The presented algorithm integrates the resolution of anaphora â€“ which also depends heavily on inferences and domain-knowledge â€“ with choosing the target unit to which a new unit should connect to: namely, the highest node providing antecedents to all anaphoric expressions in the new unit.",
        "In order for this algorithm to operate successful, it is however necessary that this process is started only after all phenomena of intra-sentential coherence relations have been accounted for, which might be done using the combined approach outlined above.",
        "Returning to the question posed at the beginning of the paper - what is the appropriate size of elementary discourse units - the answer is twofold: first of all, coherence relations can be found to hold between phrases and the clause containing them, so one should indeed start looking for discourse units at the phrase level.",
        "However, Syntax requires that the components of sentences group together, and returning to what (Mann and Thompson, 1988) said, sentences have a kind of functional integrity - one that operates on a level that is different from those of phrases.",
        "Once this level is reached, larger chunks can be formed, e.g. by referential means.",
        "The presented approach to cue-phrases as well as the use of referential relations will be implemented in the text understanding system SYNDIKATE (Hahn and Romacker, 1999), in order to account for semantically rich relations between larger text chunks and the discourse structure of texts in general.",
        "This, however, will require further understanding of the conditions of the coherence relations involved."
