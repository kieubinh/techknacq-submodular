        "Many natural language processing applications involve the complex task of resolving anaphora.",
        "Different strategies for anaphora resolution have been proposed, some exclusively relying on the syntactic structure of discourse, some including semantic and pragmatic constraints, some based on statistical methods.",
        "One of the most popular approaches to anaphora resolution is centering (Grosz et al., 1995), henceforth GJW95, which accounts for the relation between the saliency of entities in discourse and the use of referring expressions, incorporating syntax, semantics and pragmatics.",
        "Centering fits into Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "In this model a discourse is composed of segments which exhibit global coherence.",
        "A discourse 'This work has been carried out under Staging, an ongoing Danish project funded by the Danish Research Councils.",
        "segment, on the other hand, is composed of a sequence of utterances which exhibit local coherence.",
        "This latter phenomenon is accounted for by centering theory.",
        "Centering predicts that there is a connection between the coherence of a referring expression and the inference load necessary to resolve it.",
        "Although Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein recognize that many factors determine the prominence of entities in an utterance, in GJW95 this prominence is established simply by the linear order of the entities in the utterance.",
        "Different centering algorithms have been presented, spelling out the strategy described in GJW95, extending the theory to more linguistic phenomena or specifying the concept of prominence of discourse entities.",
        "Strube and Hahn (Strube, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999) in particular, calculate prominence considering the information structure of the utterances (functional centering).2 The prominence ranking they adopt does not exclusively rely on word order, which is language dependent.",
        "Moreover GJW95 only dealt with intersentential anaphora, while Strube and Hahn account for both intrasentential and intersentential, pronominal and nominal anaphora.3 Centering-based algorithms have been tested on written texts.",
        "Recently they have also been applied to written dialogues.",
        "Byron and Stent (1998), in particular, test centering on multi-party dialogues.",
        "They conclude that centering seems to be a valid theory also in this case, but it must be extended to ac-21n (Strube and Hahn, 1996) a functional-based prominence ranking has been proposed.",
        "3 An other extension of the centering framework to intrasentential anaphora has been proposed by Kameyama (1998).",
        "count for dialogue-specific aspects such as the definition of utterance boundaries, the specification of a strategy for tackling partial utterances and including discourse participants in the list of relevant discourse entities.",
        "Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), henceforth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolving anaphors referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues.",
        "The algorithm is based on rules for discriminating among the two types of anaphor based on the predicative contexts in which the anaphors occur.",
        "The individual anaphors are then resolved by the functional centering algorithm described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract anaphors are resolved with a different algorithm.",
        "ES99 test the approach on selected dialogues and obtain a precision of 63,6% for discourse deictics and 66,2% for individual anaphors.",
        "They report that most errors are due to the inability to distinguish between discourse deictics and pronouns which vaguely refer to concepts in the preceding discourse (vague anaphors).",
        "Another cause of error is the lack of information about abstract nominals.",
        "I believe that the strategy followed by ES99 is a good starting point for investigating how far one can go in resolving individual and abstract anaphors in dialogues on the basis of the local contexts in which the anaphors occur.",
        "I have adapted the algorithm so it accounts for Danish data and have applied it to Danish dialogues.4 In section 2 I shortly present the original centering framework and functional centering as described in (Strube, 1998), S98.",
