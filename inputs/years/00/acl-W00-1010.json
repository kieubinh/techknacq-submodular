        "We propose a model where dialog obligations arise from the interplay of social goals and intentions of the participants: when an agent is addressed with a request, the agent's decision to commit to the requester's linguistic and domain goals is motivated by a trade-off between the preference for preventing a negative reaction of the requester and the cost of the actions needed to satisfy the goals."

        "As noticed by (Airenti et al., 1993), a dialog .participant, even when he does not commit to the domain goals of his partner (i.e., he doesn't cooperate behaviorally), typically continues to cooperate at the conversational level.",
        "[1] A: Do you have Marlboros?",
        "B: Uh, no.",
        "We ran out' [2] A: Can you tell me the time?",
        "B: No.",
        "My watch is broken [3] A: Could you give me some money",
        "for the booze?",
        "B: I won't give you a dime What leads people to exhibit these forms of cooperation?",
        "(Traum and Allen, 1994) have challenged intention-based approaches to dialog modeling ((Cohen and Levesque, 1990), (Lambert and Carberry, 1991), (Airenti et al., 1993)) arguing that, in non-cooperative settings (i.e., when the participants do not have I (Merrit, 1976) 2(Green and Carberry, 1999) shared goals), intention-based approaches leave unexplained why a participant should bother to be cooperative, both at the conversational and at the behavioral level.",
        "In order to overcome these difficulties, (Traum and Allen, 1994) claim that speech acts pose obligations on the hearer: obligations are pro-attitudes which provide the hearer with a motivation to act, even if he is not - strictly speaking - cooperating with the speaker.",
        "Elaborating this proposal, (Poesio and Traum, 1998) propose to add obligations to the illocutive effect of speech acts: for instance, a (successful) question would pose on the addressee the obligation to answer; and, in general, a speech act poses the obligation to ground it.",
        "While we agree with (Traum and Allen, 1994) that cooperation between agents who are not part of a group has to be explained by some mechanism which obliges an agent to answer - at least for refusing explicitly - we want to go deeper inside the notion of obligation and try to show that it is strictly related to that of intention.",
        "In order to explain obligations, we resort to the notion of social goals, starting from (Goffman, 1981)'s sociolinguistic analysis of interactions.",
        "We argue that, in non-cooperative situations, social goals provide agents with the motivation for committing to other agents' communicated goals.",
        "As shown by (Brown and Levinson, 1987), an agent has the social goal of taking into account the face of other people (and his own as well); this concern generates complementary needs for the requester and for the requestee.",
        "From the requester's point of view, it results in",
        "the production of complex linguistic forms aimed at reducing the potential offence intrinsic to a demand to act (conversationally or behaviorally); from the requestee's point of view, while acceptance normally addresses the requester's potential offence by a displaying of good-tempered feelings, any refusal at the conversational or behavioral level constitutes in turn a potential offence to the requestee's face, and sets up the social need for the refusing agent to act in order to nullify this potential offence (Goffman, 1981).",
        "Differently from obligations, social goals influence actions in an indirect way: in order to evaluate the effects of an action on his interlocutor, an agent has to make a tentative prediction of his reaction (anticipatory coordination) (Castelfranchi, 1998).",
        "This prediction allows the agent to keep the partner's possible reaction into account when planning his next (domain or linguistic) action.",
        "Social goals intervene as preferences during the action selection phase, by leading the planning agent to choose the actions which minimize the offence to the partner and address the potential offence conveyed by a refusal."

        "We assume that every agent A has a set of goals G, and a set of preferences P towards states of affairs.",
        "Besides, an agent has at his disposal a set of action operators (recipes for achieving domain and linguistic goals, corresponding to behavioral and conversational cooperation) organized in a hierarchical way.",
        "The preferences of an agent are expressed as functions which map states, represented as sets of attribute-value pairs, to real numbers; an overall utility function, which consists of the weighted sum of the individual functions, expresses the utility of reaching the state depicted by a certain configuration of attributes, according to the results of the multi-attribute utility theory (Haddawy and Hanks, 1998).",
        "Goals provide the input to the planning process; in addition, they can appear in the preferences of the agent, i.e., they can be related to a utility function which evaluates the expected utility of achieving them3.",
        "On the basis of his goals and of the recipes he knows, an agent builds a set of plans, by selecting the recipes which have among their effects one (or more) of the goals in the set.",
        "The planner we use is a modification of the DRIPS decision-theoretic hierarchical planner (Haddawy and Hanks, 1998).",
        "The planning process starts by applying to the current state all selected recipes and recursively expands the partial plans until the appropriate level of detail is reached.",
        "When the planning algorithm concludes the refinement of the input recipes, it returns the preferred plan, i. e., the one with the highest expected utility: the agent becomes committed to that plan, which constitutes his current intention.",

        "If this is the case, it is possible that agent B comes to choose a plan to satisfy this goal, even if it does not yield any direct utility to him.",
        "Notice that if an agent evaluated the utility of a plan for achieving a goal that has been requested by another agent only on the basis of its immediate outcome, he would never choose that plan in a non-cooperative setting: performing an action for achieving another agent's goal often results only in a negative utility, since the side effects of the action 3Not all goals are among the preferred states of affairs, since there are instrumental goals which arise as a consequence of the intention to achieve some higher-level goal.",

        "Here, the ability of an agent to predict the potential reactions of another agent is exploited to decide whether it is worth for him to commit to the satisfaction of the other agent's goal.",
        "In order to evaluate how the partner's reaction affects his own preferences, like not offending the partner and other social goals, an agent evaluates the utility of a plan by considering the world states resulting from the other partner's reaction (one-level lookahead), both in case he has committed to the partner's goals, and in case he has decided that they are not worth pursuing.",
        "The DRIPS planner has been modified to implement the following process of intention formation in interactions with other agents (see figure 1):",
        "1. adoption: if A communicates to B a goal gA which he wants B to achieve, then the current set of B's goals, GB, becomes G'B, the union of {g A} and GB.",
        "2. planning: B builds the set of plans PB which aim at achieving (all or some of) the goals in GB (in this way the plans achieving also gA are compared with those which do not).",

        "In this section, we exploit the framework described above to model the complex dynamics of goals and social preferences that underlies examples like [1].",
        "In particular, we consider the possibility that the partner is offended by the agent's response to a request.",
        "The offence is not modeled as a direct effect of an action of the agent.",
        "Instead, during the planning phase, the agent makes a tentative prediction of the partner's attitude in the state where he is faced with a refusal, in order to evaluate how this state complies with his preference for not offending: the partner is offended as a result of his reaction to the agent's refusal.",
        "In our model, the preference for not offending the partner corresponds to a social goal' of an agent: this preference doesn't constitute an input to planning, but, by being embodied in the utility function of the agent, it contributes to plan selection, by promoting the plans which do not have offending as a consequence.",
        "This is in line with (Goffman, 1967)'s claim that \"Ordinarily, maintenance of face is a condition of interaction, not its objective\" (p.12).",
        "Some authors ((Schegloff and Sacks, 1973), (Coulthard, 1977)) have characterized the organization of conversation in terms of prototypical pairs, adjacency pairs.",
        "In our model, the existence of adjacency pairs is not motivated by the action of specific grounding norms, or obligations.6 Rather, these exchanges are explained by the interplay of the communicative intentions of the participants, and by their ability to recognize the intentions of the interlocutors (Ardissono et al., 2000).",
        "51n (Clark, 1996)'s terminology, goals like being polite are called interpersonal goals.",
        "6 \"Given a speaker's need to know whether his message has been received, and if so, whether or not has been passably understood, and given a recipient's need to show that he has received the message and correctly - given these very fundamental requirements of talk as a communication system - we have the essential rationale for the existence of adjacency pairs, that is, for the organization of talk into two-part exchanges\" ((Goffman, 1981), p. 12).",
        "In general, the preference for not offending which encompasses conversational phenomena like request-response pairs, is motivated by the requestee's goal of displaying a good-tempered acceptance of the request itself: in (Goffman, 1981)'s terms, communicative exchanges are subject to a set of \"constraints regarding how each individual ought to handle himself with respect to each others, so that he not discredit his own tacit claim to good-character or the tacit claim of the others that they are persons of social worth (...)\" (p. 16).",
        "Within an interaction, agents are aware of the fact that their actions have social effects, like conveying some information about their character and about their attitude towards the partner: \"An act is taken to carry implications regarding the character of the actor and his evaluation of his listeners, as well as reflecting on the relationship between him and them\" ((Goffman, 1981), p. 21).",
        "As a consequence, agents are very cautious in the use of the expressive means they have at disposal, namely verbal actions: besides monitoring the partner's reactions, they try to anticipate them with the aim of not offending the partner.",
        "The preference for not offending holds as well in the circumstances where an agent is forced to refuse his cooperation by the impossibility of executing the appropriate action to achieve the partner's goal.",
        "However, if this is the case, the requestee has to cope with the additional fact that a simple, negative answer can be mistakenly taken to count as a refusal to cooperate at all: [4] A: Have you got a cigarette?",
        "B: No For this reason, the refusing agent is likely to provide the requester with an acceptable reason, i.e. a remedy or account (Levinson, 1983), when the request is to be turned down.",
        "What remains to be explained is why requests at behavioral level seem to pose less constraints on the addressee, if compared to requests at conversational level: provided that the interactants don't have shared goals, it is a matter of fact that it is easier to refuse a request for money (see example [3])7 than a request to tell the time (see example [2]).",
        "In particular, conversational goals often force the hearer to satisfy them: it is aggressive not to answer at all or to ignore the speaker.",
        "The reason why paying attention to people, listening and understanding are not easily refused is that, they are low cost actions, or \"free goods\" in (Goffman, 1967) terminology, so no one can refuse them without threatening the speaker's face and offending him.",
        "A refusal at the conversational level - ignoring a potential partner and not even responding to his verbal request - constitutes a menace to the face of the requester, so it is hardly justified.",
        "7We thank the anonymous reviewers for the observation that this example lends itself to a deeper analysis, involving further social and psycological parameters.",
        "However, we will not discuss the example here, due to space reasons.",
        "Up to this point no explicit obligation is created: the \"obligation to act\" depends on the utility of the action needed to establish cooperation; if the cost of the action is low (e.g., a conversational action).",
        "the refusal to execute it can be motivated in the requester's eyes only by a requestee's negative attitude towards him.",
        "So, the requester, as a result of his ability to infer the requestee's reasoning, will be offended by a refusal; the preference for not threatening the face of the partners and preserving one's own social face normally makes the utility of offences negative, thus leading requestees to avoiding refusals.",
        "At the same time, this analysis, by making explicit the underlying motivations for the preference for a certain type of response, accounts for the existence of preferred and dispreferred second turns in adjacency pairs."

        "Note that, at both levels, subsidiary goals arise as part of the intentional behavior of an agent: for example, after performing an action for achieving some goal, it is rational to check whether this action has succeeded.",
        "9 B considers if it is possible for him to commit to the higher-level goal (sell), to which the remaining recognized goals are subordinated: although B is inclined to satisfy this goal, B knows that one of the preconditions for executing the selling action (has(B,Marlboros)) is not true.",
        "At this point, besides the choice of not responding at all, the alternative courses of action available to B consist in committing to A's goal to know if B has committed to his (unachievable) sell goal (knowif-satisfy), and the subordinate goal to know if B has completed the plan to achieve it (knowif-completed), or to commit to A's goal - at conversational level - to have his illocutionary act grounded (grounded).1 The choice between the alternative of not responding at all and any of the other alternatives is accomplished by considering the reaction of the partner to a refusal at the conversational level; this choice is enforced by the consideration that communicative actions are \"free goods\", so they cannot be refused without incurring in a state where the partner is offended.",

        "On the contrary, the second plan, though more expensive, obeys to the preference for not offending, since it protects the refusing requestee from the accusation of non-cooperativeness.",

        "In this paper we proposed an intention-based approach to dialog that aims at overcoming the critics posed by (Traum and Allen, 1994) by assuming the existence of social goals.",

        "of obligation, even if some similarities can be found with (Traum and Allen, 1994).",
        "The advantage of not resorting to a primitive notion of obligation is to have a uniform source of motivations for explaining the behavior of agents.",
        "With respect to approaches which stipulate a primitive notion of obligation, here, the same phenomena are accounted for without introducing further propositional attitudes.",
        "This explanation of the motivations leading to cooperation provides an explicative model that is uniform with the treatment of deon-tic reasoning in agent theories (Conte et al., 1998), (Boella and Lesmo, 2000) and the definition of cooperation proposed in (Boella et al., 2000).",
        "It is clear that, by reducing the number of propositional attitudes, the reasoning process becomes more complex, but our model is aimed at constituting an explanation, and it does not exclude the possibility of compiling the reasoning in more compact form: as (Brown and Levinson, 1987) notice, \"there is a rational basis for conventions, too\"."
