        "A new generation of dialog systems should be viewed as learning systems rather than static models (Jokinen, 2000).",
        "Close-world and static approaches have tremendous limitations and often fail when the task becomes complex and the application environment and knowledge changes.",
        "Thus, the learning capability of a dialog system has become an important issue.",
        "It has been addressed in many different aspects including dynamic construction of mutual knowledge (Andersen et al., 1999), learning of speech acts (Stolcker et al., 1998), learning optimal strategies (Litman et al., 1998; Litman et al., 1999; Walker et al., 1998), collaborative agent in plan recognition (Lesh et al., 1999), etc.",
        "This paper addresses the dynamic user modeling and dialog-goal utility measurement to facilitate adaptive dialog behavior.",
        "For any dialog system dealing with a technical domain, such as repair support (Weis, 1997), help-desk support, etc, it is crucial for the system not only to pay attention to the user knowledge and experience level and dialog goals, but more important, to have certain mechanisms that adapt the system behavior in terms of action planning, content selection, and content realization to user cognitive limitations.",
        "Dialog strategies and management should be adjusted to the evolving state of the user.",
        "Thus a better understanding and modeling of user cognitive process and human perception is desirable.",
        "In this paper, we propose a methodology that automatically learns user experience levels based on sub-goal utilities and characteristics observed during the interaction.",
        "Those user levels will further feedback to update utility metrics and direct different dialog strategies at each level of dialog management: action planning, content selection and content realization.",
        "The Help-Desk is our application domain.",
        "This is a work in progress.",
        "We have built a prototype system and are currently in the process of evaluation of our methodology and hypotheses."

        "The problem space is modeled by an Acyclic Problem Graph structure, which represents the dialog goal (i.e., final goal) and different paths (solutions) to the final goal.",
        "The Level Adjusting Agent controls the initial detection and dynamic shifting of user expertise level based on the interactions with the user.",

        "It can also be considered as a forest containing joint trees that have overlapped root nodes and internal nodes.",
        "Internal nodes correspond to sub-goals.",
        "A path traversed from a root to a particular node contains a potential solution to a goal or sub-goal related to that node.",
        "Given a root node, the further away from the root, the greater is the complexity of the goal (or sub-goal) represented by a node.",
        "Since multiple paths can lead to a node, there could be multiple solutions to a goal.",
        "Figure 2 is a fragment of an acyclic graph for solving problems pertaining to a Windows based PC.",
        "In this example, three paths correspond to three potential solutions to the problem about how to set the display resolution of a monitor.",
        "Each node in the graph has the following fields: Concept Name, Remedy, and Utility Metrics that include Reward, Punishment, Best-case timeout and Worst-case timeout.",
        "Concept Name represents an instruction corresponding to a particular goal or sub-goal during the problem solving.",
        "For example, the concept of \"Display Properties\" node deals with manipulating the display of the monitor.",
        "Remedy is the template that is used to generate natural language responses and explanations corresponding to a particular goal.",
        "It also contains phrases and key terms used for language generation.",
        "Reward and Punishment are the utility metrics corresponding to each sub-goal (Winkler,",
        "1972) depending upon the hypothesis of uncertainty of understanding and the level of importance.",
        "Uncertainty of understanding implies the difficulty in following certain instructions or understanding certain concepts.",
        "For example, some technical terms require users to possess greater expertise in order to comprehend them.",
        "Some potential ways of initializing uncertainty of understanding are by observation, analysis of previously logged data, or surveys.",
        "The level of importance indicates the importance of the sub-goal for understanding an instruction or a concept towards the realization of the overall goal of solving the problem.",
        "One good indication of such importance, for example, in the Acyclic Problem Graph, is the branch factor of each node.",
        "A more difficult concept has a greater level of uncertainty and hence would lead to less punishment if the user does not understand it.",
        "On the other hand, if a user correctly understands a concept that has a high degree of uncertainty, he would be rewarded highly.",
        "Reward and punishment can be predetermined and then readjusted later when the user and the group modeling progresses.",
        "Timeout metrics are used to indicate whether the user understands the instruction or the concept associated with the sub-goal within the expected period of time.",
        "The hypothesis is that when a user has no problem of understanding a system instruction, the user is very likely to respond to the system rapidly.",
        "However, when the user has difficulties, he/she tends to spend more time on thinking and asking for help.",
        "There are two timeouts: best-case and worst-case.",
        "Each timeout has a reward and a punishment.",
        "Best-case time is the time expected by the system, in the best case, that a user would take to understand the instruction.",

        "There are three levels of user expertise that the dialog manager takes into consideration: Expert, Moderate and Novice.",
        "The agent controls the initial detection and dynamic shifting of user expertise level based on interactions with the user.",
        "If a user is using the system for the first time, a good indication of the initial user expertise level is the level of detail and technical complexity of the initial query.",
        "As user's interaction with the system continues, a profile of the user is constructed gradually.",
        "This profile could be reused to set the initial user expertise when the user uses the system again.",
        "The dynamic shifting of user expertise level is of two kinds: local (i.e., temporary) shifting between local expertise levels and accumulated (i.e., long term) shifting between accumulated expertise levels.",
        "Local shifting adjusts the expertise level temporarily - by observing the user confirmation (currently an explicit user confirmation is expected) which indicates whether he/she understands a certain instruction.",
        "The reason for temporary adjustment is because we assume that the user is having trouble understanding only this particular instruction and not the overall solution.",
        "The accumulated shifting permanently adjusts the user expertise level depending upon two threshold values: EXPERT LEVEL and NOVICE_LEVEL.",
        "The user is considered an expert when his accumulated expertise level is above the EXPERT LEVEL and is considered",
        "novice when that is below the NOVICE LEVEL.",
        "The user is assumed to have moderate expertise if he lies between these two thresholds.",
        "An accumulated value (ACCUM VALUE) is calculated based on the whole dialog history.",
        "If the ACCUM VALUE of a user crosses a threshold, the accumulated user expertise level changes long term as it is assumed that there is a change in the user's overall understanding of the solution.",
        "At any point of the interaction, the system maintains ACCUM VALUE for the user.",
        "This value is used to adjust the user expertise level.",
        "The ACCUM _VALUE is calculated based on the following set of features associated with utility metrics in each node in the discourse history (Wies, 1997; Jameson et al., 1999): Sub-goal Complexity: More complex sub-goals have a greater level of importance and uncertainty of understanding, and thus have a high reward and a low punishment.",
        "Similarly, comparably simple sub-goals have a low reward and a high punishment.",
        "Accomplishing Time: this is perhaps the trickiest parameter as the chance of making an incorrect assumption is much higher.",
        "The user response time could be a good indication of user understanding.",
        "The longer the resolving of the user's problems lasts, the more unfavorable the evaluation is.",
        "Also if the user responds quickly, he is rewarded for it.",
        "To detect whether the user is distracted or not, if a series of timeouts occur continuously, the user is not paying attention to the system.",
        "Response Complexity: There is a reward and a punishment associated with each system response that reflects the complexity of the content and realization of the system responses.",
        "First of all, the content for response generation varies with different expertise levels.",
        "For novice users, all the content on the solution path will be generated as several turns of responses based on the number of sub-goals in the path.",
        "For expert users, only 40% content on the solution path (toward the final goal) is used for the generation as one response.",
        "Furthermore, for users with different expertise level, the Content Realization Module will generate system responses (in the prototype system, the system responses are mainly instructions that guide users to solve a help-desk problem) with different levels of syntactic complexity and technical details.",
        "For example, for novice users, the system tends to generate responses with single instruction corresponding to one sub-goal, while for expert users, the system tends to generate responses with single instruction corresponding to multiple sub-goals on the solution path.",
        "The response with multiple instructions will have higher reward and lower punishment than those are associated with single instruction.",
        "Thus the user who gives a positive confirmation to a more complex system response will be rewarded higher than those who understand a simple system response.",
        "Based on the above factors, the ACCUM_VALUE can be calculated depending upon the conditions using the following formulae:",
        "ffresponse complexity (reward, punishment), sub-goal(reward, punishment) , timeout(reward, punishment)] In the prototype system, we have used the following: If a goal is accomplished by the user(indicated by positive user confirmation),",
        "If a goal is not accomplished(indicated by negative user confirmation),",
        "If a goal is accomplished before best-time timeout value,",
        "Other variations of the formula are expected to be explored in the future.",
        "The Action Planner identifies the final goal node in the Acyclic Problem Graph and finds the optimal path to it.",
        "The optimal path is selected based on the path utility function.",
        "The utility of a path in the graph is the summation of the reward/punishment ratio of all the nodes (sub-goals) in that path.",
        "Path utility (start-node, goal) = E (r / pi) n where i is a concept node in the path from the start node to the goal node, r, is the reward and pi is the punishment of the corresponding node i.",
        "The number of nodes n in the path acts as the normalizing factor.",
        "Thus for a given path, higher its path utility, greater is the difficulty to understand the concepts it contains and thus higher is the level of expertise required.",
        "The following cooperative strategies are used: for an expert user, select the path that has the maximum path utility.",
        "For a novice, select the one with the minimum path utility since this is the one containing concepts easiest to understand and with more steps of instructions.",
        "For a moderate-experience user, select a path in between.",
        "(We are currently more focused on the experienced and novice users.)",
        "Content Selector is applied to select the appropriate nodes on the path to form the content of dialog.",
        "A set of users having very similar expertise levels can be classified as a group.",
        "A Utility Updating Agent dynamically updates utility metrics of sub-goals in the Acyclic Problem Graph based on the group interactions with the system.",
        "For example, Group A has a reward of +50 and a punishment of –10 assigned to the sub-goal with associated concept of Display Properties.",
        "However the agent notices that the majority of the group understand the corresponding instruction very quickly without going into the sub-goal resolution, then the agent decreases the reward to +35 and increases the punishment to –25.",
        "This dynamic retraining of utility metrics in sub-goals would reflect the evolving user experience level as a whole and would improve the robustness of the dialog manager."
