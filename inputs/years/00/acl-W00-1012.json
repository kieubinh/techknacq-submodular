        "In the paper we describe an approach to dialogue management in the agreement negotiation where one of the central roles is attributed to the model of natural human reasoning.",
        "The reasoning model consists of the model of human motivational sphere, and of reasoning algorithms.",
        "The reasoning model is interacting with the model of communication process.",
        "The latter is considered as rational activity where central role play the concepts of communicative strategies and tactics.",
        "Introduction Several researches have modelled the process of argument negotiation in cooperative dialogue where one participant makes a proposal to another participant and as the result of negotiation this is accepted or rejected.",
        "Chu-Carroll and Carberry (1998) present a cooperative response-generation model as a recursive cycle Propose-Evaluate-Modify.",
        "They concentrate on dialogues of information sharing and negotiation.",
        "An information sharing dialogue is started, when the agent recognised a turn of his/her partner as a proposal, but does not have enough information to decide whether to accept it or not.",
        "A negotiation dialogue is started, when the agent concludes that the proposal is in conflict with his/her beliefs and preferences, i.e. tends to reject it.",
        "Heeman and Hirst (1995) model cooperation by the cycle Present-Judge-Refashion.",
        "They use two levels of modelling planning and cooperation.",
        "On the first level utterances are generated and interpreted, on the second level the cooperation of agents is modelled, relating it to agent's mental states and planning processes.",
        "The Shared Plans cooperation model deals with planning processes in which participate multiple agents, see Lochbaum (1998).",
        "The model concentrates on group tasks that can be divided into separate, but interacting subtasks, and the central problem is coordination of intentions and goals of partners.",
        "Di Eugenio et al.",
        "(2000) present a model BalanceProposeDispose: first, the relevant information concerning the task is considered and discussed, then a proposal is made and, lastly, the decision concerning the proposal is made it is accepted or rejected.",
        "In our model we depart from the same type of situation.",
        "One agent, A, addresses another agent, B, with the intention that B will carry out an action D. After some negotiation, B agrees or rejects the proposal.",
        "In this paper we concentrate on the problems connected with modelling participants as conversation agents who are able to participate in negotiation in the form of natural dialogue dialogue that is carried out in natural language and according to the rules of human communication.",
        "Such a dialogue can be considered as rational behaviour which is based on beliefs, wants and intentions of agents, at the same time being restricted by their resources, see Jokinen (1995), Webber (2000).",
        "Conversation agent is a kind of intelligent agent a computer program that is able to communicate with humans as another human being.",
        "As it is generally accepted, in a model of conversation agent it is necessary to represent its cognitive states as well as cognitive processes.",
        "One of the most well-known models of this type is the BDI model, see Allen (1994).",
        "Our main point in this paper is that the general concepts of cognitive states and processes used in BDI-type models should be extended in order to include certain factors from human motivational sphere and certain social principles in order to guarantee naturalness of dialogues of the type we are concerned with.",
        "This is especially important in connection with the fact that interest in modelling cooperative dialogues where partners are pursuing a common goal has considerably increased in recent years.",
        "On the one hand, this is connected with rapid spreading of Internet-based services.",
        "On the other hand, the interest in models of full natural dialogue derives from the possibility of building speech interfaces with different knowledge and databases, see Dybkjwr (2000).",
        "Both of these developments broaden the concept of naturalness of dialogue considerably and present to it much stronger requirements concerning its empirical adequacy as it has been generally accepted thus far."

        "In our model a conversation agent, A, is a program that consists of 6 (interacting) modules: A = (PL, PS, DM, INT, GEN, LP), where PL planner, PS problem solver, DM dialogue manager, INT interpreter, GEN generator, LP linguistic processor.",
        "PL directs the work of both DM and PS, where DM controls communication process and PS solves domain-related tasks.",
        "The task of INT is to make semantic analysis of partner's utterances and that of GEN is to generate semantic representations of agent's own contributions.",
        "LP carries out linguistic analysis and generation.",
        "Conversation agent uses in its work goal base GB and knowledge base KB.",
        "In our model, KB consists of 4 components: KB = (KBw, KBL, KBD, KBs), where KBw contains world knowledge, KBL linguistic knowledge, KBD knowledge about dialogue and KBs knowledge about interacting subjects.",
        "For instance, KBD contains definitions of communicative acts, turns and transactions (declarative knowledge), and algorithms that are applied to reach communicative goals communicative strategies and tactics (procedural knowledge); KBs contains knowledge about evaluative dispositions of participants towards the world (e.g. what do they consider as pleasant or unpleasant, useful or harmful), and, on the other hand, algorithms that are used to generate plans for acting on the world.",
        "A necessary precondition of a communicative interaction is existence of shared (mutual) knowledge of interacting agents.",
        "This concerns goal bases as well as all types of knowledge bases; the intersections of the corresponding bases of interacting agents A and B cannot be empty: GBA n GBB 0, KBAw n KBBW 0, KBAL n KBBL 0, KBAD n KBBD 0, KB ABS KBBs *0,BKB As n KBAS 0.",
        "In this paper we will consider a specific type of dialogue where the communicative goal of agent A is to get agent B to agree to carry out an action D so-called agreement negotiation dialogue.",

        "A dialogue participant chooses his/her responses to the parter's communicative acts as a result of certain reasoning process.",
        "After A has made B a proposal to do D, B can respond with agreement or rejection, depending on the result of his/her reasoning.",
        "Because we consider the model of natural human reasoning as one of the important components in attaining naturalness of dialogue as a whole, we will discuss our model of reasoning in some detail.",
        "From the point of view of practical NLP the approach we will present below may seem too abstract.",
        "But without solid theoretical basis it will appear impossible to guarantee naturalness of dialogues carried out by computers with human users.",
        "We think that the model we describe here can be taken as a basis for the corresponding discussion.",
        "Our model is not based on any scientific theory of how human reasoning proceeds; our aim is to model a \"naive theory of reasoning\" which humans follow in everyday life when trying to understand, predict and influence other persons' decisions and behavior, see Koit and Oim (2000).",
        "The reasoning model consists of two functionally linked parts: 1) a model of human motivational sphere; 2) reasoning schemes.",
        "In the motivational sphere three basic factors that regulate reasoning of a subject concerning D are differentiated.",
        "First, subject may wish to do D, if pleasant aspects of 13 for him/her overweight unpleasant ones; second, subject may find reasonable to do D, if D is needed to reach some higher goal, and useful aspects of D overweight harmful ones; and third, subject can be in a situation where he/she must (is obliged) to do D if not doing D will lead to some kind of punishment.",
        "We call these factors wish-, needed and must-factors, respectively.",
        "For instance, in reasoning about some action D (e.g. proposed by another agent-, an agent as an individual subject typically starts with checking his/her wish-factor, i.e. whether D's pleasant aspects overweight unpleasant ones.",
        "If this holds, then the subject checks his/her resources, and if these exist, proceeds to other positive and negative aspects of D: its usefulness and harmfulness, and if D is prohibited, then also possible punishment(s).",
        "If the positive aspects in sum overweight negative ones, the resulting decision will be to do D, otherwise not to do D. There can exist other typical situations.",
        "If the agent is an \"official\" person, or a group of subjects formed to fulfil certain tasks and/or to pursue certain pre-established goal(s), then typically the starting point of reasoning is needed and/or must-factor.",
        "This means that there exist certain general principles that determine how the reasoning process proceeds.",
        "These principles depend, in part, on the type of the reasoning agent.",
        "Before starting to construct a concrete reasoning model the types of agents involved should be established.",
        "In our implementation the agent is supposed to be a \"simple\" human being and the actions under consideration are from everyday life.",
        "In this case as examples of such principles used in our model we can present the following ones.",
        "For more details, see Oim (1996).",
        "P1.",
        "People prefer pleasant (more pleasant) states to unpleasant (less pleasant) ones.",
        "P2.",
        "People don't take an action of which they don't assume that its consequence will be a pleasant (useful) situation, or avoidance of an unpleasant (harmful) situation.",
        "The following principles illustrate more concrete (operational) rules.",
        "P3.",
        "In assessing an action D the values of (internal wish and needed) factors are checked before the external (must) factors.",
        "P4.",
        "If D is found pleasant enough (i.e. D's pleasant aspects overweight unpleasant ones), then the needed and must-factors will first be checked from the point of view of their negative aspects (\"to what harmful consequences or punishments D would lead?').",
        "The rule P4 explains, for example, why in Figure 1 step 1 is immediately followed by step 2.",
        "The weights of different aspects of D (pleasantness, unpleasantness, usefulness, harmfulness, punishment for doing a prohibited action or not-doing an obligatory action) must be summed up in some way.",
        "Thus, in a computational model weights must have numerial values.",
        "In reality people do not operate with numbers but, rather, with some fuzzy sets.",
        "On the other hand, existence of certain scales also in human everyday reasoning is apparent.",
        "For instance, for the characterisation of pleasant and unpleasant aspects of some action there are specific words: enticing, delightful, enjoyable, attractive, acceptable, unattractive, displeasing, repulsive etc.",
        "Each of these adjectives can be expressed quantitatively.",
        "This presupposes empirical studies, though.",
        "We have represented the model of motivational sphere by the following vector of weights:",
        "Here Di, ..., Dn represent human actions; w(resourcesA 13)=1, if A has resources necessary to do D, (otherwise 0); w(obligatoryAN)=1, if D, is obligatory for A (otherwise 0); w(prohibitedAD)=1, if Di is prohibited for A (otherwise 0).",
        "The values of other weights are non-negative natural numbers.",
        "The second part of the reasoning model consists of reasoning schemas, that supposedly regulate human action-oriented reasoning.",
        "A reasoning scheme represents steps that the agent goes through in his reasoning process; these consist in computing and comparing the weights of",
        "different aspects of D; and the result is the decision to do or not to do D. Figure 1 presents the reasoning scheme that departs from the wish of a subject to do D. The scheme also illustrates one of the general principles referred to above.",
        "It explains the order the steps are taken by the reasoning agent: if a subject is in a state where he/she wishes to do D, then he/she checks first the harmful/useful aspects of D, and after this proceeds to aspects connected with possible punishments.",
        "If yes then to do .D else not to do D. 9) Is D prohibited?",
        "If not then to do D.",
        "If yes then to do D else not to do D.",
        "from the wish of a subject to do D. The prerequisite for triggering this reasoning procedure is w(pleas) > w(unpleas), which is based on the following assumption: if a person wishes to do something, then he/she assumes that the pleasant aspects of D (including its consequences) overweigh its unpleasant aspects.",
        "The same kinds of reasoning schemes are constructed for the needed and must-factors.",
        "The reasoning model is connected with the general model of conversation agent in the following way.",
        "First, the planner PL makes use of reasoning schemes and second, the KBs contains the vector wA (A's subjective evaluations of all possible actions) as well as vectors wAB (A's beliefs concerning B's evaluations, where B denotes agents A may communicate with).",
        "The vector wAB do not represent truthful knowledge, it is used as a partner model.",
        "When comparing our model with BDI model, then beliefs are represented by knowledge of the conversation agent with reliability less than 1; desires are generated by the vector of weights WA; and intentions correspond to goals in GB.",
        "In addition to desires, from the weights vector we also can derive some parameters of the motivational sphere that are not explicitly covered by the basic BDI model: needs, obligations and prohibitions.",
        "Some wishes or needs can be stronger than others: if w(pleasAD,) - w(unpleasAD) > w(pleasApi) - w(unpleasADj), then the wish to do D, is stronger than the wish to do A.",
        "In the same way, some obligations (prohibitions) can be stronger than others, depending on the weight of the corresponding punishment.",
        "It should be mentioned that adding obligations to the standard BDI model is not new.",
        "Traum and Allen (1994) show how discourse obligations can be used to account in a natural manner for the connection between a question and its answer in dialogue and how obligations can be used along with other parts of the discourse context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system."

Communicative tactics are directly related to the reasoning process of the partner.",

        "Conclusion At present there exists implemented program which can play the role of both A and B in a simple communication situation where the goal of A is that B would decide to do D. At the moment the computer operates with semantic representations of linguistic input/output only, the surface linguistic part of interaction is provided in the form of a list of possible utterances.",
        "The work on linguistic processor is in progress.",
        "We have deliberately concentrated on modelling the processes of reasoning of conversation agents, as these processes form the heart of the \"cognitive\" part of human communication, and on modelling the use of communicative strategies and tactics which constitute the \"social\" part of communication.",
        "Although the concepts and models we have reported in the paper may seem too abstract from the point of view of practical NLP, we are convinced that without serious study and modelling of cognitive and social aspects of human communication it will appear impossible to guarantee naturalness of dialogues carried out by a computer system with a human user.",
        "As we have so far mostly dealt with agreement negotiation dialogues, we have planned as one of the practical applications of the system as a participant in communication training sessions.",
        "Here the system can, for instance, establish certain restrictions on argument types, on the order in the use of arguments and counterarguments, etc.",
        "Second, we have started to work, using our experience in modelling cognitive and social aspects of dialogue, on modelling information seeking dialogues in the same lines.",
        "This type of dialogue clearly will be the area where in the next few years already systems will be required that would be practically reliable, but at the same time could follow the rules of natural human communication."
