        "Document transformations is becoming a hot topic in industrial research on document creation.",
        "The reason is practical: with the new presentation possibilities, the advantages of being able to adapt the 'same' document content to different uses - where the difference can lie in the support devices, audiences, languages or modes of interaction - becomes very attractive.",
        "It not only becomes attractive, it also becomes necessary: one needs to present material in various contexts (oral presentations, internet portals, etc.)",
        "and it is very costly to develop presentations from scratch for these various contexts.",
        "This situation raises an old question and opens a new area of research: can one separate content from presentation?",
        "The philosophical answer might be 'no', but in practice one doesn't need an absolute answer.",
        "As this area of research arises more out of practical necessity than pure intellectual curiosity, the 1TRINDI(TaskOrientedInstructionalDialogue),ECProjectLE4-8314, vcre.ling.g-u.",
        "se/research/project s/trindi/ engineering is preceding the science and it will take some time before it rest on explicit solid foundations.",
        "Here we look only at one small aspect of the problem: how can we model small changes in presentation that are due to various degrees of interactivity between participants in instructional exchanges.",
        "We start from a traditional manual and make some assumptions about minimal interactivity which are modeled through dialogue moves.",
        "We conclude that in this way we can make the presentation of the material more flexible.",
        "An important limit on the flexibility is, however, the detail with which the discourse structure of the manual encodes the task plan underlying the activity."

        "difference between monologue and dialogue We take here the position that the main difference between dialogue and monologue is that the former implies interactivity.",
        "With interactivity we mean here that the participants can influence each other's moves.",
        "With respect to the area that interests us here, giving instructions to repair devices, a traditional written manual influences the user but not vice versa (except through notes to the author).",
        "The user can, however, influence the order in which she accesses the material: it is easy to stop, to go back or to consult an other section (traditional printed material might be argued to be better in that respect than presentation on a screen, we ignore that difference here).",
        "We can consider this as a limit case of interactivity.",
        "Note that interactivity does not necessarily imply shared initiative..",
        "The literature makes a distinction between task and dialogue initiative (e.g. (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998)) but one can have dialogue with both types of initiative staying with one side.",
        "In the cases we discuss below the task initiative stays completely with the manual and the dialogue initiative only switches to the instructee in the case where she can indicate that information about some subprocedures can be skipped.",
        "There is another dimension that often intervenes in discussions about the difference between dialogue and written discourse: the former is spoken, the latter is written.",
        "Given the way things are in a natural setting, the written medium tends not to allow interactivity, whereas the spoken medium is used mainly in interactive settings.",
        "Technical changes, however, allow us to separate the written/spoken opposition from that between interactive and non, or minimally, interactive discourse.",
        "Instructional material can be presented in the aural mode without becoming more interactive e.g. when a recording is played.",
        "This can be considered as a plus for instructional material because it allows the instructee to use her hands and eyes for the task itself but it is not an unqualified advantage given that reading gives much more flexibility than listening to a tape.",
        "To cash in on the advantages of the aural presentation, we need to recapture the flexibility of access that the written medium allows."

        "It is obvious that instructional situations profit from an interactive setting.",
        "Instructional situations are typically situations in which some participants (the instructors) know a lot that the other participants (the instructees) need to know to achieve the common goals.",
        "In these kinds of situations it is important that all the required and, preferably only the required, knowledge gets transferred at the moment the instructees need it.",
        "To achieve this, it is not enough that the instructor have all the necessary knowledge, she needs also to know which state the in-structee is in and how that state changes to adapt the transfer of knowledge, hence the instructee needs to be able to inform the instructor about his state and influence in this way the course of the interaction.",
        "Currently we have manuals, whose content can be presented aurally or in a written form but where both the content and the presentation are uniquely determined a priori (modulo, the speed and order of reading mentioned above).",
        "Or we have interactions that can be at a distance but where a human instructor needs to be available at the time of the action.",
        "Making humans with the required competence available is expensive and one would want to achieve some interactivity without this.",
        "But computers tend to be frustrating participants in interactive settings when one compares them to human beings and the study of dialogue concentrates mainly on making them as human as possible.",
        "When one considers the possibility of transferring the interactivity from humans to machines, there are, however, many intermediate possibilities between no interactivity and full blown interactivity in free-wheeling dialogue where the participants can ask each other questions about anything and nothing (for a more thorough discussion about dialogues between humans and computers see (Clark, 1999)).",
        "In this paper we consider how minimal interactions can be modeled on the basis of information which is available in traditional instructional manuals.",
        "In looking at the problem this way one has to keep in mind that instructional manuals, although not interactive, are cooperative constructs: they assume that they participate with the user in a rational cooperative task and they are built on an implicit reader model, specifically they make assumptions about what the user knows and what she doesn't know and the granularity of the task descriptions that they have to provide.",
        "They obey in their own way Grice's Maxim of Quantity but they need to leave open a range of possibilities so they need to provide more detail than is necessary in all circumstances.",
