        "Synonyms can be an important resource for Information Retrieval (IR) applications, and attempts have been made at using them to expand query terms (Voorhees, 1998).",
        "In expanding query terms, overgeneration is as much of a problem as incompleteness or lack of synonym resources.",
        "Precision can dramatically drop because of false hits due to incorrect synonymy relations.",
        "This problem is particularly felt when IR is applied to documents in specific technical domains.",
        "In such cases, the synonymy relations that hold in the specific domain are only a restricted portion of the synonymy relations holding for a given language at large.",
        "For instance, a set of synonyms like",
        "valid for English, would be detrimental in a specific domain like weather reports, where both snow and C (for Celsius) occur very frequently, but never as synonyms of each other.",
        "We describe a method for creating a domain specific synonym database from a general purpose one.",
        "We use WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) as our initial database, and we draw evidence from a domain specific corpus about what synonymy relations hold in the domain.",
        "Our task has obvious relations to word sense disambiguation (Sanderson, 1997) (Lea-cock et al., 1998), since both tasks are based on identifying senses of ambiguous words in a text.",
        "However, the two tasks are quite distinct.",
        "In word sense disambiguation, a set of candidate senses for a given word is checked against each occurrence of the relevant word in a text, and a single candidate sense is selected for each occurrence of the word.",
        "In our synonym specialization task a set of candidate senses for a given word is checked against an entire corpus, and a subset of candidate senses is selected.",
        "Although the latter task could be reduced to the former (by disambiguating all occurrences of a word in a test and taking the union of the selected senses), alternative approaches could also be used.",
        "In a specific domain, where words can be expected to be monosemous to a large extent, synonym pruning can be an effective alternative (or a complement) to word sense disambiguation.",
        "From a different perspective, our task is also related to the task of assigning Subject Field Codes (SFC) to a terminological resource, as done by Magnini and Cavaglia.",
        "(2000) for WordNet.",
        "Assuming that a specific domain corresponds to a single SFC (or a restricted set of SFCs, at most), the difference between SFC assignment and our task is that the former assigns one of many possible values to a given synset (one of all possible SFCs), while the latter assigns one of two possible values (the words belongs or does not belong to the SFC representing the domain).",
        "In other words, SFC assignment is a classification task, while ours can be seen as either a filtering or ranking task.",
        "Adopting a filtering/ranking perspective makes apparent that the synonym pruning task can also be seen as an eliminative process, and as such it can be performed incrementally.",
        "In the following section we will show how such characteristics have been exploited in performing the task.",
        "In section 2 we describe the pruning methodology, while section 3 provides a practical example from a specific domain.",
        "Conclusions are offered in section 4."

        "E.g. the synonymy between snow and C has a higher impact on the weather report domain (or the aviation domain, discussed in this paper) than the synonymy relation between cocaine and coke.",
        "Consequently, the precision of a synonym database obviously depends much more on frequently used relations than on rarely used ones.",
        "Another important consideration is that judging the correctness of a given synonymy relation in a given domain is often an elusive issue: besides clearcut cases, there is a large gray area where judgments may not be trivial even for humans evaluators.",
        "E.g. given the following three senses of",

        "The combination of the two remarks above induced us to consider a manual pruning phase for the terms of highest 'weight' as a good investment of human effort, in terms of rate between the achieved increase in precision and the amount of work involved.",
        "A second reason for performing an initial manual pruning is that its outcome can be used as a reliable test set against which automatic pruning algorithms can be tested.",
        "Based on such considerations, we included a manual phase in the pruning process, consisting of two steps: (i) the ranking of synonymy relations in terms of their weight in the specific domain; (ii) the actual evaluation of the correctness of the top ranking synonymy relation, by human evaluators."

        "polysemous terms are prioritized over monosemous terms.",
        "Criterion 2.",
        "The second and third sorting criteria are similar, the only difference being that the second criterion assumes the existence of some inventory of relevant queries (a term list, a collection of previous queries, etc.).",
        "If such an inventory is not available, the second sorting criterion can be omitted.",
        "If the inventory is available, it is used to check which synonymy relations are actually to be used in queries to the domain corpus.",

        "The above formula aims at estimating how often a given synonymy relation is likely to be actually used.",
        "In particular, each half of the formula estimates how often a given term in the corpus is likely to be matched as a synonym of a given term in a query.",

        "In the table, each term is followed by its corpus frequency, separated by a slash.",
        "From each synset the word C itself has been removed, as well as the gloss words found in the stop list.",
        "Therefore, the table only contains the words that contribute to the calculation of the sense's score.",
        "E.g. the score for the first sense in the list is obtained from the following expression:",
        "The third sense in the list exemplifies the case of an empty synset (i.e. a synset originally containing only the word under consideration).",
        "In this case the score obtained from the gloss is doubled.",
        "Note that the obviously incorrect sense of C as a narcotic is in the middle of the list.",

        "Pruning is performed on the top section of the ranking list that guarantees the required precision, according to the correlation between precision and amount of pruning shown in figure 1.",
        "A second test was designed to check whether there is a correlation between the levels of confidence of automatic and manual pruning.",
        "For this purpose we used the file that had been manually checked by both human evaluators.",
        "We took into account the candidates that had been removed by at least one evaluator: the candidates that were removed by both evaluators were deemed to have a high level of confidence, while those removed by only one evaluator were deemed to have a lower level of confidence.",
        "Then we checked whether the two classes were equally distributed in the automatic pruning ranking list, or whether higher confidence candidates tended to be ranked higher than lower confidence ones.",
        "The results are shown in figure 2, where the automatic pruning recall for each class is shown.",
        "For any given portion of the ranking list higher confidence candidates (solid lines) have a significantly higher recall than lower confidence candidates (dot",
        "ted line).",
        "Finally, table 3 shows the result of applying the described optimization techniques alone, i.e. without any prior pruning, with respect to the ASRS corpus.",
        "The table shows how many synsets and how many word-senses are contained in the full Wordnet database and in its optimized version.",
        "Note that such reduction does not involve any loss of accuracy."

        "There is a need for automatically or semi-automatically adapting NLP components to specific domain, if such components are to be effectively used in IR applications without involving labor-intensive manual adaptation.",
        "A key part of adapting NLP components to specific domains is the adaptation of their lexical and terminological resources.",
        "It may often be the case that a consistent section of a general purpose terminological resource is irrelevant to a specific domain, thus involving an unnecessary amount of ambiguity that affects both the accuracy and efficiency of the overall NLP component.",
        "In this paper we have proposed a method for adapting a general purpose synonym database to a specific domain.",
        "Evaluating the performance of the proposed pruning method is not a straightforward task, since there are no other results available on a similar task, to the best of our knowledge.",
        "However, a comparison between the results of manual and automatic pruning provides some useful hints.",
        "In particular: • The discrepancy between the evaluation of human operators shows that the task is elusive even for humans (the value of the agreement evaluation statistic n for our human evaluators was 0.5); • however, the correlation between the level of confidence of human evaluations and scores assigned by the automatic pruning procedure shows that the automatic pruning algorithm captures some significant aspect of the problem.",
        "Although there is probably room for improving the automatic pruning performance, the preliminary results show that the current approach is pointing in the right direction."
