        "The main problem with the traditional boolean word-based approach to Information Retrieval (IR) is that it usually returns too many results or wrong results to be useful.",
        "Keywords have often multiple lexical functionalities (i.e. can have various parts of speech) or have several semantic senses.",
        "Also, relevant information can be missed by not specifying the exact keywords.",
        "The solution is to include more information in the documents to be indexed, such as to enable a system to retrieve documents based on the words, regarded as lexical strings, or based on the semantic meaning of the words.",
        "With this idea in mind, we designed an IR system which performs a combined word-based and sense-based indexing and retrieval.",
        "The inputs to IR systems consist of a question/query and a set of documents from which the information has to be retrieved.",
        "We add lexical and semantic information to both the query and the documents, during a preprocessing phase in which the input question and the texts are disambiguated.",
        "The disambiguation process relies on contextual information, and identify the meaning of the words based on WordNet 1 (Fellbaum, 1998) senses.",
        "As described in the fourth section, we have opted for a disambiguation algorithm which is semi-complete (it disambiguates about 55% of the nouns and verbs), but is highly precise (over 92% accuracy), instead of using a complete but less precise disambiguation.",
        "A part of speech tag is also appended to each word.",
        "After adding these lexical and semantic tags to the words, the documents are ready to be indexed: the index is created using the words as lexical strings (to ensure a word-based retrieval), and the semantic tags (for the sense-based retrieval).",
        "Once the index is created, an input query is answered using the document retrieval component of our system.",
        "First, the query is fully disambiguated; then, it is adapted to a specific format which incorporates semantic information, as found in the index, and uses the AND and OR operators implemented in the retrieval module.",
        "Hence, using semantic indexing, we try to solve the two main problems of the IR systems described earlier.",
        "(1) relevant information is not missed by not specifying the exact keywords; with the new tags added to the words, we also retrieve words which are semantically related to the input keywords; (2) using the sense-based component of our retrieval sys",
        "tem, the number of results returned from a search can be reduced, by specifying exactly the lexical functionality and/or the meaning of an input keyword.",
        "The system was tested using the Gran-field standard test collection.",
        "This collection consists of 1400 documents, SGML formated, from the aerodynamics field.",
        "From the 225 questions associated with this data set, we have randomly selected 50 questions and build for each of them three types of queries: (1) a query that uses only keywords selected from the question, stemmed using the WordNet stemmer2; (2) a query that uses the keywords from the question and the synsets 3 for these keywords and (3) a query that uses the keywords from the question, the synsets for these keywords and the synsets for the keywords hypernyms.",
        "All these types of queries have been run against the semantic index described in this paper.",

        "The success rate obtained in the case of conceptual indexing was 60%, respect to a maximum of 45% obtained using other retrieval systems.",
        "This is a significant improvement and shows that semantics can have a strong impact on the effectiveness of IR systems.",
        "The experiments described in (Woods, 1997) refer to small collections of text, as for example the Unix manual pages (about 10MB of text).",

        "For a given noun N in the text, determine the noun-context of each of its senses.",
        "This noun-context is actually a list of nouns which can occur within the context of a given sense i of the noun N. In order to form the noun-context for every sense we are determining all the concepts in the hyper-nym synsets of Ni.",

        "Find words which are semantically connected to the already disambiguated words for which the connection distance is 0.",
