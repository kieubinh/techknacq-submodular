        "We can confirm that a term is good to discriminate subject concepts if relevant documents contain such terms and non-relevant documents do not contain them and that a term is noisy if the situation is the opposite.",
        "The problem here is that not only noisy terms but also good terms can harm the performance in some cases where term weighting is not adequate or terms are redundant.",
        "One example of such cases is complex terms like supplemental phrases or overlap bigrams which violate term independence assumption.",
        "Phrasal terms are utilized either as replacement of single words or as supplemental units for single words, but according to our experience, phrasal terms as replacement of single words do not perform well.",
        "Supplemental phrasal terms works better in spite of the violation of term independence assumption.",
        "Recent studies uncovered the correlation between phrase effectiveness and query length(Fujita, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we will see the problem of effectiveness of phrasal terms from two different viewpoints utilizing a large test collection for Japanese text retrieval and statistical tools.",
        "NACSIS test collection 1 (NTCIR, 1999), which consists of a collection of abstracts of scientific papers ( 330,000 records, 590MB in text ), two sets of topic description ( 30 topics for training and 53 topics for evaluation ) and relevance judgement, provides us of a good opportunity for this purpose.",

        "<description> fields consist of one ( typically simple ) sentence.",
        "<narrative> fields consist of 3 to 12 sentences and contain detailed explanation of the topic, term definition, background knowledge, purpose of the search, preference in text types, criteria of relevance judgement and so on.",
