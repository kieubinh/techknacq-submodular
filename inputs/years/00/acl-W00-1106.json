        "There have been two different methods for compound noun indexing: statistical and linguistic.",

        "(Strza-lkowski et al., 1996; Evans and Zhai, 1996) indexed subcompounds from complex noun phrases using noun-phrase analysis.",
        "These methods need to find the head-modifier relations from noun phrases and therefore require difficult syntactic parsing in Korean.",
        "For Korean, in one statistical method, (Lee and Ahn, 1996) indexed general Korean nouns using n-grams without linguistic knowledge and the experiment results showed that the proposed method might be almost as effective as the linguistic noun indexing.",
        "However, this method can generate many spurious n-grams which decrease the precision in search performance.",
        "In linguistic methods, (Kim, 1994) used five manually chosen compound noun indexing rule patterns based on linguistic knowledge.",
        "However, this method cannot index the diverse types of compound nouns.",
        "(Won et al., 2000) used a full parser and increased the precision in search experiments.",
        "However, this linguistic method cannot be applied to unrestricted texts robustly.",
        "In summary, the previous methods, whether they are statistical or linguistic, have their own shortcomings.",
        "Statistical methods require significant amounts of co-occurrence information for reasonable performance and can not index the diverse types of compound nouns.",
        "Linguistic methods need compound noun indexing rules described by human and sometimes result in meaningless compound nouns, which decreases the performance of information retrieval systems.",
        "They cannot also cover the various types of compound nouns because of the limitation of human linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid method that uses linguistic rules but these rules are automatically acquired from a large corpus through statistical learning.",
        "Our method generates more diverse compound noun indexing rule patterns than the previous standard methods (Kim, 1994; Lee et al., 1997), because previous methods use only most general rule patterns (shown in Table 2) and are based solely on human linguistic knowledge.",
