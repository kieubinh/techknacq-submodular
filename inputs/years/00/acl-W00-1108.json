        "With the current explosive growth of Internet usage, the demand for fast and useful access to online data is increasing.",

        "There are many applications for text categorization, including information retrieval, text routing, text filtering and text understanding systems.",
        "The text categorization systems use predefined categories to label new documents.",
        "Many different approaches have been applied to this task, including nearest neighbor classifiers (Masand, Linoff and Waltz, 1992; Yang, 1994; Lam and Ho, 1998; Yang, 1999), Bayesian independence classifiers (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994; Baker and McCallum, 1998; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), decision trees (Fuhr et al., 1991; Lewis and Ringuette, 1994; Apte et al., 1998), induction rule learning (Apte et al., 1994; Cohen and Singer, 1996; Mouilinier et al., 1996), neural networks (Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend, 1995; Ng, Goh and Low, 1997), and support vector machines (Joachims, 1998).",
        "These categorization algorithms have been applied to many different subject domains, usually news stories (Apte et al., 1994; Lewis and Ringuette, 1994; Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend, 1995; Yang, 1999), but also physics abstracts (Fuhr et al., 1991), and medical texts (Yang and Chute, 1994).",
        "In this research to resolve the task of text categorization we apply a method of text summarization, that is, combining word-based frequency and position method to get categorization knowledge from the title field only.",
        "Experimental results indicate that summarization-based categorization can achieve acceptable performance on Reuters news corpus.",
        "Additionally, the computation time for the title field is very short.",
        "Thus, this system is appropriate for online document classifier.",

        "The task of summarization is to identify informative evidence from a given document, which are most relevant to its content and create a shorter version of summary of the document from this information.",
        "The informative evidence associated with techniques used in summarization may also provide clues for text categorization to determine the appropriate category of the document.",
        "Several techniques for text summarization have been reported in the literature, including methods based on position (Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997), cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Mahesh, 1997), word frequency (Teufel and Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997).",
        "Of the above approaches, both word frequency and position methods are easy to implement.",
        "In this research we combine these two approaches to investigate the efforts for categorization.",
        "In regard to the position method, Hovy and Lin (1997) considered the title is the most likely to bear topics.",
        "They claim words in titles are positively relevant to summarization.",
        "Teufel and Moens (1997) also confirmed this viewpoint; they mentioned that words in the title are good candidates for document specific concepts.",
        "They showed 21.7% recall and precision, when the title method is used alone, with an increased performance of 3%, when combined with other methods.",
        "Furthermore, from observation of the TREC evaluation during recent years, it has been shown that there is no significant difference between short and long query.",
        "It seems reasonable to acquire informative clues from the title, still not degrading the categorization performance severely."
