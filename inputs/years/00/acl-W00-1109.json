        "The amount of information available electronically in a free-text format is ever increasing.",
        "People require tools that give them the best possible answer to their queries even when a full answer may not be available.",
        "Current web Information Retrieval (IR) engines standardly retrieve URLs to whole documents, and typical user queries are just an unordered set of keywords.",
        "This is robust and allows unrestricted queries, but precision can be poor, and the output is not particularly convenient for many queries.",
        "For example, if we are interested in e.g. companies associated with Mr. Jones, we are likely to prefer an output in terms of an alphabetically ordered list of companies (with links to the sentences in which they appear) rather than a list of URLs.",
        "Information Extraction (IE) systems provide better presentation of results (e.g. tables, database records etc.",
        "), and tend to include more precise searches which depend upon not just finding keywords but finding them in particular positions or in particular grammatical relationships.",
        "However, current IE systems typically require queries to be programmed beforehand, so are suitable only for cases where the same query is to be used time and again e.g. in the processing of a newsfeed.",
        "Customisation of an IE system involves two major tasks:",
        "• adapting the information extraction system to a new domain, e.g. adding vocabulary, new grammatical constructions and domain ontology.",
        "• creating new patterns for extraction in the new domain.",
        "Customising current IE systems is thus expensive.",
        "A domain expert and a linguist with knowledge of the IE system will generally be required to specify the task, manually mark-up or categorise domain data, perhaps build a domain ontology, write extraction patterns and fine-tune them for the best compromise of precision and recall.",
        "There are thus pressing reasons for automating the customisation task and reducing the involvement of linguists as much as possible.",
        "Several methods of automatically inferring patterns and semantic dictionaries from annotated texts have been suggested, e.g. (Riloff, 1993; Riloff, 1996; Sonderland et al., 1995; Yangarber and Grishman, 1997).",
        "Pierce and Cardie (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) suggest that the use of annotated texts can be replaced by an interactive approach in which an end-user assists the system in bootstrapping patterns from a set of example results.",
        "However even this method is ill suited to one-off queries, where the user is unlikely to start from example results, but needs to be able to interactively home in on a set of answers.",
        "In this paper we describe a system which enables users to build advanced on-the-fly queries.",
        "The interface is intended to be intuitive for users already familiar with keyword IR but adds the extra functionality of sortal, linguistic and positional constraints that are more common in IE.",
        "Adding extra linguistic constraints may improve precision, and cause a drop in recall, in exactly the same way as adding an extra non-optional keyword.",
        "The approach is less ambitious than providing full Natural Language querying, but allows",
        "professional users of search technology (e.g. analysts or research scientists) to get most of the advantages of IE without having to program patterns.",
        "We assume that retraining of linguistic components (such as the tokeniser and tagger) for a new domain will still be performed by a linguist/programmer, and that end-users will be supplied with libraries of useful sorts such as person names, companies, locations, protein names etc.",
        "which are appropriate for their domain."

        "Our key interest in this work was to provide a system which allowed users to get answers: not just documents or sub-documents.",
        "We have not addressed the question of whether or not these techniques would also be useful for more traditional IR, in the sense of finding the most relevant document for a particular query.",
        "There is some potential since there are extra options to refine or expand a query e.g. using sortal constraints such as company and location, and restrictive constraints such as subject_of or same sentence.",
        "Since the linguistic constraints are under user control the query is more likely to be accurate than in systems where linguistic constraints are derived from a natural language query (though at the expense of usability).",
        "The system was designed to deal with multiple answer queries such as \"which protein interacts with TAF-2?\".",
        "This differs somewhat from the TREC question answering track ((TREC), 2000), where the emphasis is on questions which have a single answer, and systems attempt to provide the most relevant sub-document.",
        "To attempt the TREC task we would need to extend the system with a relevance weighting mechanism, and provide further techniques for query expansion.",
        "We would then expect the system to do well, since (Srihari and Li, 1999) show that the use of sortal constraints such as company, location and time plus constraints such as same sentence give good results, even with a relatively simple ranking mechanism.",
        "How much extra cost is involved in using linguistic information?",
        "There is obviously some initial cost in parsing and analysing the texts, however this can largely be hidden by preprocessing the documents.",
        "In addition there is a space cost in having a much larger index: this is necessary since we are keeping more information about the document's structure.",
        "Finally, there is the cost of evaluating more complex constraints.",
        "The cost of using sortal constraints is negligible: we can index them in exactly the same way as words.",
        "However,",
        "relational constraints such as same sentence do introduce extra processing.",
        "The figures we present at the end of this paper show that this first implementation of the system is fast enough to be usable for some real applications (and very fast by Information Extraction standards), but is not yet in the same league as standard IR engines."

        "For example, the logical form P(a,b) is represented by the set of constraints given in Figure 1.",
        "This approach aims to combine the advantages of shallow pattern-matching approaches (which are fast and robust) with those of deeper analysis which tends to do better for phenomena which involve scope.",

        "A simple pattern matching approach looking for [flight] to [location] via [location] would extract the wrong information since it has no notion of the scope of the negation.",
        "In this work we take the same idea, but apply it to Information Extraction.",
        "Sets of indexed constraints (which are themselves partial descriptions of semantic structure) are used directly as search expressions.",
        "Since the indexed constraints can encode full semantic structures, the search terms can be more or less specific: we can start with just constraints on lexical items, and then build up to a full semantic structure by adding structural con",
        "straints.",
        "Search is now a question of expressing the appropriate constraints on the information to be extracted.",
        "For example, Figure 2 is a sketch rule to extract departure time from a sentence such as \"I leave at 3pm.\"",
        "The rule subsumes a range of rules which vary in the specificity with which they apply.",
        "For example, applying only the obligatory conditions will result in the extraction of 3pm as departure time from sentences such as \"I leave Cambridge to arrive at 3pm\" since in the obligatory component there is no restriction on M with respect to T, i.e. the leave event and the time.",
        "Adding the optional constraints in (1) gives us the restriction that the leaving must be dominated by the preposition at, e.g. \"I leave from the station at 3pm,\" and (2) requires immediate dominance: \"I leave at 3pm.\"",
        "This ranges from pattern matching to almost full semantics.",
        "Any particular application of a rule can be scored according to the number of optional conditions which are fulfilled, thereby using linguistic constraints if they are available.",
        "In practice, the system described here departs from this approach in several respects.",
        "Firstly, we were working with the preexisting Highlight system which uses shallow syntactic processing based on cascaded patterns (similar to (Hobbs et al., 1996)).",
        "Deriving semantic relationships from this is not particularly reliable, so it is preferable to use search terms which rely more on positional clues.",
        "We therefore used a distributed syntactic representation to provide more reliable syntactic constraints (e.g. head word of, subject of, same sentence) augmented by positional constraints (e.g. precedes, immediately precedes).",

        "Keyword based search is a special case where the user specifies one or more keywords which they want to find in a document.",
        "However, users can also specify that they want to find a class of item (e.g. companies) and refine the search for items within the same sentence, not just the same document.",

        "This can be contrasted with some more typical ways of tying together IE and IR by performing an IR search followed by IE.",
