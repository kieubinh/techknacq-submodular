        "In this paper, new words refer to newly coined words, occasional words and other rarely used words that are neither found in the dictionary of a natural language processing system nor recognized by the derivational rules or proper name identification rules of the system.",
        "Typical examples of such words are shown in the following sentences, with the new words underlined in bold.",
        "liA*117ffi4M4, -thA'AnVirt4VA-0 111-SERARVAgT*1114. fthiri3144/1--Ct-AMVYrftN4VMARK.",

        "ivIAIIIAMENW-Tgafr)11. tS.UPV413d-*A.ElliT",
        "The automatic identification of such words by a machine is a trivial task in languages where words are separated by spaces in written texts.",
        "In languages like Chinese, where no word boundary exists in written texts, this is by no means an easy job.",
        "In many cases the machine will not even realize that there is an unfound word in the sentence since most single Chinese characters can be words by themselves.",
        "Purely statistical methods of word segmentation (e.g. de Marcken 1996, Sproat et al. 1996, Tung and Lee 1994, Lin et al. (1993), Chiang et al. (1992), Lua, Huang et al., etc.)",
        "often fail to identify those words because of the sparse data problem, as the likelihood for those words to appear in the training texts is extremely low.",
        "There are also hybrid approaches such as (Nie dt al 1995) where statistical approaches and heuristic rules are combined to identify new words.",
        "They generally perform better than purely statistical segmenters, but the new words they are able to recognize are usually proper names and other relatively frequent words.",
        "They require a reasonably big training corpus and the performance is often domain-specific depending on the training corpus used.",
        "Many word segmenters ignore low-frequency new words and treat their component characters as independent words, since they are often of",
        "little significance in applications where the structure of sentences is not taken into consideration.",
        "For in-depth natural language understanding where full parsing is required, however, the identification of those words is critical, because a single unidentified word can cause a whole sentence to fail.",
        "The new word identification mechanism to be presented here is used in a wide coverage Chinese parser that does full sentence analysis.",
        "It assumes the word segmentation process described in Wu and Jiang (1998).",
        "In this model, word segmentation, including unfound word identification, is not a standalone process, but an integral part of sentence analysis.",
        "The segmentation component provides a word lattice of the sentence that contains all the possible words, and the final disambiguation is achieved in the parsing process.",
        "In what follows, we will discuss two hypotheses and their implementation.",
        "The first one concerns the selection of candidate strings and the second one concerns the assignment of parts of speech (POS) to those strings."

        "Chinese used to be a monosyllabic language, with one-to-one correspondences between syllables, characters and words, but most words in modem Chinese, especially new words, consist of two or more characters.",
        "Of the 85,135 words in our system's dictionary, 9217 of them are monosyllabic, 47778 are disyllabic, 17094 are tri-syllabic, and the rest has four or more characters.",
        "Since hardly any new character is being added to the language, the unfound words we are trying to identify are almost always multiple character words.",
        "Therefore, if we find a sequence of single characters (not subsumed by any words) after the completion of basic word segmentation, derivational morphology and proper name identification, this sequence is very likely to be a new word.",
        "This basic intuition has been discussed in many papers, such as Tung and Lee (1994).",
        "Consider the following sentence.",
        "This sentence contains two new words (not including the name which is recognized by the proper name identification mechanism) that are unknown to our system: di97 (probably the abbreviated name of a junior high school) *Sit (a word used in sports only but not in our dictionary) Initial lexical processing based on dictionary lookup and proper name identification produces the following segmentation: ;03BRA ',pa g-ggR fg 14-T-where MO)] and * are segmented into single characters.",
        "In this case, both single character-strings are the new words we want to find.",
        "However, not every character sequence is a word in Chinese.",

        "In our implementation, we computed the probability from a parsed corpus where we went through all the leaves of the trees, counting the occurrences of each character and the occurrences of each character as an independent word.",
        "The parsed corpus we used contains about 5,000 sentences and was of course not big enough to contain every character in the Chinese language.",
        "This did not turn out to be a major problem, though.",
        "We find that, as long as all the frequently used single-character words are in the corpus, we can get good results, for what really matters is the IWP of this small set of frequent characters/words.",
