        "Entity names and their relations form the main content of a document.",
        "By grasping the entity names and their relations from a document, we will be able to understand the document to some extent.",
        "In the field of information extraction, much work has been done to automatically learn patterns [1] from training corpus in order to extract entity names and their relations from English documents.",
        "But for Chinese, researchers primarily use man-made rules and keyword sets to identify entity names [2].",
        "Building rules is often complex, error-prone and time-consuming, and usually requires detailed knowledge of system internals.",
        "Some researchers also use statistical method [3], but the training needs lots of human annotated data and only local context information can be used.",
        "With this in the view, we have sought a more efficient and flexible trainable method to resolve this problem.",
        "Section 2 first gives a general outline of the trainable method we have defined to extract Chinese entity names and their relations, then describes person name extraction, entity name classification and relation extraction in detail.",
        "Section 3 describes the preliminary experimental results of our method.",
        "Section 4 contains our remarks and discussion on possible extensions of the proposed work."

        "We view the problem of Chinese entity names and their relations as a series of classification problems, such as person name boundary classification, entity name classification, noun phrase boundary classification and relation classification.",
        "If those classification problems are clarified, then we will be able to resolve the related extraction problem.",
        "For example, if we can correctly classify (or identify) the beginning or the ending boundaries of a person name appeared in a document, we will be able to extract the person name.",
        "The process can be divided into two stages.",
        "The first stage is the learning process in which several classifiers are built from the training data.",
        "The second stage is the extracting process in which Chinese entity names and their relations are extracted using the classifiers learned.",
        "The learning algorithm used in the learning process is memory-based learning (MBL) [4].",
        "MBL entails a classification based supervised learning approach.",
        "The approach has been named differently in a variety of contexts, such as similarity-based, example-based, analogical, case-based, instance-based, and lazy learning.",
        "We selected MBL as our learning algorithm because it suits well the domains with a large number of features",
        "from heterogeneous sources and can remember exceptional and low frequency cases that are useful to extrapolate from [5].",
        "In addition, we can customize the learner using different weighting functions according to linguistic bias.",
        "The main steps for the learning process are:",
        "Step 5: Identify Chinese noun phrases (NP chunking) using NP-IG-Tree.",
        "Step 6: Use entity names and noun phrases extracted to perform partial parsing again to fix the parsing errors.",
        "Step 7: Use EntityName-IG-tree to classify the noun phrases extracted.",
        "This step will identify entity names that are missed in the previous steps.",
        "Step 8: Use Relation-IG-Tree to identify relations between the extracted entity names.",
        "For a better understanding of the algorithm, we will describe in detail the person name extraction, the entity name classification, and the relation extraction in the next subsection.",
        "Please note that we are not going to discuss NP chunking further since it is beyond the main theme of this paper."

        "Chinese person names can be divided into two categories, local Chinese person names that consist of Chinese surnames and given names and transliterated person names that are sound translations of foreign names.",
        "The length of a local person name ranges from 2 to 6 characters, while the length of a transliterated person name is unrestricted.",
        "After segmentation, person names are usually divided into several words.",
        "The task is to extract the word sequences that are person name components.",
        "With this in view, we convert the person name extraction problem to an equivalent classification problem, i.e. classifying word sequences existing in the results of segmentation into two classes, namely Person-Name and Not-Person-Name.",
        "To classify a word sequence we need to use a number of features.",
        "(1) Word features: the beginning word/tag of the sequence, the ending word/tag of the sequence.",
        "(2) Local context features: the nth (n<=3) word/tag before/after the sequence; the verb before/after the sequence.",
        "(3) Context dependency features: the dependency relations of the word sequence and the dependency relations of the first",
        "word before/after the sequence.",
        "The main dependency relations include verb-object (the relation between a verb and its noun object), subject-verb (the relation between a verb and its subject), subject-adj (the relation between an adjective and its subject), adv-verb (the relation between a verb and its adverbial modifier), adv-adj (the relation between an adjective and its adverbial modifier), modifier-head (the relation between a noun and its modifier.",
        "In Chinese, the modifier can be adjective, noun, verb or other phrases).",
        "The word features and local context features can be directly extracted from the parsing results of the training data.",
        "The extraction of dependency features needs more explanation.",
        "We employ the collocation information obtained from a large corpus [6] to help the Chinese partial parser do the parsing.",
        "In most cases, dependency relations can be taken directly from the parsing results.",
        "But, there are some instances that the parser does not function well resulting in flat parsing trees.",
        "Under these circumstances, we resort to some simple heuristics such as linear order for dependency relations, thus making our method robust enough to extract most of the dependency relations.",
        "To make the learning process more efficient, we use Boolean features in the training set, so every feature described above is translated into several Boolean features.",
        "For example, for the feature 1 th-Next-Word (the first word after the word sequence), its value is the top 500 words (ordered by frequency) that can appear after a person name.",
        "We translate it into 500 features with every feature name like lth-Next-Word-XX in which XX is one of the 500 words.",
        "The feature value 1 means that the XX appear next to the word sequence in the instance.",
        "The translated examples have about several thousands of Boolean features, which will be a big challenge for machine learning algorithms like C4.5 and CN2, but for MBL this is not a big problem.",
        "Furthermore, we use sparse array representation to make the storage requirement much lower.",
        "For every word sequence in the training data that meets with one of the following three requirements, we extract that word sequence, including its class and all its features described above:",
        "(1) Begin with a surname, plus 1 or 2 characters.",
        "(2) Begin with two surnames, plus 1 or 2 characters.",
        "(3) Begin with a character included in the first character set of transliterated person names (extracted from training data), plus several characters.",
        "The name may not surpass a normal word (that is included in a list of 5000 most frequently used Chinese words), because these normal words rarely occurred in a transliterated name.",
        "For example, if in the training data, three words \"W 1 W2 W3\" are annotated as a person name, then we will extract a PersonName \"W 1 W2 W3\" and Not-Person-Name \"Wl W2\".",
        "After all the examples are extracted from the training data, they are fed to MBL Learner to get the PersonName-IG-Tree.",
        "In the extracting process, we do the same as in the learning process to extract all examples, but the class of every example is unknown to us in advance.",
        "With the PersonName-IG-Tree, we can derive the class of every example, and then all word sequences classified as PersonName are extracted.",
        "When a person name appears more than once in a document, we can rely on cache mechanism, similar to those described in [2], to solve ambiguous cases.",
        "For example, a person name \"*\" appears more than once in a document.",
        "We first erroneously extract \"**\" from a sentence \"*Iffl ***----1-*M1.1-tAfflIiBli:i [A\", then correctly extract \"\" from another sentence \"*-4P--\".",
        "Now and \"\" are both in the cache, the cache mechanism will be able to correct the first",
        "error based on the heuristics that, if an extracted person name is a substring of another extracted person name and they do not appear in one sentence, then only the substring is the correct person name.",
        "To better understand the process of extracting person names, we describe a few intuitive examples below.",
        "(1) Sample 1",
        "The sentence: \"ggif*!P±P-1.",
        ")■t\" The segmentation result: “Igga *",
        "Here both \"*!..1/44\" and \"Vi\" are person name candidates for extraction.",
        "Because no dependency relations are found for the next word \"IP and most training examples with this feature are classified as Not-Person-Name in training data, so \"*./..1)\" is also classified as Not-Person-Name.",
        "Both the previous word \"ggIf\" and the next word \"-I.At\" are positive evidences that make it certain that -\"*jx_f_p\" should be classified as a person name, therefore our algorithm correctly extracted it from this sentence.",

        "The sentence: thiEg1.1-3*.i.Mil\" The segmentation result: -2* 611.1 Our algorithm correctly classified i-rtion\" as not a person name.",
        "The reason is that in the training data all word sequences whose previous word is \" – \" is a not a person name.",

        "Unlike other inductive learning systems in the field of information extraction, such as Crystal, we use a general machine learning algorithm to do the learning.",

        "Though their experiment showed that the performance of C4.5 based method was comparable to Crystal, they abandoned this method due to the time complexity of C4.5 when dealing with large number of features.",
        "MBL is similar to C4.5 in that both are general machine learning algorithms.",
        "Their differences lie in that MBL is a lazy learning algorithm that keeps all training data in memory and only abstracts at classification time by extrapolating a class from the most similar items in memory, therefore, its time complexity is much lower than C4.5, especially when training data contains large number of features and examples.",
        "Actually, in Soderland's analysis [8], MBL's time complexity is only slightly greater than that of Crystal.",

        "Any useful features can be added to the system without any modification to the algorithm.",
        "In Crystal, however, adding more features may affect the correctness of weight function used in finding similar examples.",
        "Our method can employ global features, i.e. features beyond the sentence level.",
