        "The typical examples are the recognition of BaseNP in English and Chinese.",
        "In English BNP (base noun phrase) is defined as simple and non-nesting noun phrases, i.e. noun phrases that do not contain other noun phrase descendants (Church, 1988).",
        "After that researches on BNP identification reports promising results for such task in English.",
        "Observing that the Chinese BNP is different form English, (Zhao & Huang, 1999) puts forward the definition of Chinese BNP in terms of combination of determinative modifier and head noun.",
        "According to them a BNP in Chinese can be recursively defined as:",
        "Inspired by these researches, we extend the concept of BNP to Base Phrase in Chinese.",
        "It is based on such knowledge that there are many structures, not only NP, in which the trivial components closely attach to their central words and constitute a basic phrase in a Chinese sentence.",
        "Obviously, resolving all these base phrases will greatly benefit Chinese parser by reliving it from some preprocessing (though non-trivial) and enable it focus on the most subtle syntactic structures.",
        "Since the whole system of Chinese base phrase is still under discussing, this paper just presents some tentative research achievements on statistics based hybrid model to Chinese base phrase identification.",
        "For the 7 types we considered at present, our algorithm turns out promising results and smoothes the way for a better Chinese parser."

        "In addition to BNP, constituents of many local structure in Chinese centers around a core word with certain fixed POS sequences.",
        "Therefore their identification is slightly different from parsing in that it bears relatively simple phenomenon.",
        "Like BNP identification, identification of these phenomena before parsing will provide a simpler sequence for parser, and thus deserves a separate research.",
        "Currently, we are considering 7 Chinese base phrases in our research, namely base adjective phrase(BADJP), base adverbial phrase (BADVP), base noun phrase (BNP),",
        "following formula is usually at hand: RC = arg max p(RC I T) = arg max p(RC)* p(T I RC) base temporal phrase (BTN), base location phrase (BNS), base verb phrase (BVP) and base quantity phrase (BM') .",
        "Though theoretically definitions for these base phrases are still unavailable, Appendix I lists the preliminary illustrations for them in BNF format (necessary account for POS annotation can also be found).. To frame the identification of Chinese base phrases, we further develop the following concepts: Definition 1: Chinese based phrases are recognized as atomic parts of a sentence beyond words that posses certain functions and meanings.",
        "A base phrase may consist of words or other base phrases, but its constituents, in turn, should not contain any base phrases.",

        "The task is to find RC, a most possible sequence of duples formed by base phrase tags and boundary tags, among the POS sequence T. RC= (<ro,co>,......, <rn,cn>), in which (1<i<=n)indicates the boundary tags, ci represents the base phrase tags.",
