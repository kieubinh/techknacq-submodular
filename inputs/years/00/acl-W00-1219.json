        "Almost all techniques to statistical language processing, including speech recognition, machine translation and information retrieval, are based on words.",
        "Although word-based approaches work very well for western languages, where words are well defined, it is difficult to apply to Chinese.",
        "Chinese sentences are written as characters strings with no spaces between words.",
        "Therefore, words in Chinese are actually not well marked in sentences, and there does not exist a commonly accepted Chinese lexicon.",
        "Furthermore, since new compounds (words formed with at least two characters) are constantly created, it is impossible to list them exhaustively in a lexicon.",
        "Therefore, automatic extraction of compounds is an important issue.",
        "Traditional extraction approaches used rules.",
        "However, compounds extracted in this way are not always desirable.",
        "So, human effort is still required to find the preferred compounds from a large compound This work was done while the author worked for Microsoft Research China as a visiting student.",

        "Some statistical approaches to extract Chinese compounds from corpus have been proposed (Lee-Feng Chien 1997, WU Dekai and Xuanyin XIA 1995, Ming-Wen Wu and Keh-Yih Su 1993) as well, but almost all experiments are based on relatively small corpus, it is not clear whether these methods still work well with large corpus.",
        "In this paper, we investigate statistical approaches to Chinese compound extraction from very large corpus by using statistical features, namely mutual information and context dependency.",
        "There are three main contributions in this paper.",
        "First, we apply our procedure on a very large corpus while other experiments were based on small or medium size corpora.",
        "We show that better results can be obtained with a large corpus.",
        "Second, we examine how the results can be influenced by parameter settings including mutual information and context dependency restrictions.",
        "It turns out that mutual information mainly affects precision while context dependency affects the count of extracted items.",
        "Third, we test the usefulness of the extracted compounds for information retrieval.",
        "Our experimental results on IR show that the new compounds have a positive effect on IR.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we describe the techniques we used.",

        "The Number of extracted compounds and precision of each parameter setting are shown in table 7.",

        "For each set of compounds, we randomly select 200 compounds.",

        "This file consists of about 9,800 new compounds because there are 49 compounds lists.",

        "Set A contains the items that are considered to be correct, and set B contains incorrect ones.",

        "Suppose these two values are al and bl, then we estimate the precision as al/(al+b1).",
        "So, there are two important points in our evaluation process.",
        "First, it is difficult to give a definition of the term \"compound\" to be accepted popularly.",
        "Different people may have different judgement.",
        "Only one person takes part in the evaluation in our experiment.",
        "This can eliminate the effect of divergence among different persons.",
        "Second, we merge those items together.",
        "This can eliminate the effect of different time period.",
        "One may feel tired after checked too many items.",
        "If he checks those 49 files one by one, the latter results are incomparable with the previous one.",
        "The precisions estimated by the above method are not exactly correct.",
        "However, as described above, the precisions of different parameter settings are comparable.",
        "In this experiment, what we want to show is how the parameter settings affect the results.",
        "Both MI and CD can affect number of extracted compounds, as shown in table 7.",
        "Compared with MI, CD has stronger effect in this aspect.",
        "For each row in table 7, numbers of extracted compounds finally decrease to 10% of that showed in the first column.",
        "For each column, while MI changes from 0.0002 to 0.0014, the number is decreased of about 20%.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that it is difficult for candidate to fulfill all four restrictions in CD simultaneously.",
        "Many disqualified candidates are cut off.",
        "Table 7 lists the precisions of extracted results.",
        "It shows that there is no clear increasing/decreasing pattern in each row.",
