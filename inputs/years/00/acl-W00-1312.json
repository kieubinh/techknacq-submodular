        "For the user who is fluent in two or more languages, even though he/she may be able to formulate good queries in each of the source languages, CLIR relieves the user from having to do so.",
        "Most CLIR studies have been based on a variant of tf idf; our experiments instead use a hidden Markov model (11MI/) to estimate the probability that a document is relevant given the query.",
        "We integrated two simple estimates of term translation probability into the monolingual HMM model, giving an estimate of the probability that a document is relevant given a query in another language.",
        "In this paper we address the following questions: How can a combined probability model of term translation and retrieval minimize the effect of translation ambiguity?",
        "(Sections 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10) What is the upper bound performance using bilingual dictionary lookup for term translation?",
        "(Section 8) How much does performance degrade due to omissions from the bilingual dictionary and how does performance vary with size of such a dictionary?",
        "(Sections 8-9) All experiments were performed using a common baseline, an HMM-based (monolingual) indexing and retrieval engine.",
        "In order to design controlled experiments for the questions above, the IR system was run without sophisticated query expansion techniques.",

        "A second method is to structure the translated query, separating the translations for one term from translations for other terms.",
        "This approach limits how much credit the retrieval algorithm can give to a single term in the original query and prevents the translations of one or a few terms from swamping the whole query.",
        "There are several variations of such a method (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Pirkola, 1998; Hull 1997).",
        "One such method is to treat different translations of the same term as synonyms.",
        "Ballesteros, for example, used the INQUERY (Callan et al., 1995) synonym operator to group translations of different query terms.",
        "However, if a term has two translations in the target language, it will treat them as equal even though one of them is more likely to be the correct translation than the other.",
