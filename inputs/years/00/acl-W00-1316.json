        "The field of information retrieval (IR) is the traditional discipline that addresses this problem.",
        "However, most of the prior work in IR deal more with document retrieval rather than \"information\" retrieval.",
        "This also applies to search engines on the Internet.",
        "Current search engines take a list of input words and return a ranked list of web pages that contain (or not contain) the given words.",
        "It is then left to the user to search through the returned list of web pages for the information that he needs.",
        "While finding the web pages that contain the desired information is an important first step, what an information seeker needs is often an answer to a question.",
        "That is, given a question, we want a system to return the exact answers to the question, and not just the documents to allow us to further search for the Leong Hwee Teo's current affiliation: Defence Medical Research Institute, Defence Science and Technology Agency, 1 Depot Road, Defence Technology Tower A, #19-05, Singapore 109679 tleonghvedsta.gov.",

        "The need for question answering (QA) systems has prompted the initiation of the question answering track in TREC-8 (Voorhees and Tice, 2000) to address this problem.",
        "In the QA track, each participant is given a list of 200 questions, and the goal is to locate answers to these questions from a document database consisting of hundreds of thousands of documents (about two gigabytes of text).",
        "Each participant is to return a ranked list of the five best answer strings for each question, where each answer string is a string of 50 bytes (or 250 bytes) that contains an answer to the question.",
        "What, when, where, and who questions that have explicit answers given in some document in the database are emphasized, but not why questions.",
        "In a related but independent effort, a group at MITRE has investigated question answering in the context of the reading comprehension task (Hirschman et al., 1999).",
        "The documents in this task are 115 children stories at grade two to five from Remedia Publications, and the task involves answering five questions (who, what, when, where, and why question) per story, as a measure of how well a system has understood the story.",
        "Each story has an average of 20 sentences, and the question answering task as formulated for a computer program is to select a sentence in the story that answers to a question.",
        "For about 10% of the questions, there is not a single sentence in the story that is judged to answer the question.",
        "Conversely, a question can have multiple correct answers, where each of several individual sentences is a correct answer.",
        "An example story from the Remedia corpus and its five accompanying questions are given in Figure 1.",
        "Each story has a title (such as \"Storybook Person Found Alive!\") and dateline (such as \"ENGLAND, June, 1989\") in the Remedia corpus.",

        "In TREG8, the answer to a question can be from any of the hundreds of thousands of documents in the database, whereas for the reading comprehension task, the answer only comes from the short story associated with the question.",
        "Thus, while the TREC-8 QA task requires efficient indexing and retrieval techniques to narrow down to the documents that contain the answers, this step is largely not needed for the reading comprehension task.",
        "Also, an answer as defined in the TREC-8 QA task is a 50-byte or 250- byte answer string, whereas an answer is a complete sentence in the reading comprehension task.",
        "Another perhaps more subtle difference is that the questions formulated in both tasks have different motivation: for TREG8, it is for the purpose of information-seeking, whereas for reading comprehension, it is for testing whether a system has \"understood\" the story.",
        "Hence, it may well be that the questions in TREC-8 can be expected to be more \"cooperative\", while those for reading comprehension can be uncooperative or even \"tricky\" in nature.",
        "In this paper, we only address the question answering task in the context of reading comprehension, although we expect that the techniques we developed in this paper will be equally applicable to answering questions in an information-seeking context like that of TREC-8."

        "The early work on question answering by (Lehnert, 1978) focused more on knowledge representation and inference issues, and the work was not targeted at answering questions from unrestricted text.",
        "Prior to 1999, the other notable research work on question answering that is designed to work on unrestricted text (from encyclopedia) is (Kupiec, 1993).",
        "However, no large scale evaluation was attempted, and the work was not based on a machine learning approach.",
        "Fueled by the question answering track initiated in TREC-8 (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), there is a recent surge of research activities on the topic of question answering.",
        "Among the participants who returned the best scores at the TREC-8 QA track (Srihari and Li, 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000; Singhal et al., 2000), none of them uses a machine learning approach.",
        "One exception is the work of (Radev et al., 2000) at the TREC-8 QA track, which uses logistic regression to rank potential answers using a training set with seven features.",
        "However, their features are meant for the task of selecting more specific answer spans, and are different from the features we use in this paper.",
        "The TREC-8 QA test scores of (Radev et al., 2000) were also considerably lower than best QA test scores.",
        "Because of the huge number of documents used in the TREG8 QA track, the participants have to perform efficient document indexing and retrieval in order to tackle the complete QA task.",
        "It has been found that both the shallow processing techniques of IR, as well as the more linguistic-oriented natural language processing techniques are needed to perform well on the TREC-8 QA track.",
        "In contrast, for our current QA work on reading comprehension, because the answer for each question comes from the associated story, no sophisticated IR indexing and retrieval techniques are used.",
        "Naturally, our current work on question answering for the reading comprehension task is most related to those of (Hirschman et al., 1999; Charniak et al., 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; Wang et al., 2000).",
        "In fact, all of this body of work as well as ours are evaluated on the same set of test stories, and are developed (or trained) on the same development set of stories.",
        "The work of (Hirschman et al., 1999) initiated this series of work, and it reported an accuracy of 36.3% on answering the questions in the test stories.",
        "Subsequently, the work of (Riloff and Thelen, 2000) and (Charniak et al., 2000) improved the accuracy further to 39.7% and 41%, respectively.",
        "However, all of these three systems used handcrafted, deterministic rules and algorithms.",
        "In contrast, we adopt a machine learning approach in this paper.",
        "The one notable exception is the work of (Wang et al., 2000), which attempted a machine learning approach to question answering for the same reading comprehension task.",
        "Unfortunately, out of the several machine learning algorithms they tried, the best approach (using neural network learning) only managed to obtain an accuracy of 14%.",
        "This work casts doubt on whether a machine learning approach to question answering can achieve accuracy competitive to the handcrafted rule-based approach.",

        "In AQUAREAS, we use the same set of features for all five question types, leaving it to the learning algorithm to identify which are the useful features to test for in each question type.",

        "Intuitively, a feature value of 0 is the best, indicating that for that question-sentence pair q and s, they have the most number of matching words in the story, when comparing q with all sentences s, in the same story.",
        "In the case where there are zero matching words between a question q and all sentences s, in a story (i.e., M = 0), then this DMWM feature will be assigned 0 for all question-sentence pairs q and si in the story.",
        "To avoid such a situation where a value of 0 is also assigned for this feature even when there are no matching words, we instead assign a very large value (200) to this feature for such cases.",

        "The scoring metric that we used for evaluation is HumSent, which is the percentage of test questions for which AQUAREAS has chosen a correct sentence as the answer.",
        "This metric is originally proposed by (Hirschman et al., 1999).",

        "Although there were a few other scoring met",
        "rics originally proposed in (Hirschman et al., 1999), all the metrics were found to correlate well with one another.",
        "As such, all subsequent work (Charniak et al., 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; Wang et al., 2000) uses HumSent as the main scoring metric, and it is also the scoring metric that we adopted in this paper.",

        "Using a large m results in simpler decision trees.",
        "t = 7 results in the use of boosting with multiple decision trees.",
        "Since there are a lot more negative training examples compared to positive training examples (ratio of approximately 4:1), there is a tendency to generate a default tree classifying all training examples as negative (since the accuracy of such a tree is already quite good about 80% on our skewed distribution of training examples).",
        "Setting n/p cost at 1.2 will make it more costly to misclassify a positive training example as negative, and thus more costly to generate the default tree, resulting in better accuracy.",
        "We achieved an overall HumSent accuracy of 39.3% on the 300 test questions.",
        "The breakdown into the number of questions answered correctly per question type is shown in the first row of Table 1.",
        "Our results indicate that our machine learning approach can achieve accuracy comparable with other approaches that rely on handcrafted, deterministic rules and algorithms.",

        "The second tree is a default tree that just classifies any sentence as not an answer.",

        "The resulting drop in accuracy is tabulated in the remaining rows of Table 1.",

        "Named entities are useful for answering these question types, since who typically asks for a person (or organization), when asks for date or time, and where asks for location.",
        "What is perhaps a little surprising is that the seven automatically discovered keywords are also found to be very important, and removing these seven features causes the second largest decline in overall HumSent accuracy.",
        "Coreference is found to affect the who, when, and where questions, as expected.",
        "The previous and next word/verb matches cause the largest decline for why questions, dropping the number of correctly answered why questions to 3.",
        "Removing verb match also causes a 3% drop in overall accuracy, while dateline and title only affect the when questions.",
        "In our future work, we plan to investigate other potential knowledge sources that may further improve accuracy.",
        "We also plan to investigate the use of other supervised machine learning algorithms for this problem."
