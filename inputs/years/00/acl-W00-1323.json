        "Lexical acquisition from large corpora has long been considered as a means for enriching vocabularies (Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1996).",
        "Depending on the studies, different issues are considered: the acquisition of terms (Daille, 1996), the acquisition of subcatego-rization frames (Basili et al., 1993), the acquisition of semantic links (Grefenstette, 1994), etc.",
        "While traditional electronic corpora such as journal articles or corpus resources (BNC, SUSANNE, Brown corpus) are satisfactory for classical lexical acquisition, Web corpora are another source of knowledge (Crimmins et al., 1999) that can be used to acquire NEs because of the constant updating of online data.",
        "The purpose of our work is to propose a technique for the extraction of NEs from the Web through the combination of a harvester and shallow parsers.",
        "Our study also belongs to corpus-based acquisition of semantic relationships through the analysis of specific lexico-syntactic contexts (Hearst, 1998) because hypernym relationships are acquired together with NEs.",
        "The unique contribution of our technique is to offer an integrated approach to the analysis of HTML documents that associates lexical cues with formatting instructions in a single and cohesive framework.",
        "The combination of structural information and linguistic patterns is also found in wrapper induction, an emerging topic of research in artificial intelligence and machine learning (Kushmerick et al., 1997).",
        "Our work differs from the MUC-related NE tagging task and its possible extension to name indexing of web pages (Aone et al., 1997) for the following reasons:",
        "• The purpose of our task is to build lists of NEs, not to tag corpora.",
        "For this reason, we only collect non-ambiguous context-independent NEs; partial or incomplete occurrences such as anaphora are considered as incorrect.",
        "• The types of NEs collected here are much more accurate than the four basic types defined in MUC.",
        "The proposed technique could be extended to the collection of any non-MUC names which can be grouped under a common hypernym: botanic names, mechanical parts, book titles, events... • We emphasize the role of document structure in web-based collection.",
        "2 Focusing on Definitory Contexts Two issues are addressed in this paper: 1.",
        "While traditional electronic corpora can be accessed directly and entirely through large-scale filters such as shallow parsers, access to Web pages is restricted to the narrow and specialized medium of a search engine.",
        "In order to spot and retrieve relevant text chunks, we must focus on linguistic cues that can be used to access pages containing typed NEs with high precision.",
        "2.",
        "While Web pages are full of NEs, only a small proportion of them are relevant for the acquisition of public, fresh and well-known NEs (the name of someone's cat",
        "is not relevant to our purpose).",
        "So that automatically acquired NEs can be used in a NE recognition task, they are associated with types such as actor (PERSON), lake (LOCATION), or university (ORGANIZATION).",
        "The need for selective linguistic cues (wrt to the current facilities offered by search engines) and for informative and typifying contexts has led us to focus on collections, a specific type of definitory contexts (Pery-Woodley, 1998).",
        "Because they contain specific linguistic triggers such as following or such as, definitory contexts can be accessed through phrase queries to a search engine.",
        "In addition, these contexts use the classical scheme genus/ differentia to define NEs, and thus provide, through the genus, a hypernym of the NEs they define.",
        "Our study extends (Hearst, 1998) to Web-based and spatially formatted corpora."
