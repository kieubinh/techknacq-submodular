        "Subcategorization information is vital for successful parsing, however, manual development of large subcategorized lexicons has proved difficult because predicates change behaviour between sublanguages, domains and over time.",
        "Additionally, manually developed sucategorization lexicons do not provide the relative frequency of different SCFS for a given predicate, essential in a probabilistic approach.",
        "Over the past years acquiring subcategorization dictionaries from textual corpora has become increasingly popular.",
        "The different approaches (e.g. Brent, 1991, 1993; Ushioda et al., 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000) vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFS being extracted.",
        "Regardless of this, there is a ceiling on the performance of these systems at around 80% token recall 1.",
        "'Where token recall is the percentage .of SCF tokens in a sample of manually analysed text that were The approaches to extracting SCF information from corpora have frequently employed statistical methods for filtering (e.g. Brent, 1993; Manning 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Lapata, 1999).",
        "This has been done to remove the noise that arises when dealing with naturally occurring data, and from mistakes made by the SCF acquisition system, for example, parser errors.",
        "Filtering is usually done with a hypothesis test, and frequently with a variation of the binomial filter introduced by Brent (1991, 1993).",
        "Hypothesis testing is performed by formulating a null hypothesis, (Ho), which is assumed true unless there is evidence to the contrary.",
        "If there is evidence to the contrary, Ho is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted.",
        "In SCF acquisition, Ho is that there is no association between a particular verb (verb) and a SCF (SCFi), meanwhile H1 is that there is such an association.",
        "For SCF acquisition, the test is one-tailed since H1 states the direction of the association, a positive correlation between verbs and sch.",
        "We compare the expected probability of sefi occurring with verbs if Ho is true, to the observed probability of co-occurrence obtained from the corpus data.",
        "If the observed probability is greater than the expected probability we reject Ho and accept H1, and if not, we retain Ho.",
        "Despite the popularity of this method, it has been reported as problematic.",
        "According to one account (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) the majority of errors arise because of the statistical filtering process, which is reported to be particularly unreliable for low frequency scFs (Brent, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Manning and Schiitze, 1999).",
        "Lapata (1999) reported that a threshold on the relative frequencies produced slightly better results than those achieved with a Brent-correctly acquired by the system.",
        "style binomial filter when establishing scFs for diathesis alternation detection.",
        "Lapata determined thresholds for each SCF using the frequency of the SCF in COMLEX Syntax dictionary (Grishman et al., 1994).",
        "Adopting the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll, we have experimented with an alternative hypothesis test, the binomial log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test (Dunning, 1993).",
        "Sarkar and Zeman (2000) have also used this test when filtering scFs automatically acquired for Czech.",
        "This test has been recommended for use in NLP since it does not assume a. normal distribution, which invalidates many other parametric tests for use with natural language phenomena.",
        "LLR can be used in a form (-2logA) which is X2 distributed.",
        "Moreover, this asymptote is appropriate at quite low frequencies, which makes the hypothesis test particularly useful when dealing with natural language phenomena, where low frequency events are commonplace.",
        "A problem with using hypothesis testing for filtering automatically acquired SCFS is obtaining a good estimation of the expected occurrence of scfi with verbi.",
        "This is often performed using the unconditional distribution, that is the probability distribution over all SCFS, regardless of the verb.",
        "It is assumed that verbs must occur with scfi significantly more than is expected given this estimate.",
        "Our paper addresses the problem that the conditional distribution, dependent on the verb, and unconditional distribution are rarely correlated.",
        "Therefore statistical filters which assume such correlation for Ho will be susceptible to error, In this paper, we compare the results of the Brent style binomial filter of Briscoe and Carroll and the LLR filter to a simple method which uses a threshold on the relative frequencies of the verb and SCF combinations.",
        "We do this within the framework of the Briscoe and Carroll SCF acquisition system, which is described in section 2.1.",
        "The details of the two statistical filters are described in section 2.2, along with the details of the threshold applied to the relative frequencies output from the SCF acquisition system.",
        "The details of the experimental evaluation are supplied in section 3.",

        "The fact that a significant improvement in performance is made by correcting the prior probabilities according to the performance of the system (Briscoe, Carroll and Korhonen,",
        "1997) suggests the discrepancy between the unconditional and the conditional distributions.",
        "We examined the correlation between the manual analysis for the 14 verbs, and the unconditional distribution of verb types over all SCFs estimated from the ANLT using the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient.",
        "The results included in table 3 show that only a moderate correlation was found averaged over all verb types.",
        "Both LLR and BHT work by comparing the observed value of p(scfilverbi) to that expected by chance.",
        "They both use the observed",
        "value for p(scfilverbj) from the system's output, and they both use an estimate for the unconditional probability distribution (p(sch)) for estimating the expected probability.",
        "They differ in the way that the estimate for the unconditional probability is obtained, and the way that it is used in hypothesis testing.",
        "For BHT, the null hypothesis is that the observed value of p(scfi 'very arose by chance, because of noise in the data.",

        "However, this is rarely the case.",
        "Moreover, because of the zipfian nature of the distributions, the frequency differences at any point can be substantial.",
        "In these experiments, we used one-tailed tests because we were looking for cases where there was a positive association between the SCF and verb, however, in a two-tailed test the null hypothesis would rarely be accepted, because of the substantial differences in the conditional and unconditional distributions.",
        "A large number of false negatives occurred for high frequency SCFs because the probability we compared them to was too high.",
        "This probability was estimated from the combination of many verbs genuinely occurring with the frame in question, rather than from an estimate of background noise from verbs which did not occur with the frame.",
        "We did not use an estimate from verbs which do not take the SCF, since this would require a priori knowledge about the phenomena that we were endeavouring to acquire automatically.",
        "For LLR the unconditional probability estimate (p2) was high, simply because this SCF was a common one, rather than because the data was particularly noisy.",
        "For BHT, pe was likewise too high as the SCF was also common in the Susanne data.",
        "The ANLT estimate went someway to compensating for this, thus we obtained fewer false negatives with BHT than LLR.",
        "A large number of false positives occurred for low frequency SCFs because the estimate for p(scf) was low.",
        "This estimate was more readily exceeded by the conditional estimate.",

        "This paper explored three possibilities for filtering out the SCF entries produced by a SCF acquisition system.",
        "These were.",
        "(i) a version of Brent's binomial filter, commonly used for this purpose, (ii) the binomial log-likelihood",
        "ratio test, recommended for use with low frequency data and (iii) a simple method using a threshold on the MLES of the SCFS output from the system.",
        "Surprisingly, the simple MLE thresholding method worked best.",
        "The BHT and LLR both produced an astounding number of FPs, particularly at low frequencies.",
        "Further work on handling low frequency data in SCF acquisition is warranted.",
        "A nonparametric statistical test, such as Fisher's exact test, recommended by Pedersen (1996), might improve on the results obtained using parametric tests.",
        "However, it seems from our experiments that it would be better to avoid hypothesis tests that make use of the unconditional distribution.",
        "One possibility is to put more effort into the estimation of pe, and to avoid use of the unconditional distribution for this.",
        "In some recent experiments, we tried optimising the estimates for pe depending on the performance of the system for the target SCF, using the method proposed by Briscoe, Carroll and Korhonen (1997).",
        "The estimates of pe were obtained from a training set separate to the held-out BNC data used for testing.",
        "Results using the new estimates for pe gave an improvement of 10% precision and 6% recall, compared to the BHT results reported here.",
        "Nevertheless, the precision result was 14% worse for precision than MLE, though there was a 4% improvement in recall, making the overall performance 3.9 worse than MLE according to the F measure.",
        "Lapata (1999) also reported that a simple relative frequency cut off produced slightly better results than a Brent style BHT.",
        "If MLE thresholding persistently achieves better results, it would be worth investigating ways of handling the low frequency data, such as smoothing, for integration with this method.",
        "However, more sophisticated smoothing methods, which back-off to an unconditional distribution, will also suffer from the lack of correlation between conditional and unconditional SCF distributions.",
        "Any statistical test would work better at low frequencies than the MLE, since this simply disregards all low frequency scFs.",
        "In our experiments, if we had used MLE only for the high frequency data, and BHT for medium and low, then overall we would have had 54% precision and 67% recall.",
        "It certainly seems worth employing hypothesis tests which do not rely on the unconditional distribution for the low frequency SCFS."
