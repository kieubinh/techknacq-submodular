        "For many applications in natural language generation (NLG), the range of linguistic expressions that must be generated is quite restricted, and a grammar for a surface realization component can be fully specified by hand.",
        "Moreover, in many cases it is very important not to deviate from very specific output in generation (e.g., maritime weather reports), in which case hand-crafted grammars give excellent control.",
        "In these cases, evaluations of the generator that rely on human judgments (Lester and Porter, 1997) or on human annotation of the test corpora (Kukich, 1983) are quite sufficient.",
        "However, in other NLG applications the variety of the output is much larger.",
        "and the demands on the quality of the output are somewhat less stringent.",
        "A typical example is NLG in the context of (interlingua- or transfer-based) machine translation.",
        "Another reason for relaxing the quality of the output may be that not enough time is available to develop a full grammar for a new target language in NLG.",
        "In all these cases.",
        "stochastic methods provide an alternative to hand-crafted approaches to NLG.",
        "To our knowledge, the first to use stochastic techniques in an NLG realization module were Langkilde and Knight (1998a) and (1998b) (see also (Langk-ilde, 2000)).",
        "As is the case for stochastic approaches in natural language understanding, the research and development itself requires an effective intrinsic metric in order to be able to evaluate progress.",
        "In this paper, we discuss several evaluation metrics that we are using during the development of FERGUS (Flexible Empiricist/Rationalist Generation Using Syntax).",
        "FERGUS, a realization module, follows Knight and Langkilde's seminal work in using an n-gram language model, but we augment it with a tree-based stochastic model and a lexicalized syntactic grammar.",
        "The metrics are useful to us as relative quantitative assessments of different models we experiment with; however, we do not pretend that these metrics in themselves have any validity.",
        "Instead, we follow work done in dialog systems (Walker et al., 1997) and attempt to find metrics which on the one hand can be computed easily but on the other hand correlate with empirically verified human judgments in qualitative categories such as readability.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2. we briefly describe the architecture of FERGUS, and some of the modules.",
        "In Section 3 we present four metrics and some results obtained with these metrics.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the for experimental validation of the metrics using human judgments.",
        "and present a new metric based on the results of these experiments.",

        "The Tree Chooser uses a stochastic tree model to choose syntactic properties (expressed as trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar) for the nodes in the input structure.",
        "This step can be seen as analogous to \"supertagging\" -(Bangalore and Joshi, 1-999), except that now supertags (i.e., names of trees which encode the syntactic properties of a lexical head) must be found for words in a tree rather than for words in a linear sequence.",
        "The Tree Chooser makes the simplifying assumptions that the choice of a tree for a node depends only on its daughter nodes, thus allowing for a top-down algorithm.",
        "The Tree Chooser draws on a tree model, which is a analysis in terms of syntactic dependency for 1,000,000 words of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).3 The supertagged tree which is output from the Tree Chooser still does not fully determine the surface string, because there typically are different ways to attach a daughter node to her mother (for example, an adverb can be placed in different positions with respect to its verbal head).",
        "The Unraveler therefore uses the XTAG grammar of English (XTAG-Group, 1999) to produce a lattice of all possible lineariza-tions that are compatible with the supertagged tree.",
        "Specifically, the daughter nodes are ordered with respect to the head at each level of the derivation tree.",

        "Once the range of choices that the generation component makes expands, one quickly runs into the problem that, while the gold standard may be a good way of communicating the input structure, there are usually other good ways of doing so as well (using other words, other syntactic constructions, and so on).",
        "Our metrics will penalize such variation.",
        "However, in using stochastic methods one is of course precisely interested in learning from a corpus, so that the fact that there may be other ways of expressing an input is less relevant: the whole point of the stochastic approach is precisely to express the input in a manner that resembles as much as possible the realizations found in the corpus (given its genre, register, idiosyncratic choices, and so on).",
        "Assuming the test corpus is representative of the training corpus, we can then use our metrics to measure deviance from the corpus, whether it be merely in word order or in terms of more complex tasks such as lexical choice as well.",
        "Thus, as long as the goal of the realizer is to emulate as closely as possible a given corpus (rather than provide a maximal range of paraphras-tic capability), then our approach can be used for evaluation.'",

        "Presumably, the quality of most generation systems can only be assessed at a system level in a task-oriented setting (rather than by taking quantitative measures or by asking humans for quality assessments).",
        "Such evaluations are costly, and they cannot be the basis of work in stochastic generation.",
        "for which evaluation is a frequent step in research and development.",
        "An advantage of our approach is that our quantitative metrics allow us to evaluate without human intervention, automatically and objectively (objectively with respect to the defined metric,- that is).- Independently, the use of the metrics has been validated using human subjects (as discussed in Section 4); once this has happened.",
